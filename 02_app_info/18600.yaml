    review: 'While the devs describe this game as a ''streamlined take on the classic
      "4x" genre'', that''s a bit of an overstatement. It''s pretty much just a straight
      line. There realy isn''t much to do other than build up an fleet and try to
      overwhelm everything as you expand outward. Other than your ships, the only
      resource to manage is upgrading factories on planets so they will build more
      ships each turn. This does forfit any ship building for that planet that turn
      and the only limit is that you can only upgrade one factory per turn & a particular
      factory cannot be upgraded on consecutive turns.


      The main negative of this game is that there is no online community anymore,
      meaning that there are 3 achievements that will be impossible to earn without
      help from friends who also own this game.


      So why do I recommend it? Because sometimes simple is fun. It''s easy to generate
      a small map and have a quick game that you can finish in under 15 minutes or
      pull up a huge one for an 8 player last-man-standing war that can last a while.
      If you either allow the adaptive AI to level up as you win games (or raise it
      manually), eventually your opponents will put up a decent fight. If they get
      to be too much, you can always knock it down a bit to make it challenging and
      fun for you the player (and turn off adaptive AI). Without any real online play
      I don''t think I''d pay full price, but if you can catch it on good sale it
      worth a few bucks for a quick and simple strategy fix.'
