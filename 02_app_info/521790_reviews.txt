With 30 missions per campaign (Alliance / Federation) and up to 3 missions in between story missions, you can play 90 missions per campaign if you grind the experience and resource missions in between the story missions. Even if you only do some of the experience and resource missions (as you will likely need to if you playing on the harder difficulties), it's a really long and repetitive grind to the end of the game. You've seen just about all the combat tactics and variations you're going to see about 1/4 way into the game, and while you do get a few new ships and better parts and crew, the combat really doesn't change, nor does it become more interesting.\n\nStory / Dialogue\nEasily the worst and most cheesy dialogue I have ever suffered through in a game. Not just bad, awful! You don't expect a great story from a game like this, but I'm not sure if you could make a worse story with worse dialogue if you tried.\n","timestamp_created":1607736742,"timestamp_updated":1607736742,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh/qkqvYCfpCmuQI="}
