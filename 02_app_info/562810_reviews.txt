BUT:\n\nThe community is very small therefore it is difficult to find players for a match.\n\nHowever my main critique is regarding controls: You can use mouse as well as keyboard BUT you cannot enter numbers, meaning you have to click the \"+\" or \"-\" button in order to adjust the desired number both in settings and ingame (for trades in instance). And this is actually unbelievable that a developer called Ubisoft publishes something like that. This issue makes playing very uncomfortable, annoying and it's just inacceptable.\nI hope this will be fixed any time, so far unfortunately I cannot recommend anybody to buy this game.","timestamp_created":1610109336,"timestamp_updated":1610109336,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnNf/8PYCesrDwQI="}
