Safe Cracker is a little strange but not terrible. Women might be turned off by it. The womens voice goes oooohhh an ahhhh in Ecstasy. Because the computer is supposed to be a women.  Xenon is an older table however I did enjoy it even though its an older table. Its got some charm. Red and Ted's Roadshow is a lot of fun.  Great looking and sounding table. Addams Family is another solid pinball table its very well done. Thank you Thing. \n\nCyclone is a classic. Great table and good flow and I love the sounds. Ride the ferris wheel. Party Zoneâ„¢, Earthshaker are both solid tables. The party zone guy with the mustache looks like the guy on mythbusters. Jack*Bot is a strange version of pinbot just updated. Its still good just a little strange.\n\nStarship troopers is a tough table.  I have recently gotten better at Troopers. I now use both right flippers to move the ball around. It makes a huge difference. I have them both the right flippers set to one button. Makes the table a lot more easy to score points.The flippers are very far apart and the outlanes are very easy to drain balls into. Games are over very quickly unless you really shake rattle and roll on this table. This table to me is the second  weakest  of the bunch.  I did like the high score pictures  you can select from and the tri flippers are fun. Its probably the toughest table in this pack. Good value if you enjoy modern tables as this one only has Xenon as the oldest table and even that one still feels modern.\n\nPhantom of the Opera looks and sounds great. Its a ball eater though. Unless you shake and rattle and roll your not going to get very far in this table. Its designed for you to lose your balls as quickly as possible. Several shots are dead shots. The ramp in the upper right hand corner is almost always a dead shot down the middle. The middle magic mirror is designed to make your ball go down the center. \n\nIts also a little confusing on how to get the mutiplyer. Instead of matching the 3 top lanes you instead need to hit the magic mirror that is designed to steal your ball if you make a bad shot. This is one of those tables that looks great sounds great. Flow is mostly on the silled expert side. Even more so then Star ship troopers and that table is made  to lose balls. Not for new people starting out. Phantom and Troopers are made for the top pinball players. In my opinion. The rest are solid and are newbie friendly.","timestamp_created":1452312336,"timestamp_updated":1452491070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.704545021057128906","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo9vNl9ICc4TvTQ=="}
