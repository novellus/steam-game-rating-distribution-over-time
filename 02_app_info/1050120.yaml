    review: "A very, very boring and meaningless addition to HDN Re;Birth 3. Yes,\
      \ this DLC may add the \"Road to Celestia\" dungeon that wasn't part of the\
      \ actual game and yes, this DLC may utilize (= recycle) some monster models\
      \ that also weren't used in Re;Birth 3, like the fat otaku and the Clione from\
      \ Re;Birth 1 (in an oversized version), but frankly, that's all it does. The\
      \ dungeon itself feels extremely bland and empty, there are no items to be gathered,\
      \ there's nothing to pick up or discover, there are no events linked to it,\
      \ no hidden blocks to search for like in all other dungeons, the monsters drop\
      \ nothing at the end of combat and as far as I know, there aren't any Change\
      \ Dungeon plans either. All you can do is go in, kill the few enemies -some\
      \ of which give huge amounts of experience, something that was actually missing\
      \ from Re;Birth 3- and... that's it. The whole thing doesn't make any effort\
      \ to become one with the rest of the game and simply feels weird and out of\
      \ place. Unless you want to turn the Super EXP UP Plan on and level up to 999\
      \ in one afternoon, you won't ever feel the need to enter this dungeon a second\
      \ time for any reason.\n\nThe exact same review applies to the \"Mini Island\"\
      \ as well. With these DLC packs at \u20AC1,59 each, if you buy them you're simply\
      \ supporting the company with practically nothing worthwhile in return. And\
      \ while I do approve of any support of IF/CH, I wholly disapprove of this DLC\
      \ for its (massive lack of) content.\n\nPS: Developers, if you truly want to\
      \ add something meaningful to this game, make an actual expansion pack - a short\
      \ story of 3-4 chapters taking place after the events of Re;Birth 3 that revolves\
      \ around Rei & Arfoire and make them both playable in that expansion [i]and[/i]\
      \ in the main game as well, as part of a NG+. [b]That[/b] would be one excellent\
      \ addition to Re;Birth 3."
