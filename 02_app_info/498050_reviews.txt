Enters room.\n\n* Can’t be bothered with first room. See's corridor. Walks into room on right.\n\n* See's Puzzle. Solves puzzle.\n\n* Mystery Solved. The End.\n\nI was honestly so shocked that my bottom jaw hit the ground real hard. Completely bamboozled I just had to look in the discussion boards to see if others had experienced this too. Yep, I was not the only one, others found it out just as quickly.  On the other hand some had walked around for about an hour before realising that they could have just solved the puzzle at the beginning by themselves. I had bypassed the whole game within 6 minutes max.\n\nThe clueless Mexican developers http://www.ensenasoft.com/ should have known better. On what grounds they claim this is worth $5.00 is beyond me? If you want your monies worth I strongly suggest that you don't try to solve puzzles in this puzzle game or you could come across the ending quicker than you had hoped.\n\nIn fact the whole game from top to bottom seemed to be just a bare boned framework of a game. The puzzles are all easy, half I solved without even needing any clues whatsoever. There is hardly anything to click on in each room other than the puzzles, practically nothing to read story wise which is a complete shame because with the nice visuals and each room having its own unique twisted feel to it, a morbid full expose on the child experiments conducted would have beckoned my curiosity more. \n\nInstead you’re just treated to a room with a dentist chair, a crane overhead with a hook and an abandoned assault rifle and the gasp expression of your main character when he declares you found the torture room. I'm not sure why your main character, who looks like 'Harry Potter' having an allergic reaction to a bee sting, finds this all too shocking.  I'm pretty sure that assault rifles and overhead cranes are just normal tools of the trade for Russian dentists.\n\nAnyway, in final, an overly simple point and click adventure puzzle game that could be over within six minutes if you’re too ambitious in puzzle solving. The real mystery of Rivenhallows is not about why the principal is doing work experience dentistry on the side, but more why on Earth is this marketed more than 50 cents? \n\nBelow the complete game by me... \nhttps://youtu.be/x3TXpkkfWnY\nNow for all the things I bypassed...\nhttps://youtu.be/dzL3xAwaIwo\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review feel free to subscribe to my curator page.
