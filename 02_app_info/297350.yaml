    review: 'The biggest problem with this game is not that it tries to be too "artsy",
      but rather that it doesn''t know how to coherently streamline its own narrative.
      It takes less than a minute into the game after leaving the first room before
      you meet your first branching path, and it is never televised ahead of time
      that one of these branches will leave you to the next chapter of the game.


      But that''s not it, in the first level alone there are at least half a dozen
      branches and by the half hour mark your main concern is not to follow the story
      along, but to roll the dice and pray to God that you''ve uncovered all "side-branches"
      before heading off to the next chapter, or else you''re easily missing out a
      good third of the entire game.


      I also managed to get stuck on staircases more than once and also managed to
      go OOB in chapter 4. Not great experiences.


      Literally the only two redeeming qualities about this game are the visuals and
      the soundtrack (the latter of which I actually sometimes I use as background
      music for reading horror/mystery books and I highly recommend picking up the
      OST).'
