    about_the_game: "The boshin war is tearing Japan apart. Followers of the Emperor\
      \ constantly face the forces of the shogunate in brutal battles. No side wants\
      \ to surrender, both fighting not only for power, but also for something greater\
      \ and much more important - for a place in history. The stakes have never been\
      \ this high. You can feel the tension in the air; the restlessness, the weight\
      \ of the entire conflict, the resolve of both sides to see things through to\
      \ the very end. But not everything is as it seems and it's not just humans that\
      \ want to secure their place on this land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the commotion,\
      \ a ronin known by the name of Satoru is left hopeless and disgraced by the\
      \ fall of his master, Mochitsugu. Without a master and no reason to fight, it\
      \ seems like he no longer has a place in this world. However, it all changes\
      \ when a certain young boy crosses his path, suddenly surprising him with a\
      \ crossroad he never assumed he would have to face.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJoin\
      \ Satoru and a few other outcasts during the battle for peace, for power; decide\
      \ what road they should take. But be warned - selecting one does not mean that\
      \ the shadows of another won\u2019t try to follow you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis\
      \ turn-based RPG will bring you to the world of Japan right at the downfall\
      \ of the feudal era and will let you test your skills against enemies that are\
      \ clearly human, but also those that somehow escape such an easy classification.\
      \ What\u2019s more, the Emperor is supported by East Nippon Company, a British\
      \ trade conglomerate with unclear intentions, equipped with powerful steam-powered\
      \ machines wreaking havoc among the forces of the shogunate. Will you be able\
      \ to overcome all the obstacles thrown your way? Or will you give in and choose\
      \ the easy way out?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreate your own path by making multiple\
      \ decisions that will eventually influence the outcome of this immersive story\
      \ - stay true to yourself and your principles or choose a darker path of sacrifice\
      \ for your own gains. Haunt or be haunted. Overcome the shadows or let them\
      \ consume you. The choice is yours, as it has always been - even if you can\u2019\
      t comprehend it yet."
