It feels similar to the \"first\" game (Amber Maiden).  In any event, this is a solid, if older, HOPA game.  There's lots to do, and the art is very nice, despite the lower resolution and lack of wide-screen (selecting wide screen simply adds a border to the game).  There is no map, but for the most part this doesn't cause problems.\n\nPros:\n- consistent world-building and appealing setting/story\n- the princess' journal notes and comments are entertaining as well as helpful\n- lots of HO scenes  (both word lists and shapes/interactive)\n- a wide variety of puzzles, some challenging\n- voice acting is generally good, although limited\n- sound effects are good\n- bonus chapter\n- integrated Strategy Guide\n\nCons:\n- older/dated look and feel\n- no map at all, and some backtracking required\n- music is repetitive, and the more \"dramatic\" parts are fine at first, but become an irritant\n\n[b]Overall:[/b]  I enjoyed the game, despite its drawbacks.  If you want a classic, older-style HOPA, this game (and the series as a whole) delivers.  I recommend that you buy it on sale.  There is a bundle for the Spirits of Mystery series.","timestamp_created":1606026771,"timestamp_updated":1606026925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.608163237571716309","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vMKq9/UCfY3prwI="}
