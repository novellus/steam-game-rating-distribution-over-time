The combat is slow as molasses.  Upgraded sails, cannon, and hull seem to make no difference - either your potshots hit the enemy more often than they hit you by random chance, or they don't.  If you're looking a game *like* this, go buy Sid Meier's Pirates.  Its combat is much better, and you can do ten times as many piratey things (amass a fleet, swordfight, collect bounties, search for buried treasure, play naval powers off each other, trade... I could go on).","timestamp_created":1367298407,"timestamp_updated":1385435752,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5PyZycICcoagBA=="}
