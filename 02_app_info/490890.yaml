    review: "[h1] REVIEW [/h1]\n\nWhat a fucking story, sad, interesting. I cant wait\
      \ till i see how part 2 will play and see what's instore for that one. \n\n\
      Though im curious what song is playing when Len and Shino faces off with Tsuchigumo\
      \ at the imperial Palace as for me it sounds very viking like though i could\
      \ be wrong but it 100% caught me off guard and it sounds epic for a battle.\
      \ Though the whole battle at the imperial Palace got me, i love it. \n\nLen\
      \ has become scary in capture: Recounting, seriously this game is amazing! Emotional,\
      \ and other sort of emotions at the same time. \n\nAll the music used in this\
      \ game, perfect places set... I love this game, developers you deserved my money\
      \ for this game.\n\n[h1] DISAPPOINTMENTS [/h1]\n\nNone."
