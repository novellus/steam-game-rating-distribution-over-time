This is a solid entry with a good story, lots of options for plotlines and how to solve various challenges.  The music is incredible and spot on for the mood of the game.\n\nThere are some glitches, like floating weapons and other odd visuals.  I only had one freeze throughout my entire first run through the game (68 hours).  Overall it is very stable.\n\nCan't wait for Wasteland 4!","timestamp_created":1610021205,"timestamp_updated":1610021205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wL6v7vYCfeugwQI="}
