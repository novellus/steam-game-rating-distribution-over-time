    review: "Can't recommend it. It's a game where you decide between two options.\
      \ The idea is good, but I feel like there should be more information. It's very\
      \ frustrating to get a negative reaction and no clue why...\n\nAlso way too\
      \ expensive. 1-2 \u20AC would be a fair pricing."
