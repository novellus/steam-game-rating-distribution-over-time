It is unique in its concept and storyline , and totally a different kind of experience than those psychological games out there. Although There are some bugs in the game and dont know why character walks with a small bump it makes it odd, also the price is high as compared to many indie games it could have been of less than 5$. So if you are fan of psychological games, then definitely buy this , but if you dont like this stuff dont buy it (due to price).","timestamp_created":1599323169,"timestamp_updated":1609360969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.624034106731414795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40vHY2vYCdpf+nwI="}
