    review: 'If you purchased [b]Lovely Hentai[/b] because you liked the artwork,
      and are thinking about this DLC because again, [i]you like the artwork[/i].
      . . well don''t. The images are stuck in a .PDF format, which I think stinks.
      What makes developers think .PDFs should be the only way to package non-conceptual
      art? What if I wanted to set these as say, a background or uh, if I didn''t
      have good .PDF reading software? What if I don''t want to load every photo at
      once, or if I want to see a certain few without scrolling through a bunch I
      don''t want? If this DLC includes loose photos in the future, I''d say [i]pick
      it up[/i]. Until then, stay away.


      Also, the "soundtrack" is literally one track. A lone .MP3 file. But hey, it''s
      calming. Put it in your bedtime-playlist. Or uh, meditation.'
