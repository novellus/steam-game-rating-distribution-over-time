      with Beards is a feature documentary that weaves a strange tale of beauty and
      brotherhood. Journey into the souls of countrymen to experience the triumph
      and heartbreak of a world-class beard. Delight in their daring stories, futuristic
      looks, and proud traditions. Men with Beards is a celebration of inner strength
      and personal growth. Man up. Men with Beards shares the stories of everyday
      people whose lives have been touched by extraordinary beards. Growing a beard
      is like making an indie film; it requires patience, care, delusion, stubborn
      determination, ego, revulsion for society, confidence in the process and an
      appreciation for the slow things in life. This is a character-driven film where
      the talking heads have serious beards and fierce opinions on identity and self-expression.
