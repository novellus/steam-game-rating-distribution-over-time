    review: I thought this little game was super fun. It really nailed the feeling
      of trying to tell a story on the fly with your friends. The game is short so
      the characters are fairly basic (the cute shy one, the goofy stoner, and the
      one who actually likes horror stories), but the humour is great and it's really
      funny to see them react to your choices, especially if you switch tones mid-track.
