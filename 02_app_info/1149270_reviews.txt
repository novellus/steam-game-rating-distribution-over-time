If you liked Chapter One, then I would definitely suggest getting Chapter Two, especially considering how cheap it is. This chapter puts more emphasis on the detective work and exploration than hiding from the monster like Chapter One did, and is generally longer and has more content. I also generally found this chapter to be a lot scarier than the first one.","timestamp_created":1609179411,"timestamp_updated":1609179411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o6ak1fYCfJaXvgI="}
