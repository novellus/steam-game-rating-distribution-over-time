    about_the_game: "Playing as a part of a herd, you'll enjoy the company of other\
      \ elephants, large and small. Walk peacefully side-by-side with the elders,\
      \ swim with the young, or delight in mischievous moments of baby elephants at\
      \ play. Elephants thrive in a collective and so will you. Being in a herd means\
      \ that you\u2019ll be better protected against predators. You\u2019ll also learn\
      \ the wayfinding wisdom of the elders. But travelling together means there are\
      \ many mouths to feed, and you must share resources and be constantly on the\
      \ move to stay healthy.<br><br>Your journey will be scattered with magical moments\
      \ as you discover new terrain and untrodden pathways, and should you choose\
      \ to wander after nightfall, you might just come across one of the fabled Ancestral\
      \ Gathering Grounds.<br><strong><br>A Different Kind of Animal</strong><br><br>Shelter\
      \ 2 centred on a lone lynx mother and her cubs as they found and killed prey,\
      \ now Shelter 3 asks you to explore a different kind of animal existence, one\
      \ where motherhood, social harmony and inheritance are the keys to prosperity.\
      \ <br><br>Like its forebears, Shelter 3 invites you to detach yourself from\
      \ human matters and inhabit the spirit of an animal. Landscapes and fauna are\
      \ rendered in mesmerising patterns and scored with an enchanting soundtrack\
      \ by Retro Family, conjuring a magical world to lose yourself in. <br><br>From\
      \ lynx cubs to elephant families, from the tundra to the jungle, from survival\
      \ to cooperation, the next Shelter incarnation migrates to new territory, evolving\
      \ into a bigger game world and an experience that you won\u2019t forget."

    short_description: "Shelter 3 invites you to explore life in the jungle, a world\
      \ of large beasts and exotic vegetation. You will be an elephant - roaming with\
      \ your family, seeking sustenance from the jungle\u2019s waterways, caring for\
      \ the young elephants and learning to navigate from the elders. But you must\
      \ stay fed, so keep moving!"
