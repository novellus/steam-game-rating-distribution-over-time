It feels good to play, and it is mostly a nostalgia blast that doesn't take too much time to get into and out of so I can play even when I have little time.\nMy only problem so far is that the Star Trek TNG Table doesn't work. It just crashes the game every time. \n\nDefinitely worth it otherwise, but if you want the pro versions I recommend waiting to get it while it's on sale and beware the TNG bug that makes me sad because I wanted to play that table again.\n\nEdit: I should add that I was able to get the TNG table to work in DX 11 mode. In the regular mode it just crashes. So if you cant use DX11 for some reason it's a problem maybe, but otherwise it's fine I guess. On top of that, just in general, there are a lot of weird little quirks (the ball will not quite move realistically a few centimeters or something weird), but overall I really really like this game.\nOh, and I don't know why it says I haven't played the game. I have been playing the game a lot since I got it- before work and on my days off. So that's a steam bug or something.","timestamp_created":1480220928,"timestamp_updated":1480344451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+/bZ1dgCeb/4aQ=="}
