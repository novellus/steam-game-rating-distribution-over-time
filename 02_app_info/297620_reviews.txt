Additionally the optimization is really poor and game often hangs for a second or two. It wouldn't be so big issue if there weren't traps on every step, trying to kill you. With such technical difficulties you're just doomed, accidentally stepping into spikes or jumping over the platform. And there are many, many platforms and many, many spikes. Definitely too many – game is designed to irritate you by being unfair.\n\nBut the biggest issue is the fact that the last level seems to be broken and the game crashes just before the battle with the final boss.\n\nTBH I've bought the game only due to the fact that I was playing it as a child… and I remember that it was much more brutal and gory (chopping off enemies' limbs, kicking them, tons of blood…). The Steam version does not have even blood. And without the whole brutality, there is nothing even a little bit pleasant left in the game.","timestamp_created":1594939983,"timestamp_updated":1594939983,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yZj1rPMCf73glQI="}
