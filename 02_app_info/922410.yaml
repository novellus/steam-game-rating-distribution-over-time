    review: 'I don''t have so much to say on this one. The theme is cool and the writing
      is cute but that''s really all there is to it. The story lacks depth, the characters
      are shallow and mostly useless, the romances are forced and the developement
      of the villains seems weird and uninteresting. The only character I found interesting
      was Dreadbone the suffering and complaining dreadful and skeletal dragon.


      Still, I enjoyed reading it but that''s because I like to read cute (and also
      because I really like dinosaurs, but even that does''nt seems developped lol),
      straightforward and simple things from time to time. I would actually put a
      "recommend" on this one but only for people who wants to read something simply
      enjoyable while not thinking too much.'
