    review: Great fun if you're into action platformers, obviously Mega Man specifically.
      Couple of the bosses are a good challenge but nothing that'll take you too long
      to overcome if you play a lot of games like these. Seen some reviews complain
      about unavoidable attacks on bosses and how they seem cheap but I'd just ignore
      that, you can no damage every boss in the game, just requires practice and repetition
      like any other game of this style.
