You can't rush, or you die. I've beaten 4 levels: 1, 3, 21 and 24... within two or so years. You can play them in any order you wish. But once you beat a level, best thing is to take some time off to cool down. Why would you need to cool down? Because this game is either the best way to become a zen master (in moderation) or a nuclear warhead (in overabundance).","timestamp_created":1609203889,"timestamp_updated":1609203889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ttaB1vYCd/ukvgI="}
