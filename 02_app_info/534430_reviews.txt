This program is aimed at a younger market and should be looked upon on that basis. For what it is - it's good, but not great. I've bought it for my young daughter and she's happy enough whereas an College Art Student may feel totally underwhelmed. If you're looking for a simple painting program for children that can do a lot of what Tiltbrush does in a stripped down form and more basically - then at £5.99 compared to £22.99 Tiltbrush - Arcade Artist is worth it! \n\nI'd recommend on that basis!","timestamp_created":1477688511,"timestamp_updated":1477688511,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oanGhtgCfP+dZA=="}
