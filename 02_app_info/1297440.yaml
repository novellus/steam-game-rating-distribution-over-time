      \ every fortnight these so called \u201CHeroes\u201D come into the village and\
      \ un-apologetically break in houses and take what does not belong to them. Tired\
      \ of this rampant menace you have decided to stop it and regain the peaceful\
      \ life you so yearn. Build traps in and around your house or maybe buy some\
      \ land on the outskirts of town to keep bloodshed away. Craft weapons, potions,\
      \ bombs to be launched at the enemy. Resource manage whatever you have and help\
      \ your fellow villagers buy buying resources from them from the gold of the\
      \ fallen \u201CHeroes\u201D.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1297440/extras/Features.gif?t=1593747704\"\
