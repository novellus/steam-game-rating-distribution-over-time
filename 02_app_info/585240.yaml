    review: 'I loved this game in my teens. I never fully beat it but my friend (who
      actually owned the game) did. Now I''ve found my old friend. Not him; that jerk
      ran off with my girlfriend in 2001. RTZ. Also, I never paid for the game when
      I was a teenager, so I''m buying a piece of my soul back.


      Unfortunately, DosBox loads up and then semi-immediately crashes. nVidia GTX
      2070 SUPER with a Samsung 44" double-wide monitor. I guess I''ll try again when
      I can afford a better PC. YOU FOOL!! YOZOZO!!'
