      The other reviews (although few in number) do a pretty solid job of explaining
      Kilcount. You play as a "bird" (or at least one of the other characters refers
      to you this way), and you''re trying to course-correct a ship that is attemtping
      to find a new place to live for its diverse inhabitants. You''ll meet bizarre
      sci-fi monsters, demonic forces, robots, and even a dog, and each has an item
      that they are looking for (or at the very least will be receptive to getting).


      Most of the fun in Kilcount, in my opinion, came from just seeing what sort
      of wild things emerged from the imagination of developer Beatrice. For instance,
      one monster that you meet wants to devour you, and after you meet him, this
      demand is noted in your notebook. As soon as you meet him, you tell yourself,
      "well, OK, that''s one demand I won''t be able to meet." However - without spoiling
      anything, I can tell you that it''s entirely possible to meet his demand without
      killing yourself.


      Unfortunately, there are a couple of things holding Kilcount back. One is that
      the moment-to-moment gameplay can get a little tedious, walking back and forth
      from one NPC to another. This can get especially tiresome if you find a couple
      of items (as I did) that all seemed like they could meet the demand of a certain
      character. One character wants a "collectible" (basically), and I felt like
      many items that I found could fit that bill. So I kept walking back to this
      character over and over to see if he wanted any of what I''d found.


      The other gripe I had is that the ending just fell a bit flat. It seems that
      the game wants to say something about generosity and service towards others,
      but I never felt that I connected with any of these characters. They were all
      just slots with various item-shaped holes for me to fill. Some of the the "quests"
      were more personal, like one particular character''s search for dignity, but
      I just didn''t feel anything upon completing this quest (or indeed the game
      at-large). Perhaps it would''ve been interesting to hear about the plans of
      these characters once we landed on our new world? Maybe this would''ve made
      me feel more invested in their plight. Upon completing one questline, I received
      an item called a Token of Love. The game made it clear that I should be proud
      to receive this item, but I actually didn''t feel like I deserved it.


      Kilcount is a neat little project from a single developer with a rich imagination.
      If you''re interested in the surreal, or in quirky, dark humor, it might be
      right up your alley. However, I wouldn''t expect a particularly exciting or
      emotional experience.
