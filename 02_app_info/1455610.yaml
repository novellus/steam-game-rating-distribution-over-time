      \ and your spaceship is very badly damaged. You'll need to find the resources\

      \ very specialist materials. Your first priority, however, is surviving the\
      \ first night.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce that's out of the way you should consider\
      \ building a rudimentary base, somewhere to live whilst you're stranded on this\
      \ planet. A base will protect you from the elements and provide a source of\
      \ oxygen, since the levels of sulfur in the atmosphere are too high for it to\
      \ be breathable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you continue to build parts to repair\
      \ your spaceship you start to notice something odd about the planet. It appears\
      \ to be dying, and your untimely arrival may have accelerated its demise! Obtaining\
      \ the resources you need might just destroy it! Oh, and it looks like you might\
      \ not be alone after all!"
