The artwork is pretty decent quality and thematically the game is a bit different from many similar titles in that the two girls have always been oppressed, yet somehow remain optimistic of their chances to gain freedom by getting nobles to sign their permit.\n\nThat's it.  Everything else is very basic, standard rpgmaker stuff done cheaply.  The combat is random encounters.  The story is very bare bones and doesn't take itself seriously.  The translation is machine-produced, then poorly transcribed on top of that.  Some of the CG lack context or don't match the context given, and there are very few of the standard user-convenience features games of this type usually have.  At least there is a gallery of sorts once you reach the intended ending (appears to only be one ending?).  There may have been a bad ending that I missed as I did miss a cg, but I'm not sure how it's possible I could have missed anything and the game provides very few hints or directions.  The combat at least is decent if very standard fare, the challenge does scale at a good pace for such a basic rpg.\n\nAt least it's cheap enough that if you like the characters/art work on the store page you can give it a go.  Just know that you're only here because you like the character art, you're not getting anything else out of this title.","timestamp_created":1598876403,"timestamp_updated":1598877418,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoaihovQCdLL3ngI="}
