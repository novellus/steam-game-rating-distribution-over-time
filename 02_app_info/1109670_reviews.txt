The menu was too big and off center (a bit to the right). I had to rotate the headset on my head to even see the buttons on the right side of the menu.\n\nAll menus in the game had the same behavior (a bit to the right and too big to be seen in total).\n\nIngame screenshots did not work. Leaving the game or VR did not work. I had to take the headset off and kill the process on the desktop.","timestamp_created":1565019909,"timestamp_updated":1582447316,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.693351209163665771","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwrnNuPACctPlzwE="}
