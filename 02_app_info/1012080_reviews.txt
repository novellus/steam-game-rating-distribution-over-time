It requires careful management to maintain boiler pressure, unlike most other locomotives in the TS marketplace. Its performance drops with boiler pressure in a realistic way too.\n- The Bossman cab view camera locations are the best out there.\n\nSome negatives:\n- On the F5 HUD, the Blower, Damper, and Small Ejector readings are all unrelated to the actual state of the model.\n- The model is more demanding of computer resources than other Pro locomotives on the market - even when running in 'Performance' mode. Exceed the TS recommended computer spec's if you want to use this locomotive.\n\nThis is my first Bossman Pro Locomotive purchase.\nI own Pro locomotives from both Victory Works and Just Trains.\nEvery locomotive has its own unique pros and cons - it would be nice if they could all get together with the best bits of each!","timestamp_created":1584325451,"timestamp_updated":1585454768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+PudkvECdbO2+AE="}
