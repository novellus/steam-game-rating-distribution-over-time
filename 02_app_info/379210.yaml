    review: 'A survival roguelike with a lot of potential brought down in its current
      early-access version by a lot of subpar functionalities. Another big issue with
      the game is tone: it tries to be a hardcore survival game but often doesn''t
      feel like that at all.


      The goal: survive on a deserted isle - perhaps not as cool as survive the apocalypse
      like with Cataclysm: DDA or Caves of Qud but sure, I''m right there with you!
      Wayward is a hardcore/realistic experience that requires you to juggle and micro-manage
      a lot of things at the same time with death looking over your shoulder with
      every step but then... you can tame a giant rat to be your friend by giving
      it food? Wait, what?! That''s so tone-deaf that it takes me right out of the
      experience.


      Unlike most roguellikes, a lot of the controls are mouse-based - which should
      be a blessing but instead hinders the experience compared to a veteran player
      in most roguelikes that can perform complex actions in just a few memorized
      keyboard commands.  Instead, a lot of actions are triggered by either pressing
      the "command menu" key or a "quickbar slot" key - which then brings up list
      of sub-commands.


      This all would be fine but these subcommands are number-based so where in [i]literally
      any other roguelike[/i] you would press [c]onsume -> [item key], in Wayward
      you need to first place an item on a quickbar slot, then hit that slot key,
      then select from a drop-down menu with the mouse. Even if the item is already
      on a slot, all subcommands are numeric so you have to go through the list every
      time to see the number rather than [b]just press "c" to consume[/b], for example.
      Or do it all with the mouse instead - not great.


      I haven''t explored deep into the game, mostly because the core gameplay is
      pretty unappealing to me right now. There''s a lot to do just to get by and
      nothing of it is as easy to perform as if it were a more traditional, text-based
      roguelike (which, ironically enough, are known for their bad UIs). Apart from
      that, there is zero character creation (other than cosmetics, name, etc) and
      I haven''t come across anything obviously interesting in the game world other
      than a higher-quality version of grass.


      I wasn''t expecting much when I came in - all I wanted was a survival roguelike
      with minimally modern graphics and user interface, yet Wayward still left me
      disappointed. Even if there were a huge amount of interesting content in the
      game (which I haven''t seen a hint of, so far), the sheer drudge of keeping
      myself alive by struggling with the UI for every little thing puts a hamper
      on whatever amount of fun I''d be trying to have with this game.


      I really hope the developers rethink some of the fundamentals here but looking
      at their public roadmaps, I don''t remember "interface overhaul/major improvements"
      being a priority.'
