Example: \"ano i want to be with you\" \"eto yes that will do\" as well as rough English translations not just errors in not Translating the words from Japanese to English. Example: \"She making hard for get off\". Other than that it is a decent game (specifically because of Amaya), i personally think this game is worth $2-$3 but with the bugs and errors it should be $1 (not to mention how short it is) you can play through all 3 characters in about an hour so there is not too much content to explore, there are 4 scenes for each character. (pictures) this is a Teen Game so there is no nudity, but there is some Sexual content in the game. so beware if that is not what you were looking for.\n\n-Story line:  Meh to average\n-PC Performance: You could run this on a Toaster\n-Average Hours to Completion: 1-1.30\n-Story replayability: as short and un-satisfying as it was, it is worth replaying at least once.\n\nGod Bless and Have a Nice Day![/b]\n","timestamp_created":1593211207,"timestamp_updated":1593211207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54703831672668457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41bey+fICfdnCkAI="}
