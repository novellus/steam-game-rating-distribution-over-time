    review: aside from the vibrant, fresh visuals the game has to offer, the main
      reason why demonizer is worth the purchase is the smooth gameplay. i was a little
      apprehensive coming from the Danmaku games, but this was a ton of fun! and also
      challenging! i can't beat the first boss! wonderful
