Didn't think I'd enjoy playing the Soviets as much as the Germans, but the scenarios are very well designed and quite frequently epic in scale, if not a tad easy for experienced players (though that's presumably historically accurate, given the rout that was the late-war German retreat).  Looking forward to Unity of Command II, I hope it preserves the excellent feel of the original. Played on linux (Ubuntu 19.04), appreciate the OS support.","timestamp_created":1569958897,"timestamp_updated":1569958933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oIa2xO0Cctek0wE="}
