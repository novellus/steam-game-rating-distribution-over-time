The game has some potential to be a good multiplayer game but so far it is far from good. There are alot of bugs in the game, sometimes enemies are in front of you and they dont even shoot ( talking about the bots), also the Stat menu or reader whatever don't updates for other player except yours( v few are playing so far so I think they are just bots added by game developer). The game can run on 60 fps on an old pc so I guess that is the only plus point. I would say dev should have given more time and hope issues get fixed in an update. I am just giving thumbs up to support the developer.","timestamp_created":1605814923,"timestamp_updated":1609361768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.421745598316192627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5Pfb2vYCdI+trwI="}
