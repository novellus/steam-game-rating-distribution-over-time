    review: "As a biologist, I was frustrated by this game. I was excited when I started\
      \ it because I love genetics-based games like Niche. I could not make sense\
      \ of the Mendelian aspect of this game. Crossing plants did not produce the\
      \ Mendelian ratios you'd expect in nature. That's fine if the creators didn't\
      \ want the breeding to work out that way. But calling the game \"Mendel's Garden\"\
      \ is misleading. \nI understand that the game is still in early-access, but\
      \ the buggy-ness of it made it really frustrating to just play the game. Moving\
      \ around through the different parts of the garden is cumbersome and the the\
      \ quick travel is not as useful as it could be. \nI do like the story though\
      \ and the plants have really neat designs."
