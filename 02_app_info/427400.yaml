    review: "Well this was the 1st film i rented on Steam and to be honest i think\
      \ it was over priced. Cheap old low budget films like this should be \xA32.50\
      \ to own for ever on steam or \xA31.00 to rent. \xA33.49 just to rent for a\
      \ few days is a bit of a rip off. Anyway, I'm a massive fan of Found Footage\
      \ films and this movie has been on my list of films to watch for awhile. The\
      \ quality options went up to 1080p so I chose that and it seemed ok, although\
      \ on a found footage film the quality is generally going to be pretty poor anyway\
      \ so I was not expecting much and I can't really say whether it was actually\
      \ 1080p or not as it's all filmed on hand held cams. The stream was constant\
      \ throughout with no pauses for buffering or anything. The film itself is interesting\
      \ as it directed by and stars a a famous documentary maker called Werner Herzog,\
      \ it starts off with mostly good acting and a great idea, but as the film progresses\
      \ the acting and actors seem to get worse with some poor acting and editing\
      \ gradually making the film seem like they got sick of it and just wanted to\
      \ finish the whole thing as quick as possible. There is no real suspense or\
      \ building of anticipation so ultimatly there are no shocks or horror. and it\
      \ just plods along like they are trying to get enough filler to make a feature\
      \ length movie. If you are not a fan  of Found Footage filsm then I suggest\
      \ you give this movie a miss. IF like me you love Found Footage films then go\
      \ ahead and watch it as you will see it refered to in various found footge movie\
      \ reviews so it's good to know what other reviews on horror film review sites\
      \ are going on about."
