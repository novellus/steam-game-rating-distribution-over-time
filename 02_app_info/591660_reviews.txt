For a dollar, you really can't go wrong, and there is alot of work in this title. It's of the sitting, 'ride' style of horror VR experience. It competes well with other non-interactive examples of the genre, but it is a big rough around the edges and amateurish. It is still fairly impressive considering the likely novice nature of the developer(s). It certainly is too 'ghetto' to be scary, but it has some very nice horror elements nonetheless, and it is 'relatively' long. [i]I loved when you got put in the coffin then the eyes were looking at you.[/i] That makes it worth a dollar. This is pretty good. Better than Demonic Guest. Not scary for VR people, but useful to train someone who won't play the actually scary stuff. [spoiler]There is two modes, but just select the 'harder' one, so you can see the bloooooood.[/spoiler] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY6edmTI8S4","timestamp_created":1504475838,"timestamp_updated":1546215936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51918327808380127","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgNrpgOgCeae6hAE="}
