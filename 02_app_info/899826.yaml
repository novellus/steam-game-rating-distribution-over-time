    review: 'All right so I''m gonna probably forget but if I remember I''ll add reviews
      of the Guitar tabs for this.


      Hammer to Fall - Bass

      Very fun to play, requires you to be able to do walk bass or alternate picking
      with your thumb. Good for people at an Intermediate skill level. Not recommended
      for Beginner bassists.


      I Want To Break Free - Bass

      A very simple song, not too much fun to play but everyone has different tastes.
      Can be quite easy, meant to be played with a pick (Apparently) but it can be
      easily played with your thumb and fingers if you can do that Overall, good for
      Beginner-Intermediate bassists.


      Somebody to Love - Bass

      Very interesting bassline and once you hear it you''ll most likely want to keep
      hearing it. Good for intermediate level bassists, probably not good for Beginners,
      but you can still try, it might be easy for you.


      Overall, great pack. Very weirdly so soon after the 2nd one, too. Worth the
      price.'
