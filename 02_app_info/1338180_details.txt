I came about the idea for this project whilst searching for fun four player games to play with my wife and kids. We already really loved the competitiveness of games like TowerFall and Tricky Towers, and I was so impressed with how the mechanics of these games allowed for balanced game play whilst still making it feel like the best player won the day. There seemed to be a big hole right where the idea for Dungeon Scale would fit and I really wanted to see if I could make something even half as fun as the other great games out there. Hopefully I have managed what I set out to do and I hope my game will bring some joy and happiness to your homes as it has with mine, it has been quite the journey.<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1>Dungeon Scale is a couch multiplayer dungeon scaling game for 2-4 players that’s inspired by the coin collecting classics of our age.
