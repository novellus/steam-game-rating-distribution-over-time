    review: 'The weird theme is the game''s best part, and although it has a lot of
      polish, it is a flawed gaming experience. The gameplay is like a two-tracked
      lane-defense game, with a lot of power-ups, upgrades, and unlocks. It has a
      solid series of several tutorial levels, although owners may quit playing even
      before completing them.


      The game is off-putting with its confusing mix of item upgrades, limited controls,
      and odd menus. For example, the game never describes the vital "pack-up building"
      action, which is also inaccessible on the gamepad controller. Overall, this
      dry game lacks a certain fun-factor. To illustrate just how many people get
      turned off by this game, only 3.5% of game owners get the achievement that is
      automatically obtained shortly after the campaign tutorial levels!


      If you can finally get into the gameplay, then the levels offer rewards for
      replaying. And there are a lot of levels in the campaign, then steam workshop
      levels to play. I enjoyed the pacing and narrative that encouraged playing them
      again. There were a decent musical tracks and voiceovers. I thought the bizzaro
      theme was sufficiently good to make up for the limited gameplay.


      I played on Ubuntu 18.10 & 19.10 with radeon mesa graphic drivers. I used an
      xbox-type gamepad controller (not recommend) and keyboard-mouse control. This
      game uses the Unity game engine, with rather long level-loading times. The game
      requires 430MBs of diskspace. I would recommend this game for gamers who are
      looking for a quirky gaming experience, who will take a chance on an inexpensive
      price tag. Wish there were more inexpensive games on steam that tried such an
      experimental approach as this one.'
