      \ by Daylight. It includes a Killer, The Oni, a Survivor, Yui Kimura and a Map.\

      \ the Sanctum of Wrath. The Oni is the new Killer. A former Samurai corrupted\
      \ by the Entity and turned into a dark reflection of his inner angst, a hideous\
      \ creature of rage, an embodiment of wrath and cruelty that reigns terror upon\
      \ his victims.  The new survivor is Yui Kimura. A rebel against traditions,\
      \ a protector to those who cannot protect themselves, an exceptional motorcyclist\
      \ who suddenly finds herself in an endless race for her life. The Cursed Legacy\
      \ Chapter also features an exclusive cosmetic item: Yui's Pink Striped Top.<br><br>What\
      \ does it mean to be authentic? How does one follow one\u2019s destiny despite\
      \ the pressures of family and tradition? Often following one\u2018s path is\
      \ a strenuous, narrow struggle full of unexpected joys and difficulties. Ultimately\
      \ it\u2019s about finding the balance between tradition and self-actualization.\
      \ But as one struggles for identity, decisions are made and consequences, good\
      \ or bad, must be faced.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1199880/extras/CursedLegacy_Killer_header.png?t=1585922705\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> The Oni</h2><br>Heir to a famous Japanese swordsmanship\
      \ school, Kazan Yamaoka sought to surpass his reputation as a warrior by turning\
      \ his back on honor and family and embarking on a dark pilgrimage of bloodlust.\
      \ As he waged his personal war against self-proclaimed samurai, he was bestowed\
      \ with the derogatory and despised nickname of Oni-Yamaoka, a reference to the\
      \ hideous creature of legend. One day, he met his fate as his former victims\
      \ took revenge on him. It drew the Entity\u2019s attention and he was deemed\
      \ worthy of becoming part of its world, joining the other killers there, but\
      \ ironically under the very form he had been compared to in his former life.<br><br><strong>The\
      \ Oni\u2019s Power: Yamaoka\u2019s Wrath</strong><br><br>The desire to destroy\
      \ weaker bloodlines shaped into a literal force. The Oni absorbs blood orbs\
      \ left by injured Survivors. Once he\u2019s collected enough orbs of blood,\
      \ The Oni enters BLOOD FURY mode. Once active, The Oni will sheathe his katana\
      \ and switch to his devastating kanab\u014D. Blood Fury also grants The Oni\
      \ access to powerful abilities: <br><br> - DEMON DASH allows The Oni to cover\
      \ large distances quickly, closing the gap between him and his victims.  <br><br>\
      \ - DEMON STRIKE extends the range of The Oni\u2019s attacks, and immediately\
