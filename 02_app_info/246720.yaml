    about_the_game: "Wayward Manor invites you to jump into the afterlife of a disgruntled\
      \ ghost, trying to reclaim his house from its newfound owners. Set in the 1920s,\
      \ this puzzle/adventure game transports players to an era of dark screwball\
      \ comedy where they must unlock the secrets of a twisted mansion. Players will\
      \ discover the quirks of Wayward Manor\u2019s unwelcome guests and choose how\
      \ to prey on their darkest fears.  <br> <br><strong>Story</strong><br>The Budds,\
      \ a dysfunctional family of misfits and eccentrics, have brought their own abysmal\
      \ possessions into your humble abode and stifled your power. Each level is a\
      \ playground for scares where players earn fear to take back control of the\
      \ room. If you want free reign over your mansion once again, you must drive\
      \ the Budds mad with fear using only your imagination and their hideous belongings.\
      \  <br> <br><strong>History</strong> <br>What started as a Lego prototype that\
      \ The Odd Gentlemen and Neil Gaiman played together one afternoon, soon became\
      \ a unique collaboration to tell a story through a non\xADlinear puzzle/adventure\
      \ game hybrid, where the player learns about the characters and world through\
      \ their observations and discovery. First launched on the website <a href=\"\
