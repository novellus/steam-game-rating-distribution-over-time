    review: 'This second DLC for AJE sits halfway between Birth of Rome and Parthian
      Wars also in terms of gameplay.

      Theaters are much wider than in Birth of Rome, and this puts more stress on
      the supply lines and greatly enhances the role of weather, especially if are
      willing to take risks (e.g. Hannibal''s crossing of the Alps by late summer).

      Scenarios are still asymmetrical but sometimes the AI fails to take full advantage
      of its options: this is especially obvious when playing Carthage as Rome, despite
      its wider array of options tends to follow always the "historical strategy",
      leading to much easier opening moves for the human player.

      If AI''s behavior about high-level strateglical planning is rather rigid, at
      lower levels can handle efficiently the armies (even if its implementation of
      a  Fabian strategy is not optimal and, has happens in Birth of Rome, has trouble
      at dealing with this approach as well).

      Overall Hannibal Terror of Rome is another worth addition to AJE and, again,
      the best virtual take on the Second Punic war available on Steam'
