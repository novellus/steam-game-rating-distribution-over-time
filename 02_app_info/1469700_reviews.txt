I mean there is no game, it is the text of the full novel transcribed (Only the first 23 chapters, however) with an interactive part where you can dress the characters (Elisabeth, Jane ...) With various clothes in a nice visual style and create postcards with quotes from the book.\nEssentially, it's an easy, fun, and enjoyable way to re-read this lovely novel at a pace to suit everyone's taste and without affecting the reader's imagination. Good work\nI hope that the rest of the novel will be published in the near future.","timestamp_created":1608944066,"timestamp_updated":1608944066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3cOizvYCeOOcvQI="}
