    review: "One of the first things that hit me when I started playing Puzzle Of\
      \ Santa Girl VR (or PSGVR, which is what I will be calling it for the sake of\
      \ ease) was the immense amount of detail that you can grasp whilst playing this\
      \ marvellous game. Now let me blow you away, all this time you have been thinking\
      \ that this is was merely filmed on a 360 camera and placed in the unity engine,\
      \ but if you are thinking this, you have got it all wrong. This game was actually\
      \ a pretty secretive test of a technology that has been around ever since the\
      \ making of The Polar Express (2004), it may have been a very strange looking\
      \ film, but it had some pretty interesting underlying components. Instead of\
      \ just filming some reference shots of people walking and doing basic movements,\
      \ then taking that to a large warehouse filled with animators, they instead\
      \ did something a little different. \n\nMotion Capture, The Polar Express was\
      \ directed and filmed on a set, with real actors in Motion capture suits (or\
      \ \u2018Mo Cap\u2019 for short) then of course they would have had a small group\
      \ of animators to adjust what had been captured into something that could be\
      \ applied to 3D models, but it would still be considerably less. This movie,\
      \ was the one of the first, if not the first of its kind, but of course this\
      \ wasn\u2019t the best example of this fascinating new technology, some people\
      \ have even gone so far as to call it \u2018Uncanny Valley the Movie\u2019,\
      \ which is fair enough. This film was a great idea, it just could have been\
      \ executed better, for example, Tom Hanks played, as in he acted and his motion\
      \ was captured for 6 different characters, including the hero child, if you\
      \ didn\u2019t know this, hero child, is well, a child and Tom hanks is very\
      \ much an adult, so there was only so much the said fixer animators could do.\
      \ The main differences between PSGVR and The polar express were that PSGVR is\
      \ not working with a $165 million budget, but I think they did it better, the\
      \ motion of this character is none like any other I have ever seen, especially\
      \ from a smaller developer. \n\nDetails. This game is filled with them, the\
      \ animators have made the world look and feel massive and of course you can\
      \ explore this world to your hearts content. I would love to talk about the\
      \ menus, I never really talk about these things, mainly because they are just\
      \ the old, uncomfortable bus that takes you to the main game, not this game,\
      \ I think this is the best menu I have ever seen in a game and I have seen some\
      \ pretty baller menus in my time, but this one mainly comes out on top because\
      \ of how realistic it is, have you ever seen those cave paintings? What do I\
      \ mean by that, you are probably asking, well, like the character modelling,\
      \ this menu is another feat of engineering and animation, is seriously realistic,\
      \ its as if one of the Studio Swag team actually took the time to carve the\
      \ menu into a mixture of wood and rock and because this is a VR game, I can\
      \ physically stand closer to it and admire the amazing textures, that only look\
      \ like a blur from further away and this is not a flaw in the game.\n\nUsually\
      \ in VR games your virtual hands are either almost ghost-like hands or just\
      \ a low poly copy of the controllers you are actually using outside the game.\
      \ Your virtual appendages in this game are super well modelled realistic hands.\
      \ You know the game is detailed when you spend time just staring at your hands,\
      \ looking over every wrinkle, every vein, every bone. You can see your muscles\
      \ moving your bones underneath your skin, its almost unreal, to the point that\
      \ I could be standing in the middle of my office without the headset on just\
      \ looking down at my real hands.\n\nLike Studio Thug Life\u2019s last game,\
      \ this game is set in Korea, but its Christmas, so it almost puts more pressure\
      \ on you to do the right thing and find the person that this entire game is\
      \ based on, the person that we know is called Santa Girl. Here is some backstory\
      \ if you are not up to date on the lore, Santa Girl is a character in the Korean\
      \ Christmas movie \u201C\uCD5C\uACE0\uC758 \uC0AC\uB791\u201DI am not expecting\
      \ you to speak Korean so this basically translates to \u201CThe Greatest Love\u201D\
      , which was first played in 2011 and instantly hit. The general gist of this\
      \ is that this Girl was the daughter of Santa Clause who grew up in the north\
      \ pole surrounded by elves and toy factories, but eventually everyone grows\
      \ up and leaves home, so she has to travel to the real world and get a real\
      \ job. But of course she finds this hard, luckily she meets a young explorer\
      \ whilst navigating out of the north pole and they slowly get to know each-other,\
      \ of course as the watcher of this film, you know they will eventually get together,\
      \ as they work really well together and just get on well. We eventually find\
      \ out that this young explorer lives in Seoul (the capital city of Korea), finally\
      \ what we were waiting for, the young man asks for Santa Girl\u2019s hand in\
      \ marriage after their long trek back together. But before they even get close\
      \ to Korea the Santa Girl goes missing without a trace, except for the faint\
      \ signs of struggle in the snow around their tent. \n\nYour job is to track\
      \ her down, with the help of this young explorer named Dokko Jin. Throughout\
      \ this game you have to solve puzzles whilst learning more and more about this\
      \ girl, you have to solve the crimes, to eventually trace their hideout and\
      \ save the Santa Girl. This sounds like it would be super simple, but this game\
      \ is not your average VR game that is  just a glorified tech demo, no this game\
      \ is a fully fledged VR title, the puzzles are plenty, challenging, but not\
      \ to repetitive or boring. Imagine the murder mystery of La Noire, the VR immersive\
      \ world of Half Life Alyx and the puzzles from The Witness, this is what PSGVR\
      \ is.  \n\nAfter your first crime scene you can tell that the kidnapper is even\
      \ more of a psychopath than you thought, he wants this to be a game, he leaves\
      \ you puzzles, riddles and notes to where you will find the next crime scene,\
      \ but you know he\u2019s only human, he will make a mistake at some point, so\
      \ you follow his game as you know its the only way you will be able to get that\
      \ girl back. Some of the puzzles you could encounter include; There is a photo\
      \ of the crime scene before any crime happened and you have to work out what\
      \ is missing from the room and what was used as the murder weapon. Another puzzle,\
      \ the kidnapper leaves you a room filled with birds and you have to catch the\
      \ bird with the letter wrapped around its leg, each puzzle you solve you get\
      \ one step closer to finding the Santa Girl. I don\u2019t want to give to much\
      \ about the story away, but you can tell already that you will eventually get\
      \ the Santa Girl back for young Dokko Jin. \n\nIf this doesn\u2019t sound good\
      \ to you already then you probably asking questions, a question I can hear people\
      \ asking is \u201CIs it re-playable?\u201D Yes, 100% yes, each level is randomised,\
      \ so you can replay this game many time, as I have and get a different experience\
      \ each time, the actual game is probably around 25-30 hours if you take your\
      \ time, but on a second play-through you can care less about story and start\
      \ taking the environment and look for some of the smaller details. \n\nShould\
      \ you buy this game? Well do you want hours of immersive puzzle gameplay, do\
      \ you want to game where you could spend hours staring at the menus and your\
      \ in game hands. Then this game is perfect for you, But what about PC specs?\
      \ Well I am a good game reviewer, I have access to a fairly underpowered gaming\
      \ laptop and a full on gaming PC, this game works very well on both, even without\
      \ the changing of settings for the low powered machine. Basically my main answer\
      \ to this question is do you have \xA311.39. Yes. Well what are you waiting\
