    review: '2 seconds to pick popular topics, and shit controls requiring you to
      click on a comment, then choose an action. wouldat least be a decent BSH copy
      if the comments were in succession. requires a godlike autoclicker to fight
      against the counter dabs


      also, not free. i couldve made this shit in scratch for god sake'
