    review: There's cryptic BS, and then there is Vane. I've tried four different
      times to play this game and I have absolutely no clue what to do or what's going
      on. Single-button prompts appear on screen every now and then, but only in some
      cases do they actually do anything. I'm mostly just flying around while absolutely
      nothing happens. If things actually do happen in this game, they're way too
      hidden behind secrecy and symbolism. I'm just a crow/raven flapping my wings
      in a vast desert. That's not much of a game.
