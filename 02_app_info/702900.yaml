    about_the_game: <strong>Time Barbarian Extreme!!</strong> is a hectic, fast-paced
      shooter game like those from the old stand-up arcade machines we used to pump
      quarters into back in the 1980s.<br><br>It runs at 60 fps in a window or full-screen.<br><br><strong>Controls</strong><br>TBE
      plays best with a gamepad controller, but you can use the keyboard.<br><br>You
      steer around with the left thumbstick and shoot with the right trigger. (Steering
      is fully analog with a gamepad controller.) Missiles are on the left trigger,
      and &quot;Time Freeze&quot; is on the top-right face button.<br><br>The keyboard
      controls are completely configurable, so use wasd or arrow keys as you prefer.<br><br><strong>Eggs</strong><br>The
      gimmick to the game is the eggs. When you kill an enemy, it pops out an egg.
      The eggs are also your hit points. You have only one life, but you start with
      10 egg slots (10 maximum hit points). Catch the eggs to fill your egg slots.<br><br>The
      real trick is what happens if you miss the egg. When an egg hits the lava, it
      spawns a new enemy, and the new enemy will be tougher than the one the egg originally
      came from. You've got to kill the enemies, but be sure to catch those eggs,
      or you'll end up making things worse.<br><br><strong>Stages</strong><br>The
      enemies come in waves, and you need to clear all the enemies to advance to the
      next stage. The difficulty quickly escalates as the stages progress.<br><br><strong>Upgrades</strong><br>Between
      stages you get the opportunity to spend your accumulated points to buy upgrades.
      There are upgrades for your blaster, multi-target missiles, extra egg slots
      (hit points), and time freeze.<br><br><strong>Missiles</strong><br>Missiles
      lock on to several targets near you and are powerful enough to destroy them
      in one shot creating a cluster of eggs. Missiles automatically recharge after
      a short delay.<br><br><strong>Time Freeze</strong><br>A <i>bullet-time</i> sort
      of time-stop effect that freezes all the enemies in their tracks. Use it to
      get yourself out of sticky situations. Time Freeze recharges over time as you
      kill enemies.<br><br><strong>Wrap-Around</strong><br>The world wraps around.
      Keep flying in the same direction, and you'll soon return to where you started.<br><br><strong>Mini-map</strong><br>There's
      a mini-map or radar screen that's useful for tracking down that last straggler.

    review: A goofy and fun game. Rewards you for any play style whether that is to
      stay back and fire safely or just run in and gun at things like Doom. The mechanic
      of being able to recoup the eggs you lost and get your health back as you fight
      means you can have an extremely chaotic play style and still stay alive if you
      manage to continuously micro your guy around and pick the eggs back up. The
      upgrades, art, and just the general idea was clearly a product of some inspired
      fun.
