Holy F*cking Sh*t!!! This is hands down my new favorite game of all time. Your first playthrough is amazing! When the game introduces you to something it does it swiftly which doesn't slow the gamee down at all. The only thing about the game is the late parts of ravenholm but that's it! this should have been the first game in my steam library!\n\nWhen the game ended i took it all in..... Than installed hl2 ep1. And Cursed at valve for no half life 3.\n\n[b]For Hl2 Update[/b]\nI honestly loved that you guys actually took the time to compile the maps with better lighting and lighting maps.\nI'm a tf2 mapper and i know how long that would take! Also [b]LIGHTRAYS[/b]\n\nP.S. Breath of the wild is my new favorite game of all time. I'm sorry hl2. I still love you. :D","timestamp_created":1485376976,"timestamp_updated":1498856707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.663768589496612549","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u8q0/dwCcqS/cA=="}
