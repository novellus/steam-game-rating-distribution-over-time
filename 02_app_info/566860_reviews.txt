Weapons feel great to use, it's not possible to just spam melee, feels genuenly satisfying and acomplishing to fight bosses. There's a very varied ammount of weapons, loadouts affect weights, there's classes that affect the damage you take, stats also involve sacrifices.\n\nThat being said, it's still on early access, so there's a few bugs here and there, overall pretty solid. The multiplayer is a little wonky to say the least. Takes a few attempts to join people. I've also had performance issues while the application is on the background.\n\nTLDR: Very good game, not too much content, multi is wonky and the visual style is very solid. Fun as heck for sure","timestamp_created":1610087890,"timestamp_updated":1610087890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwxe+t8PYCeLO8wQI="}
