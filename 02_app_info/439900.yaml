      has been one year since the bombs fell. Death and decay plague the air and the

      survivors strive to live in the outskirts and the wilderness, where nature still
      provides food and supplies for those willing to pay the high price it demands
      in both body and spirit. Take on the role of Screw, a scavenger for the colony

    review: "For those who played the main game, I like the new enemies, not to mention\
      \ the quests (my favorite was in the Quarantine Zone), but I got the impression\
      \ that something is missing in this DLC, perhaps the lack of integration of\
      \ the two cities and the characters of the first game i'm not sure. \n\nThis\
      \ does not mean that i did not like it, because i enjoyed it a lot. One of the\
      \ things that drives me to love these games is their gameplay, which for many\
      \ people do not like."
