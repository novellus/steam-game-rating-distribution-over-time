    about_the_game: "In this retelling of Dante's origin story which is set against\
      \ a contemporary backdrop, DmC Devil May Cry\u2122 retains the stylish action,\
      \ fluid combat and self-assured protagonist that have defined the iconic series\
      \ but inject a more brutal and visceral edge. <br><br>The Dante of DmC is a\
      \ young man who has no respect for authority or indeed society in general. Dante\
      \ knows that he is not human, but also that he is not like the demons that have\
      \ tormented him throughout his life. Caught between worlds, he feels like an\
      \ outcast. <br>Thanks to his twin brother Vergil, leader of the anti-establishment\
      \ group called \u201CThe Order\u201D, Dante is now discovering and coming to\
      \ terms with what it means to be the child of a demon and an angel. This split\
      \ personality has a real impact on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon\
      \ angel and demon abilities at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the\
      \ fly to dramatically affect both combat and movement. <br><br>For DmC Capcom\
      \ has teamed up with UK development studio, Ninja Theory, renown for delivering\
      \ action titles with compelling characters and narrative coupled with high production\
      \ values. The combination of Ninja Theory\u2019s expertise and Capcom\u2019\
      s unrivalled heritage in producing combat focused action titles will ensure\
      \ that this latest addition to the over 11-million selling series will remain\
      \ true to the Devil May Cry DNA so cherished by the fans, while bringing a new\
