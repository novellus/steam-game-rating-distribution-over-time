There is a surprising amount of story and many audio tapes to listen to. Xanadu also has some nice puzzles to solve that lead to one out of three endings. The main flaw is probably the uninspired art design and the gunplay could need some polish, but overall Xanadu is a decent short game that is much better than it looks like. The developer is also active on the forum and always trying to help out players with problems or questions whenever he can.","timestamp_created":1609456124,"timestamp_updated":1609456124,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563953518867492676","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhvDD3fYCcqyevwI="}
