      notes: Shady Brook contains mature content, including strong language, disturbing
        imagery, sexual situations, and nudity.  A censored mode can be activated
        at the start of a new game that will disable mature content, graphic visuals
        and text.  This will not disrupt the story experience.

    developer_response: Thank you for your review, Andi!  Just to note for clarification
      that the story is not over.  This is part of an ongoing series of games with
      an overarching plot, and both the town of Shady Brook--and the ending to which
      you are referring--will be addressed in the future.  Without spoiling anything,
      let me just say that this end is not necessarily THE end. :-)

    review: "Shady Brook is a text adventure game where you take on the role of Jake\
      \ Torrent, a fiction writer looking for a quite place to live and work with\
      \ his elderly father. However, it becomes apparent that not everything is as\
      \ it seems as Jake is soon caught in some kind of dark mystery.\n\n Pros:\n\t\
      Very simple controls\n\tPuzzles to solve\n\tPuzzles range from easy to hard\n\
      \tA mystery unfolds as you play\n\nCons:\n\tFairly linear\n\tFairly short game\n\
      \tThe one and only ending was unsatisfactory\n\tYour choices don't really matter\n\
      \nThe story is fairly solid although I have to acknowledge, I did deduce what\
      \ was about to happen. With that said, I wasn't too surprised when it came time\
      \ for the big reveal. However, some of the details I did overlook, which led\
      \ me to not trust someone when I should have trusted them. Nevertheless, your\
      \ choices don't really matter. The story is going to unfold in a very narrow\
      \ field. \n\nSince this is a text adventure game, there is no real graphics\
      \ to talk about, all the same, there are some impressionist drawing to give\
      \ the player an idea of what they are looking at which is nice.\n\nI did enjoy\
      \ this game, but I have to say the ending was very disappointing. I sat in front\
      \ of my computer, shaking my head and muttering to myself, \u201CWell, that\
      \ sucks\u201D.\n\nAt the time of this review, Shady Brook was selling for $2.99.\
      \ It took me 12 hours to complete this game (including getting all of the achievements).\
      \ 12 hours vs $2.99, this game is definitely worth it"
