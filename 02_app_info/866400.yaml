    review: 'The best WW1 game (on the tactical or operational level, so not including
      Grand Strategy games such as Darkest Hour) that I''ve been able to find as of
      the posting of this comment, not that there is any competition there at the
      moment (seriously, any game developers who may read this, are you guys allergic
      to anything that isn''t either WW2 or modern? WW2 has been done to death, give
      us some different conflicts).


      I haven''t run into any obvious bugs so far. There doesn''t seem to be anything
      blatantly historically inaccurate. The combat mechanics generally seem to get
      pretty realistic results. Supplies and moral seem to be pretty well modeled.
      Manpower and casualties seem to be pretty well modeled. No micromanagement is
      needed, and you will generally be concerned with big picture macromanagement
      of your division. And, most importantly, it kept me entertained and reasonably
      addicted.'
