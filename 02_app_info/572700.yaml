    reviews: "\u201CNancy Drew: Sea of Darkness presented a well-woven plot to uncover,\
      \ an interesting back-story of both the characters and the town, and a set of\
      \ puzzles and circumstances that were challenging, but not frustratingly difficult.\
      \ If you\u2019re a seasoned player of the Nancy Drew mysteries, I think you\u2019\
      ll be pleased with this entertaining title. If you\u2019re a new player, looking\
      \ for the perfect game out of the 32 to get started with, I\u2019d highly recommend\
      \ this one as a prime example of the quality of the series. The price point\
      \ is well worth the hours of enjoyment you\u2019ll receive from solving a mystery\
      \ alongside the most famous young female detective of all time. So grab a copy\
      \ and, as Her Interactive challenges you to do in the opening titles, \u201C\
      Dare to Play.\u201D\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://computertimes.com/NancyDrewSeaOfDarkness.html\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Computer Times</a><br><br>\u201COverall\
      \ I was pleasantly surprised by this game. The game looks better than I expected,\
      \ had an interesting story, and difficult puzzles that kept me in to the game.\
      \ While this style of game may not be everyone\u2019s favorite, for those who\
      \ do enjoy it this game comes highly recommended. Even those who are not as\
      \ interested in the genre should check this game out, and will probably enjoy\
      \ it like I did.\u201D<br>PoisonKiwi<br><br>\u201COverall Sea of Darkness was\
      \ an enjoyable game, especially if you enjoy \u201Cbrain teaser\u201D puzzles\
      \ that are more challenging than what\u2019s found in today\u2019s casual games.\u201D\

    review: Love the town, love the ship; this is just a really cool idea to include
      in the series. Now, maybe I'm a dumbass, but there was a LONG period where I
      was left in the town all by myself and I couldn't for the life of me figure
      out what I needed to do (thank goodness for walkthroughs!), but overall I think
      the puzzles were reasonably difficult. Ooh, and Ned! Lol, I've been seeing lately
      what a terrible gf Nancy can be (hanging up on Ned, interrupting, blowing him
      off, etc), but in this game she really takes the cake! If you've been following
      their relationship through the games like I have, this one's a real treat!
