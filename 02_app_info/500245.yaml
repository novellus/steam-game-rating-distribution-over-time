    about_the_game: "Built to serve the quieter communities of Germany, the DB BR\
      \ 642 upholds the high standard of comfort and reliability expected from the\
      \ \u2018Desiro\u2019 family of multiple units. Courtesy of Partner Programme\
      \ developer RSSLO, the BR 642 is ready for virtual service and is packed with\
      \ advanced features.<br><br>Near the turn of the 21st Century, Deutsche Bahn\
      \ needed a brand-new fleet of diesel multiple units, that could both provide\
      \ quick acceleration and braking, to improve journey times, and be accessible,\
      \ and adaptable, to fit in with the already-thriving German railway network.\
      \ DB turned to Siemens, who\u2019s \u2018Desiro Classic\u2019 family featured\
      \ many ideals that would suit the operator\u2019s needs.<br><br>The Desiro Classic\
      \ was available as either a DMU or EMU, and could consist of anything between\
      \ 2 and 6 cars, to comply with their customer\u2019s requirements. As the new\
      \ German unit was destined to spend its life on quieter lines, where total electrification\
      \ was not guaranteed, DB opted for a 2-car DMU variant (as did many other operators\
      \ in Europe and beyond) and classified them as the DB BR 642.<br><br>Each car\
      \ featured a low floor, providing step-free access from platform to train. From\
      \ there, one car would be fitted with first class seating, and the other a multi-purpose\
      \ area, where the W/C and wheelchair facilities were situated. Both cars shared\
      \ a common bogie, this articulated design was not only safer, but reduced the\
      \ overall noise and drag produced by the DB BR 642 when in motion. With a diesel\
      \ engine under the floor, behind each cab, the DB BR 642 can quickly get up\
      \ to its top speed of 120 km/h, and effective braking can ensure a rapid yet\
      \ gentle stop, every time.<br><br>Since entering service in 2000, the DB BR\
      \ 642 fleet as steadily grown to 234, and can be found darting around the smaller\
      \ communities surrounding cities such as Augsburg, Dresden and Leipzig. In most\
      \ cases, only a single unit is used in service, although as many as 3 can be\
      \ coupled to form a 6-car set for busier times. DB wanted their BR 642s to be\
      \ compatible with other manufacturer\u2019s DMUs, however many software concerns\
      \ hindered that plan, and today, the BR 642 fleet is only mechanically compatible\
