    review: Obviously hard to call this a game or me a player.  I use it as a serious
      tool in photo collage.  Overall, I like it quite well.  Most of the other art
      software I use have user set function keys ... f3 allows me to bring in additional
      photos.  A bit distracting when "out of habit" I blindly punch f3 and then have
      to recover from the mess I made.  Would be nice to have other shapes, such as
      stars, ovals, rectangles, et al.  I export to another program for text but think
      a text option with base features of shadow, bevel, and so on could make this
      a stand alone program for some applications for me.  Overall however, it is
      a mainstay in my resources.
