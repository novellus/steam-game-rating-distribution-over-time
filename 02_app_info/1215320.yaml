      /><br>What happens when an Evil genius gets their hands on Professor Matrix's
      Piczle dust? Bedlam, is what! Piczle-powered metal menace under_SCORE is sent
      out to turn the whole world into black and white pixels. It is up to our heroes,
      Score-chan and Gig, to piece everything back together again. <br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1215320/extras/agif_3screens.gif?t=1587045457"
      /><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1215320/extras/header_adventure.png?t=1587045457"
      /><br>Travel around the world of Piczleshire to undo under_SCORE's mayhem. Solve
      nonogram logic-puzzles to recreate everything she has previously destroyed and
      rebuild the world. Find secrets, follow trails, confront Evil geniuses in this
      heart-warming epic saga of pixelated destruction.  <br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1215320/extras/agif_areas.gif?t=1587045457"

      /><br>You control Piczle stalwart Score-chan and hapless sidekick Gig, back
      again as heroes of this great adventure. Help professor Matrix and his lazy
      cat Dbug figure out who is behind that metal malcontent under_SCORE, who for
      plot-related reasons bears a striking resemblance to our very own Score-chan.
      Who is behind this monochromatic trail of destruction? How can they be stopped?
      Will there be pizza? That, dear reader, is called a plot, and this game is stuffed
      to the hilt with it.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1215320/extras/agif_characters1.gif?t=1587045457"
