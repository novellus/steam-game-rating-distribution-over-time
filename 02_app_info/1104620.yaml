    review: I teleport from spot to spot and shoot at the same recycled enemy who
      make the same recycled sounds with guns that pointed in a weird direction. This
      here is what I would call a demo waiting for feedback on the developing concepts
      and environments... NOT a full game that is for sale, EA or not.  Its getting
      really hard to support EA with titles like this floating around.
