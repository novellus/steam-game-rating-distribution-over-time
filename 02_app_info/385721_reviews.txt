If you're looking for a 1:1 remake of the original series, then this game isn't for you. However, if you want to play an excellent adventure game based on the characters of the original, then I highly recommend this game. The developers have managed to make an excellent retelling of the original King's Quest. This game does a great job at adding to the series as a whole.","timestamp_created":1592693653,"timestamp_updated":1592693653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44I/86fICc66cjwI="}
