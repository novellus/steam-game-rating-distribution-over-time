    review: 'For what you get...


      The music selection is very well made, and it could be applied to a number of
      character types, or even events or settings.


      The six pieces you get, in two different formats (wave files not included-likely
      deprecated but can be remade from the ogg files anyway with Audacity), are definitely
      high quality pieces, and are dynamic enough to be used in just about any genre
      of game setting, Victorian, Steampunk, Medieval, and so on.


      Question is not whether the pack is good, but if it is good for the price.


      $8 for six songs, by comparison to CD-length, and average length of songs on
      CD, you''re not getting your money''s worth because most of the songs are less
      than three minutes in length. Yes, I got this on sale, and at the sale price
      of about $1.60, would be equivalent to about a third of what I would pay full-price
      for what is on offer here (I appraise this asset pack to be a solid $5).


      So, do I recommend this?

      Absolutely, but get it on sale. It''s worth having, no doubt about it. The two
      other reviews for this pack are best ignored short of talking about the price
      being too high.'
