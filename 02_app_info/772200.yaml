    review: "[h1] The Metroidvania Review[/h1]\n\n[url=https://metroidvaniareview.com/2018/06/07/mortal-manor/]\
      \ Scored Summary[/url] |  |                          [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/30503887/]\
      \ Subscribe to our Curator\t[/url]\n\n[b]How Metroidvania is it?[/b]\nHigh Fit\
      \ \u2013 There\u2019s a vast castle to explore, with a dash of instant death\
      \ mechanics that makes it [i]feel[/i] a little closer to Ghosts and Goblins,\
      \ some of the harder Mega Man stages, or perhaps similar to the original Castlevania.\
      \ \n\n[url= https://steamcommunity.com/groups/MetroidvaniaReview/discussions/1/1735465524721253543/]\
      \ Want to hear a different opinion, or want to share your own review? Check\
      \ out our Forum here.[/url]\n\n[h1]Full Review[/h1]\nIn 2009 when Mega Man 9\
      \ first came out, I found myself stuck on Tornado Man\u2019s stage for a decent\
      \ amount of time. The stage's gimmicks included new platforming mechanics in\
      \ tandem with the usual death spikes and bottomless pits, meaning that an error\
      \ often sent you back to the last checkpoint to replay the section, or the whole\
      \ stage from the beginning when you ran out of lives. This made it pretty frustrating\
      \ for my first time through. However, Tornado Man\u2019s stage [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvjc12new0]\
      \ has one of the best soundtracks in the game[/url], and in the midst of my\
      \ frustrations my foot was always tapping to that 8-bit beat. Between that and\
      \ the always-charming Mega Man, with decades of nostalgia appearing on that\
      \ colorful blue screen, I found myself pumped to try again, and again, until\
      \ I got it right \u2013 until I got to taste that sweet satisfaction of wiping\
      \ that smug half-grin off of Tornado Man\u2019s face.\n \nMortal Manor is a\
      \ similarly challenging game \u2013 a Metroidvania with death spikes that can\
      \ wipe out all of your progress \u2013 but it has none of Mega Man's style to\
      \ temper the frustration. \n\nDon't get me wrong. Mortal Manor has a lot going\
      \ for it. I was impressed by its modest 14MB offering from the outset. The controls\
      \ are tight and responsive, and enemies are designed well enough to make every\
      \ mistake feel like it was my fault, not because of some unfair telegraphing\
      \ or other RNG factor. It emulates the perfect formula for that hard but fair\
      \ feeling of achievement.  It\u2019s created a bit of a cognitive dissonance\
      \ for me though. I\u2019ve always been an advocate of mechanics and level design\
      \ being the primary force that makes a game great. Graphics, music, and general\
      \ presentation are secondary to a tightly woven challenge or well-constructed\
      \ narrative \u2013 with narrative being somewhat optional because it is, after\
      \ all, a video game. Mortal Manor presented to me the first game I\u2019ve played\
      \ that was purely substance over style. Style is something that is completely\
      \ subjective \u2013 I\u2019m sure that some people will dig the graphics and\
      \ sound of Mortal Manor. But the graphics and sound did absolutely nothing for\
      \ me. It was so much not to my tastes, I had to turn the music off. I was experiencing\
      \ real physical pain after hours of hearing the same shrill sounds. \n\nThus,\
      \ my primary reason for pushing through the game was my sense of integrity as\
      \ a reviewer; that I had to beat the game before forming an opinion on it. This\
      \ isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve forced myself through a difficult game,\
      \ that I wasn\u2019t enjoying, just for the sake of reviewing it. And experience\
      \ has taught me that trials very often reap great rewards, even in video games.\
      \ But I can\u2019t honestly say that pushing through Mortal Manor was worth\
      \ it. I\u2019ll try to explain my reasons. \n\nOn the subject of \u201CSubstance\
      \ over Style\u201D, there\u2019s one matter of substance that I feel Mortal\
      \ Manor fails significantly on; it has a great introduction to its story, but\
      \ the game as a whole does little to hold up that narrative promise. Digging\
      \ deeper into its locales reveals monsters named \u201CFlying Monster\u201D\
      , bosses named \u201CFailed Genetic Experiment named Robert\u201D, and other\
      \ similarly bland, generic enemies. The first boss that you\u2019ll likely face\
      \ is a giant frog of no real significance, and the final boss, while something\
      \ that I could have predicted, similarly doesn\u2019t seem to have any \u201C\
      substance\u201D to him other than an \u201CX\u201D marking the game end point.\
      \ I try not to compare everything to Hollow Knight because I don\u2019t think\
      \ it\u2019s fair, but Hollow Knight is a great example of Mortal Manor\u2019\
      s opposite in this regard. Hollow Knight takes [i]every opportunity[/i] to use\
      \ its environment to tell a story, creating a rich world that I wanted to see\
      \ more of. Mortal Manor's world was boring simply because it makes no effort\
      \ to do the same. \n\nFurthermore, and unfortunately, the gameplay that I\u2019\
      ve praised up until this point started to feel the same way, boring. According\
      \ to my map, I only completed 45% of the castle by the time I had made my way\
      \ to the final boss and saw the \u201CIncomplete Ending\u201D according to my\
      \ achievement. Even with the worst Metroidvanias I\u2019ve played, I felt some\
      \ compulsion to keep exploring \u2013 to keep discovering. After a fleeting\
      \ moment of satisfaction after the \"Git gud\" phase at the beginning of the\
      \ game,  I lost that compulsion to explore with Mortal Manor completely. I got\
      \ tired of seeing the same fireball spitting eyeball tower in every biome I\
      \ entered. I was tired of whacking the same kind of skeltin over and over. Even\
      \ the boss mechanics showed little creativity; the first frog boss alternated\
      \ between a single shot directed at the hero and a spreadshot in 8 directions,\
      \ which is similar to the pattern the final boss uses. I started to get a feeling\
      \ that the game\u2019s quality was being trumped by a desire for quantity. This\
      \ lack of variety is exacerbated by the instant death mechanics. \n\nI actually\
      \ was pondering about Metroidvania game design shortly before I started playing\
      \ this game \u2013 wondering if Instant Death has a place in the genre. Salt\
      \ & Sanctuary gets away with it, as does La Mulana with its \u201CWelcome to\
      \ La Mulana\u201D achievements. It\u2019s pretty popular today to compare difficult\
      \ games to Dark Souls, so let\u2019s do that. In the original Dark Souls, if\
      \ you die, you lose absolutely nothing; except the souls you are carrying. I\
      \ know some people focus on the soul loss, but you get to keep any items you\
      \ picked up before dying, any shortcuts you activated stay that way, any enemies\
      \ that are programmed not to respawn stay dead, and you don\u2019t even technically\
      \ lose the souls permanently; you can go back and retrieve them. In Mortal Manor\
      \ you lose [i]everything[/i] since your last save point when you die. This is\
      \ the same as Super Metroid or Symphony of the Night, but neither of those games\
      \ had instant death mechanics. The aforementioned Mega Man is also similar,\
      \ but Mega Man has about 2-5 hours worth of extremely linear gameplay, tightly\
      \ designed for a one-way experience. I lost everything when I died in Mortal\
      \ Manor, but I seriously questioned whether it was worth going back to re-explore\
      \ the parts that I lost. I think the ultimate result is a game with a broken\
      \ identity. It wants to be both a linear-like challenge and a Metroidvania,\
      \ but it\u2019s missing the complimentary mechanics to be truly good at either.\
      \ I think it would have done well to take a page or two from Dark Souls/Hollow\
      \ Knight/Salt and Sanctuary, or even Axiom Verge \u2013 just changing the death\
      \ mechanics would help a lot. \n\nTechnically though, you can play on Easy Mode\
      \ and remove the Instant Death in favor of near-mortal injury. Once you beat\
      \ the game, you can customize a LOT in New Game+ to perhaps rectify any gripes\
      \ you might have. If you just like having room after room to check off, Mortal\
      \ Manor is a meaty package. It even has a randomizer mode if you want to keep\
      \ it going forever. Mortal Manor has a lot going for it, and if anything on\
      \ its store page looks appealing to you it has more substance than some of the\
      \ other games I\u2019ve played. \n\nBut if you take one look at its screenshots\
      \ and find it unappealing, I can't promise you a hidden gem hidden behind its\
      \ production values. \n\n2.5 out of 5"
