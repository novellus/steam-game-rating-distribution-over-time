    review: "Well, I would need a good/bad button for this game. \nI was bored and\
      \ liked something about the art even if it's no masterpiece.\n\nIt isn't really\
      \ much, just a map full of stuff to collect in more or less a certain order,\
      \ unlocking those adult scenes rather quickly and some more or less unfair boss\
      \ fights.\n\nAfter I figured out that I could switch out monsters mid fight\
      \ and some other little stuff, it worked well enough.\n\nI can't exactly suggest\
      \ this game to others, but I also don't want to give it a 0/10.  I would say\
      \ it really depens on if the character art does something for you.\n"
