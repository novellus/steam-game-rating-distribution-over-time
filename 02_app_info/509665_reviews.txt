Too many flourishes?\nNot quite used to moving all over the fretboard?\nAre you looking for a song that will boost your confidence? \nLook no further!\n\nThis DLC is perfect for the player who is a little down that they're having issues learning some of the more 'advanced' techniques. In this track requires you to use 2 strings and move about 5 spaces on the fret board. At its most intense, you'll need to strum twice a second (if that). It's rather tame. Additionaly you'll get some practice muting the strings.\n\nThat's it, that's all there is for this track. It's rather simple, but your part in the song is very pronouced compared to some other tracks. This makes is much easier to hear how you're doing once you start to memorize the track.\n\nAll in all it's a simple track that can provide you a little mastery in a song. A top pick for bass newbies getting into the game for sure.","timestamp_created":1519146798,"timestamp_updated":1519146798,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565195322036743164","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu5GN2uECdcbImQE="}
