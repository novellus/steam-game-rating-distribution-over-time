      benchmark. <br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>See if your PC meets the performance
      requirements for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.<br></li><li>Test your PC with three
      VR benchmark tests, headset not required.<br></li><li>Or connect an HMD and
      judge the VR experience with your own eyes.<br></li><li>Detailed results and
      hardware monitoring charts.<br></li><li>Explore each scene in VR or on your
      monitor with Experience mode.</li></ul><br><strong>Try before you buy</strong><br><br>The
      performance requirements for VR games are much higher than for typical PC games.
      So before you buy an HTC Vive or Oculus Rift, use VRMark to see whether your
      PC has what it takes to deliver a great VR experience. <br><br>VRMark includes
      three benchmark tests that run on your desktop monitor, no headset required.
      Or connect an HMD and see for yourself with the free-roaming Experience mode.<br><br><strong>Orange
      Room benchmark</strong><br><br>The VRMark Orange Room benchmark shows the impressive
      level of detail that can be achieved on a PC that meets the recommended minimum
      hardware requirements for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. If your PC passes this test,
      it's ready for the two most popular VR systems available today.<br><br><strong>Cyan
      Room benchmark</strong><br><br>The Cyan Room benchmark is a DirectX 12 benchmark
      test for VR. It features a large, complex environment and many eye-catching
      effects. With its pure DirectX 12 engine, Cyan Room shows how using an API with
      less overhead can help developers deliver impressive VR experiences even on
      modest PC systems. Cyan Room requires Windows 10 (64-bit) and a GPU that supports
      DirectX 12.<br><br><strong>Blue Room benchmark</strong><br><br>The Blue Room
      is a much more demanding test, ideal for benchmarking the latest graphics cards.
      With its massive 5K rendering resolution and spectacular volumetric lighting
      effects, the Blue Room sets the bar for future hardware generations.<br><br><strong>Results
      and reporting</strong><br><br>After running each test, you'll see clearly whether
      your PC has passed or not. You'll get an overall score for your PC, which you
      can use to compare systems, and detailed charts showing how your PC performed
      during the test.<br><br><strong>Experience mode</strong><br><br>VR headsets
      use clever techniques to compensate for missed frames. With Experience mode,
      you can judge the quality of the VR experience with your own eyes. Explore each
      scene in your own time in VR or on your monitor.
