    review: "It was a fun game where you run over pumpkins in all the levels and then\
      \ you play them in reverse. If you play all the maps you will probably be able\
      \ to get all of the achievements and take a couple more minutes to find the\
      \ golden treasure. The driving is a tad slippery BUT you get the hang of it\
      \ after a race or two. The game looks & sounds great, going through the woods\
      \ and a cemetery will definitely get you into the Halloween spirit. \n\nHere\
      \ is my play through and all the achievements if you are having trouble:\n\n\
