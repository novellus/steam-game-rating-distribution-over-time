You can get the feeling that the dev put a lot of time and passion into this game and to get it right. \n\nBugs:\nI encountered one bug while playing and that was that the flashlight would not turn on again if I turned it off and tabbed out of the window, however. I am sure that's something he will fix with his next game. \n\nGraphics: \nGraphics were nice but could be a bit over glancy (IMO, I am not sure if that's even a word.) for my taste. Some of the areas were way too dark and they could be a bit brighter. \n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay was straight forward, walking and interacting with things in the game. The dev even puts in a few hidden surprises into the gameplay that I honestly didn't expect.\n\nStory:\nFrom what I understood the story/campaign was an about a guy named master (you) and it was about him waking up after something had happened to him (I'll try not to spoil) and it's about him going around trying to understand what happened to him, you also collect these little logs that you can read and that gives you even better understanding in what's going on. I sadly did not read most of the logs, so I probably missed half the story here. But without spoiling anything, you will soon realize what happened to the master (you) and what he has been up to down in his lab. (spoiler alert; it has not been pretty). I know there will be a sequel, so let's hope it expands on this.\n\nLore:\nThe game has a lore and it's probably very deep and engaging, I am sadly not that huge into lores (except with a little bit of halo) \n\nVerdict:\nYou can feel the that the dev put a lot of time, passion and effort into this game and it's a good game. The game made me chuckle a couple of times and did some stuff that I honestly did not expect and that's always a warm welcome. The campaign was good, but a bit short, and I know there's much more to this game. \nThe lore is probably very deep. I most likely have to play thru it again and it read the logs to get the full picture. \n\nI would recommend this to people that love lore and reading.\n\nI rate games like this: Don't buy. Wait. buy.\n\nI am not sure if I would rate this \"Wait\" or \"buy\" to be honest. There is a sequel coming, wait until that game gets closer and then buy it or wait after the sequel comes and then buy it to get a better understand of what's going on.","timestamp_created":1552346157,"timestamp_updated":1552346454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510204076766967773","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/+LDt+kCfIjuvAE="}
