      the sudden death of their mother, are set to leave the city to go back to their
      childhood hometown to live with their aunt, Shino. Initially leaving their hometown
      of Hibarigasaki was difficult for You, as he was close friends with a girl who
      he saw nearly every day after school at the local town lookout. When she discovered
      that You would be leaving the town, she made him promise to return to marry
      her and left him with simply a kiss on the forehead to remember her by. <br><br>Once
      You returns to his hometown, he searches for that childhood friend, only to

      scythe and claims to be a Grim Reaper. Now back in his hometown, You starts
      to rebuild his life, making friends and continuing his search for the girl he
      made a promise to. Will he eventually find his promised love? Who is this mysterious
