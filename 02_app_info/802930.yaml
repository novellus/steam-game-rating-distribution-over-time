    review: "This is a fun, simple game that requires a little bit of skill in reflexes\
      \ to play. The idea of building up your fan base for your two person acting\
      \ troupe is cute, and collecting cards and getting check marks in Snail's hint\
      \ book were what really kept me playing this game before the story started to\
      \ kick in. It's a very small environment that you're playing in, and you spend\
      \ a lot of time playing the same mini games over and over to earn coins and\
      \ unlock new cards which can be pretty big cons if you don't really enjoy collecting\
      \ as a game concept. \n\nIt's a genuinely interesting little town so if you\
      \ like to talk to NPCs and complete collections, you'll like this game. There's\
      \ three ways you can put on performances, so when you get tired of one you have\
      \ two others you can switch too. There's also a card game and a shooting game\
      \ where you can simply earn money and not worry about putting your ideas in\
      \ order for a play.  I do want to note that I personally had a lot of trouble\
      \ getting the timing right for the singing performance, so in reality I only\
      \ had two options for putting on a performance. Again I don't know if this is\
      \ just me, or if the timing really is off for the singing performance. \n\n\
      Once you advance in the story, the plays become less about your reflexes and\
      \ more about solving puzzles to please certain audience members; to get them\
      \ to love your play and give you a new card, you have to put the proper cards\
      \ in the proper order when creating your play. As it turns out, I'm not that\
      \ great at putting the cards in the right order. I don't even have half of the\
      \ card collection and I'm already stuck in the game, unable to figure out how\
      \ to put on the right play even for audience members that only have one or two\
      \ requirements for loving your play. \n\nThough you can pay Snails for hints\
      \ on the proper cards, they won't tell you the proper order. Talking to audience\
      \ members doesn't necessarily reveal the order that they want the cards to be\
      \ in either. While some of the requests are easy enough to logically set up\
      \ into a proper story, some requests are so vague all you can do is just keep\
      \ making up different plays and hope one hits. Given how repetitive the mini\
      \ games are, it gets frustrating very quickly. I would like to keep playing\
      \ and finish what is honestly an interesting story, but no one has made a guide\
      \ for this game or done a complete play through, so there's no outside help\
      \ to get you past a part you're stuck on. \n\nSince I can't in good conscience\
      \ say this is a fault of the game, I still recommend it."
