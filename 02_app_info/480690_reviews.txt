If you want multiple genres of games, this is a MUST HAVE for general arcade fun.  The graphics and atmosphere are well done, you feel like a giant protecting the colonies below and around you.  The game starts at a good difficulty level of play that progresses quickly, but smoothly. Before you know it, you'll be swinging those plasma balls and shooting bombs like crazy! This is a FUN game,  Its a very well done VR adaptation of a game from my childhood, Missile Command.  Of the many ways this could be accomplished, the Devs put you right in the middle of the action!  The incoming mechs and scanners add to the difficulty and variety of enemies. The flying mechs in later missions are huge and beautifully textured and they glide by. it was hard to blow it as I was admiring the modeling!  Inbound puts you right in the middle of some intense ARCADE action that doesnt cost a pocket full of quarters to enjoy.    Well Recommended","timestamp_created":1551542444,"timestamp_updated":1551542444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/tvIn+kCfPuQvAE="}
