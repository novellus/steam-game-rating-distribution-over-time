    review: After I've read a review comparing the game with Turok on nintendo 64,
      yes I played it too in the 90th, I thought it could be good fun. Indeed my son
      and I are not disappointed, 10 hours and ongoing says everything. Hunting dinos
      in VR is definitely topping the 2D gaming from the past, tried the old game
      again and decided that's not working for us anymore.  However, the scenery is
      beautiful, love the jungle, the little alien like monsters jumping out of their
      eggs reminding me much on mini "Aliens", of course, and add great fun. Somehow
      one can't stop playing unless you die. Re-spawning is sometimes tricky, stand
      still don't move the headset or you easily hang in the glitch with no way out.  Graphics
      are great but my 1060 GTX has  a hard job to do. Not the games fault, just need
      to upgrade to a better card. That said, if you like great jungle landscape,
      dinos and aliens, sniper rifles and all kind of weapons which are getting better
      the more you play, then that's the game for you. Devs, you have created a fantastic
      scenery and game, only wished the day and night cycles would be a little longer,
      both look stunning though.
