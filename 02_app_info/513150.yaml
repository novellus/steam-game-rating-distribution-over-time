    review: 'More of an virtual advertisement for the movie than a real game.


      I had just seen the movie and thought I''d be able to play in that environment.
      It''s a lot of target practice.


      Trying to watch the trailer was choppy for me. I have an average rig, though.
      I''m still trying to understand why someone would want to see a movie with a
      headset on.'
