      \ of this game. I really wanted to create easy, but intense combat experience.\
      \ I was struggled with controls in 3D space games, so in this game you control\
      \ 3D spaceships in 2-dimensional space. This game would be perfect if you want\
      \ to relax and shoot some bad guys for a 15 minutes or so. But if you a hardcore\
      \ gamer, you can be interested in this game too. Fight for high score, unlock\
      \ every upgrade and be the very best. I really hope you will like this game!"
