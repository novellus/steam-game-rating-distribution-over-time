    about_the_game: 'Take command of a fleet of space warships tailored to your exact
      play-style.  Favor a small task group of robust, flexible multi-role combatants,
      a large group of specialized ships, or something in between.  Do battle in a
      heavily simulation-based tactical game featuring everything from kinetics and
      beam weapons to realistic radar and electronic warfare.  Nebulous seamlessly
      blends the thoughtfulness of pre-mission planning, tension of battle decision-making,
      pressure of real-time action, and pain of inevitable sacrifice into an intense
      tactical space game that will keep you reflecting on every decision (and mistake)
      for hours after each battle.<br><br>Skip the economy management: you''re here
      to dominate in battle.  Drop into the battlespace with your full fleet and carefully
      plan your moves.  Deep, methodical combat based on thrusts, withdrawals, and
      counter-thrusts keeps the tension ratcheted up without numbing you with a screen
      constantly full of explosions.  With no reinforcements coming, every hit hurts
      and every loss counts.  Victory favors thoughtful planning and precise execution.<br><br>It''s
      in your hands, Commodore.<h2 class="bb_tag">Control In-Depth</h2>Band-boxing
      your units and right clicking the enemy doesn''t fly here.  With small, intimate
      battles, we offer you unparalleled control of every unit right down to their
      individual mounts.  <br><br><br>Keep your entire fleet together, dynamically
      split off task units, or give each ship its own assignment.  Large maps with
      lots of cover and radar occlusion make methodical positioning and sight lines
      critical.  Massing firepower in one place is not always the best solution, as
      the enemy could come from any direction in the fully 3-dimensional battlespace.  Covering
      your retreat is always in order.<br><br>Group your weapons and task them to
      different targets or focus fire with everything you have.  Selecting the appropriate
      weapon to engage a target is as impactful as deciding which targets to engage
      at all.  Weapons have compounding benefits and drawbacks, all of which can be
      compensated for and planned against.<h2 class="bb_tag">Radar And E-War Simulation</h2>Intelligence
      is key to victory and your situational awareness is never a given. Use asteroids
      and gas clouds to obscure your ships from enemy sensor systems while illuminators
      and fire control radars mark targets and the enemy attempts to blind you with
      jammers. Occlusion, passive signal detection, and balancing radar signature
      size makes fighting for intel as vicious as firing missiles.<h2 class="bb_tag">Plan
      To Win</h2>All fleets are unique in Nebulous, and you won''t know what the enemy
      is bringing to the field until your first radar contact.  A point value system
      keeps fleet strength in balance, but you may spend half the battle (or more)
      trying to determine your adversary''s capabilities.<br><br><br>The built-in
      fleet editor allows players to build their fleet from a set of hulls, each with
      their own niche, and configure these hulls to vary their capabilities.  Each
      new ship is a blank canvas waiting for you to express your tactical identity.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Detailed Damage Model</h2>There are no healthbars; every ship
      is held together by its armor and its components.  All armor damage is positional,
      meaning hits to undamaged areas will face the full weight of the armor plating.  The
      armor protects the soft, critical interior components and the ship''s crew who
      will fight frantically to keep the ship operational.  Damage control teams will
      move from compartment to compartment, repairing damage where they can according
      to a module''s criticality and the player''s priorities.'
