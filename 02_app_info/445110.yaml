    review: 'Before I start this review, let me say: I have played this game for quite
      a while, and I''ve already beaten it twice over. I enjoyed the experience. However,
      I would not immediately recommend it.


      Tasty Planet is a deeply nostalgic game. It certainly harkens back to the era
      of old Flash games - the gradient shading on those nanobots is very 2005. I
      remember really enjoying the actual Flash game as a kid, so I was eager to pick
      this up and let the memories flow.


      First, the positives: this is a very soothing game. It''s less of a puzzle game
      and more of a zen tale of endless consumption. There is something implicitly
      satisfying about running over little things and watching them vanish beneath
      your smothering size, then running over even more things that you couldn''t
      before! The sense of progression is nicely baked right into the levels. However,
      there is one glaring flaw with this design philosophy: the core gameplay loop
      is repetitive as hell.


      The game does its best to mix things up, but for all the changes in scenery,
      the experience remains fundamentally the same throughout. Time and time again,
      my favorite levels have always been the ones where I can tear apart the scenery
      in the most satisfying way possible. These are most often the straightforward
      dinosaur levels, which... ironically, are also the most basic. Rome is the most
      glaring offender on the opposite end, since the buildings look identical and
      the ballistas are wretchedly annoying to pick out from between the city streets.
      Seriously, the "protect the ballista" level and the gladiator segments are disgustingly
      unfun.


      Much of the replay value in this game comes from trying to beat your best times
      in every level. However, this is quite difficult for a number of reasons, chief
      among them being the slippery controls. See, your goo has a set velocity no
      matter how large it is. This is less of an issue when the goo takes up, say,
      an inch of your screen, and you have adequate control. All''s well and all''s
      good. However, the main way levels are extended is by zooming out your goo,
      and that REALLY hinders the game whenever the game gets crazy with shrinking
      you down. Illusion of scale aside, things become a nightmare to control.


      No better place is this illustrated than in the space levels, where your speck
      of a blob goes flying across the screen at the slightest key press, all while
      you struggle to crash into pin-sized asteroids. Nowhere else have I had less
      fun (besides that godforsaken ballista level.) In fact, I''ve had the most success
      with these levels when I overclock my old computer to deliberately slow down
      the framerate, and that''s just not fun at all!


      Unfortunately, since most of the bonus levels are unlocked through speedrun
      rewards, it really screws over anyone who''s just here for the munching experience
      (i.e. me.)


      Overall, Tasty Planet is fun for an afternoon or two, but it''s distinctly lacking
      in the long-term value I was hoping for in such a unique game. I wish there
      were more levels where I could just tear through things all zen-like, y''know?
      If you played the original game just before the death of Flash, you''ll probably
      enjoy this, and it is only 6 bucks - but be aware that you get what you pay
      for.'
