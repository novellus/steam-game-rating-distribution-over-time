      contains 16 adventure levels plus 3 special levels, totaling 19 maps with different
      features for players to explore. On the way, players will go through forests,
      deserts, snowfields, gorges, etc., encounter different monsters, learn new skills,
      and defeat the ultimate enemy.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1509990/extras/02.gif?t=1609863956"
      /><br>You can collect crystals on the map and trade them for more powerful weapons
      to face more dangerous challenges. In addition, after rounds of battle, Kagura's
      level will increase, allowing her to perform more powerful attacks.<h2 class="bb_tag">Unbearably
      cute little creatures!</h2>These little bears and kittens are so cute that it's
      a shame you have to fight them in your dreams. But don't worry, no little creatures
      are harmed in these dreams.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1509990/extras/03.gif?t=1609863956"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Refreshing Music</h2>Each level is accompanied by relaxing
      music, which is different from the tense action games, and Kagura is only enjoyable
      along the way.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1509990/extras/04.gif?t=1609863956"
