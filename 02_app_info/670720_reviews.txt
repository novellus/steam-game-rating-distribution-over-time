You can explore 8 different levels filled with all sorts of fun mechanics, that challenge you to adapt and overcome your weaknesses as a gamer. No matter how good you are there will be at least 1 level that you get stuck on at some point but it makes it that much more satisfying when you finally conquer the level. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a game that's easy to learn but difficult to master. Plus there's online leaderboards for people who want to grind out best scores even after the game is done.","timestamp_created":1603319631,"timestamp_updated":1603319631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yYHTpvUCfNmpqQI="}
