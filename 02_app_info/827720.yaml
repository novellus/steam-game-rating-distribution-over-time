      \ in several prototypes built between 1987 and 1990, featuring a more powerful\
      \ engine, better Fire Control System and a Polish ERAWA explosive reactive armor\

    review: 'The devs have just announced that they intend to use deliberately unfair
      matchmaking to "allow for more comfortable gameplay" for people who purchase
      "Battle Hardened status" (previously just an economic bonus) for their vehicles
      with premium currency.


      Yes, they actually publicly announced pay-to-win matchmaking and they are trying
      to sell it as a feature.

      On a more personal note, I played Armored Warfare for more than 800 hours and
      then got banned from the forums after I made the mistake of pointing out the
      factual errors in an article which "Silent Stalker" (the community manager)
      presented as his own work.


      https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2126034055


      Here is the article which claims that the Rhenmetall 120 L55 (which South Korea
      builds under license) "is not a copy of the Rheinmetall design. It was developed
      indigenously by Hyundai in South Korea." (I didn''t say so in the forums but
      it seems very likely that at least part of the article was written by an absurdly
      patriotic Korean and NOT by Silent Stalker.)


      https://aw.my.games/en/news/general/black-panther


      After deleting the comments, Silent Stalker become hostile and then banned me
      for saying he should be more polite.


      https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2125956158


      I tried asking for help from the mods on Discord but when I asked "Soren" for
      help, he banned me from the AW discord and posted "Thanks for the feedback"
      as the reason for the ban.


      https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2127547497


      The Steam forum ban was then removed... from Steam by someone working for Valve...
      but I remain banned from the AW Discord after spending huge amounts of money
      on the game, starting my own clan, etc.


      So yeah, Steam is good but at least part of My.games is staffed by proud morons
      who treat their paying customers like dirt... sad to see a potentially good
      game in such hands.'
