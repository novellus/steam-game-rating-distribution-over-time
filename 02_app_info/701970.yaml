    review: i got bored of it pretty quickly but that was just me.... this game is
      basically traffic jam, ingame its just one background, one song, and the game
      board. The only impressive part is the amount of levels in this game which i
      think the creator spent all there time on. So basically if your a fan of puzzle
      games to a point where your used to monotomy this would actually be a great
      choice, just dont expect any surprises.
