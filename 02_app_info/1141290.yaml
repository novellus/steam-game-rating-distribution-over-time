    reviews: "\u201CNot only is each tower a puzzle contained unto itself, but there's\
      \ the added factor that when you improve your scores in the individual towers,\
      \ you earn medals which can then be spent to make your character stronger in\
      \ ANY of the towers, contributing to a &quot;meta game&quot;. So the idea is\
      \ once you've gone through those twelve towers once and earned twelve medals,\
      \ you can then go back and replay all of them to earn even BETTER medals, then\
      \ go through them all again, so on and so forth, forever. (Some towers you can't\
      \ really &quot;finish&quot; until you come back with tons of medals. Ten medals\

    review: A puzzle game for game designers and math freaks. Definitely niche, but
      absolutely the best of its kind. The variety in puzzle setups and mechanics
      set it apart from Tower of the Sorcerer or DROD RPG.
