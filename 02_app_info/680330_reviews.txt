Needless to say, I was disappointed by my purchase of this game.\n\nFor starters \"Is the game fun?\" Yes, it can be. Would I recommend buying it? Based on my experience, no, you shouldn't. At least not until some of the game's quirks are ironed out.\n\nGraphically speaking, it's okay, I've seen better by Unity's standard, it runs good enough on most rigs. The combat does have it's moments (but I will talk about that in a bit). Level design is about on par with what I expect from Indie developers, but there are a couple questionable choices.\n\nStory wise, there really isn't any. Your a prisoner, and you need to escape and can pretty much be beaten in under 4 hours, hell even 2. There are a couple of different modes to try out, and cheats that you can play with in the game after you unlock them.\n\nBut truthfully speaking, there's not a lot in here, and what little there is definitely needs some polish.\n\nOne of my biggest cons with this game is it's combat system. The combat system, does require a tad bit of skill to learn. The gist of it is you can swing your weapon in 4 different directions, left, right, thrust, and down (Overhead), kick, and blunt strike. For defensive options you have block, and dodge (pretty standard), however there is a limited amount of physics in the game, so there will be times when your weapon collides with another's and can cause an attack to bounce.\n\nThat being said, the amount of times I've died due to some bullsh*t reason is part of why I can't reccomend this game. It's not my lack of skill, but rather the inconsistent damage output by the game. For example I could swing my sword at a guard who has inferior weapons and gear to me, and it takes me 4-5 hits, but he can swing his sword, and 1 shot me when I have full health, better weapons, and gear to boot. Or the times when the enemy stun locks me, or hits me 2 times and all my health is gone, but for some reason, I'm essentially tickling him with my weapon.\n\nEnemy variety is extremely lacking. there are guards wearing different color tabbards, but you'll only be facing 1 or 2 enemies at any given time, and 3 at the end of the game. They usually carry the same or weaker type of weapons than you do, but it won't matter because they can still 1-shot you, while your stabbing them with a butter knife.\n\nThe AI, is completely brain dead, at least for the companions you can recruit across the levels. When you kill one of the enemies, the AI will stop whatever it's doing, run over to the body, steal all the gear before you can even grab it, and then stand there like nothing. Or in other instances, they will walk right in front of your sword swing and you'll end up killing them instead of the guy your trying to fight. In multiple instances, I could have my companions tricked out with the best gear I can find, and then they run over to the body of a dead guard, take and equip the shield for some god da*n reason, and then I have to change it back.\n\nthe \"Stealth\" mechanics in this game are laughable at best, and never worked in my experience. There will have been times when I'm trying to sneak and the enemy spots me almost immediately even when I'm making no noise whatsoever, and there have also been times when I've ran right up to an enemy and they didn't notice me until I smacked them with my sword.\n\nThe money you find in the prison, can't even be used for anything, except for an achievement, so really don't bother. Or there will be times when Items are straight up removed from your inventory for no reason. I had 4 health potions, a long sword, and a short sword, I start the second level, all my health potions gone, my swords, gone and even some of my equipment, gone. In my first playthrough as I was trying to get all of Jarren's equipment, most of the stuff I had just disappeared at the start of next level, making it impossible to get.\n\nThen the \"Rogue-like\" elements are more or less just a couple of pre-rendered hallways and such, copy pasted through out the 2-3 hour treck you have to endure. Not to mention, there is one type of hallway that you just simply can't walk up, because of how steep the geometry is. That means you have to jump it, and since any AI is basically retarded, they don't know how to jump up, or even navigate the steps themselves.\n\nOverall, don't buy this game as is, wait until it's on sale, or if more content is added.","timestamp_created":1606100052,"timestamp_updated":1606100052,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1606378494,"developer_response":"Hi Ardyn, thanks for your honest and detailed review and I'm sorry about the issues you've encountered.\n\nIf you have the time I'd ask you to please make a zip file with your savegames and game log files so that I can look into the issues you had. You'll find them by navigating to the Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Elium - Prison Escape folder. Just pack the contents of the Saves folder and also the contents of the UDKGame\\Logs folder, Then send the zip file to support@eliumgame.com\n\nNormally an enemy with inferior gear shouldn't take that many hits to kill. It's possible that you're only hitting them with the tip of the blade due to not being close enough, or just hitting non vulnerable body parts. However it might be possible that some of the balancing might not be working correctly, or some of the gear not working correctly. With your save file I probably can pinpoint the issue.\n\nThe lost gear after a level transition is definitely a bug, and one that was supposedly fixed in a previous patch. Seems there's traces of it unfortunately. Getting your save file would be crucial here as well, especially if you could indicate the save name where it showed up.\n\nLastly about the steep geometry, none of the hallways are designed to prevent the AI from climbing so it's again a bug. It might either be the pathfinding being unable to climb (if the stairs were in the middle of a hallway) or the dungeon generator incorrectly stitching the room and the hallway (if the stairs were near a door). If it's the former case a screenshot would be of great help, if the latter the log files would help me find the faulty stitched room hallway.\n\nI hope you can find the time to provide the files to lend a hand into fixing these problems, and sorry again for these faults that prevent from enjoying the game."}],"cursor":"AoJwgr3B+fUCdKL/rwI="}
