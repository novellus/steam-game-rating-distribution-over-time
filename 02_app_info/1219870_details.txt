With PC and VR cross-platform gameplay, players can team up to explore ruins, fight side by side, build camps, and ultimately, save the world. Enjoy an immersive gaming experience full of surprises.

To give the music a unique Nostos quality, Kevin creatively integrated a flute quartet into the orchestra. The resulting music is unique and a perfect fit for the oriental and colorful world of Nostos. At the same time, the flute quartet sometimes plays in harmony and sometimes out of harmony, accurately portraying the sense of multiplayer interaction in Nostos.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe album features music from the game Nosto. In it, you can hear sweet murmurs of the land's native language, the sounds of days turning to nights, the struggle for survival and ideals under turbulent weather, and the long and deep breath of the land.","about_the_game":"The Nostos OST is produced by renowned music producer, Kevin Penkin of Made in Abyss fame, with lyrics by Emi Evans, who wrote and recorded the theme for NieR:Automata.
