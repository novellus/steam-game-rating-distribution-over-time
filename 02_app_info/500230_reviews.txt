You can access to 6 missions that are for ILS(+Little VFR) landing practice. It could be easy(NOT FOR ME), you set Mouse Yoke and shaking your mouse-hand really busy, while rolling mouse wheel crazily to adjust speed. In this way, you can feel X, Y, Z movement visually, coming to your mind. Every mission is short, as this DLC aims in landing procedure(not much detailed) and I agree that there are not many missions available, but this could be the good way to practice landing, if you like to practice 'manual' landing in critically low visibility situations, not automatic. The only problem is, I don't think this DLC is well worth the 100% price, even in 50%. If I could learn something useful in instrument landing, such as setting localizer frequency or engaging auto landing..","timestamp_created":1535264058,"timestamp_updated":1605700574,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495412856340408325","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws8vN7fUCfJmnqQE="}
