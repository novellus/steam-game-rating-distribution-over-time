As other reviewers have said it's not really one of great depth and once you've got the hang of spamming archers then most levels are straightforward.\n\nThis is also a simple game to get \"perfect game\" with 15 do-able achievements and a useful guide to getting them all is on the community page. Took me under 4 hours play time to complete and get perfect game.\n\nMy one annoyance with this game is the game board doesn't quite fit on one screen and the scrolling is clunky.","timestamp_created":1526853185,"timestamp_updated":1526853185,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43tXiv+MCcuTkoAE="}
