    review: 'Finishing this as soon as I bought the game. Once again, another good
      Visual Novel developed by Afterthought Studios.


      The art for this VN is good and really simple. The atmosphere formed when it
      is combined with the gentle and relaxing BGM at certain scenes is just great.
      I find myself lost listening to the BGM and forgetting to press "Next" until
      the text changed due to auto-forward. During the serious scenes, the BGM is
      nicely matched as well.


      The character interactions between Engel and his Guardian Angel are funny and
      I like it.


      Story wise is good, to see the thought process of Engel and the choices he makes
      in the progress of the story. It is definitely much better to read it again
      in New Game+! Definitely worth getting there along with the twist.


      No doubt this being a good VN, there are a couple of minor flaws in the game
      but that does not hinder me and my experience being positive.


      Giving this a 7.5/10!


      Do get this game and play it'
