Ship positioning is good and intuitive but selecting special abilities feels odd. Camera control bad to non-existing: you can only move up or down or wonky-teleport, making it impossible to play in standing area only. For example, some ships got catapulted *really* far away, probably due to a physics bug, and I was unable to reach them because they were located past the walls of my room.\n\nThere is also no menu or options to leave a mission. I don't get it, the VR controllers have a dozen buttons or so on them and displaying a menu on top of them is de-facto standard. This would solve all issues.\n\nThere are a 100 missions in this game and they seem well designed. However, this is more of a tactical puzzle game with only 2-5 ships per side. No campaign or similar.","timestamp_created":1609012252,"timestamp_updated":1609012252,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1tGm0PYCf8K/vQI="}
