    review: 'Was it worth $10? Absolutely not.


      Is it worth $1.80? Maybe, depending on who you are.


      If you are expecting a true garden simulator or a game with an interesting story,
      then you will be quite disappointed on both counts I''m afraid. However, if
      you are one of those people who likes to take the barest hints of story and
      setting and weave your own tale from them then there''s hope. I don''t know
      if there''s a way to win this game or not yet, though I am attempting to find
      out. There''s a story mode and an endless mode which implies that the story
      mode does reach a conclusion at some point. For me, the true entertainment in
      this game came from figuring out how to cheat the system in humorous ways. For
      example, in order to progress in the game you have to continue to buy and send
      bowls of fruit to the village. In order to do that you must make money. In order
      to do that you must grow fruit. In order to do that you must either continuously
      hit a wooden platform with a pair of mallets (I''m telling you this because
      the game doesn''t, so you''re welcome one person who''s ever going to read this
      review), or buy an auto clicker to click the platform for you (at a much slower
      rate than you can do it yourself). It''s simple enough until you realize that
      inflation is no joke in this village''s economy. That''s when you either fail
      repeatedly, wave your arms until they fall off and still fail repeatedly, or
      start discovering the way to cheat the system. Turns out, you can attach as
      many planters as you want to one auto-clicker as long as the planters aren''t
      touching one another. This makes it unnecessary to grow any fruit yourself and
      you can pretty much just sit at the bottom of your cave doing nothing but occasionally
      buying absurdly overpriced fruit bowls until you feel like you''ve got your
      money''s worth of this game.


      The voice actor for the guy who drops you little updates over the intercom is
      pretty good so if you''ve read the essay above and are still eager to save an
      entire village from starvation singlehandedly by simply waving your hands like
      a madwoman for a couple minutes and then just sitting on your ass then, by all
      means spend your money!'
