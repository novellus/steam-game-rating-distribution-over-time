    about_the_game: "Avalon is dying. King Arthur is long gone, and Knights of the\
      \ Round Table are in disarray. Guardian Menhirs, the only thing that makes it\
      \ possible for humans to survive in this remote land, are going dark. Your village\
      \ chose its best and brightest and sent them on an epic quest to reach Kamelot,\
      \ find the Grail, and save the land.<br><br>You were not among them.<br><br>They\u2019\
      ve never returned, and now it\u2019s your turn to lead a band of unlikely heroes,\
      \ the only ones this land can still provide. These ordinary people set off far\
      \ too late, under-equipped for the task ahead, and with little hope of success.<br><br>Tainted\
      \ Grail is a dark fantasy open-world RPG with fresh turn-based exploration and\
      \ combat. It is based around deep, immersive story from one of the best and\
      \ most innovative board games (biggest Kickstarter project of 2018!), but introduces\
      \ a whole new experience crafted directly for PC.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EVERY\
      \ DECISION MATTERS</h2>Tainted Grail is a deeply immersive experience that takes\
      \ the best elements of RPG adventures and brings them to the next level through\
      \ intricately branching storylines. Written by Krzysztof Piskorski, one of the\
      \ best Polish fantasy writers, it will draw you right in and keep you engaged,\
      \ surprised, and invested in many secrets of Avalon.<br><br>In this dying world,\
      \ no decision is easy or morally obvious, and you will often face impossible\
      \ choices. Other times, the consequences of seemingly minor actions will haunt\
      \ you in the least expected moments. In the end, your impact on Avalon is going\
      \ reverberate through deep, meaningful changes to the game world - entire towns\
      \ will raise or fall, land will shatter, ancient powers will be restored, or\
      \ broken forever.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORE THE UNKNOWN</h2>A major part of\
      \ the game involves expeditions into the land covered by the Wyrdness, an ancient\
      \ force twisting people, creatures, and even space itself in all manner of ways\
      \ .There will be plenty of enemies and weird, unexpected events waiting for\
      \ you. While dangerous, exploration will be the only way to gather precious\
      \ resources and, ultimately, to figure out what is happening to Avalon and if\
      \ it can be stopped.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STRATEGIC COMBAT</h2>During combat,\
      \ you will decide between using skills specific for your hero and figuring out\
      \ the best possible combinations to do it. Every hero will bring a different\
      \ playstyle, defined by unique skills, that you will continue to further develop\
      \ based on your favorite tactic. You will supplement this rich toolset with\
      \ various items and special moves. All of that makes every encounter a different\
      \ and exciting tactical challenge!"
