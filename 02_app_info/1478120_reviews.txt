Sure it looks really great but it just seems to be a straight port over from x-plane without any finesse for Aerofly, The main Killer being the roll point seems to be on the gunpod instead of in the centre of the wings where it should be which makes aerobatic rolls look very off.... secondly the sound as also mentioned in these reviews... \n\nThe Devs should definitely spend some more time on this to fix what should be a really simple issue as I really would think that hawk would be a great aircraft In aerofly if done properly!","timestamp_created":1609924660,"timestamp_updated":1609924660,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwspm/6/YCecr5wAI="}
