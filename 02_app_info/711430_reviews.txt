Fans will appreciate the attention to detail, from the quirky animation of the opening jazz sequence to the witty repartee between the beloved characters. Being able to dress Miss Fisher (always divine in her 1920s get-ups) was an unexpected delight. For non-fans, this is also an enjoyable, low-stress adventure game with a compelling story and item-search elements. If a third season is created (as I very much hope), there is room to improve the function whereby Phryne puts clues together in order to deduct a solution - the combinations are not always the most logically linked.","timestamp_created":1606490974,"timestamp_updated":1606490974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw89yUhfYCe8HUswI="}
