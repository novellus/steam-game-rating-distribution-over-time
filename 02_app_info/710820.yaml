    developer_response: "Hi Corbo,\n\nthank you very much for complimenting our music\
      \ :-) \n\nalso thanks for your detailed (yet negative) review.\n\nHaving you\
      \ spent some time in pondering it, we feel we owe you some explanations:\n\n\
      - we were careful not to put in scene 'minuscule' objects. However we based\
      \ our perception on PCs, the natural environment for our game. it is possible\
      \ that other devices vehicle other kind of feelings \n- we choose not to put\
      \ hot spots because we wanted to reproduce the immersion feeling of old and\
      \ classic adventure games without rushing the user past simplified enigmas,\
      \ with the only exception of timed ones.\n- there are only a couple of timed\
      \ enigmas. Again, being the reference classic pnc's this is part of the allowed\
      \ rule set. Please see King Quest 5 or Monkey Island.\n- If you click quickly\
      \ the character accelerate. We didn't want to put on teleportation not to ruin\
      \ the immersion feeling. This is in common with the vast majority of pnc's games\
      \ out there, even today. Again: because of our reference no skippable waits\
      \ are there.\n- all the enigmas have been carefully crafted with an underlying\
      \ logic. As players we really hate when an action doesn't come from a logic\
      \ deduction and our main effort has been dedicated to avoid this. If you feel\
      \ this happened I encourage you to give some specifics so to give us a chance\
      \ to explain.\n\nWe are sorry you didn't like the repeating actions needed for\
      \ one of our puzzles, but the point of that is exactly what you say: the same\
      \ action has different consequences that need to be foreseen in advance.\n\n\
      Overall we are very sorry you didn't like our game. \"Belpaese Homecoming\"\
      \ came by the effort of a team of three people wishing to evoke the feelings\
      \ of the old times adventure games. Our main motive was never to write an easy\
      \ game as that is often orthogonal to make an interesting one. Please trust\
      \ us on the logic driving our plot. If you feel like giving to our game a second\
      \ chance, we will be very grateful. If you don't, thanks anyway for having given\
      \ to our game such a deep consideration. \n\n"

    review: 'Very, very annoying point n'' click.


      The reasons:

      - Pixel hunting. Minuscule objects are essential to your progression.

      - (of course, no hot spots key.)

      - Timed pixel hunting. Some minuscule objects are only there intermittently.
      Yep, keep your eyes more peeled than that.

      - Also, you''ll need to time your grabs. Devs got confused with the point n''
      clock genre.

      - More scene transitions, back and forth, than humanly tolerable.

      - (of course, no fast movement key.)

      - Many mandatory day/night changes, all triggered from a unique location, and
      not a central one.

      - (of course, with unskippable wait.)

      - Expected actions are commonly nonsensical.


      Simply put, you''ll spend 72% of your game time waiting for your character instead
      of actually playing. One particularly terrible "puzzle" requires you to perform
      the exact same action 3 times, but on different nights. In effect, a basic repeat
