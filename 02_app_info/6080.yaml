    review: "I love this game.\nI used to play it on the WII when I was young and\
      \ I had always missed it since we don't have it anymore. This computer version\
      \ is the same so I am very happy.\nThere is lots to do and many mini games to\
      \ play. Some of them are quite hard since they are based on quick reactions\
      \ and timed events, although they are very fun. \nThe whole designing the theme\
      \ park is so much fun, from making unique roller coasters to cleaning up trash\
      \ and setting up people. \nThere is endless playtime within this game. I would\
      \ recommend this to anyone who likes casual yet busy games. It is quite relaxing\
      \ yet challenging. Perfect for keeping busy with."
