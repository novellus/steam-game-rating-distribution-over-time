    short_description: A survival horror game where you must survive inside a deep,
      dark cave with no clear way out. Hunting you is a hungry cave bear. Using your
      ears alone, you must keep your paltry lantern's light alive by collecting oil,
      and if you're lucky, you might get out with the help of your trusty shotgun.
