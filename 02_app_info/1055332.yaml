    review: 'Trust the other reviews. The brakes are horrible and the unit is vastly
      underpowered. Sounds are alright. Horn is a bit loud, which is an odd complaint
      coming from me. But it takes just about a full 30 seconds to take a 10lb set
      on a 12-car train. This should take less than 5-ish seconds. It should also
      significantly slow the train down, and yet no. The independent brake is useless,
      which is nothing new coming from Dovetail.


      TLDR; It''s pretty, but unplayable. Waste of money, even if it''s on sail. Really
      only useful for AI trains.'
