    review: Works ok with my steam index set up.  I like that I need to move around
      in my play area to make good hits.  I strongly dislike that the visual effects
      keep me from tracking the ball through contact with my virtual racket.  This
      really ruins the immersion; I need to see the ball hit the racket since I cannot
      feel it.  Still for a cheap VR game it is pretty good.
