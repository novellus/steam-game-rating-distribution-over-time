      \ city will be crawling with snipers who want you dead. To survive, you\u2019\

      notes: Realistic enemies aggressively attack the player using long-range weapons
        and through close-range combat. The player, similarly, can and must dispatch
        enemies in a variety of ways. The player can be destroyed by enemies and may
        also fall to his death from height.
