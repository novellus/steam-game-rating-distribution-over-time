Exploring actually feel oddly rewarding and the content is pretty varied. \n Combat ranges from pretty fun to button mashey and random.  Overall, the game is pretty easy at the beginning though and I mostly died to platforming. I did have some bug that blocked progression (like in the crypt fighting the green guy the fight never ended). The UI is really unintuitive and it's easy to destroy items by accident.\n\nUpdate:\nYeah, this just needs a few things to be more playable:\n- Some kind of hit effect. It's super hard to tell when you take damage\n- Make it easier to hit those tiny crates (why are they so tiny?)\n- Reduce the bow aiming sensitivity.\n- Add a confirm to destroy item\n- Lower the price: it's a bit steep for this quality\n\nUpdate 2:\nThis game gets really hard towards the end if you're not playing very well.  It's fun if you don't mind trying to cheese out enemies and bosses.  It's never straight up unfair, but you do lose your healing items on death so you have to play either perfectly or very carefully.","timestamp_created":1605772173,"timestamp_updated":1607140084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkvHAmPYCcuCgrwI="}
