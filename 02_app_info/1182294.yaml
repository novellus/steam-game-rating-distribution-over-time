    review: "I think this is an interesting and big campaign.\n\nThe DLC is basicly\
      \ x missions over xx days.\nYou start with the logistics and have to fly planes\
      \ from different nations to the middle east.\nThis might sound easy, but truth\
      \ is its not quite that simple since you have to setup refuel planes and the\
      \ planes them self.\nSo to even complete the logistic challenge you need to\
      \ master the ref point system and know how to setup this.\n( the ingame tutorial\
      \ can teach you ).\nMy advice for this dlc campaign, is to read the briefing\
      \ and do excactly as it say.\n\nBut the campaign have a bit of everything..\
      \ from logistics, sam, bombing, ships, heli ect and allot of allies and stuff\
      \ going on.\n\n- the little negative.\nmaybe a bug- I notised that there are\
      \ some F15 that can fly directly from USA east coast to spain.. without refuling.\
      \  ;-)  \n( there are like 6000km from usa east coast to spain in europe an\
      \ f15 cant fly that far without refueling ).\n"
