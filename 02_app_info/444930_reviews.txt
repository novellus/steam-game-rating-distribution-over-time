The framerate is noticeably smoother, the game crashes far less often, and you can customize just about every detail, be it the texture of the playfield, the color of the lights, or the background noises. I also appreciated how cabinet mode is readily available. This is an easy recommendation for those who enjoy pinball from the 70's and 80's.","timestamp_created":1608934385,"timestamp_updated":1608934385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523026347160339355","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ41sz9zfYCe4CYvQI="}
