    review: '[h1]Short review[/h1]


      This DLC is essentially a microtransaction. While the map is a good look-alike
      of Asia, you can pretty much find the same using the Steam Workshop.


      [h1]Long review[/h1]


      This map is exclusively available in Large size. It is in fact a relatively
      good representation of Asia. I played it once and didn''t detect any critical
      issues. The problem with this type of DLC is that it should''ve been in the
      base game or included with a free update. This map "pack" includes work that
      a modder performs for free on the Steam Workshop, sometimes better than the
      developers themselves. I got it in a bundle alongside Civilization V but why
      would you pay for something that you can find for free? If you desperately want
      to play in Asia, head to the Steam Workshop and you''ll find your happiness.'
