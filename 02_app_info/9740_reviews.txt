Sometimes, it succeeds. You can feel the spark. For just a minute at a time, you will care about how your performance affects the other characters. You will get drawn into some moody location and feel curious and tense and immersed.  The game and the film come together to make something new.\n\nUnfortunately, both the game and the film are awful, so these moments are rare.\n\nI won't go too much into either (like how on the game side there are constant annoying QTE and dialogue options are indecipherably vague, or how on the story side the dialogue is stilted and the plot goes into totally off-the-rails nonsense in the last third), but there is one particular thing that offended me, that made me want to write a review, which is how badly used the characters of Carla and Tyler are by the end. \n\nThe further the game delves into the supernatural, the less relevant two police officer characters are going to become. And it is clear the writers had totally no idea how to handle this: instead of coming up with some new way that Carla and Tyler can contribute to the plot, they basically get dropped entirely. \n\nTyler literally vanishes suddenly from the story, whereas Carla just gets shoved disrespectfully into the role of Lucas's love-interest with no build-up, and does nothing further of note. I'm not sure which is worse, especially considering Lucas is literally a walking corpse at that point.\n\nI can't exaggerate just what a massive fail this is for the story. We've spent just as much time getting to know these two as we have with Lucas, and they are both more interesting than Lucas! When the game decides \"Actually, these two aren't relevant\", it's not only a waste of two good characters — and of all the considerable mocap and voice acting and money that went into creating them — it's a waste of your time.","timestamp_created":1608565507,"timestamp_updated":1608568024,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvIWIw/YCcNz7uwI="}
