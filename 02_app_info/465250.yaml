    review: "[h1][b]Review of:[/b] [i]Styx: Shards of Darkness - The Akenash Set[/i][/h1]\n\
      \n[i]The Akenash Set[/i] is a simple DLC that adds a new outfit along with a\
      \ dagger and since there are not many alternatives for Styx\u2019s gear, these\
      \ items may come in handy. The whole set looks genuinely awesome, it\u2019s\
      \ a nostalgic classic from the old days when Styx was infiltrating the Tower\
      \ of Akenash.\n\nBoth items have bonuses, however, somehow there\u2019s no information\
      \ about penalties in the DLC\u2019s description on the Steam Store, which may\
      \ be misleading for many people. The Akenash Outfit increases the duration of\
      \ clones, but also makes Styx lose one unit of life if a clone is killed by\
      \ anyone or anything other than Styx himself. The Dagger of Akenash instantly\
      \ dissolves dead bodies of killed enemies, but also makes muffled kills impossible,\
      \ which means that upon dying they will scream and may alarm nearby guards.\n\
      \nWell, the DLC was supposed to be an exclusive pre-order bonus but it ended\
      \ up as a standard add-on, which isn\u2019t bad at all. Still, it doesn\u2019\
      t bring anything new nor worthwhile, but it\u2019s a nostalgic classic that\
      \ reminds me of the previous game - [i]Styx: Master of Shadows[/i] - and I still\
      \ appreciated the [i]The Akenash Set[/i]. Purchasing the DLC may be a good way\
      \ of supporting the developers, and if someone is a huge fan, then the add-on\
      \ is worth buying during a sale."
