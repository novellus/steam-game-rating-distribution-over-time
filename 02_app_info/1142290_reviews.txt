Girls are turning up with glowing scars on their arms, either dead or near death. A travelling magician might be behind these incidents. Still, you need to investigate and find the truth.\n\nHO scenes are fun, minigames challenging, and the plot engaging. Fully recommend, though getting in the bundle would be ideal.","timestamp_created":1569096400,"timestamp_updated":1569096400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyN/bqu0Cc53T0gE="}
