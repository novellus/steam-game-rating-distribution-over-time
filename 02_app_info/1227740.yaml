    review: "I will start off by saying this game has a ton of potential. Is the learning\
      \ curve hard, yes. But the Dev (1 guy by the way!) has been making constant\
      \ and frequent improvements. As of this review the tutorial system has been\
      \ completely revamped so I recommend giving it another go if you gave up in\
      \ the early stages. I also recommend increasing the starting income and experience\
      \ you gain when starting a new game. In my opinion its too grindy on the default.\
      \ Especially if you don't want to spend hours to upgrade your gear and buildings,\
      \ which is where the game really starts to feel satisfying. \n\nWhat keeps drawing\
      \ me to the game is the quirky retro but 3D visuals and the Dev has been upgrading\
      \ that too! I like to check into this game every couple weeks to see whats been\
      \ added. One of my favorite things is just the silly side of the game. Like\
      \ if you don't clean up a mess it'll spawn these goo monsters that you have\
      \ to attack with a spray bottle. The game also states rats and fires will be\
      \ coming soon too so I can't wait to see how those are. \n\nWhile I've never\
      \ made my own beer the games makes me want to give it a go. I hope the dev keeps\
      \ on updating this game because when I think about how Star Dew Valley started\
      \ and what it became I think this game has the same potential if the dev keeps\
      \ at it!"
