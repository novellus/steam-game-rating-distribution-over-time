It feels incredible to literally fly through the levels at the speed of sound. It took me 5-6 hours to get 3 stars on every level, which wasn't especially difficult but was definitely fun.\n\nLevel design can be hit and miss. Most are fine but there are a few with annoyingly tight tunnels, or stairs that are awkward to climb. Overall it's not a big deal, and the speed you go through the game really makes the individual issues pretty minor.\n\nThere is a small story, surprisingly. It's not especially gripping but it does serve to give character to the world. You won't miss much if you skip through the dialogue. it is somewhat frustrating that story progress is tied to crystals collected, instead of levels completed, as it displays story elements and makes claims about future levels out of sync of your completion. That is, if you finish each level in order.\n\nOverall Cyber Hook is well worth the price. If you like the demo, buy the game!","timestamp_created":1609782084,"timestamp_updated":1609782084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmqif5/YCeJ+6wAI="}
