There are websites that I use that helped me such as Real Kana and quizlet that is simply more polished to work with. If there are going to be more updates, these are things that should be considered to implement.\n\n1. Key inputs during quizzes\nI feel the lack of typing the answer kind of loses my motivation to answer more than 10 questions. I personally think it would be a more engaging experience if I am able to type these key inputs. It really gives off of a personal competitive vibe that brings the experience on a new level\n\n2. Customization for flashcards.\nObviously if you are doing flashcards, it is almost essential to have a \"custom\" list depending on what you want to learn. Although there is a looping system, it doesn't really help since you don't choose what cards you want to study. The only method I found is by missing them on purpose and then practice the ones you missed.\n\n3. Provide audio for Kanji\nIt feels frustrating that there is a lack of consistency when it audio isn't supported for everything. When I was looking through the kanji section, I had a hard time how to \"pronounce\" the words since it has different ways to spell it. Let's take the word 本. It means book if it was pronounced as ほん aka hon. However there is another way to interpret the kanji, which is もと aka moto, and I wish there is a default audio file that tells me which is the more common pronunciation, which I learned from my Japanese Class was Hon.\n\nOverall, it just feels this was made as a college project, I made a way worse version of a flashcard app before and I can definitely say it takes a lot of manual work when it comes to inputting a lot of information and files into an app. However, it doesn't really excuse the lack of polish this product holds and I do hope there are more updates so I can change my review.","timestamp_created":1609979316,"timestamp_updated":1609979453,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45JuQ7fYCfI2TwQI="}
