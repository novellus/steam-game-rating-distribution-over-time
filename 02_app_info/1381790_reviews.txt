The equipment provided is quite redundant. The Borne tractor is basically the same as the starter tractor, and the \"Gecko Strong 09\" is very similar to the other Lindners (now \"Gecko\", I guess they lost the Lindner license).\nThe tippers are OK I suppose but there were already several large and small trailers in the game, so no real need for more. \n\nThe only piece of equipment that really adds anything is the seeder. It's slightly wider than what was in the game before, so that's nice if you do a lot of manual sowing. Would have been more interesting if they gave us an even wider, foldable seeder and/or a direct drill, though.","timestamp_created":1603731191,"timestamp_updated":1603744834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnYSps/UCd+yjqgI="}
