    review: 'TL;DR Buy this, but it is pretty short. I''m gonna keep an eye on SKY
      HOUR WORKS cuz their games are hidden gems though.


      I went into this game with... mediocre expectations. It had only positive reviews
      instead of very positive or overwhelmingly positive and only a few people had
      reviewed or played it. It''s honestly a little wacky that a game with 93% positive
      reviews is only "positive" on steam. Anyway, I had played SPACE / MECH / PILOT
      and was interested in the rest of Project: Natura, so I bought it anyway cuz
      it was cheap (it was on sale when I bought it). I was honestly expecting another
      meh steam visual novel out of the ocean of them.


      So buying this was a good idea. I''m not big on visual novels, but I love this
      game. It''s a lovely little visual novel and it actually does a great job setting
      up the series. It has the same high quality storytelling and art as SPACE /
      MECH / PILOT which is just amazing. It makes some stuff in S/M/P make sense
      now that I''ve played the first game in the series, and I love the concept of
      the entire series. I am absolutely invested in this series now!


      It''s a bite sized story and it takes maybe an hour and a half to 100% all the
      achievements. You can do it in one sitting, but you can also save so that''s
      nice. Choices also actually matter, which was kinda unexpected. I figured they''d
      have less effect than they do. This game also did something fairly rare for
      games. It made me unironically laugh. Sure, I laugh at bugs and things all the
      time, but this game had a joke that actually made me chuckle out loud. It''s
      a little hard to say anything else without spoilers, so just play it. This game
      was a pleasant surprise, and it was a great first game for 2021!


      Also: Lord Gaben please allow full profile options on both this and SPACE /
      MECH / PILOT I need the achievement "Be Gay. Do Crimes." on my steam profile.'
