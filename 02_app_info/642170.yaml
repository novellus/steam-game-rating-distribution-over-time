    review: 'For $3.50 i wasnt expecting much but this game was a ton of fun. Modernized
      Duck Hunt. Very simple, and gets kinda terrifying when the game turns to a storm
      during the night and the only light you have is lightning while you head a gator
      crawling out of the swamp.


      Played with a Samsung Odyssey+. Control scheme is simple. You only stand in
      one place but you can turn 360 degrees. Again, like a modernized duck hunt game.
      Its only 400mb so you have to understand you arent wandering around in a map.
      There is just a single stage with a global survival high score, limited ammo.
      Probably not a $10 game, but definitely fun for under $4.'
