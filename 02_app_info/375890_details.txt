Create a football team, play matches, earn XP, train skills, learn new classes, upgrade facilities, buy and sell footballers, grow youth, make hard choices. It's a deep strategy which respects your time.","supported_languages":"English, Russian, Ukrainian, French, German, Spanish - Spain, Portuguese - Brazil, Italian, Czech, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Turkish","reviews":"“Football Tactics is the most captivating indie PC game I have played. In addition to the strategic gameplay and management aspects, the fact that games play out quickly helped keep me going “just one more turn.” In that way, it is very much like bigger strategy titles, like the aforementioned Civilization series. Plus, it is polished and charmingly animated, with easy to read menus and a very helpful tutorial.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.operationsports.com\/football-tactics-impressions-steam-early-access\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Operation Sports<\/a><br><br>“Think Heroes of Might and Magic but with footballers instead of griffins...”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.thepixelempire.net\/football-tactics-pc-review.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Pixel Empire<\/a><br><br>“A real innovation: deeply addictive”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.gamestar.de\/artikel\/football-tactics-early-access-der-koenigstransfer-fuer-fans-von-fussballmanagern,3321776.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http:\/\/www.gamestar.de\/artikel\/football-tactics-early-access-der-koenigstransfer-fuer-fans-von-fussballmanagern,3321776.html<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/375890\/header.jpg?t=1570548526","website":"http:\/\/creoteam.com\/football-tactics-glory\/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows XP<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 1 GHz<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 512 MB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Shaders 3.0, minimal resolution 1024 x 768, recommended dedicated graphics card with 128 MB of RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 9.0c<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 600 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"developers":["Creoteam"],"publishers":["Creoteam"],"package_groups":[],"platforms":{"windows":true,"mac":false,"linux":false},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":10,"description":"Game demo"},{"id":28,"description":"Full controller support"},{"id":23,"description":"Steam Cloud"}],"genres":[{"id":"23","description":"Indie"},{"id":"28","description":"Simulation"},{"id":"18","description":"Sports"},{"id":"2","description":"Strategy"}],"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/375890\/ss_23053b7ade6d57e6ccd1eb0038f42d7a79a57202.600x338.jpg?t=1570548526","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/375890\/ss_23053b7ade6d57e6ccd1eb0038f42d7a79a57202.1920x1080.jpg?t=1570548526"},{"id":1,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/375890\/ss_9c3f96253ecbbee448cf779a8252b88e43d01082.600x338.jpg?t=1570548526","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/375890\/ss_9c3f96253ecbbee448cf779a8252b88e43d01082.1920x1080.jpg?t=1570548526"},{"id":2,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/375890\/ss_95642ca901300a4bca229217111d106795889cdb.600x338.jpg?t=1570548526","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/375890\/ss_95642ca901300a4bca229217111d106795889cdb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1570548526"},{"id":3,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/375890\/ss_742ba7cd62095f6429c51e7e6c73b2d62edb1d17.600x338.jpg?t=1570548526","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/375890\/ss_742ba7cd62095f6429c51e7e6c73b2d62edb1d17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1570548526"},{"id":4,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/375890\/ss_87ae03a2dfd5d1e066e29b697a0a1bb1c9e867d3.600x338.jpg?t=1570548526","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/375890\/ss_87ae03a2dfd5d1e066e29b697a0a1bb1c9e867d3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1570548526"},{"id":5,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/375890\/ss_8abd4644d230e1d46a24541cd5eabc8db741dc56.600x338.jpg?t=1570548526","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/375890\/ss_8abd4644d230e1d46a24541cd5eabc8db741dc56.1920x1080.jpg?t=1570548526"}],"release_date":{"coming_soon":false,"date":"Jun 4, 2015"},"support_info":{"url":"http:\/\/creoteam.com\/","email":"hello@creoteam.com"},"background":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/375890\/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1570548526","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null}}}}
