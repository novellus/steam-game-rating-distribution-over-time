I must say that it was a cool idea to release this comic book as i really enjoyed it. It is a nice appetiser to the After Reset game.  I understand that people got used to big titles to be released in a year's time after announcement but still do not understand the difference between multimillion budgets and hundreds of employees behind AAA games and small indie, self-funded teams trying to making something worth checking.  If you like scifi stuff and espacially if you like the Fallout world, this might be worth checking.","timestamp_created":1488536776,"timestamp_updated":1488536776,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1JXtydoCe6HHcw=="}
