I think that it has potential, but currently the only multiplayer available is same room - meaning trading your headset off with somebody else.\n\nWith that being said, it is challenging - physics seem good and once multiplayer is out I think that it will be pretty fun, but right now you're paying $9 to lonely throw a ball at some cups, which is far more expensive than actually buying some pong balls and solo cups.\n\nI also hope that there's an actual honor system - or maybe special lobbies - where people do actually drink when they're supposed to, otherwise I can see this getting pretty one-sided.\n\nStill, I'm going to give this a thumbs up for people who are interested since I can't find anything wrong to give it a thumbs down (and devs clearly put that multiplayer isn't out yet but coming) - just know what you're getting into at this stage of development.","timestamp_created":1520118342,"timestamp_updated":1532402470,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx8GT5eQCedvWmgE="}
