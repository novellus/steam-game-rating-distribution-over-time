    reviews: "\u201CTranquil Garden could set a new standard and way of creating games.\
      \ Especially with character development and immersion. Game controls are fairly\
      \ simple. Adding in real life interaction and using it to increase stats drastically\
      \ increases the possibilities and even ups the immersion factor.\u201D<br><a\
