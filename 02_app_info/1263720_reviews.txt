For some advice for the developer because the game is in early access, it would be cool to add extra hand skins, or even ship skins for higher points. Maybe 5,000 or 10,000 for a ship skin. This was genuinely fun as I was trying to breach the top of the leader board, which I did *flex flex*, but I think what would help this game a lot would be to instead of having the same things go at you, make it kind of a level based game where the more points you get the higher the enemies, more asteroids or higher fire rates for enemies, as well as extra pickups or something for the ship the player controls, higher fire rates, or even something like a missile or bomb that uses one of the extra buttons that are unused in this game. Overall, I can't complain because it is so cheap and in early access, and because I don't really have experience making games some of my ideas may seem outlandish a little, but good job and I can't wait to see the finished product!","timestamp_created":1609394157,"timestamp_updated":1609394157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ43L7X2/YCevCBvwI="}
