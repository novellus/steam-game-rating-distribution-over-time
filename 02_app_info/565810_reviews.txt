(Hmm...not a good acronym, that one. I sincerely hope they never used it!) Suffice it to say, it's video game music of the highest quality, and should please anyone in search of such things. \n\n   Personally, as a wannabe writer, I eat this shit up for breakfast (and sometimes brunch, lunch and dinner as well). If you have a use/need/want for awesome, epic fantasy-themed music in your life, do yourself a favour and just buy [i]all[/i] of the Broken Sword OSTs (though you may have to buy the games first, 'natch). \n\n   Verdict: 9/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1580021855,"timestamp_updated":1580021920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605486035346984863","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkKap8O8Cf8yT7gE="}
