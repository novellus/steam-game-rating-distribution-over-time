The colors are clear and distinct, and there is a beam coming out of your block showing where it will go, which I suspect avoids a lot of frustration.\nThe one slight downside is the inability to tilt the camera, so sometimes I think I have a match when I do not, but this is really minor. \nThere are a few power-ups that show up, a bomb, one that destroys all of a color and a heart. If there are more I haven't seen them. They are really rare though, so aren't really much of a factor. \nBut two thumbs up, for people looking for a casual arcade-like simple addictive game.","timestamp_created":1575329086,"timestamp_updated":1576270610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5ZfDgO8Cfpeu4QE="}
