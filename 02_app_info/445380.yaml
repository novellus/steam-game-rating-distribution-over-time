    review: 'The soundtrack to Super Night Riders is incredibly small. Each track
      is very short, and by the time you play enough of the game, the music will be
      so grating that you won''t want to hear it again. Especially that main menu
      theme. I never want to hear that again.


      Otherwise, all that comes with this pack is a wallpaper of the game''s main
      menu, some bonus concept art, an instruction manual (you can read it [b]in its
      entirety[/b] in this DLC''s screenshots) and a pathetically-short "anime" of
      the main character [i]turning her head[/i] (no seriously, it''s just three seconds
      long and you can watch it [b]in its entirety[/b] in the main game''s store description).


      Please don''t waste your money on this DLC. Get the main game, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/recommended/444000/]I
      do recommend it[/url], but don''t bother buying this DLC.'
