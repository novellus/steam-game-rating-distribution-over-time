If you download American rail scenarios from the workshop you'll want this. If you don't do either of the above, give a skip. There's little of value if you aren't into workshop content. \n\nFirst he bad... And content creators likely won't care about it. There are only two scenarios. Back when it was full price that was pretty flimsy - especially since it comes with 10 liveries. Now that it's so cheap? Not a big deal in my book. The worst part is, one of them is completely broken. You can finish it, but it'll take about 10-15 minutes longer than the scenario allows giving you several thousand neg points. Loading it up in the editor, it says everything is completely broken to the point that it should not even start - yet it does. The two scenarios utilize the Union Pacific and BNSF variant. (The BNSF scenario is the broken one.)\n\nThe neutral is that it's a very old pack. From a distance they look just fine. Up close, you'll notice their age. Like some of the really old TS locomotives they suffer from Stretchy Coupler Syndrome but at the lower speeds you'll be using it and the shorter consists... It's pretty manageable and of course they'll work fine running around slowly as AI trains in scenarios.\n\nThe good is that these make outstanding yard duty AI switchers for scenarios. They look at home in most any American yard and they certainly add to the realism. I feel that if you're driving a train past a yard and you see one or two of these moving freight around, it just adds so much! \n\n+ Famous switches that were yard work horses for decades. Great for workshop content. \n+ Very inexpensive price for a plethora of liveries. (it'll fit most US railroads)\n+ Sounds are a bit dated, but they do the job well enough. The engine sound is quite good.\n\n- Only 2 scenarios, one of which is broken. \n- The physics need updating/fixing and have been ignored like so much of the old content\n\nAs I stated above, if you're into workshop content, it's a must have. If not, skip it. You're not missing much.","timestamp_created":1580294463,"timestamp_updated":1580294463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541162729263305664","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44fu4+O8Cf+ju7gE="}
