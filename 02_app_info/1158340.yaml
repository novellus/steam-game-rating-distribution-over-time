      Guerrucci</i> (Guitar and Mixing) and <i>Lino Pastorelli</i> (Bagpipes and Composition)
      spent several months working together to contribute, each with his own style,
      to an organic and inspired soundtrack. <br>To further enhance the variety and
      quality, some musicians joined the band with their unique instruments and sounds:

      Tracks 01, 02) and <i>Emmanuel Biamonti </i>(Flutes, Track 04).<br><br>We do

    short_description: 'A medieval-inspired folk metal soundtrack recorded with real
      instruments by a live band. Grim guitar riffs, powerful drums, bagpipes, accordions,
      contrabasses and basses and sharp flutes: everything a good folk metal album
      should be featuring!'

    review: Brilliant soundtrack by Red Dew Hellpipes. Good mix of celtic and rock.
      I'm not very good at the game itself, but I can definitely appreciate the rocking
      music to this game.
