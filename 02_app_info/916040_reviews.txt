The class system is great, the map wonderful and the strategic choices extremely satisfying.\n\nI have read some of the comment and some people say it is too hard, but if you are used to the genre you will find the difficulty alright. I beat the game around 10 hours in and then lost interest since there is not much else to do.\n\nIs this little old school game worth your money? absolutely yes! \nBut if you are looking for something that will keep you playing for 100 hours maybe you should find something else.","timestamp_created":1607456876,"timestamp_updated":1607456876,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3qz5ofYCfKSguAI="}
