May be abandoned. Still no multiplayer, still no AI or other improvements. And before some guys start yelling (DO YOU KNOW WHAT A BETA IS) again... You know what abandoned Early Access Games are? Games that promises stuff which they never deliver. Like a freaking multiplayer.\n\nOriginal review from December 2018:\nI really wanted to recommend this, but i cannot. I really like the visuals and the music (i am an 80s kid you know). But there is literally no content. You just drive endlessly on a road, target is to not crash. There is also no AI for the traffic, they just go straight. EVER. Which means they crash into you, into buildings, into walls and into mountains. When i drive i think naturally: \"oh oncoming traffic, i bet he will stay in his lane\". NOPE, not in this game.\n\nJust driving is nice for a change but it gets old very quick, so i would like some real racing modes. Lets be curious what the multiplayer will hold.\n\nEdit: You might think 1,2 hours is not enough playtime to write a review. But seriously, you have seen anything from the game in that amount of time.","timestamp_created":1545577887,"timestamp_updated":1595332459,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":26,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.65337526798248291","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4n6/OuPMCduOStgE="}
