The whole game is a moody, atmospheric experience, and the music just brings it home so utterly perfectly. It's a mark of an amazing game soundtrack when just hearing it can bring back some of the experiences you had with playing it...and this delivers. My favorite - Anger Gameplay 2 - still instills the feeling of creeping claustrophobia I felt while playing...It's awesome. \n\nWholly reccomended.","timestamp_created":1506282605,"timestamp_updated":1506282605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nJHc2t4Cea2ehgE="}
