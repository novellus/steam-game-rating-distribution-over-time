Interesting world and decent story so far, but a but random. In the beginning of the game the MC and a bunch of knights are fight demons with swords and lances, but then a dead medic's backpack has a Glock pistol in it which one of the MC's party members pick up and used to kill several demons. This is a VN RPG/Adventure game, there's no voice acting and the art is just 3D character models without a variety of facial expressions, which works decently well.\n\nFor now a recommend because it's funny and enjoyable thus far.\n\n[b] Follow my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35894647-NiLovesGames/] curator page [/url] for more reviews!
