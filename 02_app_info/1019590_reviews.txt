Levels like 6-15, 6-21, 6-22, and all the Hidden levels will push you to your limit. Acing each level felt immensely satisfying, it was like finally breaking down a brick wall only to find another one ready to be broken. there's no better feeling than finally Acing the last level in Abyss and seeing that achievement pop up at long last. \nIf you liked Lovely Planet 1 for the gameplay and want more of it, Lovely Planet 2 will scratch that itch. \nIf you liked Lovely Planet 1 for the challenge, then you have to try the Abyss levels. \n","timestamp_created":1609734467,"timestamp_updated":1609814342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl6+a6PYCc46lwAI="}
