    review: "Greetings!  Today we will be looking at \u201COccult Siege\u201D a Priority\
      \ Assignment DLC.  As with the others of its kind it includes a few random missions\
      \ themed around a story that have different paths.  But, is something like this\
      \ worth the $3?\n\nDrive me Closer:  Like the others there really isn\u2019\
      t much here to talk about, the story is another of the choose-your-own-adventure\
      \ style and I do look forward to trying different paths in the future but the\
      \ missions themselves are nothing to mention as you\u2019ve seen them over and\
      \ over.  The reward is a Tarot card, one that increases your Glory which is\
      \ great for the weekly glory grind, which alone is really worth the cost of\
      \ the DLC.\n\nJust like the prevous ones this is all based around the reward\
      \ and maybe a bit on story.  With that said I\u2019d highly recommend you grab\
      \ it for the tarot card alone.  Enjoy!\n"
