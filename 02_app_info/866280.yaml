      to get a cobalt bomb and transport it to the center of a busy metropolis. Revolutionary
      design of the dirty bomb instantly turned the prosperous city into the dark
      radioactive concrete jungle. Most of the population has been evacuated to safety,
      but there still should be a lot of people within the contaminated zone. The
      search robots were helping search for survivors, but they broke down too fast

      robots were sent to the territory. Their task was to check up the territory,
      measure the level of background radiation, neutralize the main radiation hotspots
      with the help of innovative bonding chemicals and recover the GPS signal.<br><img
