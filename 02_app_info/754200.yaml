    developer_response: "Thanks for your review. \nAs much as I would love to put\
      \ the soundtrack as well, since its from Kevin MacLeod under the Creative Commons\
      \ license. I can\u2019t. \nAlso, the reason I\u2019m making all those images\
      \ DLC is because they sell."

    review: "Given that the background artwork wasn't one of the stronger suits of\
      \ this game, I'm not sure why the developer thought it might be worth paying\
      \ for separately. I foolishly bought the \"Deluxe Edition\" 'cause it was cheap,\
      \ but this DLC sadly wasn't worth the additional 28 cents I forked out. \n\n\
      \   Chuck in the soundtrack, dev, and we'll call it even.\n\n   Verdict: 0.5/10.\n\
      \n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages:\
