You don't get a lot of explanation or any tips, which I actually enjoy, because you have to figure out the stragegy for yourself.  Controls are nice and simple, so it's very easy to get into. Overall, I really like this game and I can definetly recommend it! :D","timestamp_created":1540226045,"timestamp_updated":1540226045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480601787567138672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xIqozuYCeOeUrQE="}
