      \ /><br>Shortly before the end of 2017, the prototype of the new tram for Vienna\
      \ was completed and handed over to Wiener Linien in 2018. The new low-floor\
      \ trams will successively replace the last high-floor models of the Wiener Linien.\
      \ The Flexity convinces with its low energy consumption, for example through\
      \ LED lighting or air conditioning, which is energy-savingly adjusted to the\
      \ number of passengers in the tram.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1314140/extras/tramsim-headline14-en.jpg?t=1608306623\"\
      \ /><br>The interior of the new tram is flexibly designed. Generous multi-purpose\
      \ areas, some of which are equipped with folding seats, provide more space for\
      \ baby carriages and wheelchairs, which also makes it easier to get on and off\
      \ the tram quickly. This shortens the time spent at the tram stop and allows\
      \ the vehicles to be on time. Experience the vehicle novelty and test your skills!<br><br><img\

      \ /><br>In Vienna, the tram, also known as &quot;Tramway&quot; or &quot;Bim&quot;\
      \ in Viennese, has long been a dominant feature of the cityscape of the Austrian\
      \ capital. Since the electrification in 1987, the tram has become an indispensable\
      \ part of the traffic scene. Today, the Vienna tram is operated by the Wiener\
      \ Linien and is the fifth largest tram network in the world with more than 500\
      \ tram trains and currently 28 lines.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1314140/extras/01__5_.jpg?t=1608306623\"\

      \ /><br>With its track around the Ringstrasse, the Vienna Tram forms the heart\
      \ of public transport in Vienna. Although primarily a daily means of transport,\
      \ the well-developed tram network of the Wiener Linien connects the most diverse\
      \ districts of Vienna with each other and is therefore ideal for discovering\
      \ the city and its sights.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1314140/extras/01__20_.jpg?t=1608306623\"\

      \ /><br>You can look forward to many more features in the coming years, more\
      \ content from us and external developers and modders, and the opportunity to\
      \ get creative yourself. This is just the start of the most modern simulation\
      \ for urban transportation.<br><br><br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://discord.gg/3rpAKek\"\

      \ /><br>Shortly before the end of 2017, the prototype of the new tram for Vienna\
      \ was completed and handed over to Wiener Linien in 2018. The new low-floor\
      \ trams will successively replace the last high-floor models of the Wiener Linien.\
      \ The Flexity convinces with its low energy consumption, for example through\
      \ LED lighting or air conditioning, which is energy-savingly adjusted to the\
      \ number of passengers in the tram.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1314140/extras/tramsim-headline14-en.jpg?t=1608306623\"\
      \ /><br>The interior of the new tram is flexibly designed. Generous multi-purpose\
      \ areas, some of which are equipped with folding seats, provide more space for\
      \ baby carriages and wheelchairs, which also makes it easier to get on and off\
      \ the tram quickly. This shortens the time spent at the tram stop and allows\
      \ the vehicles to be on time. Experience the vehicle novelty and test your skills!<br><br><img\

      \ /><br>In Vienna, the tram, also known as &quot;Tramway&quot; or &quot;Bim&quot;\
      \ in Viennese, has long been a dominant feature of the cityscape of the Austrian\
      \ capital. Since the electrification in 1987, the tram has become an indispensable\
      \ part of the traffic scene. Today, the Vienna tram is operated by the Wiener\
      \ Linien and is the fifth largest tram network in the world with more than 500\
      \ tram trains and currently 28 lines.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1314140/extras/01__5_.jpg?t=1608306623\"\
      \ /><br> <br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1314140/extras/tramsim-headline17-en.jpg?t=1608306623\"\
      \ /><br>With its track around the Ringstrasse, the Vienna Tram forms the heart\
      \ of public transport in Vienna. Although primarily a daily means of transport,\
      \ the well-developed tram network of the Wiener Linien connects the most diverse\
      \ districts of Vienna with each other and is therefore ideal for discovering\
      \ the city and its sights.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1314140/extras/01__20_.jpg?t=1608306623\"\

      \ /><br>You can look forward to many more features in the coming years, more\
      \ content from us and external developers and modders, and the opportunity to\
      \ get creative yourself. This is just the start of the most modern simulation\
      \ for urban transportation.<br><br><br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://discord.gg/3rpAKek\"\
