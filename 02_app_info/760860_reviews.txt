It's a lovely premise with pretty artwork and music, but the actual gameplay is clunky, illogical and (at times) impossible to actually do!  It would be far better as a walkthrough/exploration type game rather than non-operational combat.\n\nI want to support the dev and have been waiting for progress, but not much has been happening at all.  \n\nI don't want a refund as I want the dev to be able to keep going and hopefully produce the game they had in their mind, rather than the one we have in our libraries.","timestamp_created":1584781934,"timestamp_updated":1584781934,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw26eX/vACdKza+QE="}
