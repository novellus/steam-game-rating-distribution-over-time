    short_description: Boyle Wolfbane wanted to rule the world. He failed. Miserably.
      Forced into retirement early, Boyle now spends his days arguing with haunted
      trees and scaring off the occasional knight. At least he still has Fang, his
      loyal storm wolf. Things could be worse. He could have been born a hero.
