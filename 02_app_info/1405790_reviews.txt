It is fun and tactical and can feel very rewarding when you succeed. There is some goofiness when you play with sightlines and a few other things but it's fine. My issues are mainly presentation. I would like some more time and effort put into making the movements and animation a bit more smooth and interesting to look at, especially since they have a real time replay feature (something I absolutely love but feels kinda off in this case because of the awkward animations). Still, good fun for a few hours of your time.","timestamp_created":1610118508,"timestamp_updated":1610118508,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3tWi8fYCdtbHwQI="}
