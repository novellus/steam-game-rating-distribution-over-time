    review: "If you enjoyed reading the original Starnova and enjoy playing office\
      \ tycoon games, you'll absolutely love Idol Empire. \n\nIf you haven't read\
      \ the Starnova VN, I would definitely recommend doing that before getting this\
      \ game - without the original for context, Idol Empire's writing would seem\
      \ almost totally nonsensical, and the many, MANY easter eggs and inside-jokes\
      \ would go completely over your head. \n\nBut if you HAVE read the VN, Idol\
      \ Empire is freaking hillarious! It captures all of Starnova's charm with almost\
      \ none of the drama. The devs managed to translate the girl's various quirks\
      \ and backgrounds into quantifiable statistics and special abilities in a way\
      \ that makes sure everyone feels unique while also keeping them in-character.\
      \ \n\nAs an actual tycoon game, Idol Empire is very solid - if you enjoy tycoon\
      \ games, chances are you enjoy having multiple things to manage at once, and\
      \ this game certainly delivers.\n\n* KN: Money! Earn money by selling songs\
      \ and doing jobs. Every job has a base payout that you'll receive even if the\
      \ job is unsuccessful - however succeeding at a job will pay out a nice bonus\
      \ on top of that. You can also make money by selling merchandise, but it's peanuts\
      \ compared to what your girls will pull in from record sales and big jobs. If\
      \ your KN falls below negative 5000, you'll automatically sell some of your\
      \ company's stock to pay off the debt - if you run out of stock, you get a GAME\
      \ OVER. You can buy additional stock at any time from the \"Finances\" menu,\
      \ provided you can afford it.\n* CENTER: The center of your idol formation,\
      \ which can be changed at any time from the \"Manage Idols\" menu. Your Center\
      \ will passively gain Center EXP over time, unlocking various passive effects\
      \ that benefit the entire team (some of which are REALLY OP). However, each\
      \ girl's passive effects are only applied when they are the acting Center, meaning\
      \ you'll want to switch Centers depending on the situation and the overall stage\
      \ of the game. Center EXP is tracked across ALL playthroughs, so once an idol\
      \ unlocks a Center ability, it becomes permanently unlocked for that girl on\
      \ all future games and will even be retroactively unlocked if you load an old\
      \ game.\n* HAPPINESS: when the girls are happy, they'll passively charge their\
      \ NOVA gauges, allowing them to unleash special active abilities. When unhappy,\
      \ they'll be vulnerable to negative status effects, some of which can get pretty\
      \ nasty, Ensuring the girls are happy with their current salary (which can be\
      \ checked under the \"Manage Idols\" tab) causes them to passively gain happiness\
      \ over time, while being dissatisfied will cause them to lose happiness over\
      \ time. Assigning them jobs they enjoy will boost their happiness, regardless\
      \ of whether or not the job is successful - by the same token, assigning them\
      \ jobs they hate will cause them to lose happiness. Tabloid scandals and Stalker\
      \ attacks will also reduce happiness, but those can be prevented by constructing\
      \ Legal and Security departments. \n* HEALTH: performing tasks will drain the\
      \ girls' health bars over time - when their health bottoms out, they'll be hit\
      \ with the \"Overworked\" status ailment, decreasing their happiness and slowing\
      \ their movement speed. Health is primarily restored by having your girls rest\
      \ in the Break Room, but in emergencies, a Girl's NOVA ability can be activated\
      \ to fully restore their health and prevent any further health loss for the\
      \ duration its active. \n* POPULARITY: each girl has their own individual popularity\
      \ score, which is the sum total of their FAME and INFAMY scores. Increased popularity\
      \ causes the girls to sell more records and earn larger bonuses on successful\
      \ jobs, but also causes them to demand higher wages and makes them more susceptible\
      \ to tabloid scandals and stalker attacks. However, the increase in money gained\
      \ from high popularity is exponential, while the upkeep cost of the girl's wages\
      \ and your legal & security departments is linear, so as long as you make sure\
      \ your tech keeps pace with your girl's popularity, you'll be fine. \n** FAME:\
      \ the primary means of boosting popularity - selling songs, performing lives,\
      \ and succeeding at job assignments will all contribute to a girl's fame. More\
      \ FAME = more POPULARITY = more MONEY \n** INFAMY: a double-edged sword - it\
      \ contributes to POPULARITY (and therefore a girl's money-making power) the\
      \ same way FAME does, but carries much, MUCH more weight towards increasing\
      \ the frequency of scandals and stalker attacks. Infamy is gained by failing\
      \ at jobs, doing dirty jobs, or by mishandling scandals (so yes, an infamous\
      \ idol can get trapped in a downward spiral of endless scandals if you don't\
      \ have a legal department). Infamy fades slowly over time, but can be decreased\
      \ rapidly by sending your girls on a vacation (can randomly appear as a job\
      \ offer), using Julie's NOVA ability (she creates a fake scandal which drains\
      \ the infamy of all the other girls on the team, while raising her own), or\
      \ by building a PR Department and setting it to \"Damage Control\". \n* PURE:\
      \ I've been playing this game for over 30 hours, and I'm still not entirely\
      \ sure what this stat does lol. Doing dirty jobs or making PVs with fanservice\
      \ shots will cause your girls to lose PURE.  Making Sasasmi your center or owning\
      \ full share control of your company will cause all of your girls' PURE stat\
      \ to recover over time, and doing charity jobs or performing AVs at a shrine\
      \ will give one-time boosts. \n* JOBS: Yes, jobs are a manageable resource!\
      \ Your office can stockpile up to 16 job offers at once, so it doesn't hurt\
      \ to keep some Vacations or other jobs the girls enjoy on hand in case of emergencies.\
      \ No new offers will arrive for as long as you're at the 16 job cap, so it's\
      \ also important to dismiss bad jobs and carry out low-risk or high reward jobs\
      \ as they come. \n\nNow, since you sat through this entire review (or at least\
      \ made the effort to scroll to the bottom lol) I'm gonna hit you with some pro-tips:\
      \ (note, some of these are fairly game-breaking, either avoid reading them or\
      \ make sure you ramp up the difficulty in the game settings if you want a challenge)\
      \ \nTip #1: At the start of every game, raising the girls' salaries from 100\
      \ KN to 110 KN will be enough to boost their satisfaction rating to \"Happy,\"\
      \ causing them to immediately begin gaining happiness over time. Having quicker\
      \ access to the girl's NOVA abilities (especially Nemu's real estate tycoon\
      \ ability which reduces building costs by 75%) is a huge boon in the early-game.\
      \ \nTip #2. If you don't know who to make your first Center, I highly recommend\
      \ Nemu - leveling her up gives you a small amount of passive income that helps\
      \ a lot during the early-game, and her Level 3 ability causes automatic stock\
      \ sales to sell for 50% more money than what you purchased them for. That's\
      \ right, with Nemu as your Center, falling into debt can actually TURN A PFOFIT!\n\
      Tip #3. Build multiple recording booths, set them to have Mariya record multiple\
      \ solo singles using the bare minimum expenditure (Amateur recording artist\
      \ + NO PV) , and then SPAM her NOVA ability. All of the songs will finish recording\
      \ instantly, netting you a constant stream of money and popularity for Mariya.\
      \ Don't be surprised if Mariya ends up with 10 times the popularity and brings\
      \ in 100 times the money as the other girls! \nTip #4. Go in to options and\
      \ set the LIVE difficulty from \"Standard\" to \"Cakewalk\" - this will cause\
      \ the hype bubbles to move at half-speed, making it much easier for the girls\
      \ to pop them on their own without having to spend money on stage effects. I\
      \ can confirm that changing the difficulty of LIVE performances has no bearing\
      \ on achievements unless specifically stated in the requirements (and I'm pretty\
      \ sure there aren't in this game that require you play on a specific difficulty)\
      \ \nTip #5: speaking of LIVES, holding a blowout performance (performing a song\
      \ without letting any bubbles hit the stage) will \"revive\" that song if it's\
      \ an old one, causing it to once again generate sales"
