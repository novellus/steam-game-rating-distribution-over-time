    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">Character-action set in ancient Swiss Gaul</h2><br>Around
      a hundred years BC, all of Gaul is far from Roman control. In the lands controlled
      by the Helvetii, a Roman legion was subjugated by young warchief Divico, blessed
      by a ancient boon brought to him from parts unknown. However, this victory came
      at a great cost, as soon the result of the warchief''s pact would turn into
      a curse; an ever spreading rot crawling through his land, and slowly corrupting
      his mind and heart.<br><br>With the help of the trusted yet reclusive druid
      Nammeios and the curious half-beast Renart, Divico sets his journey to undo
      the source of the rot and restore what was lost inside him. Through his own
      martial prowess and powers conferred by the old gods, the fight ahead promises
      to be intense.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1094590/extras/store_features.gif?t=1605291668"
