    about_the_game: Cybernetic Fault is a satirical adventure game with an anti-science
      storyline. The player will feel himself in the role of a romantic scientist,
      who is not shy about his incompetence and puts bold experiments on reality and
      common sense. He doesn't have time to read the instructions for the equipment
      and make calculations! Without a decisive break with classical science, the
      world can no longer be saved!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1409740/extras/Descr_img1.jpg?t=1601020863"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">FEEL YOURSELF A CRAZY GENIUS</h2>In fact, the protagonist
      is not always right. He doesn't have to be right at all. Sometimes the fate
      of the world depends on half-educated people, free from unnecessary knowledge.
      To conduct breakthrough scientific experiments, scrap iron is enough to close
      the wires. To say a new word in science, just press the red button. Or at least
      forget something, mix it up. This is science. Welcome to reality!<br><br><img

      get tangled ... But temporary difficulties are not a reason to give up! This
