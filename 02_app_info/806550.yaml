    review: 'Total hidden gem of a game! Went in curious about the gaining-abilities-by-dying
      conceit, but was impressed by the surprisingly deeply felt writing and music.
      The gaining-abilities-by-dying thing is similar in theory to The Missing: JJ
      Macfield and the Island of Memories, although personally, The Missing didn''t
      land for me at all (besides generally enjoying Swery''s Lynchean-stealing aesthetic),
      and I found The Missing''s gameplay super tedious, being more about executing
      a plan for an obvious solution, as opposed to actually needing to be clever
      to progress. Existence was consistently challenging in all the right ways, and
      rewarded and respected my time as a player. Recommend.'
