      Particulate it''s more than a VR game looks like a science project.


      As you can see in the video you can manipulate particles in a lot of diferent
      ways looks more like a study of how works the universe with the gravitation  more
      than a game, but i''m sure anyone can enjoy playing with this.


      There are several modes absorbing, pushing, hitting the partices ect... and
      really well acomplished the physics part.


      While I was doing all that I don''t know why the particles got increased in
      number not sure if they divide in more little particles or what.
