    review: "The game is world building and connected to its sequel Akashicverse Malicious\
      \ Wake.\nStory mode brings light into the darkness into what happens in the\
      \ other games. \n\nThe game in itself seems complex at first, but when you spent\
      \ a little time and play the mission mode you will learn how the game works.\
      \ Mission mode also got some extra challenges for good players. \nThere is also\
      \ a manual in both languages in the game folder. It can help you to understand\
      \ how each character works. \n\nYour goal is pretty much to beat the other player\
      \ in puyu puyu smash bros with top music in the background and all the visual\
      \ candy. \n\nThe game has some minor flaws. occasionally you will get lags.\
      \ From my experience these lags mostly show up when using Aranha's method Trick\
      \ Trap Tears or when you are about to lose your game. \n\nThe game is hopefully\
      \ getting an online vs mode in the future. \n\nI believe that if you are familiar\
      \ with the other games you won't be disappointed by this game."
