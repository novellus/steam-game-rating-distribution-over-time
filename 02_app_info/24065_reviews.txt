It lacks accuracy, detail and has so many fundamental errors. It either needs a major revamp (eg extension to Gourock, Wemyss Bay) or discontinued.","timestamp_created":1608585439,"timestamp_updated":1608585439,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48bzKw/YCf+2DvAI="}
