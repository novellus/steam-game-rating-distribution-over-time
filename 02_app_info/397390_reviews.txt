Not because I'm a glutton for pun-ishment, but because the atmosphere is really breathtaking. All right, enough with the bad puns, let's get serious here. The *feel* of the game really comes through: the music, the graphics, the characters, the story, everything feels really cohesive and applies a kind of lighthearted, amusing touch to the perilous journey you're about to take. It ain't easy being a newcomer in the intergalactic culinary industry, and you'll have worse things chasing you across the galaxy than an angry executive chef! This is one of those rare games where I'll actually have a good time playing despite struggling against the unfair RNG, and coming from me, that's really saying something.\n\nStill waiting to beat the game on Dragon Sweat difficulty in multiplayer.\n\n10/10 would die a happy Chef again :)","timestamp_created":1609138570,"timestamp_updated":1609152920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnJ+/1PYCeaWCvgI="}
