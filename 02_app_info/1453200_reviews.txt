The NPCs have some glitches that can be abused to easily survive any encounter, but the gameplay is pretty fun if roughly 1 hour is worth the price to you.\n\nThis game doesn't have a narrative (which isn't a bad thing at all. Just noting for those of you who mind) and the ending is rather abrupt. I hope the creator continues making games and keeps improving!","timestamp_created":1609825242,"timestamp_updated":1609825242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwufnD6PYCfafOwAI="}
