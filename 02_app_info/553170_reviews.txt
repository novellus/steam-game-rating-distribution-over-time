I have only played as the Romans, and it is a frustrating, but accurate, simulation of the First Punic War.  Whilst it is initially easy to capture the East of Sicily, as you advance further West, Carthage's superior Navy lands troops in your rear, and potentially retakes victory Cities. You can turn back to deal with them, but this leaves you with less time to capture the rest of the Island, or maybe invade Carthage itself. Alternatively, you can split your forces, garrisoning what you have captured, but leaving you with too few forces to capture the remainder of the island. It is a fairly small map, but you are likely to need most/all of the 24 game turns to win the game. Very enjoyable. Not played Carthage yet, but guess it's the same in reverse. Strike where the Romans are weak, or not even present. Avoid where they are strong.","timestamp_created":1589719421,"timestamp_updated":1589719421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522293031215667725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hKqqkfICdoKwiAI="}
