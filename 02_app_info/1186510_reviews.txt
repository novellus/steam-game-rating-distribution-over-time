It's quite surreal and abstract.  Love the logic puzzles in it so far.  My only issue is the animation and audio seem to be choppy at times.  A lot of the audio during the opening scene cut out completely, and it appeared to skip a couple of times.  I don't know if it was the game itself or if it was my system that was causing it.  I am running Windows 10 on a system that's at least 5 years old (belonged to my mom, then she let me have it a year-and-a-half ago when I made noises I wanted to save up for a new desktop with gaming capabilities).\n\nI have noticed that gameplay is choppy in some areas, but again, that could just be my system.  I do wish the mouse cursor was a little more visible, making it easier to locate it when trying to pick up objects or move pieces in a puzzle.\n\n\nI think this game would be very good (perhaps better) for VR rather than PCs.  While I do enjoy playing it and other similar games on the PC, I think with the context it would be best as a VR game.","timestamp_created":1575058829,"timestamp_updated":1575058829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482912361621856689","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1575100980,"developer_response":"Hi probinson417, thank you for the nice review. It would be great if you have a little time to contact me in the hub or any other channel, so I can look into the reason behind the sound glitches, and can investigate what caused those."}],"cursor":"AoJ47M203O4CcOvR3wE="}
