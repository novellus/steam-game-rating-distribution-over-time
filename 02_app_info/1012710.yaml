    developer_response: Hello, thanks for the feedback! In the multiplayer mode there
      is a clan feature, which allows you to team up with your friends to fight together
      against the machines and/or against other clans. Please feel free to let us
      know in the discussions what you don't like about the looting, or suggestions
      you have to improve it.

    review: Just bought this game today, it runs smooth and all that, it just needs
      much more content. It really has a dead feel, not much excitement for capturing
      objectives, the best part of the game for me was throwing my weapon lol. To
      the developers if this game, I would go for a man vs machine approach. Maybe
      make the robots smart and work together using vehicles and stuff, and having
      us players team up to fight the robots capture bases and that kind of stuff.
      Keep at it I'll check out your updates as they come out, also the looting system
      could use some tweaking in my opinion. But for now my review is save your money
      buyers.
