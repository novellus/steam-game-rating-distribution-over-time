It is like most other Kemco released RPGs in that everything is pretty generic and looks like it could have been made with RPG maker.  \n\nYou go around the world, recruiting party members, trying to beat the big evil of the game.  You get three party members, but each of them can have 3 companions with them, for a total of 12 members in the party.  \n\nDuring combat you can have a party member and all their companions attack or you can use a party member skill.  Note that if you use a skill from one of your party members, all your other members of that group will do nothing for that turn.  That said you best bet is usually to attack every turn with every character.  This will get you through most of the game, as the game is really easy.\n\nA big talking point for the game is the 100 party members you can collect.  This is done in a suikoden style with you traveling around and talking to people.  Some join right away, and some demand items or you to complete a quest or have some required stat.  9 of the people you recruit can be assigned to your party and another 16 can be assigned to two support squads that enhance you party abilities.\n\nAs far as extras, there is a crafting system, where you sacrifice unwanted weapons to make a weapon more powerful, a battle arena, a treasure chest dropping mechanic where you have to wait for a chest to open, an extra dungeon, a secret ending and a shop where you use tickets and currency you get from battles (not gold a different most likely premium at one time) to buy rare and powerful items.  You can see from this and waiting for some chests to open that this game was intended to have optional purchasable currency, most likely when it was on mobile, but here you do not have the option to purchase extra currency.  \n\nThere are extras to purchase, like extra XP and damage, but honestly the game is so easy you will not need them.\n\nTook about 10 hours to beat the game and see the true ending, so it is a quick play.\n\nAll in all an inoffensive game.  I would rate average if I could but since nothing is bad about the game I will give it a thumbs up.","timestamp_created":1604585471,"timestamp_updated":1604585471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4weevzPUCdM27rAI="}
