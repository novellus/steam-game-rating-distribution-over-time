    review: "Recommend with reservation. Get on sale.\n\n    Start with Kein's route,\
      \ it is the most enjoyable. I tried to save him til last, but I don't think\
      \ I'll finish this game. I really enjoyed another game by this company called\
      \ \"The Rose of Segundia\", and had hoped that this game would have the same\
      \ feel. It does not. It is a more serious subject matter and there are very\
      \ few moments of joy or fun. It feels like the game is trying to teach me something\
      \ about the struggle of man to remain good in the face of extreme hardship and\
      \ injustice, the corruption that can come with power, struggling to find onself\
      \ and self worth, etc. I have a major in religious studies, and this felt like\
      \ an attempt at a deep conversation. It succeeds at being intelligent and darker\
      \ than most stories I've played... but almost to it's own detriment.\n     It\
      \ gets repetative until the characters split about 1/2 way through. The seriousness\
      \ of the subject matter makes a lot of the lovey relationship moments seem weird/forced.\
      \ The romances almost don't fit into the story. It switches between tragedy\
      \ and the struggle of man to a cute scene where the MC and LI help the other\
      \ wash their hair or something. The art is usually very good with a couple scenes\
      \ being a bit blurry and off looking. The MC is forced to be lawful good most\
      \ of the time. Overall, I wouldn't say to actively avoid it."
