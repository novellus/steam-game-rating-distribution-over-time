    review: 'The base game is just great, that''s for sure.

      Some of the DLC''s are also pretty good too.

      Most of them are just cash-grab trash, tho.

      This small DLC is simply alright in my books.

      It gives you some additional playtime value.

      The new tomb challenge is actually decent.

      And the small story expansion is good too.

      There''s also a brand new outfit and a bow.

      Overall: This is a pretty decent dlc for sure.

      It''s a part of the definitive edition, amazing.

      Buying this on its own would be a mistake.'
