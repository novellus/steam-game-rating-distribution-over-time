    review: "This dlc gives the illusion that you have a lot when there's really not\
      \ much. The art is, yes, very nice, but this is not worth how much it costs.\n\
      \nPros: \nNice art\nHas sprites, big character art, and just the faces. So cross-style\
      \ compatability I guess.\nThere's a rad cowboy/girl hat.\nIncludes animations/a\
      \ guide on how theirs work but that also leads to a small con. See below.\n\n\
      Cons:\nAnimations are a bit confusing to figure out - and while I commend them\
      \ for even having this, there aren't enough options to justify making an animation.\
      \ If I spend all this time figuring out how to make animations with your sprites\
      \ and then I can't even use them to make a full-length game - what's the point?\n\
      You'll have to manually edit everything, if you were unaware of that. Every\
      \ little piece of the characters is separate from eachother.\nNot many options\
      \ as previously stated. Two female hair options with two recolours - while there's\
      \ only ONE male option with two recolours.\n\nOverall: Just not enough content\
      \ to make something with it. Not worth 8 dollars. If you really like it - get\
      \ it on sale and make sure you have some drawing experience because you can't\
      \ make due with only using what the pack offers.\nI'm in the process of a refund\
      \ right now."
