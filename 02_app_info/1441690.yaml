    review: 'I believe this to be a work in progress at this time.

      Played with the HTC Vive and XBox Controller,

      Vive controllers are useless at this point in time.

      Very Relaxing and Meditative Journey through a beautiful landscape.

      Options to turn off and on the dialog and I recommend the dialog, I did love
      the sounds of the running water and the animals. The movement of the plants
      in the wind is very well done. Make sure to look around so you do not miss any
      of the animals. Selections for time of day are very nice and my preference was
      morning which I really enjoyed.

      Tried first with Ultra graphics but did not do so well with a Nvidia GTX 1060
      so I changed it to Detailed and it played fine. You really need a XBox or Steam
      controller because I can not see how you can adjust with Keyboard settings with
      a Headset on unless you use it before you start the journey. Would be nice to
      be able to use Headset Wand controllers.

      If you enjoy a Beautiful and Meditative experience. You will enjoy ZendoVR.
      Good Price too.

      Thank you very Much'
