Although you see a lot of the same enemies and obstacles as you progress, the level design and rapid gameplay loop keep you from ever getting tired playing.  The bits of dialogue sprinkled throughout the levels help give the game a lot of character as well.  There are occasional difficulty spikes, but they aren't ever really unfair.  The game also has a simple but robust level editor that you can open up while playing any of the levels to make your own edits, or start a new level or campaign from scratch.  \n\nThe only feature I wish it had was an added \"boost\" button to give you some extra oomph at the cost of more fuel.  It would have made some challenges I faced a little more fun to overcome and could make for interesting speed-runs as well.\n\nIt [i]is[/i] early access, so expect a few *extremely* minor bugs, but this is an extremely fun and well made game overall!","timestamp_created":1608496098,"timestamp_updated":1608496098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwrdX1wPYCf7nluwI="}
