Beat it in about 15 mins. Still had fun so I am going back for more. Got it for 3.50 and it is totally worth it.\n\nThe biggest drawback I've run into is the mouse pointer isn't locked into the window on fullscreen. So sometimes when you are playing you may not realize your pointer is outside the window and your paddles stop moving. \n\nOther things I would like to see: More in level power-ups (such as guns on the end of a paddle that lets me shoot at bricks), more levels, and the ability to keep going after 10 levels. I do understand that this game is $4 and it is worth it for that price already so anything after the current iteration would just be a plus.\n\nIn short: Get this game - it is fun, cheap, and a great way to lose 15 mins playing a game.\n\nEdit: I've come back and played some more after a year or so, and the mouse lock problem I was having has been fixed. I SHOULD have pointed out in my original that my monitor set up is one above the other, which could have been the issue. I still stand by what I said prior: Get this game, it's cheap, fun, and even if you only play for 1 hour before deciding you're done you'd still get your money's worth.","timestamp_created":1531377297,"timestamp_updated":1599122580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1532128967,"developer_response":"edit: Thanks to mixer.com/Janoria, we were able to troubleshoot the mouse issue and there's now a patch for this issue live now!\n\nGlad you liked the game!\n\nThe mouse pointer should be locked to the game board at all times, so I'll look into why it's not happening for you.\n\nI've got a missile upgrade in the works but having a prestige mode sounds like a really fun addition because once you're at the end of a run it could be wild to restart again with everything you've got. \n\nThanks for the suggestion!"}],"cursor":"AoJwosTIqfQCfcztpQE="}
