    review: 'Man I just love this train so much...

      I mainly love the trains in this game including this one that comes with the
      special ability (TS PRO) as in saying it''s so realistic!

      Just to give some examples what TS PRO vehicles like these do is that IF your
      going 50 MPH or higher than 50 and decide to apply the brakes all the way (
      100% Emergency ) the wheels on the locomotive no matter if its a Diesel, Electric,
      or Steam locomotives will lock up and sparks will fly from the wheels of the
      locomotive as your sliding down the rails... Plus with locomotives of any type
      that have TS PRO icon beside the DLC image that also means that it is harder
      to control but hopefully you should get a hang at it...

      And another example. lets set your just idling and not moving once on spawn
      or whatever you were doing that had to make you come to a complete stop... If
      you put the Reverser to full forward or full backwards and put the Regulator
      at maximum ( 100% ) the wheels on the locomotive will over spin and will display
      a warning saying "Wheel Slip" now that''s not a bad thing that just means when
      you take off you just have to be mindful of the Throttle-( Regulator ) and/or
      the Reverser....


      And also one more thing! About vehicles with the TS PRO icon in the image of
      the DLC of any locomotive the Interior of the locomotive has a Special Feature!
      All controls inside the cab of the locomotive that have TS PRO icons are fully
      functional! Just for examples, Bell, Whistle, Levers, Knobs, Buttons, Switches,
      Windows, Doors, Gauges, Realistic Animations. and many more that are all functional
      and can be used or messed with but be careful you could screw the vehicle up
      and could cause damage. ;) Not that like you would want to damage a TS PRO locomotive
      and end up having a game error that takes you out of the current Session that
      you were in but i''m just saying, Be careful, Genital, Cautious, and possibly
      be aware if any issues you might encounter! Anyways... With TS PRO locomotives
      of any kinda the cab controls are fully functional! every single control within
      the cab works! and you can use them! :)


      There are probably other things that the TS PRO vehicles come with but that''s
      all I wanted to point out for people that are looking for interesting vehicles
      to drive... And to make a challenge for yourself as well. I fully Recommend
      these type of vehicles including this one with the TS PRO logo beside it! Have
      fun! and thanks for reading this long Review by me!
