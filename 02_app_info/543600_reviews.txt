I've been to many haunted corn mazes and haunted houses, and playing this gave me the same thrill without the hassle of travelling, bad weather, ticket fees, etc.  I absolutely love the artwork and effects.  Great sound ambience and effects as well.  The locomotion movement wasn't difficult to grasp and it feels good the faster you move (you can feel the air move).  Best played on a crisp cool autumn night with the windows open.  Love it!\n\nPlayed on HTC Vive Pro / GTX 1080 Ti","timestamp_created":1604038612,"timestamp_updated":1604040073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48qOPvPUCee//qgI="}
