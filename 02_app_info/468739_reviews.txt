If you guess wrong, you lose a life. But if you guess right, you either gain a life or someone else loses a life. The trick is, you can never ever see your own hand. The round goes on until one player has died or your hand is empty. There's also 4/36 cards always faced down, and that's never revealed unless you chance it and guess/cast a 2/36 spell to reveal them only to your own hand.\n\nI play tested this with my friend Goury and can imagine having more fun with more people.\n\nAlthough this game doesn't use cards, the same principles applies to gameplay and holding tomes is part of the charm of guessing wrongly and calling BS to statistics.\n\nCaveats:\n\nThe automatic deal button doesn't seem to account for rotation of tomes which leaves it clearly visible if the player's camera is orientated the right way. If everytime you get dealt cards you can see your own hand, it defeats the core gameplay mechanic. Host should find and download a blindfold mod and blindfold the player manually, then deal a person their hand.\n\nCaveat Fix: I edited the original lua script to add the blindfold automatically to trigger for whoever clicks it for 2 seconds when you deal your own hands to avoid seeing the tome slippage. New Round triggers a 5 second blindfold that will prevent all players from seeing their own hands from tome slippage. Go in game save a copy of Abraca... What?! into your save game then go to Modding => Scripting => Global => Lua => Global and paste [url=https://pastebin.com/xL3Vfp53]This pastebin link[/url] and after overwriting original script. Load that save to play the fixed version.","timestamp_created":1606975285,"timestamp_updated":1606979820,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnsPdk/YCeLj2tgI="}
