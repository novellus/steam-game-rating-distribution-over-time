I really had a lot of fun with it. Took me back to when I was a kid just starting my love for RPGs. If I had to come up with any negatives they would be that characters missed enemies more then I liked and I would have liked some legendary armor unless I just didn't find them. Thanks for an awesome game. I will be checking out other games you make. Also I played Nightmare Mode and it was hard at times but still way too easy towards the end.","timestamp_created":1601658496,"timestamp_updated":1601658496,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5325203537940979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwKSS9fQCdbu3pQI="}
