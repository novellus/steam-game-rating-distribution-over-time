    review: "A fairly well-implemented (UI etc) version of one of my favourite mathematical\
      \ puzzle types.\n(Similar to \"the 24 game\", with different numbers, and different\
      \ quantities of numbers - but sadly, much easier)\n\nI'm just over halfway through\
      \ after 1 - 1.5 hours, and my main thought is that it needs more puzzles that\
      \ are ranging from slightly to quite a bit more challenging.\nEspecially more\
      \ puzzles where the solution isn't just to reduce most of the numbers to 0 or\
      \ 1, and then add or multiply those.\n\nI do wonder whether it would benefit\
      \ from Steam Workshop - so that players might add custom levels with a higher\
      \ difficulty.\n\nOverall, hard to say whether to recommend or not recommend\
      \ this title. \n(When on sale, because of the ease of the game & low-ish amount\
      \ of content - 100 levels, probably doable for most in 2-3 hours)\nI have a\
      \ feeling most other people will get bored - most of those who like this type\
      \ of puzzles will probably find it boring after a short time from being just\
      \ too easy.\nPersonally, I am craving for this type of game/puzzle, so that\
      \ helps me to still play it - and even so, I play it in bursts of just 2 - 8\
      \ levels at a time, often disappointed at the difficulty."
