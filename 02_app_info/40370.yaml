    review: It's a real time strategy game that's not focused around a businesses
      venture or military movements. If you're bored of the typical strategy game,
      I would definitely recommend this game. It offers simulated aspects of all forms
      of first response. EMS, firefighters, law enforcement officers and utilities
      workers are the four primary first response uniforms that hold up their respective
      countries all over the world. As a Paramedic for 15 years now, some of these
      calls are legitimate, and some aren't even close, but it's definitely fun and
      you should give it a shot!
