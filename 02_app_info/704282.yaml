      \ with the fall of the Iron Curtain which had divided Europe since the end of\
      \ the Second World War, many changes to traffic took place throughout affected\
      \ nations. New cross-border and inter-city route opportunities were able to\
      \ be considered, and the Austrian Federal Railways (\xD6BB) sought to take this\
      \ opportunity to procure new and able traction.<br><br>Existing locomotives,\
      \ such as the \xD6BB 1063, were capable of crossing borders, however their limitation\
      \ was top speed, rendering any form of express services impossible. To work\
      \ around this, a development of the \xD6BB 1146 was specified, resulting in\
      \ a new series of electric locomotives, capable of 175 km/h, to be built between\
      \ 1993 and 1994. These new locos, of which 18 were delivered, were classified\
      \ as the \xD6BB 1014.<br><br>The \xD6BB 1014s were unlike anything else seen\
      \ before them, with traditional looks swapped out for an all-new, modern design,\
      \ fitting for express traffic into the 21st Century. The fleet of \xD6BB 1014s\
      \ originally worked out of Vienna, however they would soon be seen across Austria,\
      \ frequently visiting enamouring countries on cross-border passenger and freight\
      \ services, as well as heading more local duties.<br><br>Despite their success\
      \ in service, the \xD6BB 1014s were also considered a very unnecessary and expensive\
      \ purchase; with such a small number in operation, the decision was made to\
      \ retire the fleet in 2009, only half way through their intended service life.\
      \ They remained stored for several years, before finally being shipped to Romania\

    review: "Upon giving this further attention, i have worked around some of the\
      \ things. \n1. use the auto start up sequence and save yourself some frustration\n\
      2. turn off the indusi system. \n\nThis of course still leaves the subpar sounds\
      \ and bizarre traction (wheel spin at 100kph on flat track??) issues but you\
      \ can at least somewhat predict them and work around. \n\nThe window shades\
      \ now move. I am not sure if there was a patch to address some things in the\
      \ 2 years that have passed since. So thats nice at least. \n\nStill a not recommended\
      \ due to the weird traction behavior and sounds are lacking\n\n------------------------------\n\
      \nI am a big aficionado of this locomotive.. collecting them in physical Ho\
      \ an N scales, also all sorts of publications and what not about them. Only\
      \ natural i get this in virtual form as well.\n\nPros\n- Interior looks ok.\
      \ Not fantastic but ok for something that came out in 2018, even with TS engine\
      \ limitations its just ok looking. \n- its a 1014\n\nCons\n- operation is a\
      \ combination of clickable buttons and keyboard shortcuts\n- sounds are either\
      \ too loud or too silent.  alerter? whats that? cant hear it.. zing e brake\
      \ for you!\n- has decent amount of bugs. it loves to just not go. as if the\
      \ throttle is not always communicating \n- wheel slip. dear holy trinity! on\
      \ snowy weather this thing cant pull itself. it will literally lose traction\
      \ and go from 80 to 0 in no gradient places and just get stuck there. it will\
      \ not restart. you cannot move it when it stalls. not backward, not forward.\
      \ remember the throttle thing? yeah... it just goes south and you have to reset\
      \ the scenario.\n- sander seems to have no impact whatsoever\n- the dynamic\
      \ throttle/brake lever that OBB is so famous for using on all tractive power\
      \ is completely screwed up too. so is loco brake and even train brake. basically\
      \ lots wrong with all control systems on this one. \n- nothing moves in the\
      \ cab. no windows, no shades, no mirrors (you dont model the pop out mirrors\
      \ on these? really? wow)... \n- the radio screens are black squares (left side\
      \ of the panel) that are superimposed atop other textures.... jesus\n\n\nbuggy\
      \ as sin. only buy if you really just want the 1014 in the game. and if you\
      \ really really really want it. otherwise RUN AWAY FROM THIS GARBAGE"
