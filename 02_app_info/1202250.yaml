    review: "LUXAR is about the journey of an organic being floating in maze like\
      \ levels while trying to survive, overcome obstacles and solve puzzles. \n\n\
      So the controls are what you'd expect from a game about floating, they are \"\
      floaty\". It takes some time getting used to them but once you get the hang\
      \ of it game becomes quite fun. You can move the organism in 3D space, up/down/left/right\
      \ and forward/backward. With these controls you solve puzzles in the game to\
      \ reach the end point of the level. Organism needs air to survive and if air\
      \ runs out you die. You have to be alert when it comes to traversing the levels\
      \ because you have a limited supply of air and you can add on to that air supply\
      \ to a certain limit, that limit depending on the difficulty you play, by being\
      \ close to tiny blue orbs. These orbs are finite however so you have to manage\
      \ your air supplies well enough to finish the levels.\n\nThere are enemies that'll\
      \ damage your air supply, make you slower for a short amount of time and there\
      \ is one enemy type which'll instantly kill the organism if it touches it. You\
      \ can evade these by being quick to change your direction of motion.\n\nFirst\
      \ few levels are easy, very easy to teach you the basics. But as you progress\
      \ life gets hard real quick and I have a problem with this part of the game.\
      \ Levels get really long after a while, like 5-6 minutes each and if the organism\
      \ dies you have to start all over again, this is not fun because later levels\
      \ can be really hard and doing the same stuff from earlier parts of the level\
      \ over and over again is boring, the game could definitely use a checkpoint\
      \ system. The last level is the worst when it comes to this, a level where you\
      \ escort another being, have to watch your route so it doesn't kill itself following\
      \ you by tripping over some laser, have to watch for your air supplies, to top\
      \ it off the level takes a good 10-15 minutes and there's no shortage of traps\
      \ and challenges. Just pure insanity I dropped it there before finishing it.\n\
      \nThe puzzles in the game are mostly going from one place to another in mazelike\
      \ levels to open the next part but there are a few that needs you to think and\
      \ those are really well thought out.\n\nArt of the levels are fine but i feel\
      \ like it could use different styles for later levels, like the variety would\
      \ help it.\n\nTLDR:I'm still going to recommend it because puzzles are fun,\
      \ OST is great and once you get the hang of the controls it's fun to guide the\
      \ organism through the levels. Just be aware that it's a bit on the harder side\
      \ on the difficulty scale."
