    review: "Since there's only a skeleton anno 1800 community on steam there are\
      \ really no reviews of DLCs. So let me try to describe my experience and help\
      \ those that can't pick them all or are scared to invest more money.\n\nSunken\
      \ Treasures most importantly adds a brand new and dare I say most crucial region.\
      \ Trelawney. You are getting access to a large maps with a monstrous sized island\
      \ that will accommodate you. period. You won\u2019t play a single game long\
      \ enough to fill this island. It\u2019s just that big. And that\u2019s good\
      \ as it will become your capital rather soon and should be your focus from the\
      \ start of the game to relocate there.\n\nWith this DLC you get access to this\
      \ region obviously, but also story connected to it. I won\u2019t spoiler anything,\
      \ but the story while sometimes a bit boring is at times really interesting.\
      \ Especially that it does hint a lot about relations between the Empire and\
      \ La Corona (that\u2019s how plebs calls it ;)  ) Very enjoyable for fans of\
      \ Role Playing. \n\nExpect that you get access to famous Junker that is in every\
      \ game and his wares, and some of these are extremely useful. Of course you\
      \ also get chance to hunt for sunken treasure which if you invest time an money\
      \ will be not only lots of fun, but also profitable and it transcends regions\
      \ and DLCs!\n\nSumming this up Trelawney is your base of operation for the entire\
      \ game. While it\u2019s totally doable to play with your old islands and win\
      \ game or building great cities, the sheer scope of Trelawney will be sure to\
      \ make your Capital memorable and most importantly it will help a lot in all\
      \ sorts of expeditions. \n\nIf you want to buy only one DLC go for this one.\
      \ It\u2019s about the most crucial one! Of course if you prefer a different\
      \ region such as Arctic or Africa (not release as of yet) then go for it. But\
      \ personally I believe you should develop your Capital here first and then explore\
      \ these new lands with economic powerhouse at your back. That way you will really\
      \ feel like imperialist! I give this DLC 10/10 I\u2019m honestly not having\
      \ any problem with it!\n"
