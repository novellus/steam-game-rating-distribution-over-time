    review: Really entertaining and challenging, far off from the base game to the
      point were I had to came up with new strategies in order to beat this short
      but difficult DLC. Totally woth it, a nice expansion from a great game. I'd
      recommend it to everyone who enjoyed Die Again, altough I'd advise to expect
      some difficult levels.
