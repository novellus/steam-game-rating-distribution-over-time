I have put about 30 hours into the game so I qualify for at least a first impression.  First and foremost, if you are looking into buying Agarest you have to realize that you are buying a dating sim (although simplistic) wrapped up inside of an RPG.  The objective of the game is to defeat the boss of each generation and then to pick one of your companions to mate with so that you can continue towards your ultimate quest which spans multiple generations.  Each generation will have you playing as the offspring of the last hero and companion that you picked.  This is the story all wrapped up short and sweet.\n\nThe appearance of the game is a mixed bag.  The CG (as they call it) are actually still shots with text that carries the story forward.  The art and quality of the images are amazing (subjectively speaking).  This remains true for the towns where you will spend your time crafting and upgrading weapons/armor.  The battle system where you will spend the majority of your time shows the age of the game.  The graphics are comparable to the Playstation 1 capabilities.  Your party of heroes are cut down to chibi size and some of us who may be spoiled by newer generations of games might be slightly let down here.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the battlefield is where you will find yourself 90% of the time.  This is both where the game shines as well as where the game begins to lose its glimmer.  To start off, the battle system uses a turn-based grid system with both a move phase and then an attack phase.  Each character uses Attack Points (AP) that they expend by both moving and attacking.  The shared expense of the AP for both phases adds a strategic element to the gameplay.  Obviously you would regret not moving your party member in a effort to conserve AP to find out that now your character is too far away to initiate any attacks against the enemy for example.  The most strategic element of the battle system is the inclusion of a linking system which in short allows you to string attacks together. \n\nThere are some negative things to say about Agarest.  You will find yourself fighting the same enemies over and over and over again.  The battleground where you take on enemies will change into new scenary but only when you enter new areas which can take hours to advance through.  This redundancy of core game mechanics dulls the experience and soon you will find yourself selecting the AutoBattle mode whenever you can putting your attention elsewhere.  This becomes increasingly frustrating if you sludge through eight or nine battles fighting the same enemies in the same battle area just to be awarded by a 10 second still picture of a character who you are not interested in.\n\nWith all this said do I recommend this game?  Well yes and no.  It depends on what you are after in this game.  If you are wanting the experience of a RPG similiar to other AAA titles that have branded themselves as must plays... then No.  This game falls short in too many areas.  Although the game opens up with its own crafting/upgrading system and many achievements to work towards, the gameplay is not diverse enough to keep the traditional RPGer happy.  However, if your main reason for buying this game is to see attractive Anime girls appear on your screen, collect trading cards/backgrounds, and/or enjoy casual dating SIMs this game could be for you.  The artwork is stunning.  The content shifts from mild to erotic which will please many fans.  If you are going to give Agarest Genertions of War a try just don't go in expecting more than what it promotes itself to be.","timestamp_created":1385489781,"timestamp_updated":1607986133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":48,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.76979905366897583","comment_count":14,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gKfcsfYCdsLSHQ=="}
