I just can't help myself, I feel inspired. Or, in Motte-speak: \"Help myself I can't, I feel inspire.\"\n\n   The first problem with this game is the apparent lack of anyone on the design team who can speak English. This I don't mind, but surely someone in their broader social circle could have offered to do a quick proof-read of the game before releasing it commercially to the world at large?  \n\n   Hell, they could've asked the average six year-old on the internet. Pretty sure THEY would've worked out by now that \"Maids are fight each other but suddenly stopped and tremble in the presence of Sarah\" isn't a proper sentence. You do get used to it, though; we've all seen the Star Wars films, after all. It's just a shame that Yoda-speak isn't exactly conducive to maintaining a mood of spooky unease. But this is hardly the game's biggest impediment to greatness.\n\n   The 2D, top-down perspective in a horror game is a brilliant idea. And when this game gets dark, and the flashlight comes out, it's definitely some eerie shit. But in broad daylight the character animations look, well, about as good as those in Hotline Miami.  \n\n   The only thing is, Hotline Miami was an incredibly fast-paced, splatter-happy ode to visual crudeness and uber-difficulty which seemed to know precisely what it was trying to achieve. Which WASN'T \"scaring\" you...which, granted, this game still does surprisingly well at times, mostly on account of the aforementioned flashlight effect and the frankly awesome soundtrack. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that the super-disturbing soundtrack pretty much SAVES this game at times.\n\n   What about the gameplay, you ask? Well, it's nice enough, especially if you're a fan of action-adventure orientated \"survival horror\" games of the Silent Hill / Resident Evil ilk, as I surely am. But there's a LOT of back-tracking, and after a while you get good enough at simply AVOIDING the endlessly-respawning nasties, and the combat is mostly a case of finding one good, accurate spot to stand and mashing the mouse buttons.\n\n    I even managed to kill the first Boss with a baseball bat, 'cause I haven't yet managed to pick up a gun despite all the bullets I'm now carrying. I mean, I keep killing bad guys carrying guns which they shoot at me, but for some reason my character seems uninterested in picking any of these pistols up. I assume I haven't missed an all-important gun placement elsewhere, but I'm not even sure it matters if I have, since I can apparently kick Boss butt well enough with a melee weapon. \n\n   Just in case it's sounding like I'm not digging this game, let me assure you that I actually am. And I'm assuming it's not gonna be the longest game in history, so I probably WILL see it through to its conclusion. \n\n   What am I gonna find there? Well, probably nothing too great story-wise, 'cause despite some early promise the story seems to be getting sillier by the hour. But it's got mood aplenty, despite the aforementioned problems, and the moth-y motifs and mysterious island setting certainly make for good horror fodder. \n\n   I think it might be overly generous to say that this gets three-quarters of the way to its potential, but let's be nice and say it gets two-thirds of the way. Hence the number below, slightly rounded up in the interests of encouraging future product from these admittedly promising designers. \n\n   Happy bug-swatting.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.","timestamp_created":1397238927,"timestamp_updated":1498652135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":44,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.706288754940032959","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45Zmo99wCcdqrJQ=="}
