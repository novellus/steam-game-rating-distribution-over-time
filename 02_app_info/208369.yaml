      \ can also turn its hand to passenger work, and now you can take control of\
      \ this powerhouse in Train Simulator. <br><br>The Class 67 diesel electric locomotive,\
      \ nicknamed the \u2018skip\u2019 by railfans, was originally designed as a replacement\
      \ for the Class 47 to haul high-speed mail and passenger trains. Built in Spain\
      \ between 1999 and 2000 by Alstom with a General Motors engine and transmission,\
      \ initial tests proved the Class 67 to be capable of over 140mph. However, the\
      \ locomotive\u2019s heavy axle load led to a 110mph speed restriction on the\
      \ class until modifications to the bogies allowed a safe operating speed of\
      \ 125mph. The locomotives are still restricted to lower speeds on certain routes\
      \ and particularly at under-bridges because of their axle weight. The engines\
      \ and running gear are the same as in the Class 66, but with higher gearing\
      \ to allow faster running. <br><br>These 90-ton locomotives can be found pulling\
      \ freight trains, running Thunderbird passenger train rescue duties, hauling\
      \ the Caledonian Sleeper and even pulling the Royal Train. The Class 67 for\
      \ Train Simulator features a highly-detailed cab with accurate controls including\
