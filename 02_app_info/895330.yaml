    about_the_game: In this game you have to find your way through the ranks of cars
      that were parked not the most successful way. Huge trucks and simple passenger
      cars block your way while you need to leave urgently on business. And no one
      can understand this mess except you. The number of moves is strictly limited,
      so think carefully before you move the next car!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/895330/extras/unblockparking.jpg?t=1532345278"

      it seems at first glance, because sometimes it is not clear how these machines
      were able to be in such a position, and even more so how to put in order all
      this chaos. Nevertheless, there is always a way out, and you are sure to find
      it. After playing this game you can easily cope with any, even the most difficult
      and confusing situation in the Parking lot. The game develops thinking and is
      suitable even for children, thanks to its simple controls.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/895330/extras/os.png?t=1532345278"

    review: 'This puzzle game has some issues : there are some bugs (sometimes, when
      you move a car, it does not increment de the count), and the controls are not
      perfect (to move the cars). However, there are a lot of levels, some of them
      being challenging enough that you will have to try a few times before resolving
      them. The other ones are pretty easy.

      In the end, nothing fancy, but the core game mechanic works well. This puzzle
      game is enjoyable to play and I would recommend it if you have a couple of hours
      to spend.'
