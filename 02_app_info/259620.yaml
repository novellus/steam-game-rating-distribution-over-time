    reviews: "\u201CThis is an amazing game! I love the combination of a procedurally\
      \ generated voxel world with intense action &amp; RPG elements. The grappling\
      \ hook and anti-gravity pack are a lot of fun and add an interesting dynamic\
      \ to the game. I love exploring the seemingly infinite world to find new items\
      \ and situations.\u201D<br />\r\n10/10 \u2013 Swawa3D @ IndieDB<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\n\u201CJust want to say again that this is a great game! For those of\
      \ you who feel like its a minecraft copy just beacuse of the cube textures used\
      \ you really need to rethink what a game is about! The game play of 3079 is\
      \ nothing like minecraft it is pretty unique as well as how the weapons all\
      \ have diffrent stats and colors kind of reminds me of Borderlands. However\
      \ it is still an original idea for a game and i still play it from time to time.\
      \ You should at least try the demo and if you like it please buy it and support\
      \ fruit! :D Still give it a 9/10 ! Best Regards, Adam\u201D<br />\r\n9/10 \u2013\
      \ SeaNanners<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CAfter playing this game all day, all i\
      \ can think about is playing it more. It has an insane amount of replayability\
      \ and the difficulty is random. Which is refreshing. Some enemies are difficult\
      \ to kill and some are easy. The way the difficulty gets higher is based off\
      \ the distance from where you start. Which is great.\u201D<br />\r\n10/10 \u2013\
      \ Blackop2 @ IndieDB<br />\r\n"
