As it is now, the entire game loop is looking at rocks and plants, building a box, and hiding at night. When you've stared at enough rocks and plants, you can go find an alien nest and shoot it while they swarm you, the only challenge being bringing enough ammo.\n\nThe AI is trash. The prey animals pile up at your base because they cant path around the walls. The birds fail on the ground because they cant path a flight pattern. The enemies charge directly at you or your base core without any rationality and often get stuck. The combat isn't fun and is quite tedious.\n\nBuilding is mediocre. The block designs are bland and grinding out elements to build them is tedious. There's no real variety, and no real reason to build anything other than an armory, which is an early game item that lets you repair or replace the broken armor the game starts you with.\n\nThe controls are poor, you can easily kill yourself farming seeds by accidentally grabbing explosive eggs. You spend most of the time farming, and the animals are so dumb they block you by running into your harvest beam constantly. \n\nThe survival aspect is trash. You spend most of the game tearing out grass to find seeds so that you can cook your stockpiles of hundreds of meats. Then you stare at water for entire minutes to soak up dirty waters one by one, so that you can eventually purify them and they'll replenish 10% of your thirst. Its tedious for the sake of making you do something so that the devs can call this a game.\n\nHonestly im not going to buy anything from Flix after this. I feel like I keep opening this game just hoping it will be fun, only to wonder why ive wasted my life getting to an undefeatable point in less than an hour. I grind just to make myself feel like this was worth it, but it really isn't.\n\nIt seems as though the only thing the devs cared about was making the steam store page look decent.","timestamp_created":1609903014,"timestamp_updated":1609903345,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ41vHt6vYCcbnywAI="}
