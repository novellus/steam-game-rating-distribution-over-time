    review: "Edit : I have played it for 5 hours now and I my opinion is still the\
      \ same as it was before.\n\nClimbing works differently than you might have played\
      \ before such as in The climb or Climby, instead of selected grab points your\
      \ hands are Physics driven, you have three floating finger ends (like Rayman)\
      \ and a palm you need to use your grip to hold on to objects. \n\nThe game is\
      \ procedurally generated so each tower is different, there are no check points\
      \ so if you fall you need to climb from where ever you land. it plays a bit\
      \ like Getting over it but in VR\n\nThe environments are simple looking but\
      \ stylized in a way that I think looks nice, I have notice some small performance\
      \ hitches which are unexcepted for fidelity level.\n\nFor the $12 I played in\
      \ my local currency I really recommend the game especally if you like Climbing\
      \ games but you might want to make sure you have some good VR legs first \n\n\
      \nSince this is still in Early access some suggestions for the devs from me\
      \ would be to add some more music to the game and maybe an option to control\
      \ the tower height (and allow tall towers) maybe some incentives for reaching\
      \ to top (like a trophy modeled after the tower they just climbed or somthing."
