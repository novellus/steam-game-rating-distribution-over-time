    review: 'The base game and trickster expansion are more worth it but this is just
      an extra game mode for $8 and it is not that it is bad it is just super overpriced.I
      would say it is worth $2 to $3.


      Both expansions are worth $3 or less but this one is the worse of the 2.


      This expansion reminds me of Company of Heroes 2 in the main map style.Some
      might be into it more as it gives what you do in the main map carry over to
      the next levels more but I found COH2 to be too hards even on normal with the
      computer being too overpowered at some points.
