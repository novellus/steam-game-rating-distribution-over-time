    review: I was pleasantly surprised by this game and would definitely recommend
      it. During the first section I thought it would just be a horror game where
      you have to constantly run from the enemy, and not much past that. But I really
      enjoyed the story, I usually don't care about story when its presented in this
      way but this was actually cool. And the art direction/aesthetic was super cool
      too!
