After a couple of matches, a surprising tactical depth unfolds. Remote play together works well and is a good replacement for online multiplayer. \n\nPlayed excessively in local multiplayer on my friend's account, hence the short playtime.","timestamp_created":1603149536,"timestamp_updated":1603175267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4q6esovUCcLT6qAI="}
