And as a lover of both orchestral [i]and[/i] synth-y music, I'm hardly complaining. The price is also very reasonable, for eight perfectly decent-sized tracks.\n\n   Verdict: 8.5/10.\n\nUPDATE: Actually, this soundtrack is seriously growing on me. And how did I not notice the similarities to the Amnesia: The Dark Descent soundtrack before? Let's increase that Verdict a tad...\n\n   Updated Verdict: 9/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/​\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210​\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1562500909,"timestamp_updated":1577186749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544633984565734863","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pP3pm+8Cc6XTzQE="}
