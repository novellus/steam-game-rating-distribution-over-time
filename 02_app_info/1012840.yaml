    review: I experienced a number of frame drops, and interruptions in the game that
      caused it to start, stop, and jump.  But, even without taking those into account,
      the story needed to be much tighter.  It seemed to be a jumble of scary tropes
      thrown together.  I was very much looking forward to this game, but in the end
      felt unsatisfied.  I admit it may be because I feel the intersect of stellar
      and lovecraftian horror is rich with opportunity, but ultimately I felt let
      down.
