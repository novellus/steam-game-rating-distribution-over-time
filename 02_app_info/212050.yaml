    review: "I liked the game and I can recommend it to other people, BUT.....\n-as\
      \ all Wadjet Eye games \"Resonance\" has a very annoying tendency to getting\
      \ freezed once in a while. \n-some of the puzzles are HORRIBLY HARD/UNREASONABLE\
      \ to solve. I have been forced to look into Walkthrough when it comes to ornate\
      \ safe puzzle, because if I really tried to solve it properly it would take\
      \ me a year or more - each of the \"colors\" has so many different steps to\
      \ take properly that you either must be very lucky to solve them or just try\
      \ till doomsday. It kills fun. \n-I get what the creators had in mind when they\
      \ allowed us to take care of all 4 characters but it's really frustrating when\
      \ you click time after time on \"follow me\" multiple times when you want all\
      \ group to follow you. \n\nIf you're really good at solving hard puzzles then\
      \ go for it. Or if you want to have fun with really interesting story this game\
      \ offers us, but you're not scared to look into Walkthrough for time to time.\
      \ Otherwise it's not for you."
