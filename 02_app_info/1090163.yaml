    review: "false advertising:  It does not instantly makes Season Pass 2 Characters'\
      \ Ninjutsu accessible to your character. You have to get Season pass 2 first.\
      \ \nWhen I asked for a refund, they blocked me from entering the game. So, I\
      \ have to get a pointless DLC so I can reenter the game. The support team plays\
      \ coy and tells you where to buy the DLC so It's a scam.\nDo not get it if you\
      \ do not have the Season Pass"
