      sinister. <br>As a member of the Golden Tooth Company, a famed band of treasure
      hunters and mercenaries for hire, you are the latest to attempt to plunder the
      depths of the stronghold, in your quest for untold wealth. What you were not
      told is that many before you have tried, and all have failed. <br>In the depths
      of Milrendir something evil stirs, and is growing more powerful by the day.

      claim the riches that lie beneath?<h2 class="bb_tag">Procedural Dungeons</h2>Smash
