It is excellent as a novel... but it falls a bit short on the visual half of the genre. And it's essentially kinetic. There are 3 choices, but they do not appear to change the story much. The worldbuilding is also great? The setting reminded me a lot of [i]The Last Remnant[/i], a game I loved. Another game it reminds me of a bit is [i]An Octave Higher[/i]. There are some similar themes, but I liked this much better overall.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2014583838\n\nI think I saw maybe one? typo in the whole thing which is impressive really. Characters are complex. The story is complex, without being difficult to understand or follow. It isn't happy, but I often like the sad stories, and it ended fittingly. Loose ends are generally well tied up, and the mystery is explained as well as the character behind it can tell you.\n\nOn the visual side... it has no CGs. The character sprites are nice, and I like most of the outfit variants. However, there are not many poses for the characters, (examples of variation include hoods when they're mentioned, a violin for Vale, a rifle for Mero, and fighting poses for everyone) and when they're performing actions, things tend to look a little odd. Moving around, and using abilities looks fine. Fighting is really well written! But it doesn't look like fighting when no one has fight poses and there's often no enemy sprites. There are also some unique creatures mentioned like sephies that I would have loved to see illustrated. It could also have used a bit more background variety. What exists is well done. But there isn't a whole lot of variation. The start menu is also a little basic, though the UI is serviceable, and the text box is nice. The music also fits the scenes well.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2015751880\n\nOverall, I liked it despite the gripes I have regarding the appearance of it. If this were a book, I wouldn't really have any complaints? It's a neat story. But I hope the team can do just a bit better on the visual side in their next release. Cause the writing is excellent. Would recommend this to people who like western VNs with more serious/sad plots.\n\n[quote][b]Follow our [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33853800/]Curator Page[/url] for more Reviews and feel free to join our Visual Novel, JRPG & Anime Group [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/OtomeSekai]Otome Sekai[/url][/b][/quote]","timestamp_created":1583569748,"timestamp_updated":1609195926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.676308751106262207","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn6bj1fYCf//I9gE="}
