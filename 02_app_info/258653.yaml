    review: "Overall: flat route, nice midpoint and endpoints, boring straightaways\n\
      \nGraphics: the stations are modeled quite well, no glaring issues with them.\
      \  The bridges and catenary, especially in Manchester, look pretty cool.  The\
      \ scenery is pretty nice to look at and the cities are quite fun to see.\n\n\
      Trains: The 158 is not much different from previous releases of the 158.  It\
      \ sounds as good as a DMU can be expected to sound.  I'm not a major fan of\
      \ it, but it's an alright train for this line.  \n\nRoute: From Manchester you\
      \ go on a cool brick bridge with views of the city and some pretty nice stations\
      \ to boot.  It's slow but it does pick up once you pass the stadium.  After\
      \ that there's a long boring straightaway; it feels like a chore to drive this\
      \ section.  The midpoint at Warrington has a brick bridge and is curved, giving\
      \ you a nice view of the town.  Beyond that is another straightaway that is\
      \ not particularly scenic.  There's a ramp that takes you to a mainline section\
      \ that then leads straight to the tunnel right into Liverpool Lime Street. \
      \ If there's a highlight, it's the endpoints and the middle; the rest is just\
      \ more boring.  \n\nScenarios: These basically introduce you to the route. \
      \ I haven't found any gamebreaking issues with them.  They're alright overall."
