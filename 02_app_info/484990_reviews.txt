I've had this for about a year, and it's the closest thing you'll have to a controllable dream.  Music is absolutely amazing, and it changes with your flight and speed.  Favourite activity was to just hurl around asteroids, but there's a lot more you can do.  Flying is fun, and every object in the game has different physics to them.  There's a demo, or free version, also, so try it out.","timestamp_created":1514772272,"timestamp_updated":1514772272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwuNLd1+ACe8W8lAE="}
