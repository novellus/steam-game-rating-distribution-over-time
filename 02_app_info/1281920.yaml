      and timing as you wield the ability to summon weapons and cast offensive magic!
      Face off against a variety of enemies, from the ruthless soldiers of the Ward
      clan to the menacing Vagabonds. Every challenge will highlight your resilience

      /><br><br>In the distant future, the warrior called Jaena is tasked with eradicating
      the machines which reside on an artificial island. In order to stop them, she
      must explore this uncharted territory and uncover the mystery behind what her
      enemies have been planning for the past several centuries. But this is no easy
      task; many obstacles block her path, including the towering Vagabonds, weaponized
      robotic golems that were built for war, and a maniacal cult leader who has earned
      the title &quot;Nomad.&quot; As this quest becomes personal, the challenges
      will test Jaena's resolve and threaten her humanity, the only quality which
      separates her from the machines she had sworn to destroy. Your only choice is
      to cut through your enemies, prove your worth as a warrior, and claim control
      over the Aalegan Isles.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1281920/extras/rsz_irseperator_becomewarrior.jpg?t=1604595661"
      /><br><br>As Jaena, you must master the legendary Bladerush ability in order
      to take the fight to the machines. Summon a dagger, and throw it in any direction.
      Your power is linked to the blade, and its strength allows you to pull yourself
      towards it at a high velocity. This flying leap is the core purpose of Bladerush,
      and it is a necessary tool for gaining an advantage in combat, as well as exploration.
      The potential is endless--throw your dagger into an enemy to soar towards them
      for a quick attack, or keep a blade hidden somewhere safe for a quick getaway.
      You can even chain Bladerush jumps to stay airborne for long periods of time,
      flying through the air for as long as you can manage your mana resources. This
      power is yours to wield. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1281920/extras/IronReckoningStoreGIFFinal.gif?t=1604595661"
      /><br><br>Massive leaps through the air can get you close to an enemy. But to
      deal real damage, you'll need to wield Jaena's signature broadsword, Claymore
      V. Timing is everything, waiting for the ideal moment to strike as you create
      opportunities with offensive magic and movement skills. How and when you summon
      your weapons will be key in discovering your strategy for eliminating your foes,
      and clearing the island of the machine threat! <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1281920/extras/rsz_irseperator_features.jpg?t=1604595661"
