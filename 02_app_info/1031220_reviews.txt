They have both interesting story and a good looking world.\nHere...you don't see much NPCs....the world is rather dull. And the fights are boring. Mostly you will fight one or two different groups of 4 enemies. No random encounters...you see them and if you fight them they are gone for ever.\nThe only question for the fights is....using skills or not. If not, the fight will take up to 2 rounds. \nIf you use skills/magic its done in one round but...because there are so many of them you must use potions or the replenish points *rare*. And that means that after every 10 - 20 rounds you leave the dungeon and travel back to the last replenish point. Or, later in the game\nyou take a few hits and fight the *long* 2 rounds fight. Fun fact, you maybe know that in most\ngames certain enemies are imune against a spell or take less demage. Well, not here. Every\nenemey takes the same demage...that is at last a good point because your mighty mage\nhas only 3 spells (level 16).\nLoot...only a few exp. and coins and seldom a potion. \nBut its the layout of the dungeons.....they are boring. Grey walls, next to nothing furniture and long passages.\nAnd I mean real real long narrow passages.\nFor the extra dungeons...till now I visited 4 of them...urg, they are even more boring....and you get only a few skill points and some extra equipment.\nOh, and don't hope for the dynamic party system....so far this contains only that after every break the characters change the walking order of the party.\n\nSo my points are: boring gameplay, dull graphics, next to nil interaction, no secrets, linear gameplay (dungeon, optional extra dungeon, next dungeon).","timestamp_created":1583543242,"timestamp_updated":1591051253,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.615476250648498535","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40O6CufICfNjB9gE="}
