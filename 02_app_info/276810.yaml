    about_the_game: '<strong>Mordheim: City of the Damned </strong>is the first video
      game adaptation of Games Workshop''s cult classic tabletop game Mordheim. Set
      in the Warhammer World''s decimated Empire city, Mordheim: City of the Damned
      is a turn-based tactical game where you lead warbands into bloody and lethal
      skirmishes. The game blends RPG elements, fast-paced tactical combat and intricate
      unit customization in a time wrought by chaos and rivalry where only the strongest
      survive. <br><br>After a twin tailed comet crashed on Mordheim, the City of
      Damned turned into a terrifying battlefield where rival warbands fight fiercely
      for the control of key neighborhoods, looking for glory and fortune by acquiring
      the very valuable Wyrdstone fragments. <br><br>Choose from iconic Mordheim warbands
      - Sisters of Sigmar, the Cult of the Possessed, Skaven, Mercenaries from the
      Empire - and lead your troops to battle. Recruit new units, equip them with
      enhanced gear. Evolve and customize your warband with the experience gained
      from each successful mission, transforming them into a terrifying force on the
      battlefield. <br><br>Devise the best strategy to annihilate your rivals. If
      you fail, some of your units might lose a limb... or worse. Keep in mind that
      in Mordheim: City of the Damned, a dead unit is lost forever! Consider the environment
      when formulating your battle strategy, exploiting the unique buildings, ruins
      or the layout of the streets. Deploy your troops carefully and anticipate the
      actions of your adversaries to set up ambushes! Organize ingenious battle plans
      where the talents of your units will be as important as your own luck during
      key moments of combat. <br><br>Loot items and weapons hidden in the ruins, or
      steal those of fallen opponents. Survive the dangers that abound in the City
      of the Damned and collect as many Wyrdstones as you can, but remain ever vigilant.
      Mordheim is one of the most treacherous places in the Warhammer World! <br><br>In
      these epic battles where fame and glory await, your strategy will definitely
      be your best ally! Visit the four corners of the City of the Damned to complete
      multiple missions in the solo campaign, or challenge other players in enthralling
