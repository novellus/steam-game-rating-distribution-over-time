This is truly 16 bit classic JRPG magic.\n\nPositives:\n- captivating story that 'sucks' you in, you want to continue playing to discover the story\n- well written dialogues\n- well chosen soundtrack\n- no grinding necessary (enemies are visible) but people who want to grind can choose to do so\n- nice variety of character / personalities\n- well balanced although on the easy side (for me difficulty was fine)\n- well dosed use of humour\n- good game lenghth (not too short, not too long)\n\nnegatives\n- lack of variety in enemies\n- lack of interaction with objects!\n- only stock RPG Maker graphics (not a negative at all for me personally)\n- game is too easy for players who like a challenge\n\nOverall: an excellent RPG game, warmly recommended for people who like narrative driven games.\n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1586691795,"timestamp_updated":1601488990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw89WL8PQCfqaXgAI="}
