    about_the_game: "This is game is about a very difficult journey through life and\
      \ mental health issues. It tries to emulate the chaos of the mind finds itself\
      \ in very difficult situations in life. It is sort of a personal journey with\
      \ a minimalistic approach and chilling atmosphere anyone can relate to. It leads\
      \ to rage and the desire to quit and give up. You will want to quit this game!\
      \ You probably will quit this game! It will induce rage and in that prove it's\
      \ point. The hardships in life are hard and only through trying and getting\
      \ back up again, trying time and time again and fighting through the impossible\
      \ odds you may reach the end. The end? If you've ever had such a situation it\
      \ will bring you back there, it may make you feel bad, down, enraged and it\
      \ will try actively to put you back down in the depths of depression and self-doubt.\
      \ And, then... things will change... Just like real life... Without spoiling\
      \ too much... Prepare to hate it, rage over it and complain how unfair and stupid\
      \ some things are and I assure you the life is much like that. But those who\
      \ endure reap the benefits!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the gameplay side of things:\
      \ It is a skill-based platformer. It features procedurally generated levels\
      \ with a story. There are many different enemies and obstacles. There is a secreted\
      \ in the game that can be discovered in a very complicated way, do not spoil\
      \ it if you find it (shhh...)! Click to shoot and space to jump with WASD movement.\
      \ There is a shop mechanic and a high score. It features a beautiful atmosphere\
      \ and unique hand-drawn characters. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you were to compare\
      \ it to something it would be like Super Mario if he was a super depressed ninja!"

    short_description: 'A psychological game about hardships of depression, life,
      being stuck, enraged and unable to fight. Unable to find the reason to continue
      and touches the dark side: The rage, hate, denial and definitely the wish for
      it to stop and for you to give up... But that''s the easy way that leads nowhere...'
