    short_description: Would you like to know what the landscape will look like in
      the sky? In this animation, you will stand in the Floating Island,to see the
      water, waterfalls, huge flower trees... What do you think will happen in a miracle?
      Is it possible to witness the life of two &quot;little Dough people&quot; with
      our own eyes?

    review: 'I really love supporting independent VR efforts, especially artistic
      ones, but this just isn''t worth $11.99... maybe $1.99, but even that would
      be a bit much for the content here. Really sad to have to request a refund on
      this one.


      Zero interaction... 100% VR animated film... which would be fine, but the film
      isn''t that great. The entire movie is 12 minutes long and the storyline just
      isn''t engaging. Additionally, the animation quality is choppy and the voice
      actor audio is of terrible quality... it sounds like it was recorded on a cellphone
      from a bathroom stall. The music soundtrack seems to cut in and out randomly
      and ends in hard cuts rather than transistioning nicely from piece to piece.


      The one highlight is the main character and set designs... really cute with
      a lot of potential, but they''re wasted on the poor animation and delivery.
      None of the characters have any life or detail to their animation.


      Devs... please put some polish on this and maybe I''ll revisit. I''d love to
      fund your further efforts, but this doesn''t show the attention to detail that''s
      going to be neccessary for you to succeed.'
