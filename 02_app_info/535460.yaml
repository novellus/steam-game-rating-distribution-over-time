    about_the_game: This is a VR experience which shows how virtual reality can invoke
      an involuntary response. I created the first scene - the canyon - as I wanted
      to demonstrate the effect to friends without having to guide them through a
      game to a suitable point. It was so effective I wanted to expand on it. This
      is very much aimed at being an experience you can keep in your library and bring
      out to show new users - it isn't a game so there aren't any challenges in it,
      and will have less effect on veteran VR users.<br><br>The current stationary
      scenes are:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A wooden bridge over a canyon<br></li><li>A
      narrow ledge on a cliff<br></li><li>The top of a building in a city<br></li><li>Being
      in a dark passageway with only a flip lighter<br></li><li>Being trapped underground
      with the walls closing in<br></li><li>In the ocean surrounded by sharks<br></li><li>On
      a window cleaning gondola on the side of a skyscraper</li></ul><br>There are
      also scenes which include player movement:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Performing
      a base jump<br></li><li>Swinging round a city with grappling hooks</li></ul>

    review: Very cool, felt like i was playing one of the original DK1 tech demos,
      because i probably was, fun and definitely incited physical and mental reactions,
      very good to show people vr, worth the dollar i paid
