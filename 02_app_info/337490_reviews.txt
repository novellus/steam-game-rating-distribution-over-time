I didn't even realize it was unskippable the first time because I watched it all, but the second time, I really had no desire to wait for five minutes with nothing to do.\n\nSo, that taken care of, I enjoyed the game.  It took me two hours for the main game and two hours for the New Game+ mode.  I enjoyed both and thought that the mechanics were quite neat.  It felt like it did a good job introducing new mechanics and then exploring them.  And it moved on to the next thing before you got bored.  I didn't really get the ending, but otherwise, I recommend it.","timestamp_created":1609562839,"timestamp_updated":1609562839,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532967031002044678","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/fra4PYCfYXPvwI="}
