    review: "The long awaited sequel to the sequel of one of my favorite franchises\
      \ is back! Unfortunately, not better than ever. \n\nWhy? Well you see for all\
      \ intents and purposes, this game lies to you yet again. \n\nIt tells you how\
      \ you are a Gangsta Sniper. But you are in fact not a sniper. Aiming and shooting\
      \ does not make you a sniper. It makes you a gun user.  Gangsta Gun User. Now\
      \ I forgave the first game for it not having a sniper and allowed the developer\
      \ to use that feedback to fix it in the sequel \"Gangsta Sniper 2:Revenge\"\
      . But when that game came out, there was nary a sniper rifle to be used in the\
      \ game despite in the description that it said there WAS a sniper AND rifle.\
      \ \n\nThere was not a single sniper rifle in the first two Gangstra Sniper games\
      \ and I made it clear that I would not stand for this.\n\nThe developer has\
      \ had THREE chances to fix this. They say that the third times the charm, but\
      \ this is just lucky charms without marshmallows. And the cereal has been sitting\
      \ out for five years. And the spoon is a sniper.\n\nDo not buy this game. It\
      \ is a lie. Yo uare not a Gnagsta Sniper. You're a False God.\n\nYou will not\
      \ be able to live your dreams as a Gangstya Sniper."
