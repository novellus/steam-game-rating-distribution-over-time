I liked the demo.  I purchased this game because of the demo and the \"cool\" looking graphics and style.\n\nAnd then...  I quickly discovered a lesson I've learned long ago with games.  \"Don't judge a book by its cover\"\nWhile this game seems to take its inspiration from the movie \"World War Z\" and it has frantic, fast, and relentless zombies... it quickly turns into nothing more than running in circles kiting the zombies over and over and over and over and over and over.  \"Zombie Kiting 2020\" would have been a much more fitting name for this game that in the end is about as shallow at that ditzy blonde we all knew in high school.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4fgvOJtdLo&feature=youtu.be\n\nI really did want to like this game.  But it just fades too fast and lacks any depth what-so-ever and this makes it lose it's initial luster very quickly.\n\n- There are no power-ups, no different guns to buy or earn, no character upgrades of any kind, nothing to craft, no bosses, no real progression that makes you feel like you're advancing in any way.  Ugh.\n\n- While I understand this is a zombie shooter, some kind of story and reason for why we are here would help\n\n- Three maps and many different waves of zombies, but it doesn't matter what map or what wave you advance to, it's just the same thing as before.. run around in circles until all the zombies form a line behind you allowing you to stop and shoot, run and reload, stop and shoot, run and reload, stop and shoot, run and reload.. rise and repeat 1,000 times over.  Zzzzz.  It looks \"cool\" and the graphics are awesome, but it just quickly loses it's initial burst of appeal.. kinda like a cool firework that looks amazing for 3 seconds and then you're left looking into the cold night air.\n\n- Another game that proves once again that we need to STOP judging games, movies, books, and people by what they look like at first glance and start searching deeper.  This game scored a perfect 10 out of 10 score from me in the \"graphics\" department, but because it's so damn shallow in gameplay and depth, it only mustered a total score of a 65%.\n\nNot Recommended... unless the price drops to $3 or under OR the developer(s) adds substance to the game to keep it interesting and make it something other than running around in circles kiting the zombies over and over and over and over.","timestamp_created":1553933235,"timestamp_updated":1553960872,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.683306992053985596","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhKXS5+kCeJGSvgE="}
