So good for relaxing with some music and just chilling out. qop is made by the same Dev as ZUP probably the most well known of these games. Unlike ZUP there is no timing or luck involved here. Just find the correct route and take your time. No reason to rush. I really like the inclusion of a Dark Mode as i do find heavy white backgrounds quite harsh on my eyes so that was appreciated.\n\nLike all of these games it comes with the usual load of nicely made achievements icons designed to be used in a profile showcase. A nice bonus for an already good game.\n\nI got it in a very good bundle deal for all 4 qop games with Shoot, Push, Portals and Shoot, Push, Repeat also from the same developer.\n\nI just completed the first qop and look forward to playing the others and seeing what else Quiet River Games release in the future.","timestamp_created":1609826458,"timestamp_updated":1609826458,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmcvI6PYCcNzOwAI="}
