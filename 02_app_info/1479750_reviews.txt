It just seems like an unnecessary step to opening the portal to the next level.\n\nJumping off the walls is inconsistent, and feels even more strange given that you can give yourself a lot of height, but not a lot of forward velocity. Also a little buggy, in certain cases I would rotate around the walls when attached to them.\n\nNeeds a cross hair - launching the ball forwards is good, but if you just miss a jump it's a bit hard to replicate the velocity without a cross hair. \n\nA few jarring transitions - mainly just when loading levels and restarting the stage (though I can understand this if just for the sake of getting the player back into the action without a pause). \n\nCould use some music.\n\nThe sheer amount of achievements is also not needed, getting one every time I finish a stage takes the \"achieve\" away from them. \nGreat performance, not a demanding game at all. \n\nOverall, concept is cool and is fine for a first game, though the mechanic inconsistency made me want to stop playing as it felt like I was just repeatedly yeeting balls at the wall until I got lucky and got it in just the right spot. If these are fixed, then I may return to finish.","timestamp_created":1608994506,"timestamp_updated":1608994533,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.611686408519744873","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46IXjz/YCcp60vQI="}
