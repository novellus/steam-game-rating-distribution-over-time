    about_the_game: TcNo TimeKeeper helps you shorten the time you spend editing a
      video by helping you remember exactly where you need to be in the video. Stop
      spending time scrubbing hours of video, and work on a better final product.
      (This is NOT editing or recording software, you still need those to record and
      edit videos as usual)<h2 class="bb_tag">Who is this for?</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>
      Livestreamers<br></li><li> Podcasters<br></li><li> Video creators (YouTube,
      Vimeo, etc.)<br></li><li> Video editors (If the creator uses TcNo TimeKeeper)</li></ul><h2
      class="bb_tag">Features</h2><strong>Save storage space:</strong> If no times
      were noted before the end of the recording, you'll be presented with an automatic
      option to delete files created after the recording started individually or altogether.<br><strong>Controlled
      easily:</strong> Setting hotkeys correctly will allow seamless integration with
      any recording software.<br><strong>Remote control from any WiFi and web-enabled
      device:</strong> Use a phone, tablet or even another PC to control the program.
      This makes it perfect for those without direct access to a computer while recording,
      such as in a podcasting situation.<h2 class="bb_tag">Compatible with every recorder
      and editing software</h2>The program outputs times you record into a text file
      or .csv, for later use. If you don't edit your own work, send this as well as
      whatever else you need to an editor and they can use the times. The program
      does <strong>not</strong> interact with recording or editing software directly.
      You still need recording and editing software, this does not substitute either,
      it's purely another tool to help speed up the editing process.<h2 class="bb_tag">How
      do I use the program?</h2>While recording content (on any device with any software),
      have TcNo TimeKeeper open. When something noteworthy occurs that you or an editor
      needs to come back to in editing, press the hotkey you assigned to make a note
      of the time. When you or someone else is editing the video, they know exactly
      where to go and don't have to spend hours scrubbing through video finding good
      parts, missing hundreds on the way. Spending less time searching allows creators
      to create better final products.<br>The program is lightweight, and designed
      to run in the background, without interrupting the user; making it perfect for
      Livestreamers, Podcasters and content creators alike to use it, without the
      audience even knowing.<h2 class="bb_tag">Easy to understand</h2>The program
      was created to be simple, and understandable by anyone. Once downloaded, set
      up the hotkeys you want, and if possible set the start/stop recording hotkey
      to the same as your recording software, so they both start simultaneously. While
      recording press the note keys to remember certain moments in the recording.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Does it work with X or Y recording/streaming software?</h2>The
      program works independently from recording software. It doesn't matter what
      program you use to record, heck you can even use hardware if you want. The program
      just suggests that you set the hotkeys to the same as your recording software
      for ease of use, it doesn't matter what software you use at all. This works
      with any and all recording software. If however there are issues, I'm always
      working on improving the program.<h2 class="bb_tag">Does this program record
      or edit video? Will I still need recording/editing software?</h2>No, TcNo TimeKeeper
      does <strong>NOT</strong> record, edit or interact with your video in any way.
      Yes, you will still need recording and editing software for video creation,
      as usual. This program is here just to help you better know the footage you
      record so that when you or an editor gets around to editing, they can simply
      skip to where they need to be and edit faster. When you use this tool and make
      note of important events as you're recording, you'll be able to quickly find
      them in the hours of footage you record. When you spend less time looking for
      good content in footage, you'll have more time to spend on polishing the final
      video.

      The program was entirely broken for a short while, but was fixed.


      The program should be fully functional now, and easy to use. If you''re still
      interested, give it another try, or reach out to me via Steam if you''ve already
      refunded the game and would like another key.


      Sorry for any inconvenience.'
