(Some CGs aren't available in the gallery)\n[*] Lack of compiled information for reference. With a story like this that has so many unique terms and variables to keep track of, it'd be nice to have an option in the menu for people to refresh their memory if they've forgotten what something means.\n[/list]\n\nIt's definitely an excellent visual novel despite its flaws. If you've read Brilliant Shadows, definitely follow up with this!","timestamp_created":1597217565,"timestamp_updated":1597217565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.636442005634307861","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lL3l8PMCf5z6mgI="}
