      videogame for single player. Player act as a man, looking for something in the
      desert. Wandering, breathing, memory appeared, about her. He start imagine,
      and impatience won't let him rest. At the top of the dune, he saw a crystal
      tree. He can't tell. He is confused. Painful memory appear again, he remembered
      she is gone. But can't remember what he is doing. Unknowingly, he step on a
      crystal bridge. An exit door appeared. He is afraid and happy at the same time.
      But wound last night is still occupy.<br>    Dazzling glare, frozen ground,
      weak breath, he remember that desperate morning which have no relative with
      her. The river of time never came back, only thing shows up is their past. More
      clear the memory is, more pain he will suffer. Untill he saw the emptiness.
      Huge doubt occupy his heart, what is real?<br>    Nothing is real, except memory
      about her and every breath.<br><br><br><strong>A story about the Breath.</strong><br>    My
      first time have the feeling that air in this world is so thin is about one year
      ago. Almost all air around me is gone like there is a high power exhaust fan
      is working by my side. I am nearly breathless. If there is an oxygen meter,
      maybe it will show the same level with the Himalayas. So stuff like breath which
      is so familar become very serious. My body is suffering, happiness and joy is
      go away. Finally, I quit this suffering journey, back to home and staying with
      girlfriend and cat, and it's possible to take a breath.<br>    What strange
      is, I didn't analyze this thing like I usually do. On the contrary, I didn't
      think. And air around me become more plentiful. Maybe I am in the Amazon forest
      now. Someday, like a drowning man suddenly learned how to tread water, struggling
      let his head out of water and take a good deep breath, an unsttopable passion
      suddenly appeared in my head which tell me in my head &quot;God, I eager to
      tell someone about this.&quot;<br>    This passion, is where the Breath came
      from.
