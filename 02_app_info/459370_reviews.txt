Its an isometric voxel based action game where you go through levels and complete objectives and kill enemies so its pretty fun. There's 9 stages and you go through the levels and you do different objectives and talk to npcs and you pick up more weapons and you also unlock skins which you can switch to at the start of every level. There's a whole bunch of skins to find so if you want to collect them all that helps with replay value. You also get a score after you beat a stage and each stage has a boss to kill so yeah pretty fun little game. Quite short though, was able to do everything in around 5 hours so  unless you wanna collect the rest of the skins or get better scores there's not really much reason to play more. The annoying things about the game is every time you attack you move forward and certain enemies damage you just from touching them so that makes it quite annoying. Luckily though there's ranged weapons so that can make it a bit easier. The game itself is super easy like when you die you just respawn and the level hasn't reset or anything so you can die as many times as you want and still beat it so pretty much anyone could beat this game. Would be nice if it had some difficulty levels but oh well. One annoying thing is after you beat a stage you have to wait around for a 30 second timer for some reason, the game does have coop but it even does it in singleplayer so that's a dumb really. The game runs very well though I must say, solid 144fps and computer is quite as a mouse so pretty good. Overall not too bad, couple of issues, would like a bit more to it for the price but worth getting on sale. 7/10","timestamp_created":1609997674,"timestamp_updated":1609997674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505208373069763184","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4dzV7fYCfp6ZwQI="}
