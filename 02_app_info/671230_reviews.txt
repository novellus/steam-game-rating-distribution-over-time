If you like short VNs with nice art and likeable characters, this VN is for you. There are caption typos but the strength of this VN is truly in the artwork. Dialogues can be improved but that should be an easy fix. I would suggest creating other VNs for the other characters apart from MC. For instance, Clustre, Atalica, and the Guchi girl all look like they could have their own VNs centered around them. The story in the 'other world' where MC was transported was quite short but I thought that was okay because it's not a multi-season anime like Fairy Tail.","timestamp_created":1563227109,"timestamp_updated":1563227109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46Jbm++sCd5y5zgE="}
