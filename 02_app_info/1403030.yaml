      \ wood, ore, fiber, and so on provides<br>the necessary materials to craft increasingly\

      \ the use of a tool to harvest; for example an axe to<br>chop down a tree, a\
      \ shovel to dig up a plant, or a pickaxe to mine a rock. There are<br>common\
      \ resources like wood and stone but for more advanced crafting recipes the<br>player\
      \ may have to scour the world for rare biomes and materials such as the bog<br>providing\
      \ vital peat and bog-iron. Diverse world biomes motivate exploration and can<br>affect\
