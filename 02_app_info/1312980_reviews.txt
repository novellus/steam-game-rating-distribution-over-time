Engine can be a bit buggy. Flightmodel in normal flight is ok, but spins are not realistic at all (plane should exit spin as per handbook,  very hard to rock out of a spin in game)\nCockpit looks mostly good, outside model is medium quality. Could be a fun model, but needs fixes before it is worth its price.","timestamp_created":1589984868,"timestamp_updated":1589984868,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.611895143985748291","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6vaemfICf5KFiQI="}
