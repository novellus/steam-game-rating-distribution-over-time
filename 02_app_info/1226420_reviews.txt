I'm still not sure what exactly I played. I should have read the store description better which talks about a narrow bridge. \n\nThat's really the whole game. You cross a roof-top bridge. Otherwise a fish eats you. So far either the fish has eaten me or I got stuck on the bridge without being able to move. I don't understand the locomotion or this game.\n\nYou start out like in a visual novel almost. You can't do much. You can view the 3D environment around you. There are some minor animations, but it's mostly just viewing a static scene. Then you can finally move around at the rooftop. I fell off at least 3 times. Then I got suck on my last attempt, without being able to move at all. Is this meant to be a room-scale experience? Does your flashlight move you forward? Are you able to use full locomotion to clear the bridge? I did manage to fall 3 times using full locomotion, but not on my final attempt. \n\nWell, whole thing takes like 3-4 minutes. Game just starts out of nowhere and ends the same. You'll be having to restart the game for subsequent attempts at this bridge crossing. I even had trouble starting the game straight from the Steam library. I had to start from within Steam VR.\n\nDid I have fun? No. Was this an interesting experience? No. Was it pretty to look at? No. At least it was only .99 cents and I could see it was going for something unique at least. Maybe the full game will be better. I won't refund although I probably should.\n\n[b]Rate 4/10. This should be free to play. I would have given a 5/10 if it were free.
