Generally, the puzzles and hidden-object scenes are also less interesting. The story starts strong, but loses coherence in the late game as it struggles to bring together an overly complicated plot. The characters are also less fleshed out, which may be part of the problem. The bonus adventure is especially weak as it rushes through with very little context.\n\nStill, it's fun to play. Just make sure you start with the superior first game!","timestamp_created":1543552707,"timestamp_updated":1543552707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m6W6secCeO+HtAE="}
