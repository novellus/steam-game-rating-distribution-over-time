The game is complicated by some points, including the lack of ammunition and the impossibility of fast crafting.\n\nSo far, the game is a little raw, of course, but the developers are constantly working on the game and improving it. Large objects have a \"soapy\" effect. If you like more difficult games, then this game is for you!","timestamp_created":1595923609,"timestamp_updated":1609669559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.641820549964904785","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4rYjy4/YCfb+CmAI="}
