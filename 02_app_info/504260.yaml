    review: "Weeks ago, I found this game by accident on the Steam store. I shared\
      \ a link to it with a friend just to joke about how weird it f#cking looks.\
      \ He joked about gifting it to me as a joke, and at the end days of the Summer\
      \ sale, he actually did it. And holy f#ck, what a let-down this thing is. Now\
      \ sure, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect from it, but the whole game falls\
      \ flat on my opinion. And as I usually do, I'll start by talking about it's\
      \ negative points.\n\nFirst and foremost, the gameplay. It's f#cking boring.\
      \ Have you ever played Arkanoid? Then this is it. The bulk of the gameplay is\
      \ the exact same f#cking thing. And the worst part is, it's easy as hell until\
      \ you reach higher levels, however to reach higher levels you gotta keep playing\
      \ for 10 minutes in a game where even when you try to get yourself killed, it\
      \ doesn't seem to happen.\n\nSecond, is the gimmick with the LSD-like effects.\
      \ Sure they look cool, but the novelty of them wears off stupidly fast. Here's\
      \ the thing: the game on itself is boring and easy, adding those effects makes\
      \ it nearly impossible to see what's happening... But it won't matter because\
      \ of you hold the trigger and move in one direction while spamming A, you'll\
      \ still last for 15 minutes despite not knowing what in the actual f#ck is happening.\
      \ What's the point of the effects? To make it harder? To look cool? Who knows,\
      \ but it really doesn't do much to enhance the gameplay, it's just there as\
      \ a selling point.\n\nThird, the price. 3\u20AC ain't too bad but you'll expect\
      \ a game this kind of average to get some sort of good deal during big sales\
      \ such as the Summer sale, which might I add, for most people it's the biggest\
      \ one in Steam. Well, not for this game. All it got was a miserable 15% discount\
      \ with is nearly unnoticable. I even though of buying the game myself before\
      \ the sale if it did get a good discount but 15%? Even games that got released\
      \ months ago got better discounts. And honestly, the game isn't worth neither\
      \ 3\u20AC or 2,40\u20AC. Maybe 1.\n\nLastly, the game looks... Kinda bland.\
      \ Not talking about the seizure-inducing effects, those look cool, but the rest\
      \ of the game? All enemies are a variation of smiley faces either straight or\
      \ turned upside down, the backgrounds rarely change the balls are those same\
      \ MS-Paint-looking smiley faces but green and at times with hats, most of it\
      \ looks bland as hell, like something straight out from the deepest parts of\
      \ the Steam Greenlight. \n\nDoes the game have anything good though? Well...\n\
      \nThe game works well with controllers. It's to be expected though, since as\
      \ far as I'm aware, it was released first on Xbox360 and then re-released on\
      \ Steam.\n\nThe dev/s did put a lot of effort on the LSD-like effects and the\
      \ sounds. And for that they should be deeply commended.\n\n...But I honestly\
      \ can't think of anything else. I haven't played this game much, yeah. But there\
      \ isn't really much to see before you've seen it all. The whole game is all\
      \ about some amazingly looking effects that don't really add up much to the\
      \ whole experience. Maybe it's fun to play this while high, who knows. But you\
      \ gotta be high as hell on my oppinion to play too much of it. I sure as hell\
      \ though, gonna tell my friend to look if he can refund gifts.\n\nTL;DR Edition:\
      \ Cool effects and sounds on an underwhelming pong game that's not even pong,\
      \ IT'S F#CKING ARKANOID with smiley faces all over the place. The whole game\
      \ is based around the novelty of having seizure-inducing effects that won't\
      \ let you see sh#t. It's a cool concept but executed poorly. Couldn't even stand\
      \ an hour of this thing before I got sick and bored of it."
