      \ /><br>The game takes place in alternative reality based on our world in the\
      \ late 1980s. Search through the abandoned factory owned by TECH-SHA Robotics,\
      \ an infamous company known for their interactive, humanoid robots designed\
      \ supposedly to help in everyday activities. Your task is to find hidden remotes\
      \ controlling the robots, discover the company\u2019s past and uncover all the\
      \ events that led to its collapse. Pay attention to your surroundings, there\
      \ is something else in the factory besides you...<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1452210/extras/headline2.png?t=1603398148\"\
      \ /><br>INPUT6 is a first person, short, fast-paced horror game. Your main task\
      \ in a single playthrough is to find all the robot remote controls. They appear\
      \ in different places in the factory each time you play. In addition, you can\
      \ also find items containing information that may help unravel the company's\
      \ mysterious history and uncover what led to its collapse. However, you need\
      \ to hurry - you have a limited amount of time.<br><br>One of the main mechanics\
      \ in the game is switching between the <i>inputs</i> - the game takes place\
      \ simultaneously in separate segments of the factory, which you can switch between\
      \ at any time. Switching can also protect you from a malfunctioning robot which\
      \ moves around the entire factory. After the robot enters your field of view,\
      \ you only have a brief moment to react - you must switch <i>input</i> as soon\
      \ as possible to avoid getting blocked from moving around the current segment\
      \ of the factory.<br><br>Additionally, you are also able to check the archives\
      \ where you can take a closer look at items found during the main part of the\
      \ game. Collect all of them and maybe you will be able to figure out what led\
      \ to the company's collapse.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1452210/extras/desc_image.png?t=1603398148\"\
