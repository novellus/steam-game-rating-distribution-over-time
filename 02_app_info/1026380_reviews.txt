Timer and text to show \"starting in XX:XX\" ...\n\nRecordings of the visualization have the potential to be used with video editing software to add more details to it.... overlays, screen, etc... \n\nLooking for a preset to set resolution to 3440x1440 or at least have a properly non-stretched 16:9 rectangle to capture a video with OBS or other software... currently the visualization stretches to 3440x1440 using the Fullscreen 1080p setting...\n\nExperimental windowed 2560x1440 looks great! I am using a 3440x1440 monitor and when I do full-screen it shows with less quality... not as \"sharp\" as the windowed 2560x1440...\n\nWishlist: \n- Option to use smooth edged bars (have different bar styles)\n- Ability to have different visualizers with a green screen so we can blend them on video editing software... This is instead of the 3D backgrounds...\n- Ability to import SVG shapes for which the spectrum bars can come out of...\n- Better alignment of settings on the top of the window, some text overlap (at leas\n- Ability to allow settings to display on the \"experimental\" resolution \"windowed\" screen.\n- Make spectrum bars reach way higher.... I have tried different music genres and audio sensitivity settings, and mostly only the lower frequencies make the bars on the left most side go up somewhat... makes for a rather \"uneventful\" visualization.\n\nThis is awesome!!!!! and has lots of potential!!!\n\nWould recommend.","timestamp_created":1606518607,"timestamp_updated":1606522651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4l8iNhvYCcdOBtAI="}
