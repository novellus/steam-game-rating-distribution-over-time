This game is hilarious.\n\nIt just makes you think about VR possibilities in the field of graphic adventures. I know the game is simple and easy, but it is just great! I loved the humor, recognized Rick and Morty voice acting immediately and loved the game from beginning to end. Would pay everything for a full game. \n\nI just hope graphic adventures come back with VR.","timestamp_created":1486692297,"timestamp_updated":1608821368,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540636062622070313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzLzOyvYCcubdcQ=="}
