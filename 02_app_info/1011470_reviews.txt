Although some people complain the game has no tutorial, i think the game is pretty straight to the point, and as some reviews mentioned, it is similar to Creeper World. The game is also one of the few games that has \"Networking\" to its theme.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, and the games has a Synthwave/Retrowave vibe. Although the gameplay its pretty entretaining, i think its price (at least where i live) its a little high...still got what i paid for. Some more content would be nice (different gamemodes like challenge mode).","timestamp_created":1608745203,"timestamp_updated":1608746658,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjb2xyPYCfefEvAI="}
