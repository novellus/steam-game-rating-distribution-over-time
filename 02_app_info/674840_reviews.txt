It is a crude facsimile of a real video game that from long distance appears to be the real thing, but the moment you look at it, you find out that it's at best painted cardboard.\n\nThe dummy game at first appears to have mechanics. This is a lie. The numbers mean absolutely nothing, the effect of everything is random, not even the purely arbitrary experience numbers add up correctly.\n\nThis phony game also tries to have quests with choice and consequence. As the game description puts it \"There are some antogonism rewards you will get by choosing a particular decision that favour one spiritual path. Choose to fight slavers, and a Paladin companion might join you, choose to help the slavers and you may get gold and a dark paladin in your party. Those are your choices, and it is up to you to shape the destiny of you character as well as Ethernalia course of events.\" This is in fact true, except this particular choice comes at a point in the game where the creator gave up trying to make something at least passably similar to a game and the player no longer has any real input.\n\nThe farce of choice and consequence is brought to a finish when the game stops referring to your character by the name you picked and just addresses you as Balder, the name of the protagonist of the self-published novel this game was based on. The ordinary post-Baldur's Gate roleplaying games usually give the protagonist some sort of title that can be used in voice acted sequences in place of a name. This game does the same in spite of not having any real voice acting. However, as it is a cargo cult game, it just crudely replicates the outward appearance without any understanding of the underlying purpose.\n\nBy the end of the game, the pretense drops off and things just stop working. Whole areas are devoid of anything interactable and blatant placeholders are everywhere.\n\nA casual look at the game might make one think it's a blatant scam. I, however, think that the creator is just too dumb to know what a video game is and is trying to make one based on seeing screenshots.","timestamp_created":1597283517,"timestamp_updated":1597283560,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.466847628355026245","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpJ3h8vMCdNGOmwI="}
