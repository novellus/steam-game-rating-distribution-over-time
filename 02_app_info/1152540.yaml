    review: 'I like the premise, but the execution is pretty bad.


      The starting area works well enough, with only minor hiccups. It''s when you
      go to the areas not shown in the demo, & especially outside the castle, that
      the game''s stability takes a nosedive. I found myself swimming in the air on
      more than one occasion in the gardens. I also noticed my snail count kept increasing
      & decreasing on it''s own, while the bush travelling behaviour is erratic &
      inconstant with the rest of the game. Frankly, it goes on, but I''d rather not.


      Sadly, I can''t recommend this game.'
