Playing it requires such intense focus, swift reflexes, and an almost psychic level of intuition that it puts you in a trance-like state which is enhanced by the surreal atmosphere of the liquid-fluid metamorphoses of the stages, each shaped in fantastical ways and littered with vividly colored shapes that burn their way into your brain and remain visible behind your eyelids long after you've finished playing.\n\nI've been a fan of Geometry Wars since it began as a mini-game within Project Gotham Racing 4 in 2007. I've watched it grow, each iteration improving on its core premise, and Geometry Wars 3 is leagues ahead of its predecessors as well as its peers. The production values are top-notch and the gameplay is finely tuned and addictive & varied enough to keep you playing for hours and continue coming back to it. From the gorgeous presentation to the unique & psychedelic level designs to the upgradable special abilities to choose from (each changing how you approach a stage and its enemies), it's clear the developers put a lot of time & effort into this. What impressed me most, however, were the variations on the basic types of gameplay modes and how they translate over to 3 dimensions. There are still flat-surfaced 2D levels, but on the 3D stages, you (and your enemies, the types and behaviors of which are vast) retain command of the entire surface which is shaped in creative ways and sometimes covered with strategically placed walls and interactive objects. This opens up worlds of new possibilities which the developers are constantly exploring. A recent update (in which \"Evolved\" was added to the game's subtitle) introduced an entirely new set of levels with multiple modes - an expansion easily worth $15, completely free. With the attention to detail and sheer amount of content continually being added upon, you really get the feeling that this is a labor of love for the folks at Lucid Games.\n\nA common complaint I've noticed is that the game is too difficult. When I first started playing this, I agreed that it was insanely hard and the learning curve too steep, but after spending a few hours with it, I felt increasingly comfortable and began to advance quite quickly through the adventure mode. A few days later, I revisited those early stages I initially had so much trouble with and wound up getting the full 3 star score on all of them with relative ease. It's true that the amount of enemies on screen at any given time and the frenetic pace at which the game operates can be overwhelming (as can the cheesy techno soundtrack), but it is not impossible. If you have decent hand-eye coordination and a twin-stick controller (and I must stress how important it is to use a modern, dual analog stick controller for this), you'll get the hang of it, and this is a game most definitely worth getting the hang of. [b]A+[/b] - sublime & genre-defining.","timestamp_created":1428512264,"timestamp_updated":1610109033,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598784208297729492","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4osP+8PYCd66eOg=="}
