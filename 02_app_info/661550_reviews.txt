However, this one is held back by a couple of minor issues.  First, a solid handful of the puzzle solutions come off as either random, illogical, or somehow misleading.  You can usually get past this via the traditional point & click method of trying everything on everything else, but on two separate ocasions I genuinely found myself ground to a halt and needed a hint.  The game has no built-in hint system, so this quite literally takes you out of the game.  Second, though the translation is entirely coherent, it's very often clear that the script was never edited by someone whose first language is English.  On the other hand, the game offers other language options, at least one of which is presumably fine on this point.  (I have a hunch the game would be best played in German.)\n\nOverall a positive experience if you're in the mood for an indie point & click experience.","timestamp_created":1517177350,"timestamp_updated":1517177444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514396011829376221","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6tK0n+ECcNu1lwE="}
