    review: Jesus! This is one of the BEST Games I've ever played in my entire life!
      I absolutely LOVED it! The old school graphics were Perfect for the game. The
      music was terrific, especially for the time period. The characters were all
      very interesting, as was the story line, then in the end you find out most of
      it was all true based on real history! What a labor of love this game is! It's
      so much Fun playing the same character, but with different roles throughout.
      There are many locations and it feels very much like a LucasArts style adventure,
      but with its own dynamics. The "puzzle" elements were always clever or at least
      made sense. And I learned alot about the real history of Coral Gables Florida.
      One of the Best games of all time Ever!!!!
