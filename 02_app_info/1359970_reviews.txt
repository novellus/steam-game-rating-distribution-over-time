Graphics are fine, music is OK, animations are meh, enemy IA non existent and story, I didn't gave it the chance.\n\nIA is the main reason I'm not recommending this game. Enemies seems to move randomly or using some kind of pathfinding algorithm in order to reach you, which some times is just painful. There's a boss who will move immediately after being hit, sometimes it will move in your direction... sometimes it wont, aaaand if you enter the room without a subweapon you can throw upwards you might end up dying of boredom waiting for the boss to move down so you can reach it. Also I don't recomend it because I hate instakill spikes...\n\nPS The game's not hard you just need to feel confortable with the controls... and the enemy behavior.","timestamp_created":1605494540,"timestamp_updated":1605494540,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7tC75/UCf8PTrgI="}
