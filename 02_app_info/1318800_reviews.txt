The moment you open it and begin the story, you don't want to put it down. It keeps you thinking about what is going to happen next.\n\nAnd, in my personal experience, it also makes you think about irl stuff an awful lot.\n","timestamp_created":1609727582,"timestamp_updated":1609727582,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw87PP5fYCc7SiwAI="}
