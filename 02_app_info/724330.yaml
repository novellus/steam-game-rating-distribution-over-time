      \ world simply known as &quot;The West.&quot; You're looking for whatever work\
      \ you can find--bounty hunting, smuggling contraband, running guns...maybe even\
      \ a little train robbery if yer so inclined. 'Bout anything to pay the bills,\

      \ from one Wild West town to the next, meeting interesting characters.  A few\
      \ might have a job to offer or cargo for you to haul. Others might be fixin'\
      \ to just shoot you where you stand.  At its core, Age of Grit is about the\

      \ careful thought to achieve each victory. A heavy cannon might do well against\
      \ a slow moving, heavily armored enemy, but perhaps a long-gun will be more\
      \ effective when gunning down a more agile opponent. A machine gun might be\
      \ powerful at first, but as the barrel overheats it's effectiveness will diminish.\
      \ With clever strategy, a weaker ship can typically bring down a much stronger\

    review: 'the game is still broken, no new fixes, and still lots and lots, and
      i meat lots and lots of bugs.


      Here is a couple the breaks the game;

      -Cant open the vendor store sometimes without restarting the game, which caused
      by somekind of trading bugs, where you cant sell to certain stores that buy
      the products the need for higher than purchase price of it somewhere else. This
      makes it really hard to make money in the game, and if you have very few ways
      to make money in a game it becomes ''game breaking''

      -Battles are bugged, especially scenario battles. In normal battles, your ship
      stops completely sometimes, and you can move only 3 clicks, b4 you have to repeatedly
      click the range and then engage button when world map traveling. And when you
      encounter the story battles, and you destroy the ship your battling, and it
      still has 1 hp left while its on fire of debuffed when you destroy it, the ship
      is destroyed but the 1 hp remaining still shows, which leaves you stuck in the
      battle... another ''game breaking'' bug.


      Im sure there are a ton more that i havent encountered, but those are the ones
      that i encountered in the first 2 hours of the game, and have restarted, deleted
      and redownloaded the game 8 times now b4 i got fed up with the bugs.


      This game has good premise, and has great game play ideas, and would probably
      keep it in my library, but looking at the slow update, it may take a while for
      the game to finish, so ill just not recommend it until many of those game breaking
      bugs are fixed.'
