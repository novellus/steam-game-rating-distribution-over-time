    about_the_game: 'A <strong>unique puzzle</strong>... a huge mad <strong>contraption</strong>
      to ponder over, made of upcycled things. Slowly and carefully work levers, pull
      cords, rotate wheels... observe the effects and deliberate, and gradually fathom
      its workings.  Work-out how to work small parts of the bigger contraption and
      eventually figure-out how to use it all together to bake a loaf of bread.<br><br>A
      tricky puzzle, but relax. Half an hour here, 10 minutes there...have a ponder
      and come back to it, sleep on it.  TraptionBakery is made to amuse, baffle,
      perplex and interest you for weeks.<br><strong>TOP TIP: move the levers <u>slowly</u>...and
      adjust your view to see anything the lever moves. </strong><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1292100/extras/traptionbakery_drawings_selection.jpg?t=1604503371"
      /><br>When you''re not in a puzzle solving mood just zoom-way-in, look around
      and marvel at all the crazy upcyclepunk things.  This game was a four year labour
      of love: programming, and drawing hundreds of things for the contraption. Hardly
      any drawing is there just for show, most of it has a function.<br><br>When you
      work-out how to bake bread then the <strong>simulation</strong> aspect of the
      game comes into play: you will be presented with a critique of how good your
      loaf was and you can improve your technique for better scores.  Could you even
      become one of the elite few world-wide to achieve a Master Baker''s Licence?
      (See achievements.)<br><br>TraptionBakery can be played full screen, or in a
      smaller window.<br>(TraptionBakery may work on computers with a slower than
      specified in the Minimum System Requirements but panning and zooming will be

      how on Earth you can bake some bread with it, or marvel at it's madness. Upcyclepunk

    review: I was after an indie game for grownups which would challenge me but also
      be addictive and quirky. A pretty tough wish list, and I spent a long time looking
      before I found this game. It's fiendish and quirky and humorous and very, very
      clever... Not sure if I'll ever beat it, but... No, I WILL beat it - I'm not
      going to give up :) And it's too addictive to stop playing, anyway.
