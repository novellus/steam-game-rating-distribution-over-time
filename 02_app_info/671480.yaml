    review: "It is hard to decide whether to recommend this one or not.\n\nI finally\
      \ decided on \"yes\", because it is an original experience.\n\nMokMok Episode\
      \ 01 is a short (verty short) trip into a fantastic world of sound and image.\
      \ The colors are beautiful, the animationa dn landscape are cool and dreamlike,\
      \ the music and sound effects are great. You are a blue crieature that must\
      \ follow a kind of wisp and activate musical critters in order to travel around\
      \ the scenery. The more you activate, the more complex the music they end up\
      \ making.\n\nMokMok is fairly intuitive and easy to use, and at the beginning\
      \ it displays some tips on how you can navigate through the world. \n\nI actually\
      \ enjoyed the experience despite it didn\xB4t seem too challenging nor much\
      \ of a game-game, I felt more as if I was in soem kind of sandbox.\nI did finish\
      \ teh episod eon my first run in under 15 minutes, and I was in no hurry at\
      \ all. That and the little sense I got of actually playin were my biggest drawbacks.\
      \ I didn\xB4t find the sounds especially relaxing either, so it is not like\
      \ a Game I would come ack to if I wanted to relax. Maybe other episodes will\
      \ change that, but not for now.\n\nBut still, the graphs, soundtracl and concept\
      \ were interestinge enough as to end up recommending it."
