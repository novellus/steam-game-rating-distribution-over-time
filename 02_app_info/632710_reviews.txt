But at the very least we got to see more of the 4 girls, Rise, Chiho, Ayaka and Ritsuko we all know and love and that's always a positive. While I was happy about Ruriko finally getting her well deserved spotlight, the ending felt pretty odd, at least to me. Nonetheless, I'm happy overall, especially since Princess Evangile was my first ever visual novel.\n\nAs for best girl... It's so hard to choose between Rise and Chiho. On another day I might say Chiho, but right now, I'd say Rise!","timestamp_created":1609367610,"timestamp_updated":1609367610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqZzy2vYCcfT1vgI="}
