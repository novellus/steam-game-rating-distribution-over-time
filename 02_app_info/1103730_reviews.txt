Love the cool characters their designs and funny dialog. Gameplay is fun with the right analog stick for combat. I wish I knew about this game earlier. I only found about it recently while searching for 4 player local co-op games. Had fun playing with the family during Christmas time.","timestamp_created":1609488397,"timestamp_updated":1609488397,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rP6+3vYCfO2qvwI="}
