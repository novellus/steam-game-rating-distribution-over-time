I would recommend this on a sale, this is my all time favorite route in my all time favorite country :3 Now just a quick rating:\n\nScenery: 5/5 \n\nLocomotives: 3/5\n\nLagginess (lower means laggier): 2/5\n\nPrice: 2/5\n\nDrivability: 5/5\n\nFun: 5/5","timestamp_created":1595754305,"timestamp_updated":1595754305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43sqXxfMCfNXPlwI="}
