Did Mordhau not live up to your expectations? Well i have the game for you! This game is 10/10, Indie game. The Devs put alot of hard work into the game and it shows, The game is well optimized and i get 30fps on my 1070TI more than i get on Chivalry and Mordhau! The game features 4 insane classes that have a very wide range of attacks and skill.  my personal favorite is the Archer and i get a bow and I can play to my liking, I am able to snipe from across the map with epic Aim, The game features insane animations and voice acting, I cannot recommend this game more! Its even better if you are Autistic cause it makes your experience even better, You however cannot reverse overhead wessex Cucumber your enemy. you cant feint either from what i can tell so its fantastic. I cant tell you how annoying Feints were, they broke the game as they did not make sense, I mean, stop your attack mid swing? Uh No. I would just swing until he is dead and bash my sword on him. Or Her, im not sexist or anything if you want to be a fem Knight go ahead in fact, ill be the one making food lololololol.","timestamp_created":1588891612,"timestamp_updated":1588891612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtr7U+PECcNClhgI="}
