    review: Hey, watch out - zombie are coming... But no, it looks like this time
      we will have to deal with a more dangerous enemy - BOOTS !!! Jokes aside, we
      have a brand new platformer made in black and white style. It may seem that
      you have already seen such games a bunch of times, and this one will not surprise
      you with anything. Well, you are partly right, of course, but I still decided
      to devote a couple of hours to this game and discovered a couple of funny things
      there. Firstly, the game really tells about the fight between boots and plants,
      but at the same time the protogonist here is a boot, and what is more, in HUMAN
      form, armed with a pistol with endless cartridges. It sounds absurd, but it
      is. In general, if you are looking for innovative gameplay, then this game is
      clearly not for you, but if you just want to pass a couple of hours cheerfully,
      you can safely take it for a rather modest price of $ 0.89.
