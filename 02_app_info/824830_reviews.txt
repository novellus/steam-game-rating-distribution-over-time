Except for 1 EX chapter and the characters that I also liked in the previous games there was nothing else that I would say was better than average.\n\nHorror\nThe vast majority of this game wasn't scary at all. Sure it scared me a few times but those were minor like in the first Half Life and that this is kinda weak for a horror game. Especially if the other 2 games were actually scary most of the time.\n\n3D graphics\nThe biggest factor why this game wasn't scary. It doesn't look good at all and is more laughable than shocking or creepy. The perfect example would be the row of heads that are in both this game and the first game. Just using 2D RPG style again would have been so much better than the new look.\n\nWrong endings\nThose weren't satisfying at all. Sure some wrong endings in the previous games weren't interesting too like the green skull ending in the first Corpse Party or 2 endings in Book of Shadows where you reach 100% darkening but that's it. In Blood Drive nearly all were forgettable and not shocking or dark. Most wrong endings happen when you fail an escape or similar things. If you ever die because of a phantom then you already know how boring these endings will be. There are no CGs and even rich text that describes how brutal the deaths are is a rarity. So these are typical game overs that are just called wrong endings.\nThe best wrong ending for me would be last chapter wrong ending 4 which was actually dark.\n\nMusic\nOH MY GOD WHY IS THE SOUNDTRACK SO BAD! The first game had one of the best soundtracks ever and Book of Shadows while not having many new tracks had some tracks that were good and for the rest just used the tracks from the first game. But this game had no good tracks at all. These were either just forgettable or annoying after a few loops. Also tracks like the infirmary track or similar that alone can scare you even if nothing happens aren't in the game.\n\nCharacters\nThe old ones are as good or bad as always but the new characters weren't really interesting and we also got Kuon Niwa who is with Yuka the worst Corpse Party character.\n\nStory\nAnd the biggest reason why this game and the 8th chapter of Book of Shadows should be ignored and not seen as canon. The new stuff with the witches and the cults just makes the overall story of the series just worse and I just can't take it serious anymore. The original lore was good enough and the expansion of the story wasn't needed.\n\nMisc\nThe fast-forward option is really slow thanks to the fact that the game now only fast-forwards dialog and never animations and your characters has only little stamina because of the chases that are just annoying after the 2nd time.\n\nEX Chapter 01\nThe only good thing that is new. It has more Kizami and Morishige in it. You should actually look it up online because it doesn't have much to do with the new story so playing Blood Drive isn't needed.\n\nTL;DR Just skip Blood Drive. Nothing of value except for that one extra chapter is in the game.","timestamp_created":1609725396,"timestamp_updated":1609725396,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwojH5fYCfbuhwAI="}
