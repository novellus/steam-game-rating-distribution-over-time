    about_the_game: "Several hundred years ago, a cataclysmic catastrophe nearly ripped\
      \ your galaxy apart - an impassable ring of torn hyperspace fabric appeared\
      \ in the center of the galaxy, which normal hyperspace engines can\u2019t overcome.<br><br>Since\
      \ this Event nobody has managed to get near the central regions of the galaxy.\
      \ All you know is that the Event also spawned multiple untraversable hyperspace\
      \ rifts throughout the entire galaxy, and that a strange race of aliens, the\
      \ Xsotan, has appeared in the center. It looks like these aliens have found\
      \ a way to cross over the torn hyperspace fabric, but so far nobody has managed\
      \ to establish contact with them.<br><br>There are also rumors about a strange\
      \ new metal called \u2018Avorion\u2019 which has appeared in the center of the\
      \ galaxy around the same time as the Xsotan have arrived. Apparently the aliens\
      \ use this material to build their ships.<br><br>Start out as a nobody at the\
      \ edge and work your way to the center of a galaxy that gets more dangerous,\
      \ but also more rewarding the closer you get to its core. Avorion takes sandbox\
      \ aspects from games like X or Freelancer, throws in co-op multiplayer and lets\
      \ you build your own ships. It features ships made of freely scalable blocks\
      \ that can be procedurally generated and that break into pieces where they're\
      \ hit in space fights.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/445220/extras/combat.png?t=1603115727\"\

      \ hunt down enemies for coin or even participate in wars between entire factions.\
      \ Once you\u2019re victorious, collect loot from defeated foes which you can\
