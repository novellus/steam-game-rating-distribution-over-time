    review: "[b] DIDACTIC PORTRAIT OF LADY 90s [/b]\n\nShadow of the Comet is a good\
      \ example of the adventure genre in the 90s, with its merits and flaws shining\
      \ like the stars over Illsmouth on Halley\u2019s passage. However, what the\
      \ game does wrong may require your patience and goodwill more often than not.\
      \ Therefore, its appeal is a bit more narrow than other titles, even from that\
      \ period.\n\nOn the upside, first things first: it\u2019s Infogrames, it\u2019\
      s Cthulhu. That alone could take you through. This version contains decent voice\
      \ acting. Nothing extraordinary, but still giving a serviceable personality\
      \ and flavor to almost all characters. The overall plot is charming, par for\
      \ the course for Cthulhu lovers. Art direction is stylish, especially the scenery\
      \ and building design.\n\nOther than that, you\u2019ll probably find out for\
      \ yourself that Shadow of the Comet\u2019s best quality is a certain \u2018\
      je ne sais quoi\u2019, a mysterious style that guarantees its place in the gaming\
      \ cosmos.\n\nOn the downside, I\u2019d start with sound design. I always chuckle\
      \ when reading the official line about this: \u201CBone chilling sound effects\
      \ that hurtle you into the depths of chaos!\u201D. Uh\u2026 no. Sound effects\
      \ are lacking when compared to similar titles from its time (even other Infogrames\u2019\
      \ titles), sometimes just plain weird and funny and also very sparse. Many a\
      \ scene will feel bland precisely because of this shortcoming of \u201Csilent\u201D\
      \ events.\n\nSome puzzles hinder the game\u2019s progression, locking your progress\
      \ if you make \u201Cwrong\u201D choices. Save, save and save, my friend. Dialogue\
      \ choice structure is linear and also blemished by the 'game-over mechanic'\
      \ problem.\n\nPlot progression felt weird and sometimes nonsensical, tarnishing\
      \ the story. Not the plot itself, which I quite enjoyed it, but the transitions\
      \ between the main scenes (the diary helps to bring rythm to the story, but\
      \ not as much as one would think).\n\nIn the end, I'd still recommend Shadow\
      \ of the Comet without hesitation. It\u2019s very didactic of its time if nothing\
      \ else. Game history par excellence."
