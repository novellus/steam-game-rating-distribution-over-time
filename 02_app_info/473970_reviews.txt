There's like 10 and they all look the same and nothing is labeled.\n\nWhat icon? My interface is covered in tiny icons, none of them labeled, nothing marked.\n\nThe interface is a sloppy mess, sure you can figure it out, but there's no excuse for how bad it is right from the start. Even the tutorial assumes you already know what all the buttons are. Well no, I don't know what the buttons are and that's why I'm playing the tutorial you freaking Muppet. When you make a sloppy cluttered interface where everything looks the same, you either provide a tutorial that shows you what the buttons do, or just get out of my way and let me figure it out on my own.\n\nNope, this gives you a sloppy interface and then gets in your way with instructions that don't bother to instruct you how to use anything correctly.\n\nFine, skip your useless tutorial, I'll figured it out myself. \n\nWait, this is it? This is the entire game? The least interesting part of an RTS followed by the slowest Tower Defense combat I've seen in a while?\n\nThis is some attempt at a hybrid mashup of RTS base building mixed with tower defense wait and hope combat mechanics. It certainly thinks it's clever and maybe there was a good idea in here somewhere; but it got lost under the terrible interface, the awkward clutter of buildings that all look alike and a souless attempt at humor with some of the cheesiest voice acting to come out in recent years.\n\nClick on an enemy unit and you get some child going \"grrr\" at you, as if you are supposed to be afraid of an 8 year old girl who thinks she's a scary zombie.\n\nClick on one of your own units and you'll get a rotating set of generic uninspired one liners that sound like they were recorded as filler but accidently left in the game when they ran out of budget to hire voice actors.\n\nI've played for all of 10 minutes and I've already heard the same squeaky child say \"yes commander\" more than 100 times for every possible action.\n\nAs a concept this probably had potential, but it's very poorly executed and with such lackluster production quality that it just doesn't hold my attention at all. \n\nIf you catch it on sale for $1 or less and hate yourself, go for it, but honestly you can find free games better than this. Not worth anywhere near its full $10 asking price.\n\nI got this as part of a bundle so I don't feel too ripped off, but I can't recommend bothering to buy it on purpose.\n---\n\nEDIT: Take a look at the achievements, less than 2% of owners have bothered to complete the final mission, more than 98% of owners abandoned this game. There's your real review.\n---\n\nEDIT 2: I can force myself to finish the game, but I can't force myself to like it. Many hours later my only regret was wasting the time to play it.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]","timestamp_created":1537885123,"timestamp_updated":1609102687,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57358938455581665","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sc//0vYCcOOyqwE="}
