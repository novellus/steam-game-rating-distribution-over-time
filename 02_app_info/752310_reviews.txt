Each level is themed differently enough that they all feel unique, with the final one being a neat exercise in vertical design done wild west style. As you play, you can spend cash upgrading the drone so it can stay away from base stations for longer durations - essential if you're doing the late game achievement speedruns. There is no real failing here, as running out of battery just ends your session but saves your progress for the next attempt. I don't see myself ever playing this again, so I'd suggest holding off for a sale before picking up Flying Salvager.","timestamp_created":1568665697,"timestamp_updated":1568665697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.625984132289886475","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rt/wne0CdL2u0gE="}
