    review: "[h1][b]FFFFFFFFIFTY-SSSEVEN MINUTES?!!!![/b][/h1]\n\nThis game looked\
      \ so prominsing! It has great visuals, one good voice actor (emphasis on \"\
      one\") and does a good job of utilizing hand controlers in-game (emphasis on\
      \ \"in-game\"). It looked like it had everything to be an amazing story driven\
      \ space fighter game, a brand new \"Star fox VR\" that would 1-up [i]House of\
      \ the Dying Sun[/i] (a game that I believe currently holds that title) and it\
      \ looked like it was going in the right direction, but then took a complete\
      \ 180, gave that one well voiced character the Vaudeville Hook, and slamed down\
      \ the curtine with a \"That's all folks!\" The only reason I might keep this\
      \ game is because I got it for a steal on sale at $3, but that's all it's really\
      \ worth, here's why:\n\n[h2]The Menu[/h2]\n\nThe first problem you encounter\
      \ is in the menu. You get your standard lazer pointer to select things with\
      \ the controllers. Everything's well and good until you actually try to change\
      \ things. The lazer locks on to the sliders you use to change things like brightness\
      \ and volume, but if you try selecting these things with the triggers, the lazer\
      \ switches hands. I guess it was meant to be a means of unlocking yourself from\
      \ the sliders, but it was unnecisarrily confusing. However, once you jump in\
      \ the game, you'll find that this is the least of it's problems.\n\n[h2]Your\
      \ \"Ship\"s\"[/h2]\n\nLike [i]Star Fox[/i], this game has 3 ship types, each\
      \ with different speeds and weapons. The only trouble is: each is only used\
      \ once, and NONE OF THEM CAN TURN FOR SHIT! This becomes apparent in the first\
      \ level, where you fight your first enemy fighter. Now most games give you the\
      \ upper hand in this type of encounter, but this one has you doing loop-da-loops\
      \ around eachother because neither of you can rotate sharp enough to face one\
      \ another. What kind of space fighter game doesn't let you thwart your opponents\
      \ with agile manuvers? I asked myself this question and laughed remembering\
      \ Jontron's review of Aquaman 64 and his famous line: \"Ever wanted to play\
      \ the most annoying level of 'Star Fox 64,' every time?\" That's this game too!\n\
      \n[h2]The Final Level[/h2]\n\nThe final level, a.k.a. LEVEL 3 is just 10 minutes\
      \ into the game and you are already taking your snarky robot companion into\
      \ the enemy \"planet\" to destroy it. Why did it take me 47 more minutes to\
      \ finish the level? Because the game completely drops it's space fighting genre\
      \ and becomes a rage game instead! From the beginning of the level, your afformentioned\
      \ snarky robot companion cuts to the chace and straight up tells you that your\
      \ new ship is a peice of crap. Hey, that kinda reminds me of what Falco said\
      \ in that afformentioned [i]Star Fox[/i] level. Take this as a warning because\
      \ you will get a bunch of insane obsticals thrown at you which wouldn't be a\
      \ problem if your ship wasn't so big and sluggish. Then when you finally get\
      \ to your objective, your robot companion, whom you just barely met, decides\
      \ to do a cliche \"best buddie sacrifice\" before you even had the chance to\
      \ bond with him. Then, you gotta do all that rage inducing flying back out of\
      \ the \"planet\" accept this time you're under the pressure of his 2 minute\
      \ fuse! \n\n20 deaths later, it's over an you're rewarded with a credit sequence\
      \ that feels more broken than the rest of the game as it only shows one line,\
      \ and then just locks you in this white room with the \"ghost\" of your robot\
      \ companion as if we are supposed to still care about him.\n\nLong story short,\
      \ this feels like a demo for an ambitious kickstarter game, and if it was, I\
      \ would be extatic in anticipation for the full release, I might have even backed\
      \ it! But NO, this is the whole game as far as I can tell, and it's over before\
      \ you can grow attached enough to cheer it on! If you missed the sale I jumped\
      \ on, I guarentee that your $10 is much better spent towards  [i]House of the\
      \ Dying Sun[/i]."
