      \ Every input, from the triggers to the trackpads, can offer haptic feedback\

      \ triggers</h2>With a satisfying digital click at the end of the trigger pull,\
      \ dual-stage triggers can be used as analog, digital, or both types of input\

    review: "Without a doubt the best controller!\n Nowadays, adaptability, precision\
      \ and responsive time are everything in video games,\nSteam Controller simply\
      \ dominates in all of these areas.\n I use it a lot, with the huge variety of\
      \ games in my collection.\n This controller is an excellent peripheral for sessions\
      \ with friends or family and the accessories are also very good and extremely\
      \ useful.\n If this product and sales ends, it's because of the poor and old\
      \ mindset influenced by a massive flood of rival companies products on markets,\
      \ like the ones of Microsoft and Sony.\n I just wish that this product to keeps\
      \ in production, because with only 4-5 years on markets it's still a baby.\n\
      \ People use to refuse to give it a try, but the Steam Controller it's Very\
      \ recommended!"
