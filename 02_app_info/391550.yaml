      \ using the scanner is very hard to find them . A hud radar would allow you\
      \ to see them coming no need for talking heads. \n6. 2nd suit needs a better\
      \ gun or the missle should stay online till you run out then refill\n7. you\
      \ get killed running after the energy globes make them come to you I have had\
      \ to restart game twice because of getting stuck getting the globes of energy.\n\
      8. 4 human will kill you faster than you can shoot them. humans are much to\
      \ hard to kill. \n9. why does some water kill you and other water you can wade\
      \ thru either it kills you or it doesnt. and if it kills you give the humans\
      \ squirt guns instead of rifles. Talking about the area toward beginning when\
      \ you shoot down the trailer held by the crane. you cant explore cause the water\
      \ kills you. \n10.Im guessing the GRU HAS A LOT OF Satilites so maube use these\
      \ to get overhead view insted of talking heads. or send the missles down insted\
      \ of them to stop working when you ned them. Shows missles on bottom rt corner\
      \ I always show more when I run out.\n11. 2nd Mech takes to long to shoot. them\
      \ red line look cool but they get you killed.\n12. garnades would be fun have\
      \ the humans leave a few around. \n13. what good is a sniper rifle at 500 yds\
      \ if you cant use a scope or your mech eyes cant zoom the sniper area could\
      \ have been great . but no zoom and while the human are killing you. and you\
      \ them the little energy balls lay 400 yds out so all in all you need to take\
      \ the fight to them to get rehealed. plus no way to return their medicen if\
      \ you have to stand in the window to shoot ccause your rifle doesnt go over\
      \ the top and shoots the wall in front of you. sam for you missle by comming\
      \ out of the top back of the mech they hit the ceiling and walls around you.\
      \ \n14 very enjoyable but computer really slows down when you use talking heads\
      \ or shows incoming. the little warning signs would be enough.\n15 really do\
      \ love it so far cant wait to see where you go. \n\nIf your reading this to\
      \ figure out if you want to buy or not. Id say buy the game. it arena fighting,\
      \ plus followwing a script but once you get past the script its great."
