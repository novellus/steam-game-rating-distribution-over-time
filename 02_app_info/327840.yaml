    review: I have been slogging through this for ages adding miserly points to progress.
      Now I realise no matter how you improve the AI just simply notches up nullifying
      any talent you have and stuffing you to the back of the race again or repeatedly
      blowing you up to stop you in your tracks. The stats above are wrong I've played
      this over a hundred hours. I still recommend it as it's a gas in the beginning
      but a real grinder not much further on.
