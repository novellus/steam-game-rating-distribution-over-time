    review: "A confession: yes, I knew full well what I was buying when I forked out\
      \ my 49c for this (on sale, 'natch). A reviewer's gotta review: I review, therefore\
      \ I am. \n\n   Did I honestly expect that I'd give this product a thumb-up?\
      \ Of course I didn't. In fact, I would've been gob-smacked if I was in the present\
      \ process of coughing up a POSITIVE review. (That said, I didn't expect it to\
      \ be [i]this[/i] bad...)\n\n   Look at the title, for frig's sake: MAR WAR.\
      \ First bad sign. Now look at the screenshots. Yep: another GameGuru game. Now\
      \ look at the price...HOLY SHAMOLIE! They actually have the gall to ask FIVE\
      \ BUCKAROONIES for this steaming load of bollocks, in the CURRENT YEAR no less!\
      \ Well, colour me putrid and call me Gertrude. That's really quite silly, that\
      \ is.\n\n   TL;DR: it's utter [i]balls[/i]. Possibly the worst GameGuru game\
      \ I've ever played, and trust me, that's truly saying something. Medals for\
      \ bravery need to be promptly issued to anyone with the mettle to get past the\
      \ first five minutes of \"gameplay\".\n\nVerdict: 0.1/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed\
      \ this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\n\
