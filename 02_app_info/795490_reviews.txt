Think along the lines of \"Fat Man\" for the Sega Genesis without nightmarish controls. \n\nSo ok, Early Access, random levels... crowd of perpetually spawning back guys... basic dudes with extra baddie with some sort of gimmick... cool, bare bones but I like where this is almost going... despite not having any real options, instructions, point... just a selection between Trailer Park Goro or Eyeball...Guy...Man...Thing.\n\nWell, I got it on sale so no biggie, maybe this is just the Alpha Release.  Sat on it for a year or so, it gets released a few months ago.  \n\nOH BOY! I thought, has there been an update? Has someones bizarre pet project come to fruition?\n\nNo.  It's still a mess.  But now the Mess is far less cute because it's not even hiding behind \"Early Access\" and any of that Middle School charm that I feel nostalgic for in my days of watching horrible crap on NewGrounds has left.\n\nAll I have is disappointment.","timestamp_created":1607575545,"timestamp_updated":1607575545,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yoS+pfYCcJjIuAI="}
