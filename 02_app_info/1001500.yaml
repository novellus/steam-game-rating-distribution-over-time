    review: God this game has intrigue and I want to learn more about it but the game's
      mechanics itself won't let me be interested. There are way too many stats to
      keep track of, such that I don't think the creator properly factored in the
      crossover of having certain combinations. You will almost always hit walls of
      choices where none of your stats are suited for any options, and it doesn't
      feel intentional or good to play. The game doesn't clearly communicate which
      stats mean what and the crossover between stats makes it all the more confusing.
      I didn't even get a chance to decide if I was honorable or cunning in the tutorial
      so I went through the game without the ability to choose either option. And
      in choices where 2/3 were the honor and cunning choice I'm obviously restricted.
