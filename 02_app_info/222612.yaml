    about_the_game: "The Gresley-designed Class J50 from Meshtools is now available\
      \ for Train Simulator in a number of BR and LNER liveries.<br><br>The origins\
      \ of the Class J50 were in the Sir Nigel Gresley-designed Class J23, an 0-6-0T\
      \ steam locomotive designed in 1913 for the purpose of working short-haul coal\
      \ traffic in Yorkshire. Forty Class J23s were built for the Great Northern Railway\
      \ (GNR) between 1913 and 1922 and proved to be an adaptable locomotive in the\
      \ compact coal yards of the North.<br><br>At the time of Grouping in 1923, the\
      \ London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) adopted the Class J23 and reclassified\
      \ it as the J50 and J51 \u2013 the former with larger boilers and the J51 with\
      \ smaller boilers. The LNER continued to build a further 62 Class J50s between\
      \ 1924 and 1939, and rebuilt its Class J51s to Class J50s between 1929 and 1935.<br>Four\
      \ subdivisions of the Class J50 distinguished variations during construction,\
      \ including the fitting of steam or vacuum brakes, left or right-hand drive\
      \ and long or short coal bunkers. With the nationalisation of Britain\u2019\
      s railway network, British Railways inherited the LNER Class J50s, and they\
      \ continued in service as shunting and short-haul locomotives.<br><br>Withdrawal\
      \ of the Class began in September 1958 at the arrival of diesel shunters, and\
      \ all regular locomotives were withdrawn by September 1963, leaving just departmental\
      \ locomotives in service. These were subsequently withdrawn by September 1965.<br><br>The\
      \ Class J50 for Train Simulator, developed by Meshtools, is available in a number\
      \ of British Railways and LNER  liveries, including BR Green, BR Early, BR Late,\
      \ BR Mid, LNER Black and LNER Green. Features of the locomotive include standard\
      \ and advanced driving controls, with extra scripting on the advanced controls\
      \ to depict vacuum brakes, dampers, notched reverser, exterior animations and\
      \ controller emitters.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible,\
      \ giving you the freedom to drive the BR/LNER Class J50 on any Quick Drive enabled\
      \ route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included\

    review: Easily the nicest steam loco I own for TS.  The option of simple controls
      is welcome as it means I can learn to use the advanced controls in my own time.  The
      engine feels great, looks fantastic, and I heartily recommend it.  I think the
      asking price is fair, considering the average - on sale it is an absolute steal.
