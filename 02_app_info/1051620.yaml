    review: "I admit I didn't like the idea that after purchasing the game with its\
      \ first kombo pack I didn't find Shao Kahn in the roster. Same goes for Frost\
      \ but at least she's granted following the completion of chapter 4 in Story\
      \ Mode.\n\nKahn is good. Experts can comment on his combos and speed compared\
      \ to the others - numerous websites created tiers and assigned a mediocre-good\
      \ evaluation to Kahn. I, on the other hand, can comment on what it feels like\
      \ controlling the villain that acted as boss in MK 2 & 3. \n\nIt's amazing!\
      \ I modified his default variation to give him the ability to throw a hammer\
      \ not just the spear. The former has krushing blow while the latter is good\
      \ for great distances and it is also pretty fast. Then you have his shoulder\
      \ charge (can be modified to a spear version) and you can laugh at the opponent\
      \ or taunt them just as he did to you more than 2 decades ago. These will make\
      \ you stronger for a short period time or your enemies weaker. \n\nAs for the\
      \ fatalities? They are disgusting and the use of hammer is important for both.\
      \ Friendship is clever and fun. Khan's voice actor did a great job. Gears include\
      \ changing the looks for the hammer and the spear as well as giving Kahn a different\
      \ helmet. Skins are not that great in terms of variation - I preferred the fully\
      \ clad Kahn that looks like a samurai from ancient times. \n\nOverall, I'm very\
      \ satisfied with the character. His kombos are great but you have to be careful\
      \ when inputting the first hit as the animation can take slightly longer compared\
      \ to the others."
