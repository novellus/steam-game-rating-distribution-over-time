While the potential for both tables is great, but Wild West Rampage is the let down with the easy ball drains. It's a computer game not a cash table, so why make it so difficult to get a good score going and enjoy the tables advanced modes? I've scored over 500M in a couple of tables so it's not that I'm a bad player. Castlestorm is much better, but it too can be a bit frustrating with the drains. Like I said, it's frustrating how difficult the advanced modes etc. are to access on these two. I think these tables need update before I'd recommend them.","timestamp_created":1501162044,"timestamp_updated":1501162044,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpt+Owt0CcNKHgQE="}
