      /><br>Beracus and Lee finally have a lead to more information for a potential
      cure for Beracus'' suffering village.<br>Upon finding the entrance to an apparently
      abandoned bunker, the two abruptly become trapped inside and discover the place
      is still very much lived in by a family of cult members who also happen to be
      skeletons. (Uh-oh.)<br>The family mistakes Lee and Beracus for cult members
      who are simply &quot;late to the party&quot; so to speak, and give them free
      reign to explore the bunker as they all wait for the surface to become the &quot;New
      World&quot;. (Uh-oh!)<br>Of course, Beracus and Lee don''t have that kind of
      time! Not only do they need food, water, and air to simply survive, they must
      return to the surface to continue their search for an the all important cure.
      Together they must talk to the skeleton family to discover important information,
      find clues, collect items, and try to uncover and understand the tragedies that
      turned this simple bunker, into a tomb.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194160/extras/featues.png?t=1576696183"

    review: Good quick little adventure game with good writing and a fantastic and
      unique art style. Absolutely worth the price and Im interested to see where
      the story goes from here, hopefully it will be continued somewhere in the near
