    review: 'I''ve played this game for about 40 minutes, and I''m trying to decide
      if I want to return it or not. While it was only $1.09 CAD I feel that it''s
      not put together in a very aesthetic fashion. Mechanically, it sort of works.
      But I''m talking how it actually LOOKS AND FEELS. And it doesn''t look or feel
      very good at all.


      Octomber. Yeah. That was an actual typo. I can forgive most things, but that
      is really, really bad. Not to mention the very poor english all throughout.
      Seriously, people: get someone to proofread your stuff and help clean up your
      scripts. It''s becoming the norm, not the exception, for RPGMaker games.


      +Low Price Point

      ...Yeah, that''s about all I''ve got.


      =Hunger and Thirst Meters are well-implemented, however, they seem to tick rather
      quickly.

      =Poor grammar. Again, Octomber...

      =The constant heartbeat starts to get annoying.


      -Game starts in Full Screen with no way to change it (F3 makes it smaller, but
      still Full Screen)

      -No way to actually quit the game without hitting Ctrl+Alt+Del. Quitting in-game
      just takes you back to the title screen, and literally NOTHING I did there,
      aside from CAD, caused the game to exit.

      -The low light aesthetic does more to annoy than cause suspense. Three hits
      and you''re dead from a zombie. Take a wrong turn down a single hallway and
      you''re pretty much dead, unless you have a weapon. However, you have no idea
      where you''re going because there''s little to no light to see paths. While
      I can understand and appreciate WHY that is like that, make the zombies move
      very slowly to help avoid them in time, or give us more light to see the layout
      of an area before we start to run around blind.

      -The font choice is best left for the title screen. After a while it''s just
      annoying. And it''s for ALL the text in the game.


      TLDR: Game is far too dark to be enjoyable, which is too bad, because it actually
      seems like something of a fun game there. I''m not going to recommend it at
      this time, unless the creator cleans it up a bit.'
