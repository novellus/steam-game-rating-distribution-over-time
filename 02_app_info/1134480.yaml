    about_the_game: 'YORG.io 3 is a unique combination of tower defense, zombies and
      strategy. Now with multiplayer and mods!<br><br><strong>This game is under active
      development!</strong> It is a finished and playable game, but I''m working on
      improving the game mechanics right now, since some people complained about it
      (Whereas others loved it). I also fixed a lot of day one issues which were the
      cause of the most negative reviews. Please note that this game is <strong>quite
      different</strong> compared to the original YORG.io!<br><br>Build up your base
      and defend it against the zombies, which try to destroy it during the night.
      You need to place mines and factories to build supply chains which produce ammunition
      for your defensive towers. Research and upgrade every tower to unlock its special
      abilities and manage your factories to produce the optimal rate of resources!<br><br>YORG.io
      3 introduces entirely new content, featuring a lot of new buildings and unique
      enemies. Progressively unlock towers like the new laser tower, and get prepared
      for armored and invisible zombies, super hard bosses, map themes and much more!<br><br><strong>MULTIPLAYER</strong><br><br>That''s
      right - YORG.io 3 now has multiplayer! Play with and against your friends and
      strangers in casual games. Build zombie factories to produce zombies and attack
      your opponent with it in the 1v1 and 2v2 match modes.<br><br>And to make sure
      you don''t get bored, there are now ranked games! Complete your placement matches
      and play ranked games to climb up the ladder and eventually reach the legendary
      master division!<br><br><strong>MODS</strong><br><br>YORG.io 3 now supports
      mods! Mods have access to the whole game and can add new buildings, enemies,
      mechanics, overlays and basically everything you can imagine!<br><br><br><strong>MAP
      LAYOUTS &amp; DIFFICULTIES</strong><br><br>Play on different map layouts which
      each feature an individual theme and power-ups, which grant global bonuses to
      all of your buildings. The medium and hard difficulties ensure you won''t get
      bored! And if you''re more of the constructor guy, theres still the sandbox
      mode which lets you freely experiment.<br><br><strong>ALL NEW CONTENT</strong><br><br>Get
      prepared for the zombies by using the special laser tower. Produce power using
      solar panels or the nuclear reactor. Upgrade your factories to produce better
      ammunition using coal, iron and uranium. Prepare your defenses for the mage
      zombie whose attacks spread over multiple buildings or the pulse zombie which
      disables your defenses. There is so much new content, I don''t even know where
      to start!<br><br><strong>ACHIEVEMENTS</strong><br><br>Take the challenge and
      complete up to 42 achievements with several challenges in the single player
      to gain coins as a reward!<br><br><strong>SKINS</strong><br><br>Personalize
      your zombies and buildings with cool skins from the store! All skins can also
      be seen by your opponents in multiplayer.<br><br><strong>STANDALONE ADVANTAGES</strong><br><br>YORG.io
      3 will simultaneously launch on the web - However, with very limited features
      and content. Get the Steam version here for the best experience! If you are
      unsure about the purchase, I recommend playing a while on the web version for
      free and see if you like it! PS: The Steam version is much cheaper than buying
      the content in the web version!<br><br><strong>TRANSFERRING YOUR ACCOUNT</strong><br><br>Also,
      if you want to transfer your savegames from the web version to the standalone,
      send a quick E-Mail to feedback@yorg.io with your web username and your standalone
      username, and I will transfer your savegames!'

    review: 'I don''t like the art style and building, base expansion, upgrading buildings
      has become totally annoying.

      While it adds some more variety than its predecessor, it feels more clunky with
      a lot more micromanaging required.


      Better stick with Yorg.io!'
