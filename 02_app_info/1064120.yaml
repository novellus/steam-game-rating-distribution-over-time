      \ of myself, so I promptly murdered him. Unfortunately, I missed the guard in\
      \ the corner of the room, so I had to murder him too. Thing is, no one else\
      \ heard my bloody hacking, so I quietly climbed out the back window. Later in\
      \ my demo, I was told that the crime was discovered, but it wasn't quite pinned\
      \ on me yet.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-10-best-indies-of-pax-east-2019\"\
