    review: "The numbers on the cubes are very difficult to read.\n2 and 5 are not\
      \ very clearly distinguishable and the 3 looks only very abstractly like a 3.\n\
      Some cards disappear under the table when you put them on the table. The dice\
      \ should be able to be manually set to a position because they sometimes rotate\
      \ if you release them too quickly after moving or if they lie on top of each\
      \ other and then take one down.\nFor an official dlc I expected more. There\
      \ should at least be no bugs that prevent the player from playing the game because\
      \ the cards always disappear. \nAs long as the bug is not fixed I can not recommend\
      \ the game."
