    about_the_game: "Lemnis Gate is a time-warping, turn-based combat strategy FPS.\
      \ Over five alternating turns taking place in a 25\u201D time-loop, you are\
      \ called to master the unique abilities of a varied cast of deep-space operatives\
      \ and outskill, outsmart, and outmanoeuvre your opponent in mind-bending four-dimensional\
      \ battles. <br>Lemnis Gate twists time to subvert one of the world\u2019s most\
      \ popular game genres and offers a relentlessly inventive multiplayer experience\
      \ deeply rooted in tactical FPS gameplay. Challenge yourself to think across\
      \ four dimensions as you embark on the ultimate test of cognition and combat.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THINK\
      \ DIFFERENTLY</h2>Matches in Lemnis Gate take place within time loops. You have\
      \ 25 seconds to execute your action, be it blasting an enemy, manoeuvring your\
      \ operative, or setting up your next move. After all players have taken turns,\
      \ the next 25-second round begins. Now you\u2019ll face what has happened while\
      \ setting up what will happen. Each of the five rounds is your chance to alter\
      \ the timeline as past, present, and future converge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STRATEGIC\
      \ COMBAT IN THE FOURTH DIMENSION</h2>Victory doesn\u2019t rely on shooting supremacy.\
      \ You\u2019ll have to use skill and strategy to create unstoppable game plans\
      \ and get the drop on opponents. It\u2019s all about non-linear logic, abstract\
      \ thinking, and outlandish manoeuvres. Execute audacious acts and think several\
      \ moves ahead to get the win.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A TIME-BENDING TACTICAL SHOOTER</h2>With\
      \ a varied cast of characters to choose from, how you play is up to you. Lay\
      \ damaging toxic waste in your enemy\u2019s path, slow time to land the perfect\
      \ shot, or deploy protective orbs to assist your future self. Every operative\
      \ possesses a distinctive loadout and special ability that proves decisive on\
      \ the battlefield.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TEAM UP WITH YOURSELF</h2>Welcome to\
      \ the team comprised entirely of one: you. With Lemnis Gate\u2019s innovative\
      \ auto co-op feature, you command every member of your side. Auto co-op gives\
      \ you total control of five deep-space operatives, effectively enabling two\
      \ competitors to duke it out in bustling ten-character matches. Become a literal\
      \ one-person army.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COUNTLESS POSSIBILITIES, ENDLESS OUTCOMES</h2>From\
      \ the first second to the last, anything can happen in Lemnis Gate. Each round\
      \ is a fresh chance to implement an unbeatable new strategy \u2013 or earn redemption\
      \ from an earlier error. Predict hostiles\u2019 routes, infiltrate enemy lines,\
      \ and develop multi-layered gameplans by co-operating with yourself. Experiment\
      \ both in and outside time, and get creative with causality."
