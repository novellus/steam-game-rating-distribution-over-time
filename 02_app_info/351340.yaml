    review: For most of my playtime I was kind of lukewarm about this game; it relies
      far more heavily on reading LOTS of notes (spaced very close together) than
      it does on finding, using, or combining items, the story isn't exactly terrible
      but isn't exciting, and the art is nice but sparse to the point that the environments
      don't feel fleshed out in most areas. When I got to the point where the game
      requires you to kill a cat, though, that was game over. This is an absolute
      deal breaker for me, and the game isn't piquing enough interest to consider
      going against my instincts in order to proceed, so I won't be finishing. All
      in all I feel like there could've been a good game here, but it needed another
      round or two of editing on all fronts. This game feels premature, for lack of
      a better word. There are probably people out there who would enjoy it, but in
      the end I'm just simply not one of them.
