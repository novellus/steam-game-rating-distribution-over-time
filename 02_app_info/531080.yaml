    review: "LONG VERSION - So originally bought this game long ago, but couldn't\
      \ get it to work with my Touch controllers on my Oculus Rift, despite the page\
      \ showing that it supports Oculus.  The developer confirmed that he didn't know\
      \ why his page showed this support (he'd never tested it) and didn't mean for\
      \ his page to show it and said he couldn't remove it.   Could never get it to\
      \ work, the game stopped being supported later and it disappeared into my list\
      \ of VR games to be forgotten.   Until I got my Rift S.\n\nSomething told me\
      \ to boot this back up and try to see if the Rift S controllers were any better\
      \ with it.  You wouldn't figure it would be, but I got curious.  Turns out it\
      \ worked much better, although clunky for some reason.  I found out on an old\
      \ youtube comment that the controllers detect touch on the buttons in addition\
      \ to pressing them, which complicates things.  So if you went into the Steam\
      \ controller settings for this specific game (Steam VR options, Devices, Controller\
      \ Settings, then pick the game from the list on the right) and DISABLED the\
      \ touch feature on the A, B, X and Y buttons (I also did this for the triggers\
      \ as well, just to be safe), then the game works!\n\nIt's a fun game, easy to\
      \ learn, has some humor in it. and the ability to move around and change distance\
      \ from the map in 3rd person gives it a cool atmosphere, almost like you're\
      \ the character and the DM.  If you like D&D type dungeon crawlers I'd recommend\
      \ it for the $10 if you have a Rift S or a Vive.   \n\nTLDR (short) version\
      \ - You can get this working with the controllers on Rift S with some minor\
      \ adjustments in the settings and it's a fun dungeon crawler for ten bucks."
