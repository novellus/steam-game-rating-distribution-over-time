I figured that any person that pursues a project for over a decade deserves some of my money. \nI have mixed feeling about the game itself though. While the levels are mostly competently designed, the story suffers from serious pacing issues and in the end lacks substance. It just sorta goes on until it doesn't and in the end it doesn't feel like we've accomplished anything or learned anything at all (except killing the AI robo). \nMinor issues: HL2's AI sucked when it came out 16 years ago and it didn't improve all that much since then. The space battle section could use up/down movement support (SPACE/CTRL). The low-gravity section is weirdly coded so it makes your telekinesis weaker?? Voice acting is the kind you'd expect from a one-person project... etc, etc\nBut despite many problems it kept me engaged. You can get lost in the levels, but while looking for a way to progress you can stumble upon some secrets with goodies. The environments are decently varied and some look very pretty. Most importantly, I think the game succeeds in making the player feel oppressed through it's art, visuals and gameplay. So even though the story sucks, G String still manages to provide a full Cyberpunk Dystopia Experienceâ„¢. For this it gets a recommendation.","timestamp_created":1610123263,"timestamp_updated":1610123263,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wee08fYCdN/JwQI="}
