      Recruited Everyone I Know To Fight The Dark Lord', or 'IHLSBMCILSIREIKTFTDL'
      for short, you primarily play as the main character Josephine, fated to defeat
      the Dark Lord. However, as she's generally unskilled in combat, she recruits
      literally everyone in her hometown to fight enemies with a party of 99 characters!<br><br><img

    review: 'It''s a simple game, and it does what it says on the tin. You get a massive
      party of characters to fight in RPG battles.

      "Oh ha ha," you say, "like that mobile Final Fantasy game where you just tap
      to attack right?"

      NO. Each of the characters has stats and unique moves, and combo moves, and
      an HP and MP pool of their own. They''re like characters from any other oldschool
      RPG, except you get 100 of them at once.


      It''s cool for a while, give it a spin.'
