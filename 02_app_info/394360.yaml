    reviews: "\u201CHearts of Iron 4 wields complexity like a swift armor division\

      imperfectly, impressionistically, and perhaps a little amorally\u2014it lets\
      \ me orchestrate the most titanic armed struggles in history, from the fussy\
      \ economic details to the cut-and-thrust of mechanized warfare. There are other\
      \ great strategic-level wargames out there. But I have never played anything\

      \ after many dozens of hours, I'm taking a break from Hearts of Iron 4. Not\
      \ because I'm sick of it; quite the contrary, in fact. What I need to do is\
      \ some serious reading, some careful planning on what my vision for the United\
      \ States should be in 1936. And when I've done that planning \u2014 when I've\
      \ formulated my character sheet, as it were \u2014 I have the utmost confidence\
