    about_the_game: "You are no hero \u2026 no prancing knight or scholarly wizard\
      \ but a champion of the dark gods. As their chosen, you have command of legions\
      \ of barbarians, beastmen and demons. Wield unholy strength, necromancy and\
      \ hellfire to bring ruin to the civilized realms. Honor your gods on the bloody\
      \ fields of battle in a quest for power and ascension.<br />\n<br />\nDemon\u2019\
      s Rise: Lords of Chaos is a turn-based, tactical RPG set in a brutal and unforgiving\
      \ fantasy world. Taking place amidst a horrific war in the cold north, the campaign\
      \ will see your party fight innumerable enemies, huge monsters and powerful\
      \ sorcerers. Victory will require the tactical use of terrain, morale, formations\
      \ and magic. Build an increasingly powerful war band, command demonic allies,\
      \ and crush those that stand against you.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\tTactical Choices:\
      \ Use terrain effects, cover and line of sight to gain an edge over your enemies.\
      \ Employ spells to hinder powerful enemies, area effect damage to clear the\

      \u2022\tBuild Your Party: Choose from 20 diverse character classes to build\
      \ your war band. Your warriors will improve with every victory, becoming stronger\
      \ and unlocking new powers and skills. Acts of courage and savagery on the battlefield\
      \ will bring favor from your gods, which can mean the difference between glory\
      \ and defeat.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\tCollect Gear: Equip your warriors with\
      \ powerful weapons, arcane objects, runic armor and legendary artifacts. There\
      \ are thousands of items to find and collect, each with their own stat effects\
      \ and background lore.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\tCampaign: Fight through a lengthy\
      \ campaign and numerous side quests that span more than 40 hours of play time.\
      \ No level caps and the ability to replay levels at a harder difficulty add\
      \ to the longevity.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\tEngaging Lore: Immerse yourself in\

    reviews: "\u201CDemon's Rise: Lords of Chaos is one of the better role-playing\
      \ games of the year. It's certainly the deepest in terms of tactical decision-making\
      \ opportunities and challenging combat encounters. There is a lot of min-maxing\
      \ potential and the game really rewards smart play. Fans of tactical RPGs, Dungeons\
      \ &amp; Dragons, and MMO-style combat will really take to the campaign and won't\
      \ regret adding this game to their collection.\u201D<br>4 / 5 \u2013 <a href=\"\
