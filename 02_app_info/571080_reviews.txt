(reversing takes longer than simply floring it to bounce out so it's not really an option either\n\nIt feels like you increased the difficulty too as I did grab a bronze before and now my closest time is about 1 sec. off on one of the easiest tracks, that I never did play a lot of the similar games way back when doesn't help of course. (I am also a hood view type of gamer which also handicaps me a bit)\n\nOverall it's been improved quite a lot and I'll keep it installed and see how things move along occassionally.","timestamp_created":1485540020,"timestamp_updated":1486923297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486725687980651855","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jp7imdoCd8LQcA=="}
