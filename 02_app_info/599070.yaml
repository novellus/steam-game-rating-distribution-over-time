    review: "The game can be pretty easily summed up by saying that it does exactly\
      \ what it advertises, no bells, no whistles. If the idea of calling balls &\
      \ strikes appeals to you, without anything beyond that, then there's a good\
      \ chance you'll enjoy the game. Personally, I didn't feel like it would have\
      \ been worth the full normal price of $2.99, but for the sale price of 98 cents,\
      \ it was worth a shot. \n\nThe graphics/animations could certainly use improvement.\
      \ I could hypothetically see a multiplayer option where the pitcher attempts\
      \ to trickle the umpire into get the calls wrong. Obviously, a home run derby\
      \ option would be fantastic, but obviously those things are beyond the scope\
      \ of Umpire Simulator. \n\nJust ask yourself if you're willing pay whatever\
      \ the current price is based on what it *does* have, rather than what it *doesn't*\
      \ have. I can't really recommend the game, but I can say that the program does\
      \ what it claims to do."
