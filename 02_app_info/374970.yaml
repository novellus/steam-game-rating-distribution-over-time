    review: 'I have backed and purchased a few beta games such as Racing Glider but
      this one is very far away from being in beta.


      When you start the game you cannot see any controls as it cuts off the top of
      the play area and it opens in a window which cannot be resized.


      There are no options, nothing to show you what keys to press and is this only
      a VR title, the game does not make this clear at all.


      I will stick with the title to support the developers (Good Luck) but you should
      not have released this game now as in this state you will rightly receive negative
      reviews of which I cannot fault them for.


      Please release just a quick NotePad update, firstly for the keys and secondly
      a road map would be helpful.


      You should pull this game till you are further down the road, I expect to have
      at least a splash screen at the start of the game with keys.


      It has been experience from other beta games that if you intend to please this
      now (September 2020) then don''t expect a meaningful update for a playable game
      till at least March/August 2021.'
