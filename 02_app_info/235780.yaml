    review: 'It would be unfair to criticize this for HL2 being dull grey console
      action with impotent gunplay, boring and humanities-level-mentally-challenged
      guns, bad inventory, really idiotic art-style, amounts of stamina akin to average
      HL2 fanboy, while it considers FOV a "cheat" and has absolutely screwed up lens
      curvature. Instead i''ll talk only about differences.


      Level-design. [b]Level-design![/b] These levels are even somewhat better than
      HL1. They use space most efficiently, look logical and are not a one corridor
      from start to finish with vortigaunts licking your posterior-checks every 10
      seconds in the "free-roam" cut-scenes. This is just great! New music is fitting
      and pleasant. And the story is slightly better than HL2, while writing is as
      bad, but narrative is just great. Also it doesn''t overstay it''s welcome and
      clocks about 4 hours.'
