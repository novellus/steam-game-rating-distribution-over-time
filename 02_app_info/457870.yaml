    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers[/h1]\n\nYou\
      \ can watch my video review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/SS7y5Awf0-c\n\n\
      I know this game is currently only .49 cents USD (Steam Summer Sale 2019), but\
      \ I just can't recommend it. I didn't have any fun playing any of the mini-games\
      \ and I didn't get .49 cents worth of entertainment value. The whole experience\
      \ felt clunky, especially on the Oculus Rift where every minigame starts behind\
      \ you. \n\nThe minigames themselves wouldn't be so bad if the physics felt right,\
      \ but they don't. On the sword swinging one, there is no tactile feedback to\
      \ your swings. On the basketball minigame, the ball physics seems like it's\
      \ too rigid which makes it difficult to put some trajectory with the further\
      \ targets. On the target shooting one, the gun angle is wrong on the Oculus\
      \ Touch Controllers and you have to spam the trigger finger. Finally, on the\
      \ hoop throwing one, the physics feels too floaty ... like you're throwing a\
      \ ball in space with little gravity.\n\nThere are local leaderboards for each\
      \ minigame. However, I don't want to play any of them anymore after a total\
      \ of 15 minutes of play. Not worth the .49 cents I paid.\n\n[b]Rate 4.5/10.[/b]"
