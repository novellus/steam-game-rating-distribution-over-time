    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Get Forest Warrior 20% off during Early Access!</h2><br>Forest
      Warrior is a game in which you will have to survive a forest full of evil monsters
      like zombies, birds and fire spirits. Using weapons as hatchets, guns and explosives
      you will have to stay alive in increasingly difficult waves. <br><br>Besides
      weapons you are also able to use so called specials. Specials are powerups that
      can be activated in-game. They vary in duration and function and have a certain
      power level. The specials are described in the select menu before starting the
      game. <br><br>While in-game you have four specials per run, of which three can
      be chosen from the select menu whereas the last one (the most powerful one)
      is locked. <br>A particular type of specials are &quot;Allies&quot;. Allies
      can be summoned to back you up while fighting the evil. Examples of allies are
      the Hawk and the Husky. The Hawk helps clear up birds where the Husky helps
      you survive evil monsters at ground level.<br><br><br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.blackshellmedia.com"
