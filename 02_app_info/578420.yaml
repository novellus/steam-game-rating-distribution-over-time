    review: 'This is a wonderful game that really delivers on the "Groundhog Day"
      concept. Each time the day repeats you will have found something new, which
      you can then exploit in the next cycle: either you have found a new item, learned
      the schedule of a new character, or gleaned crucial information about how to
      break the cycle. The game manages the difficult task of making gameplay compelling
      and even addictive without combat or XP or other video game tropes. I also appreciate
      the many quality-of-life features in the game that they maybe didn''t need but
      are what elevate the gameplay: you get to keep items between cycles, there''s
      a very helpful hint system which helps you along without making it too easy,
      and when you die the game often lets you restart just before that happens, without
      making you play it all out again.


      My only gripe is possibly that the story doesn''t neatly wrap up in the end.
      I would have liked to see a really cohesive ending that draws in all the story
      threads from the various endings. But all in all it''s a small criticism. I
      strongly recommend this game!'
