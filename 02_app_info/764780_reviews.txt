I hoped that maybe I could recommend it to friends who've never gotten into the series and interest them into picking up the comics.\n\nAs much as I wanted to though, I can't really do that in good conscious, so that's why I had to downvote it.\n\nNow, it's not to say that there aren't any merits. Mayshing's art and character designs continue to be beautifully done. Any fan of the eDepth Angel comics will be happy to know that everyone's characterizations aren't off in the least. If anything, I thought it was refreshing to be able to spend some time with Lien and Kolei before they became cyborgs since it was only briefly touched upon before. It was also pretty neat to be able to get to know Kolei and Seon along with Lien.\n\nFor me though, I think there were two main issues about the game. One was how I personally found the mystery solving portion of the game too confusing and the other was how there's too much information that a newcomer wouldn't know but is considered commonplace knowledge for the cast. At the very least, it'd probably be recommended to read the game's About section for any information not brought up in the game clearly. (And even then, there's some stuff you'll miss, such as Angel's drive to cure ...)\n\nSure, the game's story isn't exactly straight off of the comic and some things actually go down differently, but it's not really enough to say that it's standalone.\n\n\"[i]So okay, it's not a standalone game, but if you've already read the comic then it should be fine to play, right?[/i]\"\n\nWell... perhaps? It's true that I understood what was going on just fine as a comic reader but... it could just be my own ineptitude but I actually found the investigation aspect really hard?\n\nLike, there's no clear indicator which ones you actually need or if the order of the evidences you placed in the timeline is the correct one. I just found myself praying that I got it right even though nine times out of ten, I immediately got myself in unintended (usually bad) endings.\n\nIf you're able to understand how to go through those sections or if you have the walkthrough at hand then maybe your opinion would probably be more positive. But those two flaws didn't really sit well with me too much to like the game enough. :c","timestamp_created":1535496915,"timestamp_updated":1535496915,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.672202765941619873","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g/GvweUCeIvAqQE="}
