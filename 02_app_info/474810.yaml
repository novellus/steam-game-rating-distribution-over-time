    about_the_game: "Dorke and Ymp is an unreleased Super Nintendo game developed\
      \ back in the early 1990's by a Swedish company called Norse. The game was developed\
      \ with unlicensed tools made by the game programmers. Unfortunately the game\
      \ failed to acquire a publisher and was never released. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      Luckily we found the original programmer, composer, and artist and we acquired\
      \ the source code at about 50% of the game. We worked on the game for over a\
      \ year to finally complete it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis are the new features\
      \ and updates done to the game: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u2022Over 100 Bugs and\
      \ Crashing bugs fixed! <br />\r\n\u2022Added a whole new world and levels (Volcano)\
      \ <br />\r\n\u2022Added Menu, cut-scenes and ending. <br />\r\n\u2022Implemented\
      \ password system <br />\r\n\u2022Designed, developed and implemented boss fights\
      \ (4) according to the original game story. <br />\r\n\u2022Organized the game\
      \ to be able to play with continuity. <br />\r\n\u2022Over 40 levels and 10\
      \ hours of gameplay! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is a puzzle adventure platformer\
      \ in which you got to help Dorke (and Ymp) to do some errands for your evil\
      \ Master Wizard in exchange of training you and teaching you his magic spells.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is very very hard and challenging, but hardcore\
      \ games will have fun playing it!"
