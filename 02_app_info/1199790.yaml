    review: "It's an excellent game, with a very good decision-making system that\
      \ makes you feel like it is your own story. The only thing that I might change\
      \ is that you have to restart the whole story if you want to chose something\
      \ else (Its isn't very convenient when you chose something you didn't want by\
      \ mistake hahah). There is also no way to reread the previous pages. Also, it\
      \ would be awesome if you put some other languages too, like spanish. Anyways,\
      \ It's a beautiful game that I really recommend. I'll look forward to the second\
      \ book! \nEs un excelente juego, con una muy buena toma de decisiones que hace\
      \ que te adue\xF1es de su historia. Lo \xFAnico que quiz\xE1s cambiar\xEDa seria\
      \ que una vez lo juegas y decides algo, tienes que reiniciar la historia completa\
      \ para decidir otra cosa, no se puede volver pagina atr\xE1s para releer lo\
      \ que elegiste. Esperare con ansias el segundo libro!"
