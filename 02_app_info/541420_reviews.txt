Its simple and its good. Its not a game you'll play for all eternity but its nice to come to it once in a while to relax. I like how the board moves and collecting the orbs on hard mode gets really hard once the whole map is filled with these black columns. :D\n\nPls consider this is only 2€ If you got a Vive you probably shouldn't be angry at paying 2€ for a game. Even if it only would be fun for about an hour. I'll keep this under my favorite VR games.","timestamp_created":1479066899,"timestamp_updated":1479066899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o7rQr9gCfsm2ZQ=="}
