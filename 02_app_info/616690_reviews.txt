However my biggest gripe is it's lack of physics that even exist in the most rudimentary of Breakout clones from 30+ years ago.  The ball drops, and where it hits on your paddle has no effect on where it will travel.  It's very random and sometimes VERY frustrating, especially when you are down to your last few pixels.  Momentum of the paddle also has no effect.\nYou'll have a few blocks to go on left field, but no matter how you hit the ball or how hard, it travels to the right.  Since your paddle only has limited hits, you know you'll get a game over.\n\nI play the game with the mouse, and although you see the cursor you can't click on any menu items and are forced to use the keyboard.\n\nI love the crazy \"plot\" screens that appear, but having to restart to the main menu EVERY TIME YOU GET A NEW ONE gets old very fast.  I want to keep coming back, but as the game gets harder you realize more and more how flawed it is.  I'm enjoying the story, and a few parts even had my jaw wide open, but having to grind through the stages becomes a chore.\n\nI really wish the main gameplay was fixed, then this game would easily be worth a purchase.  Otherwise you'll likely be like me and only play a few minutes of time before getting frustrated and shut it off.  Time to go play Arkanoid instead.","timestamp_created":1575354969,"timestamp_updated":1575354969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uqWe5e4CcIm74QE="}
