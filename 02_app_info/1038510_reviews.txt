The slice of life bits are just like any other Visual Novel kool aid you had already consumed if you are into this kind of stuff. The real shine comes in equal parts from the action scenes and the narration of events from the characters past. Both exuted in a magnificent if you are a huge austistic weeb like i am.  All the routes from the game build on the other routes, building a narration that pay dividends if you paid attention to the actions of the characters. \n\nThe characters can be considered cliche in some ways, most of the girls are most affected. But Dies irae is such a surprising story in that it takes those cliches to their limit,  reaveling their true nature along the way. The game would not have been the wild ride that it was if not because of the soundtrack.  The best moments, and the big reveals are masterfully mixed up to deliver an almost tracendental experience. \n\nIn the end it is  dificult to decide to recommend this game,  mostly because by playing it you will become a bigger delusional or chunni weeb that you may be already.  There is also the issue of nazi glorifaction, that while the blow is indeed softened by their status as villians; They are still elevated to the status of demigods, one of the main villians was a real life war criminal from the Gestapo .  All the others are made to be empathic characters by the pitty you could feel for them. \n\nMy final veredict would be:\nPLAY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE A GIANT EDGELORD, or if you have a secret backstory written about yoursellf in wich you have a demon inside your rigth arm, and a secret organization going after your guts. This game is Chuni. \n\nBut among chuuni stuff it is the Zenith. \nas many intelectu/a/ls have said before me: Rusalka is best girl.  \n\n \n\n","timestamp_created":1583357526,"timestamp_updated":1583357526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/8/d0/ACcqmQ9gE="}
