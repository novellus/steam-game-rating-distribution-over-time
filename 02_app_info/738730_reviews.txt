This is not one of them. (Video Version of Review) https://youtu.be/MuJTI98lvEo  This game has 5 stages that can be all beat in less than 15min. One stage is just you kicking 6 stationary politicians in the nuts. That's it. The game over all lacks any real meat or substance, and that's a shame because they really could have made this into more with some additional work and thought. The playground and physics portion of this game is sorely lacking, and the title relies way to heavily on cheap jokes and even cheaper humor. All in all you can get a heck of a lot more for $10 on Steam than this. There is a \"play ground\" stage with derivable vehicle, but even this area is glitchy, uninspired and a real let down. Is this game as bad as Banana Town? No. Is it worth your time or money? No.","timestamp_created":1511234580,"timestamp_updated":1511235334,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.648829638957977295","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw96Wp7t8Ce8bwiwE="}
