[b]Awesomenauts: Overdrive Expansion[/b] isn't that great of an expansion for [url=steamcommunity.com/id/iN008/recommended/204300]Awesomenauts[/url]. It's the same price as [url=steamcommunity.com/id/iN008/recommended/256500]Starstorm[/url] yet you only get 3 nauts instead of Starstorm's 5. One of which is considered to be one of worst nauts in current meta with the other two in Overdrive being decent but not overbearing.\n\nEdit: As of 14-12-2016 and the 3.4 update a 4th naut was included with the Overdrive Expansion.\n\nEdit: Starstorm and Overdrive expansions are no longer sold after the free-to-play update.","timestamp_created":1480445098,"timestamp_updated":1532714721,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566760659217834473","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47tO67uQCeIaPaw=="}
