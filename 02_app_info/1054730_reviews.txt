I can't stop building treasure decks. They are very fun to play. I haven't tried the Mecha cards yet but have lost against Mecha decks several times. If you like Faeria, definitely get this DLC.","timestamp_created":1561920935,"timestamp_updated":1590716813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528745114803314209","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47ImHr/ICf+23yAE="}
