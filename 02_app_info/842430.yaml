    review: Played the game wish it had more of a community from what i see on steam
      this game is either really small and flopped on release because theres no guides
      any where also i look this game up on google it doesnt show up maybe its because
      you have to restart the game every 5 minutues or two space battles because it
      freezes game also punishes you for trieing to go more then one girl at a time
      by making them both ghost you then you can use their training which sucks was
      cool but maybe make it where i can earn the trust back in next games also wish
      i got more from successfully finishing the dates maybe some money would help
      because the dates are so expensive. the vioce acting is really good also loved
      all the girls stories and personalities none of them were bad so its mostly
      gameplay they need to polish besides that was worth the 13$ NEEDS A COMMUNITY
      THO REALLY BAD
