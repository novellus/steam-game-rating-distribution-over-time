It's an RPG Maker game but far from your standard fare and in my opinion a better piece than To The Moon. The story is an abstract fantasy, which is trying to touch important philosophical and ethical questions. Whether it succeeds or not is questionable as is the nature of such topics. It certainly cares them well and while the themes might feel little forced sometimes, it's never without a taste.\nBesides that I would recommend the game for swift gameplay centered around weapons and skills tied to them. This makes each playthrough different. Graphics are really nice and some of my favourite pixel art i have seen this year. Especially the colours are very well selected. \nAnd man, I love the soundtrack. It's where the game really shines. Somewhere among classic rock, Carpenter's synths and 16-bit fantasy games, it hits the sweet spot and just rocks.","timestamp_created":1577653519,"timestamp_updated":1577653519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qcjeqe8CcYKX6AE="}
