Finally I bnought it this holidays because wanted something with good strategy elements.\n\nI started playing and... was bored duo endless tutorials. Read about that, great, now do that, wonderful, read this. Bla bla bla..\nAlso, I am not of fun of such nonsense setting. (you can damage there with insults and kisses), so... tried to do something, clicked different buttons and forced myself to play. Wanted to close the game, but....\nAfter I completed the first expedition and I got myself into World Map, I have started to look for different things. I realized the game is huge and has a lot of deep mechanics. So, I started to play it again... then again... then again. Until I got a great crew. I think the strategy how to train the, and passed it with a high score. \n\nAfter that I bought DLC and started again.\nThe game is great. Check for Pros below tp prove my words.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2351999293\nPros\n- Unusal turn-based combat. You can with with not killing enemies but speaking wit them and making them friendly. There are 3 types of damage type: aggressive, friendly and deviate. There is usual rock-paper mechanics but with these mechanics. Be aggressive against friendly and be deviate against aggressive.\n- 20 characters of 4 classes with slightly different abilities and basic perks. Each character has unique perk if used as a captain. You can take 3 in the battle. So, basically, each walkthrough with new men is different from previous\n- Interesting adventure mode. You explore a location and get resources. Most of events start a combat battle or a text quest. Your explorers should have perks to pass these quests. So, you need to make perfect teams and level up certain perks to be successed.\n- There are 5 expeditions before the game ends. Beetween expeditions you can make researchs, buy items, earn extra resources with jobs, hire people (gives extra perks). This part os the game is really fun\n- There are 5 difficulties in expedition. Each difficulty has 3 different locations.. This and points above make the game EXTREMELY replayable and fun.\n- 2 DLCs which adds even more stuff and mechanaics. The game gets funnier\n- Community makes weekly challenges. The community is still alive.\n- Funny setting of the game. Not serious, but fun and hilarious.\n\nCons\n- Boring tutorial with too much of text blocks. I was very close to close this game and forced myself to play a little more. it got interesting after I appeared in the World Map.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2351999338\n[h1]Resume[/h1]\nAt first glance I found this game confusing, but after I completed a first expedition, I started new game again and again until I finished it with a great score on Iron-Man modification. The game is nice. It is really fun to learn mechanics and thinking about your the best team, planning perks and etc. Also, the game has incredible replayability.  Two DLCs adds even more replayability. There is a lot of achievements. It is fun to play this game with small sessions with long time between them. The game has good combat and extremely satisfying talking/RPG elements. It is very fun to collect stuff and planning your crew after each expedition. Overall, I recommend this game for a full price for all strategy fans.","timestamp_created":1609989399,"timestamp_updated":1609990020,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557894766330718994","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwusO47fYCfc6WwQI="}
