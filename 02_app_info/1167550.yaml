    review: "To view stereoscopic photos, this program is the best for me at the moment.\n\
      It works without any problems except for rare crashes, although I have not yet\
      \ been able to determine whether the program or other parts (PC / VR glasses)\
      \ are responsible for this.\nIf you want to view your own 3D photos with VR\
      \ glasses, you should use this software.\n\nI find the price/performance ratio\
      \ very good.\n\n(Made with DeepL ;) )\n\n\nUm stereoskopische Fotos zu betrachten\
      \ ist dieses Programm f\xFCr mich momentan das Beste.\nEs funktioniert bis auf\
      \ seltene Abst\xFCrze problemlos, wobei ich noch nicht feststellen konnte, ob\
      \ das Programm oder andere Teile (PC / VR Brille) daf\xFCr verantwortlich sind.\n\
      \nWer insbesondere selbst gemachte 3D Photos mit einer VR Brille betrachten\
      \ will, sollte zu dieser Software greifen.\n\nPreis/Leistungsverh\xE4ltnis finde\
      \ ich sehr gut."
