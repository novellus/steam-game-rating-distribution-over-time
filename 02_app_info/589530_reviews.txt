I was playing using a controller and it said that Y/triangle was the skip button, and X/square was the menu. It was reversed for me. I don't know if this is a common issue but feel it's worth mentioning.\n\n[u] Pros [/u]\n[list]\n[*] Mostly voice acted aside from the main character (Japanese)\n[*] High production quality\n[*] Good and consistent art style\n[*] While trope-y, the characters are likable\n[*] Auto-play and skip read features are nice\n[/list]\n\n[u] Could Be a Pro or a Con [/u]\n[list]\n[*] If you're into otome games, you probably know which ones you want to romance by looking at them\n[*] Some storylines are more romantic than others, and can lead to the main character feeling more or less impactful on the other characters/plot\n[/list]\n\n[u] Cons [/u]\n[list]\n[*] Your mileage may vary on this, but the game is very loosely based on real people and events. The romance options are based on actual people, and if that makes you uncomfortable, this might not be for you. That said they're very anime-fied and fit neatly into standard otome tropes so it is easy to look past.\n[*] This is a personal peeve but there are some potential love interests that will walk into the plot and promptly exit if you don't pick the options related to them, never to be seen again (unless you want to romance them in another playthrough). Feels a little weird to meet a guy for one scene and never talk to him again when the game feels like it's yelling at you to look at him.\n[*] This game has a sequel, so if you're enjoying it I recommend grabbing Hakuoki: Edo Blossoms to know what happens. The good endings do not actually end.\n[/list]\n\nI highly recommend Aniva's achievement guide if you're into achievement hunting or just want to see different routes!","timestamp_created":1609894265,"timestamp_updated":1609895114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0b7O6vYCeoHvwAI="}
