This is a good series so far.","timestamp_created":1581004783,"timestamp_updated":1581004783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570137560367584229","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42c/OjfACcJnI8AE="}
