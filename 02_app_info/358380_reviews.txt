Instead I had Wacky Wheels, and good god was it fun,\n\nAs a PC game the graphics and \"3d\" world rendering were done better. Arguably firing live hedgehogs at your fellow racers is more fun than turtle shells. Undoubtedly I will pick the shark as my main racer every single time hands down.\n\nI am writing this review because I loved this game as a child, and continue to love it as an adult.\nI hope that even one of you out there finds this game and can manage to see it through the eyes of a kid in 1994, exploring gaming on a DOS Packard Bell machine with the option to upgrade and boot to the mostly useless Win 95, and will understand the wonder and potential  I saw in computer gaming at that time. If I can be a shark, driving a go kart in 3d, firing live hedgehogs at other racers, on this computer... what must the future hold. What untold potential will I witness in my life?\n\nThis is where it all began for me.\n\n","timestamp_created":1607589921,"timestamp_updated":1607589921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jvD0pfYCdsHQuAI="}
