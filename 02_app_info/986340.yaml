    review: "Having Played and loved Apollo 11 HD and Titanic VR. I was expecting\
      \ something a bit better than this arcade endless runner with historical elements.\n\
      \nFirstly though, I aplaude the dev's guts for attempting to make this a fun\
      \ experience, but ultimately it came off feeling somewhat rushed an also a little\
      \ disrepectful, historically.\n\nCompared with the sinking scene in Titanic\
      \ VR which was treated with care, in this, the training and any sense of comradery\
      \ between the crew is all rushed through to drop us into the action. \n\nI would\
      \ have preferred to have a high quality version of the Arvo Lancaster to walk\
      \ around and familiarise myself with. And even the ability to use a grip and\
      \ pull locomotion method to get into each of the positions on the plane, it\
      \ would have helped give a sense of scale and presence which is lacking when\
      \ you're just stuck in a seat.\n\nWhile the cockpit looked quite nice, the external\
      \ detail of buildings and forests was entirely lacking.\n\nAnd all the little\
      \ gamified elements, recycled assets of trees buildings etc were repeated ad\
      \ nauseam on the journey to the dam. And while I do appreciate the difficulty\
      \ of re creating the actual flight to target, as well as the periods of \"boredom\"\
      , at the same time I would have loved it there was a simplified version of night\
      \ navigation, trying to spot navigation landmarks etc.\n\nI had a lot of difficulty\
      \ with the controls of the plane. I was using my Rift S controllers, and never\
      \ really found a satisfactory way to ensure that I was always in control of\
      \ the plane. I'd be flying for a while, manuvering, then suddenly I'd have no\
      \ control over my pitch, I'd glance down and my hand wasn't on the yoke anymore.\
      \ \n\nAnyway, I'm still happy that this exists. But it's purpose for existing\
      \ leaves me scratching my head a little. \n\nWhy go to all the effort to create\
      \ \"Immersive Vr Education\" if you're going to simply gloss over some of the\
      \ more incredible parts of the story. \n\nBut I guess, at the end of the day,\
      \ it was probably the same with Apollo 11 HD and Titanic VR. Needing to cheat\
      \ the realism in order to still have a \"game\" \n\nSo yeah, those are my thoughts.\
      \ \n\nI'm very interested to see what Immersive VR Education come up with for\
      \ their next project.\n\nBut for Lancasters, I'll be keeping my eye on the development\
      \ of Valiant Effort, (and the Mighty Eighth)\n\n"
