    review: "First 30 minute MIXED REALITY and VR gameplay of Robot Incursion, enjoy\
      \ guys:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyWzzUSGPho\n\nShort Review (will\
      \ be updated soon):\n\nRobot Incursion is a surprisingly immersive, good looking\
      \ and well made wave-based First Person Shooter in Virtual reality! The Mixed\
      \ Reality feature is working and looks perfect in this game, as you freely move\
      \ around in your roomscale area, shoot robots, hide behind objects and defend\
      \ yourself in constant action. I really think Robot Incursion deserves more\
      \ attention!\n\nRobot Incursion is a single player game (so far) and you play\
      \ as a soldier defending your base, your teammates and of course yourself agains\
      \ evil robots, space ships and creatures in a beautiful future-inspired environment.\
      \ Being an early access title, Robot Incursion already contains plenty of different\
      \ areas to play within, all of them with unique atmosphere, weather conditions,\
      \ varied enemies and som impressive and detailed graphics and physics.\n\nThe\
      \ control system in Robot Incursion is really awesome, as you manually pick\
      \ up, reload and hold the weapons with the Vive motion controllers and that\
      \ really gives you total feeling of presence in VR. Standing and controlling\
      \ the big turret weapon, or fireing off the Assault Rifle is something you just\
      \ have to try out! \n\nRobit Incursion includes a simple training tutorial that\
      \ lets let you practice your weapon handling before you move out and start playing\
      \ this VR experience. AI and level of difficulty is quite high, and it really\
      \ is a challenge to make it more than a few minutes on each wave/map/level.\
      \ Well, I like this game and I hope more content, weapons and maps will be added\
      \ soon. \n\nI will update my review when more time is spent on the game, and\
      \ when more content is added. For now, Im recommending this game for all of\
      \ you that likes wave-shooter FPS games, just give it a try - it IS nice! :)\n\
      \n"
