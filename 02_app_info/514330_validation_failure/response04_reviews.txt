You think Activision, EA, Bugthesda and Bugisoft are biggest villains of gaming industry? Then you really should get familiar with Koei Tecmo:\n\n100$ season passes? Check\nBad console ports? Check\nOverpriced games & dlcs without any discounts? Check\n60$ games that went F2P soon after release? Check\nSelling same things as dlc in two different games? Check\nBad communication with the community? Check\nDLC with expiration dates (this is new low invented by them) ? Check\n\nDownvote is for Koei, not for Mai - she's great addition from KOF series.\nKT you are hopeless and beyond saving, blacklisted.","timestamp_created":1568109402,"timestamp_updated":1568109402,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+dKmje0Cd+n90QE="}
