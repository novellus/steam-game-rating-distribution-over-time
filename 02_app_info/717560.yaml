    review: 'Beautiful art, a good cast of voice actors and an intersting beginning.


      I would love to recommend this game, but the flaws outweigh the good too much.
      The game feels like the first chapter in a much longer story, both because of
      its length and because of the way the ending is written. The lore initially
      seems very interesting, but then turns out to be much more stale than expected.
      The three cases don''t really become more difficult or engaging as the culprit
      is obvious from the start. All in all this feels more like a proof of concept
      than a finished product.'
