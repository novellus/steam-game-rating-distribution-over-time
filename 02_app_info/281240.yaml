    review: It is not the best "hidden treasure" type of game and does not worth the
      price (although it's quite cheap). The items are sometimes too hard to find.
      I'm only playing this(or replaying) because I had played this about 10 years
      ago, so I'm just enjoying the nostalgic feeling. Nevertheless, the story is
      not too boring but I personally think that this game should be free.
