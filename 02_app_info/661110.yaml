    review: "I haven't played a lot of it but so far it is interesting I have played\
      \ longer than stated by steam because I end up playing offline a lot. I seem\
      \ to miss a lot of our hits but that could be because it takes getting used\
      \ to the controls. Interesting concept as far as combat goes, I don't think\
      \ I've played a game like it. I believe it will pick up speed with time, but\
      \ I was a bit confused with the tutorial but I also am not the most attentive\
      \ player. Check some gameplay for it and make your own decision. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRnLb3QI-yM"
