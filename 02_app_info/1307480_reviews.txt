After a short while it's just the same missions over and over.  No challenge.  Even at $2 this game is over priced.  The developer would do good to drop it a dollar.  I mean, I enjoyed it for the first 15 minutes.  That could be worth a dollar.  But I can rent a movie for $2 and enjoy myself for 90 minutes.  Based on that...over priced.","timestamp_created":1608181852,"timestamp_updated":1608181852,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9vTGt/YCfsnuugI="}
