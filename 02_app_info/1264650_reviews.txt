The music really adds to the appeal of the game. I'm also impressed with the ethnic diversity of the characters in this game, and the dialogue is amusing at times too, but well-written. This is probably one of the best HOG I have ever played. Pleasing to look at, easy to navigate, and the puzzles are fun.\nThere are a couple annoying things about this game, like the screen freezing with ice if you click too much, but the most annoying thing is that the items that you need another item to open/get to it with are not highlighted or otherwise made noticeable at all. That would have been really nice to have so I didn't have to click around everywhere looking for the special item. I think another game I played used sparkles of some kind to distinguish it and then when you hovered over it it told you that you needed another item to use this item. \nOne thing that really, really bothers me is that there is a mobile phone in a couple of the HO scenes and I can't for the life of me figure out why....it's never an item you are supposed to find and I need to know what the purpose of it being there is.\nOverall, 9/10, would buy again.","timestamp_created":1606541870,"timestamp_updated":1606542570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.619047641754150391","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwocbZhvYCeKWYtAI="}
