    about_the_game: "Ludo Online is a strategy board game for two to six players,\
      \ in which the players race their four pawns from start to finish according\
      \ to the rolls of a single dice. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo, three, four, five\
      \ or six can play without partnerships, players can be human or computer-controlled,\
      \ playing on the same computer or across the internet. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      At the beginning of the game, each player's four pawns are staged in the player's\
      \ yard. To enter a pawn into play from its yard to its starting position, a\
      \ player must roll a six. Each player throws once each turn unless he throws\
      \ six, when he has another throw. The pawns are moved forward as many squares\
      \ as the dice indicates. Players may not end their move on a position they already\
      \ occupy. If the advance of a pawn ends on a square occupied by an opponent's\
      \ pawn, the opponent pawn is returned to its yard. The player who moves all\
      \ of his pawns in the home row first wins the game. Second and third places\
      \ are determined based on how many pawns players have gotten home."
