You don't have control of the game like 99% of the time...\nClassified the story as boring after being patient reading text until chapter 2... After that... \nremoved auto scroll and left click mouse as crazy at the corner until choices appears.\nEven I crossed that ugly bug already documented in chapter 6 and they haven't fixed.\nGood thing there is a \"workaround\".\nAt the end section... started reading again... it raised the quality of the story a little but still it does not provide any reward in replay.\nIf they had the models to get the pictures for the graphic novel, they should have made at least a cinematic experience. Static pictures does not provide any sense of story engagement.\n","timestamp_created":1583762184,"timestamp_updated":1583762184,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467775493860244751","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9KLl3/ACcI6H9wE="}
