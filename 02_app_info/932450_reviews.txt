The gameplay is really solid, with a decent progression curve and there's only one move that becomes kinda redundant late game, the rest are all situationally really useful. It really encourages you to think about every move you make, and I really got engrossed in playing it. Boss fights feel really epic too, with really rad soundtrack!\n\nPlot wise, I'd say it's pretty good overall. The initial leap from the protag being a harmless nun to a cold-blooded killer does require a bit of suspension of disbelief, but the way her character changes over the course of the game is really interesting to watch. There's a cool amount of lore and the characters are interesting to interact with.\n\nAll in all, I'd definitely recommend this game. For the price you're paying, you're getting a fun, challenging, deliciously dark experience with a soundtrack that I would honestly pay to get.\n\n(On that note, creator, if you were to put up the game's OST for sale on Steam or somewhere, I'd absolutely buy it.)","timestamp_created":1568659575,"timestamp_updated":1568659575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jbLZne0CdfWt0gE="}
