While this table still seems to reset all progress towards a mode or multiball on every drain, which is frustrating, there are interesting options for scoring that can be achieved more quickly. A nice mix of easier, reliable shots with some rather difficult shots, too. I felt like I had good control of the ball and could attempt what I wanted to try; some tables it's more like the ball is just laughing at you and going where it wants, but not here. While I don't regret my purchase of their earlier remake tables, I'm happier with this one.","timestamp_created":1489170723,"timestamp_updated":1489170723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.643637537956237793","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i77f3NoCfPCKdA=="}
