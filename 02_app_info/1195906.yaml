    review: "Good combination of male and female protagonists this time. Other DLC\
      \ packs had only female characters often but this has a better balance (6 male\
      \ / 10 female characters).  The quality is also good with various bust types,\
      \ full body images, and SV and walking sprites. So everything you need if you\
      \ want to use it for RMMV (or Visual Novel Maker).\nThe quality of the characters\
      \ are like the Heroine Packs. However, I find this pack better because it is\
      \ more balanced in male and female protagonists! \nThank you for listening Degica\
      \ and I hope we can see more Character packs with a balanced number of male\
      \ and female characters. :)\n\n"
