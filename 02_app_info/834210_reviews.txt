I bought game + DLC and regret this after 10 minutes...\n1. This game is so simple that can be made in Unity in less than 1 day.\n2. There is no tactic, strategy - nothing in this game. You can just buy 3 idle source of income and... nothing more. There is no progress, no new planets - nothing\n3. Game is totaly empty. You can click on 4 diffrent things and do nothing more\n4. GAME RESET YOUR PROGRESS RANDOMLY! I played 10 minutes and clicked 3000 times. I was kicked out from game, when I started it again I needed to start from zero. Same happen when you buy DLC and choose diffrent planet (mirrored + diffrent color = 2 USD payment... really?)\n\nSummary: It is the worst clicker game i ever saw. I can not believe that want 5USD from me (in Poland) for this crap which can be made in few hours with very basic Unity knowledge. The worst is that there is no progress system and even your ingame \"gold\" is reseted without reason.\n\nJust avoid this game - even the worst free to play clicker game is better than this scam.","timestamp_created":1523380621,"timestamp_updated":1523380621,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.66095048189163208","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1523477535,"developer_response":"Good day dear customer\n\nWe are very sorry that you do not like our product.\nThe timer was wanted.
