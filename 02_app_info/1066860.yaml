    review: 'If your wanting to try this out you can go to the official web page and
      get the non commercial version their, its free to use, but you cant license
      them unless you get the commercial version. it''s kind of like RPG maker but
      you have the freedom to make simple 3D Objects, like table''s counters and book
      shelves. you can even make the environment 3D.


      it dose not come with a lot but you can add your own grafix and even change
      how many pixels are in the tiles. the default is 16X16.


      If your having problems then you can go to their how to guide at

      ( http://-paper-maker.github.io ). at the time of this comment the guide is
      not complete but it still gives you the basics.


      I''ve been using RPG maker''s since 2k and its like the newer RPG makers. if
      you are use to XP, VX, VX Ace, and/or MV then it will take a little while to
      get use to it but the system is similar enough that you can figure out what
      dose what.


      "I recommend getting the free version to try it out like a demo then if you
      like it buy the commercial version and if you don''t like it. then give it a
      few months and try it again. if you still don''t like it then don''t buy the
      commercial version.


      The free version as of this comment is at ( http://rpg-paper-maker.com/index.php/downloads
      )


      NOTE: Paper RGP maker is not done yet and still has a ways to go.'
