    review: "I had a lot of fun with it enjoyed the game only ran into a few hiccups,\
      \ [strike]after saving in a cave (at the edge of the map or things just weren't\
      \ loading?) the game soft-locked and will no longer load the profile resulting\
      \ in i guess starting over.[/strike] This has since been fixed in recent updates\
      \ so i'm back at it again.\n\nwishing I could rebind a few keys but this is\
      \ more of a personal preference than an issue with the game I just always go\
      \ to tab instead of  the \"i key\" to open the inventory. \n\ntrying to figure\
      \ out how ropes work as I seem to always take fall damage if I use them to scale\
      \ lower into the caves. \n\nThe Music is always banging and could listen for\
      \ hours. Overall just a nice exploration game some times panic and a lot of\
      \ fun."
