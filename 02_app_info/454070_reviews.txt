That being said, it does have its shortcomings (all games do, after all), especially considering the constraints of most single, part-time developers.\nThat being said, the game is a complete, lovely experience, overall. Nowadays, the game is single player only, unless you either start a server, or find and join an existing one. The original, existing one that once was, sadly, is no more. That is hardly a deal-breaker though, because the game is fun as is, simply as something to jump into and explore a lovely, old school, fantasy world. The game is free after all; which is quite a bargain to me, for what it is.\nThere is a plethora of spells, a good amount of skills and enough crafting skills, not to mention a huge amount of individual levels for each of these - that makes progression very worthwhile, builds can be extremely varied, and it will take a long time to max most any one of the skills.\nComing-up with new and interesting builds is part of the fun of it for me, although I do tend to hover somewhere around Battle Mage Cleric whenever I can.\nHaving said that, it does not take long before your character is feeling powerful, at first gaining dominion over those persistent and pervasive undead. Although, that's not where you have to start; is simply one option.\nYou can tame a great variety of beasts, ride them and even tame some humanoids.This can lead to some interesting, and rather hilarious, moments.\nThe amount of items are varied enough to where it feels rewarding to discover something new, comparing its feasibility with current equipment.\nMore could be said, but it's better to simply experience it. My character is only level 20 currently, and there is SO much more to see, do, etc. Oh, did I mention you can buy a ship and sail around?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld Review:\n[spoiler]One of those indie games that could've been fun. Definitely needs a lot more work put into it, but that isn't happening at this point.[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1564256084,"timestamp_updated":1598472584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52702707052230835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtP+YlvQCd42fzwE="}
