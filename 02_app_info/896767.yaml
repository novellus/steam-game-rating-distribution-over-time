    about_the_game: "At the end of the 1970s, Electro-Motive sought a successor to\
      \ its landmark SD40-2 locomotive and for its 645-series power plant. That effort\
      \ would spawn Electro-Motive\u2019s \u201C60-series\u201D diesel locomotives\
      \ and EMD\u2019s evolutionary 710-series engine. But tucked between the classic\
      \ SD40-2 and the SD60 was a transitional model that would take the 645-series\
      \ power plant to its highest levels of output and preview design features of\
      \ the 60-series. That locomotive was the SD50.<br><br>In 1980, the first SD50s\
      \ appeared with the delivery of six pre-production units for Norfolk &amp; Western.\
      \ Deliveries of regular production versions of the SD50 began in the spring\
      \ of 1981, and from 1981 through 1985 421 standard SD50s would be constructed\
      \ using EMD\u2019s traditional \u201CSpartan\u201D cab design. To improve the\
      \ appeal of the SD50 during its production run, EMD had, in late 1984, boosted\
      \ the horsepower rating of the model from 3,500 to 3,600 horsepower and had\
      \ introduced improved alternators and traction motors. As such, the SD50 matched,\
      \ with a 16-cylinder power plant, the potency once reserved for EMD\u2019s 645-series\
      \ 20-cylinder SD45.<br><br>Over its production life, the SD50 garnered 12 original\
      \ buyers. Conrail was the largest buyer, acquiring 135 SD50s. The railroads\

      \ 81 units; Chesapeake &amp; Ohio 43, and Baltimore &amp; Ohio, 20.<br><br>Most\

    short_description: Tucked between the classic SD40-2 and the SD60 was a transitional
      model that would take the 645-series power plant to its highest levels of output
      and preview design features of the 60-series. That locomotive was the SD50.

    review: "Textures:\n\nLocomotive has pretty good textures, on par with DTG's Seaboard\
      \ U36B pack.  However, the winter textures on the trucks are a bit wonky, like\
      \ they\u2019ve been run through a monochrome negative filter or something.\n\
      \nI would rate textures a 4/5.\n\nDetails/Special features:\n\nThe locomotive\
      \ contains a few special features that have been carried over from the D&RGW\
      \ base model:\n\nThe clapper on the bell moves when the bell is activated, the\
      \ doors and windows can be opened and closed (the rear door also changes the\
      \ engine sounds in the cab), and toggle-able number board, class, and platform\
      \ lights (the class lights appear to only shine white though).\n\nI would rate\
      \ details/special features a 3/5.\n\nSounds:\n\nThe engine sounds are quite\
      \ good, except that they are from the wrong model of engine (the included sounds\
      \ appear to have been recorded from an EMD 645E3, which is found in locomotive\
      \ models such as the SD40-2.  The real SD50s used EMD 645F  engines, which sound\
      \ closer to the MP36PH-3C engine sounds from the Peninsula Corridor route).\n\
      \nThe horn sounds are pretty bad, it sounds like the microphone had water in\
      \ it during the recording process.  The bell is the standard bell sound the\
      \ DTM products have, which unfortunately can't be heard inside the cab.\n\n\
      I would rate sounds a 3/5.\n\nPhysics:\n\nPhysics are alright, the locomotive\
      \ has a decent amount of pulling power, and the dynamic brakes don't cause the\
      \ train to jump the tracks like in some other locomotives.  Air brakes feel\
      \ a bit too strong though.\n\nI would rate physics 4/5.\n\nScenarios:\n\nUnfortunately,\
      \ the locomotive doesn't appear to feature any scenarios, I would have liked\
      \ to see at least one scenario for the Miami - WPB route or the Clinchfield\
      \ Railroad route.\n\nWould rate scenarios 1/5.\n\nTotal score for this DLC is\
      \ a D-.\n\nI would recommend waiting for a sale to pick up this DLC."
