You can hardly walk around crowded areas of areas with lots of structures without the game completely failing or crashing your entire computer.  Not to mention when it crashes it completely locks up the computer and makes it so you can't do anything except hard shutdown your device which isn't good for a computer.  Even my friend who owns a 4k gaming computer can't even run the dang thing properly even with potato settings.  The game tells you to \"avoid crowded areas to keep the game functioning properly\" or something in the notes that shows up in the loading screen but that's physically impossible to do when the first area you are sent to after the sea base area is a crowded area with lots of mobs and structures.  Good job thinking that one through!  This game needs a lot of help and work before you should even consider buying it, if I could I would refund it.","timestamp_created":1609409933,"timestamp_updated":1609409933,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ47NWT3PYCcOqHvwI="}
