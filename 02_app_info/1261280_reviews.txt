Its addictive and reminds me of nostalgic time playing similar flash games. Also, wide variety of metal and peaceful music sets the mood and at times it enhances the experience when executing slick saves and moves. Once you get used to its fast-paced grappling mechanic it become too addictive to die and try again.. Loved this game <3","timestamp_created":1587215937,"timestamp_updated":1587216594,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxebexvECcIncgQI="}
