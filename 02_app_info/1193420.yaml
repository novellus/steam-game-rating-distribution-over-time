      card game where you play 1 of 9 Factions to control the future direction of
      the USA.  Each Faction has it's own Card Deck which you either play against
      your opponent's hand or use to gather resources from each US State. Each Card
      has a specific action when played such as controlling a resource or blocking
      another Faction in a state. By the end of the game, the Faction controlling
      the most US States wins the game. <br><br><img src="https://media.st.dl.pinyuncloud.com/steam/apps/1193420/extras/icon32.png?t=1586794928"
