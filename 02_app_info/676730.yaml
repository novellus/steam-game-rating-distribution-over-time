    review: I mostly can't agree with the negative reviews. From someone who plays
      a lot indie horrorgames, this one is not bad. It has a few jumpscares, it's
      really short and the puzzles are, except from 1 time, logic and don't take much.
      But it made me feel scared a couple times and even when the story is not the
      best, it's totally worth being played. I liked it, but I got it on sale, probably
      wouldn't buy it for the full price.
