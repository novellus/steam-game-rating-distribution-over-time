    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers[/h1]\n\nYou\
      \ can view my video of gameplay here: https://youtu.be/oFRFZ76Kevw\n\nI paid\
      \ $1.99 USD for this game on a Steam sale. However, I am happy it went free\
      \ to play for everyone to enjoy. This is a good app, but it obviously went free\
      \ to play for a reason. It's just clunky overall to use. \n\nIf you can look\
      \ past the unintuitive UI / tools then you can enjoy easy-to-make Dioramas with\
      \ lots of toys to play with included. There are lots of 3D models you can use\
      \ in this app to create many different scenes. It's easy to move around (press\
      \ grab to move yourself around) and rotate objects or the world (grab + joystick\
      \ left or right). \n\nI could not figure out a way to delete items once created\
      \ (looking at the community forums, the dev says on the Oculus to press Y while\
      \ holding an object - I thought I had tried that). I don't think there's a way\
      \ to make new objects or import / export objects or your final creations. However,\
      \ it is enjoyable to view the dioramas already-made within this app or view\
      \ your own creations. Probably one of the easiest creation tools once you get\
      \ the hang of the interface. \n\nObviously, this app is limited in what you\
      \ can do, but the trade off is that it's very easy to create worlds. I was able\
      \ to make a good looking diorama using the pre-made assets in about 10-15 minutes\
      \ with little knowledge of this software. The question becomes though: what\
      \ good is it to create something if you can't easily share it with anybody else?\n\
      \n[b]Rate 7/10. It's free and it's one of the better free apps on Steam. I just\
      \ wish the tools & UI were more polished.[/b]"
