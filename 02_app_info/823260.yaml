    review: 'The music for this game was one of the best parts for me. It sets theme
      wonderfully and is great example of what you can do with synth.  Listening it
      to the first time I kept saying things like, "Huh, why is this next song called
      ''It Will All Be Okay''? ... ... OH YEAH *THIS* SONG THAT IS TOTALLY WHAT THAT
      IS."


      It''s probably not going to have that effect for you if you didn''t like the
      game.  But if you did then this is a fantastic addition.'
