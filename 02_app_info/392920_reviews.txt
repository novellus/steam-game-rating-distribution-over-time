I tried a grab bag of \"Compatibility Mode Settings\", all failed UNTIL...\n\nIn addition to suggested settings*, YOU MUST CHOOSE THE \"RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR\" COMPATIBILITY OPTION.  You will only need to do it once.  (for me, it kept asking for password like 7 times, wrote to disk,, exited).  I shut off admin mode (needed 1x only) and WHALA:  game runs fine.  I chose \"Windows Xp release 3\" and \"16 bit color mode\" Compat settings too.\n\nYOU MUST START THE GAME FROM THE PROGRAM FOLDER (game.exe somewhere in steam's folder system).  You cannot launch it from Steam's front end wrapper thing.\n\nAFTER THAT:  runs like most RPGMAKER games, windowed mode runs fine too.\n\nThe game has a big an EXCELLENT completely game guide (.pdf) (hidden) in the Steam folder somewheres.\n\n--------------------\nHaven't played much yet but saw the guide so I'm going to give this game a YES \"at some price\".  You can probably find the game guide if you want to know if it's worth what the current price is.\n\nGraphics:  good and some original some rpgmaker re-used\n\nMusic:  higher end, good, and not \"the same old rpgmaker\" songs i remember.\n\nGame:  played little, but seems good and the guide shows it's got some good detail to it\n\nYES RECOMMEND:  but don't do what I did:  get it working before 2 days expire incase you can't get it to work","timestamp_created":1608197031,"timestamp_updated":1609065802,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkfXy0fYCfv/yugI="}
