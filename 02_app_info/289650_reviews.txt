My real time played overall is 274 hours and 14 min. \n\nImo the best AC game overall. But the release really hurt this game. \n\nIf you're sick of the RPG style and or want to try an older AC game this is the one to play. Co-op is also a blast when it works... that said you can do it solo for an immense challenge. \n\nCombat is also skilful , engaging and challenging (at least until you reach the max weapons). \n\nFor me it's a 9/10, however realistically it's an 8/10.","timestamp_created":1610045121,"timestamp_updated":1610045121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ntyK7/YCe+urwQI="}
