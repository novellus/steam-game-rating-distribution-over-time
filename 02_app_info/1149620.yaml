      \ Station Simulator is all about renovating, expanding and running a gas station\
      \ along a highway in the middle of a desert. Freedom of choice and multiple\
      \ approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients\
      \ in this game.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_RENOVATE.gif?t=1608303432\"\
      \ /><br>Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it\
      \ to its former glory. Get rid of the broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint\
      \ and decorate. Just don\u2019t spend all your cash on the looks right away,\
      \ you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy those that can\u2019\
      t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations\
      \ and improvements.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_Expand.gif?t=1608303432\"\
      \ /><br>The more you widen your gas station\u2019s appeal, the more customer\
      \ demands will vary. The truckers want a healthy meal and a shower while the\
      \ Tesla driver wants a Latte while he waits for his car to charge up. Expand\
      \ the range of services you offer by adding stations, buildings and appropriate\
      \ equipment. Why not expand and build a shop area, build a car wash station\
      \ or even a small motel? How about some slot machines to ramp up the profits?<br><br><img\

      \ /><br>Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch\
      \ another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have\
      \ already built, ranging from your own color schemes, the name of your gas station\
      \ to decorations inside and outside.<br>Don\u2019t forget to advertise! Letting\
      \ people know about your existence and services you expand will drive even more\
      \ customers to you. It might not come cheap, but pays for itself in the long\

      \ /><br>Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success.\
      \ They all expect to have their cars filled up and their food served right away.\
      \ You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours\
      \ and have to schedule various tasks for when it\u2019s less hectic. Proper\
      \ time management and closing the right priorities becomes very important when\
      \ it comes to keeping your customers happy.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_Hire.gif?t=1608303432\"\
      \ /><br>You can try, but the more you expand the less likely that you will be\
      \ able to manage it all on your own. Hire the right people to help you run your\
      \ business, but keep a close eye on them. Some employees might just not do their\
      \ job right, slack, lack the right attitude to serve customers or even steal.<br><br><img\

      \ stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps\
      \ to keep profits up. You can also opt to increase your profits further by procuring\
      \ from less reputable sources. Remember the gas truck that went missing last\
      \ week the newspaper wrote about? Well, a shady character is just offering you\
      \ a full gas delivery at half the price\u2026<br>Or maybe you want to take some\

      \ some are just out to get you. Don\u2019t worry, you have many stupid and mean\
      \ things you can do to take revenge on such people. Drop their food, be extra\
      \ slow to hand things over, shake their soda real good or just throw stuff at\
      \ them. Dozens of ways to get back at those nasty ones. Just don\u2019t overdo\
