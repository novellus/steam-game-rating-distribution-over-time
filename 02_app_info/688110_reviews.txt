You'd think by 2017 we'd have seen it all for this dead horse of a genre, but Blockgame takes that rotting horse corpse and reanimates it with an innovative mechanic: you control a character that must jump, dodge, and get the goat (literally) to match the endlessly falling blocks. The fantastic characters and music are only the topping of this tasty little snack of an indie game. \n\nMr.Mug/10","timestamp_created":1505954893,"timestamp_updated":1505954893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537191569805145264","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zIH60N4Cd4rwhQE="}
