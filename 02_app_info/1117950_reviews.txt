On top of this, only Tenzou offers re-vamped enemies/gimmicks layouts, while Call and Joule share the same scenario with the original game.\n\nThis being said, while out of the 2 DLCs I'd recommend the other one more, this one was still fun and totally worth it if you can't get enough of this game. \n\nAbout each character:\n\nCall:\nHer main gimmick is the helping robots she can use. There are 3 different types, but they're very samey, and only one of them guarantees a burst combo, so I'd tend to either only use that one type, or disable them altogether outside of boss battles.\n\nJoule:\nHer special power allows her to equip for a brief moment of time any and all upgrades no matter the CP cost, and this, without infering on your score. It is a tons of fun to equip literally everything and kill bosses in 3 seconds.\n\nTenzou:\nHe can crouch and slide, as well as slowly fly around (though that will cost you 500 CP, which is a lot more than any other character's \"aerial action\"), and his special power can lock-on to any enemy on the screen and guarantee a burst combo. \nThe experience is very Mega Man-y, and since he's the only one with new and different enemy/gimmick layouts, he's definitely the highlight of this DLC.","timestamp_created":1594649102,"timestamp_updated":1594659693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nPzHpPMCd+6DlQI="}
