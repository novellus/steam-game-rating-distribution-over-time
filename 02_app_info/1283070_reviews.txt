It is really a unique game the way pieces can be picked up, overlapping, and even upside  down.  Sometime pieces will fall on the floor instead of the table and you will need to navigate to pick them up.  Strangely enough I enjoy the challenges of placing pieces.  However, the update in the spring kind of broke the enjoyment because the graphics look like you are putting together a quilt instead of a puzzle.  The borders are too distracting so it is difficult to know which piece goes where.  If development can provide the option so the graphics clearly transition to the next piece as before I would make this my favorite puzzle game.  Right now it is borderline to recommend the game because of the quilt appearance, but do like the developers ingenuity.","timestamp_created":1596841593,"timestamp_updated":1596841593,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iqHL5fMCc+CImgI="}
