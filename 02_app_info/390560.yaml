    short_description: A fighting game designed from the ground up to be so easy to
      control that even non-fighting game players can play it, yet deep enough to
      play in tournaments. Vibrant graphics and excellent online play.

    review: "[h1]tl;dr[/h1]\nFantasy Strike is worse than Smash Ultimate but it's\
      \ arguably more accessible and has most of the quality of life features that\
      \ fighting games [i]need[/i]. The game is poorly monetized and not perfectly\
      \ balanced but the core gameplay is free and fun. To not try it would be stupid.\n\
      \nFantasy Strike is more than just \"another fighting game.\" It's a philosophy\
      \ that fighting games should be for everyone.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]+Accessible.[/b]\
      \ Most fighters require hours of practice to achieve [i]basic competency[/i]\
      \ with a character. Strange inputs and ridiculous combos are either hard on\
      \ the fingers or require a lot of practice for no reason. Fantasy Strike is\
      \ different. The controls are purposefully designed to be as simple as possible\
      \ without losing any of the depth that fighting games are known for. There are\
      \ also spotlight videos to get you up to speed on any character in under 10\
      \ minutes. You can also disable macros to ensure that every input is exactly\
      \ what you want (unlike grabs in Smash Bros.).\n[*][b]+Great feedback.[/b] From\
      \ the \"JUMPABLE!\" and \"COUNTERHIT!\" messages to the frame advantage sparks\
      \ and flashing hit points (in danger of guard damage), this game's feedback\
      \ is immaculate. You'll usually know what's going on and what you did wrong.\n\
      [*][b]+Competitive.[/b] You can't grind or pay for characters or power.\n[*][b]+Elegant.[/b]\
      \ The yomi counter is especially innovative and fun. It's beautiful!\n[*][b]+Challenging.[/b]\
      \ While FS is easy to pick up it's [i]very hard[/i] to master. The mind games\
      \ are intense, the roster is diverse, and you can train and learn nuances and\
      \ techniques like in any other fighter. There are 144 matchups. There's serious\
      \ replay value here.\n[*][b]+Plays great.[/b] Rollback networking and cross\
      \ platform support make this game a joy to play.\n[*][b]+Sounds great.[/b] This\
      \ is some of my favorite fighting game music.\n[*][b]+Looks great.[/b] There\
      \ are occasionally low res textures, bad animation frames, and flat shading,\
      \ but it's the best that you could ask for from an indie company. The Fantasy\
      \ Strike world looks pretty good in 3D.\n[*][b]+Very unique ranked mode.[/b]\
      \ Ranked mode uniquely builds 8 player tournament brackets on the fly to make\
      \ things more interesting. You can rank up quickly if you win consistently.\
      \ In a ranked match you pick a team of 3 characters who are randomly pit against\
      \ the opponent's 3 characters. You have to win with all 3 to win the set. This\
      \ means you can't counterpick, you get more matchup variety, and if you lose\
      \ hard to a character you won't have to deal with them for the rest of the set!\n\
      [*][b]+Good updates.[/b] These include bug fixes, balance changes, and community\
      \ requested features like practice dummy recording.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\
      [list]\n[*][b]-Far less freedom[/b], especially compared to Smash Ultimate.\
      \ A lot of times you'll have 1 correct move and 10 wrong moves, with no choices.\
      \ And if you time it wrong, even that might not work.\n[*][b]-Oppressive spam.[/b]\
      \ I find zoning boring.\n[*][b]-Some feedback is poor.[/b] From Jaina's offscreen\
      \ arrows to the ambiguous fuzzy guard, sometimes you actually can't see what's\
      \ happening.\n[*][b]-No hitboxes in training mode.[/b] This feature is really\
      \ important but missing!?\n[*][b]-Frame advantage for throws isn't shown in\
      \ training mode.[/b]\n[*][b]-Jaina's RED DRAGON is way too slow.[/b] It's obviously\
      \ meant to drain Midori's dragon meter but Sirlin Games should consider speeding\
      \ up the whole process. This could go for all supers.\n[*][b]-The controls are\
      \ accessible but the mechanics are not.[/b] Many things aren't explained. What\
      \ moves can be canceled into others on hit/block? What moves are immune to grabs?\
      \ What moves break armor? What's a tick throw? What's oki? Meaty attacks? Safe\
      \ jumps? Backwards throw? Armor moves stop working during hitstun (which makes\
      \ the armor ironically useless)? etc.\n[*][b]-Overpriced cosmetics.[/b]\n[*][b]-Random\
      \ daily shop.[/b] Even if you buy premium currency to support development, it's\
      \ really hard to buy what you want.\n[*][b]-The premium DLC is half-assed.[/b]\
      \ The Collector's Pack doesn't include the Original Soundtrack, and the Original\
      \ Soundtrack doesn't have the character select music. I already asked, and Sirlin\
      \ Games has no plans to change anything.\n[*][b]-No handicaps[/b] (custom health).\n\
      [*][b]Fuzzy techniques and more.[/b] Because block and yomi counter are instant\
      \ actions that recover instantly, you can perform them before other actions\
      \ as option selects. This greatly increases the skill ceiling while requiring\
      \ more precise inputs. The counter is to delay your grab by about 5 frames.\
      \ Not so accessible, eh?\n[*][b]-Music and costume priority seems to be determined\
      \ at random?[/b]\n[*][b]-Limited audio options.[/b] You can't turn off voices\
      \ without SFX, you can't choose the exact music to play in matches, and you\
      \ can't disable ambient noises from the menu without also disabling it from\
      \ matches.\n[*][b]-Replay's can't be saved[/b] without \"Fantasy+\", a subscription\
      \ costing up to $5/month. I don't need to tell you how stupid this is. Pro tip:\
      \ You can always watch your last replay and record it on Windows 10 with WIN\
      \ + Alt + R.\n[*][b]-Balance could be better.[/b] The characters are [i]not[/i]\
      \ balanced equally. Rook and Onimaru are particularly bad. They're slow, have\
      \ missing/weaker fundamental utility options, and their gameplans simply don't\
      \ work in a meta infested with strong zoners that easily escape their pressure\
      \ and return the fire. Their armored moves are blatantly worse than the invincible\
      \ moves all the zoners have. Rook has BOTH of the worst supers in the game,\
      \ several of his key moves whiff if the opponent jumps or performs \"aerial\"\
      \ ground attacks, his Vines attack is so sluggish that it's hard to land even\
      \ in ideal scenarios, and his lack of a real anti-air essentially makes his\
      \ last hitpoint useless (you can spam jump attacks to beat anything Rook does\
      \ or stall the match for free). Onimaru doesn't have a real jump-in attack (it's\
      \ unsafe on HIT!). Rook and Oni's other moves tend to be slow or unsafe and\
      \ can fail even when they feel like they honestly shouldn't. Meanwhile you have\
      \ characters like Quince whose anti-air hits up to the ceiling and combos for\
      \ half your life bar AND puts you into a mixup blender. The community agrees\
      \ that some characters are clearly stronger, and you'll usually see the pros\
      \ playing the same characters. But don't let my balance complaints hold you\
      \ back from trying the game! It's not THAT bad; just know that Rook and Oni\
      \ (usually) have uphill battles.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game's monetization\
      \ scheme is dubious, but the actual gameplay is fun. While I don't enjoy the\
      \ game flow or mechanics as much as Smash Ultimate, Fantasy Strike is easier\
      \ to play and does everything right. It's the kind of fighting game that we've\
      \ been sorely lacking. Games like this are a rare treat and I'm happy to see\
      \ Sirlin's design work finally put into action. Now I have much clearer idea\
      \ of how traditional fighting games play and precisely why they're inferior\
      \ to Smash. [b]Try it then buy it[/b] to support Sirlin's team so they can improve\
      \ the game. We now have 12/20 of the Yomi characters at the time of writing.\
      \ I'm excited to see who's added next!\n\n[h1]Actual (best) prices[/h1]\n[table]\n\
