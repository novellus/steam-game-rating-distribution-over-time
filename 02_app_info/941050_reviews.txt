The mini games are embedded to make sense in each situation. I enjoyed this game very much. I am not into horror themed games and this here was perfectly doable. \n\nThis is definitely one of the better games in this genre. I am glad I gave it a go. \n","timestamp_created":1597476647,"timestamp_updated":1597476647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hebB+PMCd7PImwI="}
