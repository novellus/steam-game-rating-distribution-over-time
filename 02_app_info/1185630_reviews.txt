It's fun until you reach a level where you can't get any further. If you manage it at some point, whether due to the experience gained through previous fails within the level, by chance or luck: you are happy endlessly. Absolutely recommended pastime for in-between. But be careful, can be very addictive :D","timestamp_created":1582312899,"timestamp_updated":1582312899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m9jMtPACef/c8wE="}
