The game strongest element is its intriguing scifi storyline. While we've seen plots of government vs freedom before, the addition of the personal element into it is well done here, and it's not a simple good vs evil story line. The soundtrack complements this, and presentation wise, the game does a reasonable job. It's the gameplay that falls flat on its face. While you'd think it'd be straight forward, long lines of sight added to some enemies that can snipe you from afar makes a deadly combination that puts the frustration factor not only on high, but on infurating. This on top of some poor level design decisions that don't complement the gameplay in question either. See that's the key word in all this: Frustration. It's a game that can't escape that frustration, whether it be a bad accuracy system that goes against the small time to die game play, or literring the floor with movable boxes that impedes the players progress, and blocks his line of site. In the end, I all I wanted to do was walk away from the game, never to look at it again. \n\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]My Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The 80s story themes do pretty well overall, as it does remind me of good government versus free will stories of the past. It's not just straight up good versus evil, there's detail and nuasence added to this tale.\n[*] Sound track is pretty rockin, with good electronic music that fits what the game is going for in most cases. High action, and good fun all around.\n[*] For the most part, the UI is clean and functional, minimal but giving you the information that you need. \n[*] The ammo upgrade system is nice. \n[*] The core gameplay rewards creative thinking, which is basically finding out how to exploit the AI.\n[/list]\n\n[b] My Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Design, Design, Design. There's a couple of mechanics that could work in this game, but when they get combined together, it's a disaster.\n[*] Enemies have deadly accuracy, even with weapons considered to be close range (shotgun). Best clip is in the video where I walk through the door, and get blown away from an enemy off screen in one shot. Speaking of....\n[*] The camera fights you as you won't be able to see what you need to actually fight the enemies at times. Combine that with some deadly accuracy, and you've got a situation where it's just not fun to get your ass handed to you. Especially when....\n[*] The accuracy stat on guns was a bad idea in a game with such a short time to die, especially when enemies don't seem to be affected by it. \n[*] Why the shit on the ground. It is one of the most annoying things in the fact that it can actually really mess with the mechanics of battle. Why. Why do this. Especially when you can actually hit that shit with your gun at times. \n[*] Game needed better level design all around. While there's some variety, it doesn't play to the game strengths, especially with long corridors, or some kill zones that you can't avoid. \n[*] Having numbers for abilities at the bottom of the screen without something relating the ability is an oversight.\n[*] The game lacks punch, impact. Sometimes throwing a mine can get a cool rush of fun, but most of the time, you're doing the same thing over and over again.\n[*] The AI is pretty dumb at times. Once I figured out that you can melee around corners....yeah the game became a bit easier. Not in a good way.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.
