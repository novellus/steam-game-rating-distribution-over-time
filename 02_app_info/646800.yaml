    review: Motorland Tale is very interesting, although short, being short is not
      necessarily bad, but the way it gives us more of a world so interesting makes
      us want more and more. The design is very beautiful and the colors give a special
      charm to each page. If you, like me, were enchanted by the world of Teslagrad
      and World to the West, you will surely enjoy this comic.
