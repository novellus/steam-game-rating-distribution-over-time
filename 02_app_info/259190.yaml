      location, will unlock an incredible and dangerous power. Johnson pleads with

    review: "Avevo paura visto le recensioni altrui e invece il gioco funziona perfettamente\
      \ su Windows 10, \xE8 solo in inglese ma non \xE8 un problema. Sul gioco in\
      \ s\xE9 che dire, uno dei pilastri della mia infanzia e caposaldo del genere\
      \ horror alla maniera dei vecchi resident evil e silent hill, atmosfere incredibili,\
      \ colonna sonora da brivido, protagonisti ben riusciti (soprattutto Carnby)\
      \ e parecchio rigiocabile seppur lineare. Straconsigliato agli amanti dei survival\
      \ horror di una volta."
