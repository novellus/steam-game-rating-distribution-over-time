Add in a series of power-ups that force you to go right up to the metaphorical net or risk a super charged challenger, and you have something that can only be described as frenzied.\n\nThat sort of fast-paced, reaction-based craziness is always going to be more fun with friends, but the single player tournament mode has plenty to offer too. Each character has an off the wall motivation and an equally off-color happily ever after waiting for them at the end of a successful tournament. But just like a multiplayer match, you'll have to be focused and quick to get there. After all, you're always only three good throws away from victory, yours or your opponent's.","timestamp_created":1607093985,"timestamp_updated":1607093985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526315808296203613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ47oORl/YCetehtwI="}
