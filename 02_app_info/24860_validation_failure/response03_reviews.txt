You can't get it on origin anymore because EA doesn't want you buying a game and enjoying it for 10 years.  \n\nEDIT 2021\nSeems you cant buy this game at all anymore, period.\nIts kind of a shame, the only version you can get legally , is the Project Reality mod which is now a standalone game with BF2 assets, and honestley, I always thought PR is overrated.\n\nThere's still a few very enjoyable nostalgic mods floating around on Moddb like Point of Existence 2, and the Alpha Project.\n\nI like firing this game up every couple of years, loading up POE2 or Vanilla, and experiencing some good old 2005-2009ish nostalgia.","timestamp_created":1388109507,"timestamp_updated":1610092816,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486803621053695679","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6NTA8PYCedfeHw=="}
