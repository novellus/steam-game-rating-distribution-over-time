    short_description: Penultimate. The second to last. The not-quite-final. The calm
      before the storm. Here at the beginning of the end, teens both moody and muscular
      await you. More heartwarming candor, more laughs, more weird time nonsense,
      and more memes that were outdated the second our pens left the paper.
