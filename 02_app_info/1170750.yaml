    review: 'Bought this game because I always wanted to learn Morse Code.

      I''m glad I can now practice it beyond listening to old recordings of Morse
      Code, however I find the speed at which it tests you to be rather fast for beginners.
      I find myself incapable of passing the first radiogram as I keep going back
      to the main menu after losing pace with it. Even on the slowest speed I still
      have difficulty, and am disappointed it can''t be slowed down further.

      I am glad I can now practice individual letters, but radiograms are currently
      beyond me.


      Overall I''d say it''s 6/10 as a learning resource, with four deducted for the
      frustration a newcomer goes through after failing a radiogram for want of a
      slower speed.'
