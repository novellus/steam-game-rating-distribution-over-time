So this game has screwed me [i]twice[/i] in the exact same way now, so I didn't get to complete it. That's okay, though...there's this newfangled thing they've got on the interwebz called YouTube, and some nice folks have posted up videos which verify that: a. this game is barely twenty minutes long, and b. it's not worth the effort of playing anyway.\n\n   What's the problem I had, you ask? Well, I \"solved\" a small laptop \"puzzle\" within the game, and got shown the location of a key. Went to said location, spotted a key, but couldn't pick it up. Decided what the hey, I could speed-run my way back to this in a jiffy, let's just uninstall, reinstall, and try again. NO KEY this time. \n\n   Posted a question to the dev in the game's forum, and in all fairness, he did try to offer a work-around...though this work-around led to a problem of its own, where the game now had \"content locked\" and refused to download the executable file. Looked up the \"content locked\" problem on Google, and it's a fairly common Steam error it seems. (Just one I'd never encountered on any other game prior to this one!) Again, the couple of \"solutions\" offered up failed to work, or simply seemed too difficult to bother.\n\n   Waited a couple of weeks, reinstalled just to see. Presto! Works again. Repeat early steps of gameplay...NO KEY again. Feck it, I'll check a walkthrough, see if it's even worth the fuss. Answer: IT'S NOT.\n\n   Look, maybe I would've been willing to go to the ends of the earth to play this through if it was a game of some length and/or some note, but it's neither. It's a mediocre asset flip - same house as The Survey, but with less furniture - in which you walk around a [i]very[/i] empty house, find a few notes in otherwise empty drawers and cupboards, solve a couple of non-puzzles, and get an abrupt and unsatisfying ending for all your troubles. I wouldn't be recommending it if it [i]didn't[/i] have such extreme technical problems, so I'm sure as sh*t not going to when it does. \n\n   Just do as I did and watch a walkthrough, if for some strange reason you still feel compelled to. Might as well save your money. Your chances of being happy with your purchase aren't very high even [i]if[/i] the fecking game works for you. Mildly atmospheric, with a couple of passable jump-scares, but cliche-ridden in the extreme and chronically boring even by the standards of a walking sim junkie like myself.\n\n   Oh, and for what it's worth: the YouTuber with the twenty minute video? Spent an awful lot of time walking around in circles trying to trigger events, so you can probably speed-run the game in less than ten.\n\n   Verdict: 3.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1533024023,"timestamp_updated":1594355678,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60172879695892334","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws5/Am/MCf4mjpwE="}
