    review: "Hey,..\nsorry about so many critics but, is because I really had Liked\
      \ the yours First, Moon shot Game Ideia,\nand in this new you are taking out\
      \ almost all of what I had liked in the first..\nok, you will do how you want\
      \ or how sell better, but how apears you are doing a kind of continuation of\
      \ the Moon Shoot, it was supposed to be Better,\n so I comes here try some\n\
      Ideas...\n\nThe First(MoonShot), already had a Very Good Base concept and gameplay(a\
      \ little difficult hard but, Complex and Functional controls(VERY GOod controls\
      \ to a realy physics-based game) , and this was one of things what let the game\
      \ Great, after the players learn the controls the competition and its possibilities\
      \ were very Nice! ). In this new apears you took a lot out of it, to try some\
      \ of arcade to kids 4 years age, and yet not stay so easy, and lost the wealth\
      \ that was( think I one of think that made the MoonShot game Great).\nThis new\
      \ orbitou tlaws have HOrrible controls if compared to the old MoonShot\nAnd\
      \ What is this DISC dust effect from the wheels of the tanks?!\nThe Visual Effects\
      \ Also already was Very Good /o/.. Please Dont change the vfx team.\n\n\n\n\
      Well,\nI dont know if you are asking. apologies for something but...\nwhat I\
      \ think just was Missing in the first moon shoot to a new Game like this \"\
      orbit outlaws\"... To be a Amazing game.\n\n- More options of tanks and \"weapons\"\
      \ \"parts\" \"adds\"(what you already are doing in this new game, Nice!)\n-\
      \ Improve a little the 3d details of the models(what also you are doing in this\
      \ new game, very Nice), textures may be, \"cartoon\" language already solve\
      \ a lot of this, and is Good language to a game where the models in most will\
      \ apear smalls on screen, pollutes less visually.\n\nAND\n- A Campaign Mode,\
      \ even if simple, but Levels, Bosses,.. and may be some other enemies types,(what\
      \ could be just the tanks with different colors and weapon configurations).\n\
      \n\n- PLease, Dont change the controls to this new game, for me it is horrible,\
      \ compared with the wealth that was the oldest in Moon Shoot.\n\n- Where are\
      \ the breaking planets???! Why did you take it off?!\n-Where Are just One screen\
      \ with all the players?!?!, this new are splitting in severals screens, when\
      \ to a local game where the tanks in most of time is in nearrealy Dont Need\
      \ , stay worse, and yet this way(splitting the screens) are cuting some of players\
      \ some times.\n at least give a option to choose the screen type, if split or\
      \ uses ONE screen where dynamically embraces all players(this Much Better to\
      \ this type of game).\n\n- other, the time of things of the oldest,.. was better,\
      \ calm, in right time, you Saw what was happening and gave importance, value\
      \ to these,.. this new, is more fast, reflex may be the actual modern times\
      \ where almost nothing have importance, value, and almost all people have anxiety.\n\
      \n- Dont tranform the sound vfx in a war of fluffy plastic pieces,\nenough today\
      \ kid toys real life.\n\n\n- and this last is more personal...\nNice the ideia\
      \ of differents pilots but, this star fox style .. mix of cartoon hyper cute\
      \ with serious characters.... : / ?\nsomething Just Cute, like \"Lovers in the\
