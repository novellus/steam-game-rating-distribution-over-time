In fact, it's quite solid and competent - even a tiny bit clever at times in its use of props and scenery - and I sincerely hope it got a good mark if it was a final-year university production.\n\n   Interpret that statement as you will.\n\n   Suffice it to say, if you're someone who already finds live theatre a bit on the \"cringy\" side, this won't be the video to change your mind about such things. The word \"video\" perhaps being this product's biggest downfall: I'm sure I would've enjoyed it more in person. As it is, the \"filmmaking\" skills on evidence here won't exactly knock Stanley Kubrick out of anyone's All-Time Top Ten Filmmakers list, and it really does look like the kind of show where you had to \"be there\" (and preferably know and love at least one person in the cast or crew). Ah well.\n\n   Damn and blast it. I'm going to give this a mediocre score, yet still give it a \"Recommend\", aren't I? I promised myself - among other people - that I'd try to stop doing that. Honestly, I just don't have the heart to diss this product with a thumb-down, and it IS on the cheap-ish side, price-wise. It furthermore ties in with a video game also available here on Steam, which, er...I'm in no rush to play right now, but maybe someone will become sufficiently enamoured with either product to check the other one out.\n\n   So who am I recommending this to? Someone. Someone out there will appreciate it, no doubt. That person just wasn't me, unfortunately. Maybe I just don't have enough \"irony\" in my blood to appreciate this kind of humour any more. I blame Family Guy. It really was the last straw that broke this particular camel's back.\n\n   Verdict: 5.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1517239880,"timestamp_updated":1517240600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.656552493572235107","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3MiloeECeNi8lwE="}
