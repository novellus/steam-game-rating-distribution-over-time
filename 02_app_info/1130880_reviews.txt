Space combat feels nice and engaging, not too slow, not too fast. The developer is actively improving the product and looks into player feedback.\n\nStill, lots of things to be done.\n\n- Controls are not very well-defined, and many players will need remapping.\n- Tutorials have bugs. You can easily break them by doing something unexpected. It would be better to disable actions that should not be used instead of warning players not to use 'em.\n- Flying backwards is complicated. Pain when hitting large targets.\n- Missiles behave strangely. Player ship may outrun its own missile.\n- Asteroid fields look nice but hitting asteroids is creepy.\n\n(Updated on 11/3/2020)","timestamp_created":1599557869,"timestamp_updated":1604430936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/Kbix/UCdYTFoAI="}
