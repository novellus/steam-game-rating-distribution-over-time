    review: It's a fun game with beautiful artwork. I love the visual style of the
      game. But I have to give this a thumbs down because it has problems. The menu
      options are almost not there at all. If you hit escape it hard dumps out of
      the game without warning. There is also a big problem with white text on a very
      light if not white background. It's almost unreadable in places. It would also
      be nice to have your previous high scores saved so you know what to beat next
      time. The game feels rushed and still needs work. I bought all the expansions
      that adds up, it  would be nice if the interface and menus lived up to the game's
      potential. Aside from that it does (bare bones) what you would expect it to,
      it just does it in a not very professional manner. I will revisit the game if
      I see an update and change this review if the problems are addressed. It's charming
      under that layer of feeling unfinished.
