I don't recommend this guide because it mainly show the way to complete main quest only. There is no list of where all the secret rooms are, and maps screenshot of the main walkthrough didn't mark all the location of the secret room either. Even though animal kings's location are listed but the detail is not enough (Example: IMP king inside cave in eternal autumn.). It should have more detail similar to Millennium 1 guide, like IMP king is in eternal autumn cave, map 2, and this boss weak against... it should be something like this. Anyway this guide doesn't look like an official guide because when I search for the list of all secret rooms online, I found a walkthrough that is more complete than this one. \n\n\n","timestamp_created":1531329620,"timestamp_updated":1531329620,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgvWWxeQCcObopQE="}
