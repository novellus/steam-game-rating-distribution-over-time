    review: "Esse jogo tem um potencial enorme, por\xE9m como o jogo \xE9 desenvolvido\
      \ por apenas uma pessoa, est\xE1 de parab\xE9ns... acredito que quando sair\
      \ do acesso antecipado, vai ficar excelente o jogo. Pra quem curti esse estilo\
      \ de jogo que envolve administra\xE7\xE3o, vale a pena comprar no acesso antecipado,\
      \ tem muita coisa j\xE1 pra fazer, com 9 horas de jogo, devo ter jogado nem\
      \ 15% do jogo ainda, antes de comprar o jogo, li muitos coment\xE1rios de meses\
      \ anteriores, e notei que praticamente tudo que as pessoas falaram que estavam\
      \ faltando no jogo, j\xE1 estava no jogo, fiquei at\xE9 surpreso, ou seja, o\
      \ criador escuta a comunidade, isso \xE9 bem legal, por isso esse jogo tem um\
      \ potencial enorme."
