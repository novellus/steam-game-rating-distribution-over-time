    review: Cute game that desperately needs a story mode, or achievements (or both)
      to create some narrative drive and give the player a reason to return. I am
      giving it a mild recommendation because I did have fun with it for a few hours,
      and because I like the warm and friendly vibe, but it could be so much more
      with just a little more development time invested.
