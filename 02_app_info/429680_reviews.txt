It's still my favourite card game nonetheless! \nHowever it's likely never ever going to get properly fixed in that department, so i can't personally \"fully\" recommend this game..\nIt's still a very rewarding and fun card game however, so if you're looking for something like that (with lots of grinding if you're a collector etc) then it might just be your type of game. \nI've been playing this for some years now and still it randomly disconnects or crashes with no apparent reason on random occasions. >still happens at times<\nIt's a shame really because this card game could have been one of the absolute greats, sadly it doesn't quite delivers what it actually tries to promise.. (the dlcs are also somewhat pricey, though you can save up on Gold (or with the rarer Crystals) and get some with it instead -more grinding- of course)\n\nFun, complex but also with its flaws and shortcomings.\n\nPersonal score: 7'5/100","timestamp_created":1478035667,"timestamp_updated":1593803260,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533949851989746094","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhviEi/MCeLbIZA=="}
