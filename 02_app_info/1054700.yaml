    review: "There is some jank, but the controls, combat and so on are predicatable\
      \ enough that it quickly fades into the background. After that I genuinely think\
      \ it has out dark souled dark souls and feels like an early from software game.\
      \ \n\nThe experience of being intimidated by a dude with a halberd, and then\
      \ wailing on the prick when he tries to drink a healing potion is excellent."
