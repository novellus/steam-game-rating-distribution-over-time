    review: "It really is a good settler-like strategy game. \nYou do all the classical\
      \ stuff, from setting up an economy, logistics with transporting routes through\
      \ a street building system, military (if you want) by building towers and accomplishing\
      \ your goals.\nThe campaign splits into a military path with the goal of conquering\
      \ the enemy base or an economic path, which tasks you with economical challenges\
      \ to build a monument.\n\nThere are several different modes, challenge, random\
      \ maps, community made maps and frontier (a seasonal challenge).\n\nThe strategic\
      \ part is solid enough. Theres plenty to build, the economy becomes more complex\
      \ the more you research, theres a good portion of gameplay to be found with\
      \ enough depth to pose a challenge to a seasoned strategy player.\nIts all about\
      \ creating efficient cities too, so when you like efficiency puzzles, you might\
      \ like it as well.\n\nRegarding scope it falls a bit too short. Theres a lot\
      \ to do, but not a lot to achieve or head to.\nThe campaign is super short (i\
      \ havent counted them, but roughly 12 missions including the introduction levels),\
      \ random maps might give you variety in environment, but nothing to thrive for.\n\
      There is no meta goal or super difficult challenge to achieve.\nMilitary also\
      \ seems to be limited to community made maps and the campaign.\nSadly the community\
      \ maps are not that inspired and even if they were, there is a really limited\
      \ amount anyway.\n\nI personally wished that there was some overarching goal\
      \ you could go for. A gigantic monument that takes a lot of effort to complete,\
      \ a solid AI you can play against on maps for up to 4 players at least (=1v3\
      \ AI, deathmatch or 2v2 (player and 3 AIs), multiplayer or some sort of meta\
      \ game (see Mindustry and its planetary campaign with sectors or \"Before We\
      \ Leave\" with its solar system where you can connect several planets together).\n\
      \nBut there isnt.\nIn that way its more limited than Settlers 2.\n\n\nThis game\
      \ leaves me with a feeling that it does a lot much better than the classical\
      \ Settlers Games and brings in some fresh wind while keeping a similar style,\
      \ while at the same time falling short in providing scope and scale.\nIn that\
      \ sense it feels like a really well done first game to prove that it works.\
      \ \nAnd if i could voice a wish to the developer, then it would be to take this\
      \ game as a basis for the next one and create a sequel with bigger scope and\
      \ scale.\n\n\nI recommend it. Its a really good and fun game. \nIt looks fine\
      \ and the universe is explained fine enough to make it feel ok that there are\
      \ robots that need food and water and not some sort of biological species.\n\
      Although i would prefer the latter.\nThe strategic gameplay is deep and complex\
      \ enough and it provides enough to play around with for a few dozen hours.\n\
      More if you create your own maps with the map editor or love to challenge people\
      \ in Frontier Mode with \"speedrunning\".\n"
