    review: Honestly can't recommend it. I had to get down on the floor just to access
      the options as it constantly placed me above the car roof. There's no tutorial
      and I can't even find how to use the pedal or the music. If you try to import
      music, it boots you right to the desktop. Just either not well made or needs
      better instructions.
