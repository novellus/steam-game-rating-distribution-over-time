    about_the_game: Become chief of police for the city of Freemont. Hire and equip
      traffic cops, investigators, and SWAT officers. Shape the behavior of the entire
      police force by customizing department policy. Dispatch your police officers
      to crimes and watch as they carry out their duties based on the rules you set
      for them.<br><br>Unlock special perks and tools to withstand crime waves, use
      spike strips to stop fleeing vehicles, deploy undercover agents to catch criminals
      in the act, and send out the police helicopter to spot trouble from afar.<br><br>The
      city is alive with innocents and suspects who carry out their activities whether
      you see them or not. The world around you reacts to your choices, as the criminal
      ecosystem retreats in the face of swift justice or grows bolder in response
      to leniency. Protect and serve the public and you'll win their trust; but if
      you fail, they'll come to hate you and you might just get yourself fired.<br><br><strong>Key
      Features</strong><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> More than 30 crimes and events
      to dispatch your units to, including property crimes, violence and vice, noise
      complaints, and traffic violations. </li><li> Department policy, skill filters,
      training, gear assignment, and customizable patrol routes allow you to manage
      law enforcement in any way you see fit. </li><li> Play freely in an open-ended
      sandbox mode, or enable Challenges and work to fulfill specific objectives.
      </li><li> Opinion polls and newspapers provide feedback on your performance.
      </li><li> Gather intelligence by arresting suspects and connect with informants
      to expose crime throughout the city. </li><li> Intricate sound design that not
      only brings the big city to life but can also provide clues to hidden criminal
      activity. </li><li> Extensive tutorial and in-game manual.</li><li> Nearly an
      hour of original music.</li></ul>
