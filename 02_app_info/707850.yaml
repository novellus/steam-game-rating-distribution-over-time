      \ as they provide many skills and mental learning benefits and opportunities.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>COGNITIVE SKILLS:</strong></h2>Puzzles come in a\
      \ whole range of themes and topics such as alphabet letters, shapes, vegetables,\
      \ numbers, pets, transport and colours.  It increases their visual spacial awareness\
      \ and develops a deeper understanding of these themes and topics.  All children\

      \ of certain themes such as alphabet letters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>PROBLEM\
      \ SOLVING:</strong></h2>Completing a puzzle, even the most simplest of puzzles\
      \ sets a single goal to achieve.  Toddlers and children must think and develop\
      \ strategies on how to approach in achieving this goal.  This process involves\
      \ problem solving, reasoning skills and developing solutions which they can\

      \ MOTOR DEVELOPMENT:</strong></h2>Puzzles are a fun way for children to develop\
      \ and refine their fine motor skills.  When engaged in playing with puzzles,\
      \ children are required to pick up, pinch and grasp pieces (some with small\
      \ knobs, pegs or chunky pieces) and move them around, manipulating them into\
      \ slots, sorting them and fitting them into the correct places.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\"><strong>HAND AND EYE COORDINATION:</strong></h2>Playing with puzzles\
      \ requires a trial and error process which involves a lot of hand and eye manipulation.\
      \  For example, as a toddler or child places a piece of the puzzle that does\
      \ not fit, they will try all over again where their actions involve doing what\
      \ they actually see.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>SOCIAL:</strong></h2>Puzzles\
      \ are a great educational tool to enhance and promote cooperative play.  As\
      \ kids work together to complete a puzzle, they will discuss where a piece should\
      \ go and why, take turns and share and support each other when handling frustration,\
      \ then sharing the joy of finishing the puzzle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>SELF\
      \ ESTEEM:</strong></h2>The accomplishment of achieving a goal brings so much\
      \ satisfaction to a child.  Overcoming the challenges involved in solving a\
      \ puzzle really gives them a sense of achievement and pride within themselves.\
      \  It provides a boost to their self-confidence and self-esteem as this prepares\
      \ them for other challenges in life.<br>Puzzles are a fun educational toy that\
      \ challenges young minds, teaching and preparing them early in life some very\
      \ important life skills."

    review: 'I already reviewed another puzzle game from the same author ("Cabins:
      Jigsaw Puzzles"), so I''m gonna copy paste the points that seems relevant to
      this game too and add new one when appropriated.


      [b]Positives+++[/b]

      [u](same points)[/u]

      +You can select a group of pieces to move them all somewhere else at the same
      time

      +Snapping sound is ok

      +When you snap there is a visual cue to let you know those 2 pieces has snapped
      together which I think is a good idea for people who can''t hear the clicking
      sound!

      +I like that you can click once, move the mouse with your piece stick to the
      mouse pointer or click, hold and drag a piece. I would have put an option to
      enable/disable it though for those that don''t want to have the click without
      holding feature.

      +I like the shape of the puzzle pieces

      +Visually, puzzle pieces have a nice shadow making them look very real

      +There is a shadow when moving pieces around

      +Accuracy to pick up the pieces is on point! <3

      [u](new points)[/u]

      +Puzzles shapes are fun to place on the board

      +I like that all of them are paintings/drawings. I think that most of the images
      have nice elements that makes them fun to solve.


      [b]Suggestions~~~[/b]

      [u](new points)[/u]

      ~Some of the images could benefit from having their color adjust a bit to be
      more vibrant.


      [b]Negatives---[/b]

      [u](same points)[/u]

      -F12 to take Steam print screen doesn''t work.

      -Puzzles doesn''t save when you quit the game and start it again.

      -You need to select a puzzle from a Steam menu and quit the game to select another
      puzzle. It would be much better with an in-game menu.

      -No achievements

      -Snapping is a bit too short so that sometimes I have to pick and drop multiple
      time for my pieces to snap. There is no option to change that either.

      -No sound setting

      -No settings to change the number of pieces by puzzle. Each puzzle only has
      a fix number of pieces and you can''t change it making this game having little
      replayability.

      -I wish that there was an option to enable dragging instead of having it by
      default when you click on the background because sometimes I miss-click a piece
      of puzzle just a little bit and then the dragging occurs.

      [u](new points)[/u]

      -Contrary to his successor "Cabins: Jigsaw Puzzles", this one doesn''t indicate
      how many pieces a puzzle has. It wouldn''t take much time to update this older
      game if the code has already been written for more recent games. I think it
      is nice when a developer take the time to update his older games.

      -Puzzle pieces are not shuffled. Each time you enter a puzzle they are displayed
      in the same position.

      -This is a big downer: each puzzle used the same puzzle pieces. Add that to
      the fact that every puzzle begins with their pieces in the same position and
      it''s like you are doing the same puzzle all over again almost exactly the same
      way :O! I got curious to see if this has changed in the most recent game "Cabins:
      Jigsaw Puzzles" but it''s the same! (At least the Cabin game has a different
      number of puzzle pieces, but each 70 pieces puzzle, for example, still begin
      with the pieces layed out exactly the same and all the pieces shapes are also
      the same ..).

      -The game is quite short. I timed myself doing a puzzle and it takes about 3min
      to complete a 48 piece puzzle. With 16 different images it would only take 48
      minutes to complete them all once. Since there is no setting to change the number
      of pieces, there is little replayability. Even if the game is cheap, I think
      it''s too short.


      [b]Conclusion[/b]

      There is 16 available 48 pieces paintings/drawings to solve. The puzzle shapes
      and the snapping are satisfying. Discovering that there is only 1 cut of puzzle
      and that each puzzle have the same numbers of pieces and use the same puzzle
      cut is a disappointment leading me to not recommend this game. It''s also pretty
      short (under 50minutes to finish all puzzles).'
