In short, a great little trivia challenge game that has a surprising depth and breadth of trivia questions. The fighter animations get tedious after a while, but they are in keeping with the Fight Club-type theme; it would have been great if there was a way to turn them off.\n\nI did find one question for which its answer was probably right when written, but wrong now: which country has the most satellites in orbit. But that's understandable; it's just one of those questions where the answers can change quickly.","timestamp_created":1609769113,"timestamp_updated":1609769113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42urt5vYCcPSywAI="}
