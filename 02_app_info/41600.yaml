    review: "Whilst this is a really enjoyable 3D platformer it is an absolute bitch\
      \ to get running, I\u2019m not even sure if you can get it running at all as\
      \ there are no online patches. I\u2019ve only been able to play this out of\
      \ luck with a really old computer. On modern Systems however it crashes all\
      \ the time and for some odd reason there\u2019s a message saying \u201CJump\
      \ if you want to play\u201D that just pops up at random, there\u2019s no way\
      \ to make this message go away, forcing you to restart the game. How ever there\
      \ are some gameplay mechanics that just haven\u2019t aged well, perfect example\
      \ being the atrocious camera. I can overlook this but for other people this\
      \ can be a significant issue. Now as much as I love this game it pains me to\
      \ say it\u2019s really not worth it unless you have an old pc and have heaps\
      \ of nostalgia for it.\nWith the abundance of remakes and remasters of older\
      \ games at the moment, this game really does deserves one."
