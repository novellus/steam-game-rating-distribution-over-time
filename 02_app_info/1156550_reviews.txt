I haven't run in to any problems too dire so far and i'm enjoying my time with the game.\n\nCurrently the game is playable and there is enough to enjoy if you're a fan of the genre, I think it's worth supporting so long as you don't mind the Early Access stuff.","timestamp_created":1604318617,"timestamp_updated":1605973568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwoP3e9fUCcoHkqwI="}
