Back then all the parts, including this one, used to have a fantastic German version that was just hilarious and brilliantly done. Unfortunately, for some weird reason, the German version was cut away on all parts you get on Steam, including this Vol. 3.\n\nThis is a shame and makes this game incomplete. \n\nIn English though, it is fantastically entertaining like the previous parts. Perfect for parties or to kill time on Christmas ;)\n  \nI'm afraid, as much as I love this series, I have to give a \"thumbs down\" though, because for me there's missing a crucial bit.","timestamp_created":1608550276,"timestamp_updated":1608550345,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471698105335235596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ks3EwvYCc/b1uwI="}
