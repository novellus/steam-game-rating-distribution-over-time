It is a super easy game in a bad manner. You can find health potions and coins (that allows you to respawn) everywhere in the game which makes you basically not care about dying. Dying is also almost impossible. I found out that skeletons can actually hit you at the last level. It is also incredibly easy to bypass the opponents simply by jumping over their head. At one point I was so bored that I was intentionally fighting and not running away from the opponents. These two points really hurts the gameplay. Other than these, I really liked the game. The atmosphere, the music, the artsytle was very sweet. Everyone seems to complain about the boss being too hard but it was the only proper fight I had in the whole game and I enjoyed it (it is actually really hard tho I just enjoyed that).  It is also really short (I finished it in 51 mins). As a result, I believe the game needs some upgrades but for such a cheap price it is worth getting it.","timestamp_created":1609361113,"timestamp_updated":1609361113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+rfZ2vYCfZzyvgI="}
