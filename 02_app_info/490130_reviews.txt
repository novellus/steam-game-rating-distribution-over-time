I will pretty much explain what happens in this \"movie\", which it hardly is, really, it is just a super long documentary of some old guys desperately trying to get funding to complete the airplane scene for their decades old recreation of RoTLA. They get into arguments and find out new problems about shooting the scene for minutes on end, and then you see clips of the film, just short clips, not the whole thing. Yeah, maybe they should retitle it to \"Raiders! : Just Another Documentary...\" and if some of you are thinking that this is the full film, it is not. I mean, criticism all aside, I guess it is fun to watch a bunch of old people speak about their crazy past and where they are now, and if you have time to rent it, I guess I would recommend it, even though it's not worth the 10 dollars I paid, or the 7 dollars to rent it. You have to be a hardcore fan of Indiana Jones to really appreciate this movie.\n\nEDIT: AUGUST 27TH 2016 \n\nNow, the movie is going to be on Netflix by September 15th. What a waste of money this movie truely was. I paid 11 dollars for this movie, which is the same damn price for a month of HD Netflix!!!","timestamp_created":1466874059,"timestamp_updated":1472276288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.709102928638458252","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoKqg5dYCdf7jWg=="}
