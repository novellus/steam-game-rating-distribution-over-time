    about_the_game: In HOLY COW! you need to lead a journey of an absolutely extraordinary
      cow who not only needs to survive in this cruel world of meat eaters but also
      wants to produce and collect the biggest possible amount of milk, no matter
      if the grass field is on the ground, ocean bottom or inside whale's stomach!
      ..at the same time trying hard to avoid any love stories.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/841110/extras/HolyCow300lvls_en.gif?t=1607517951"

      every possible enemy wave in four unique worlds! Enjoy dozens of level types
      consisting of maze, tower defense, arcade and rogue-like schemes. <br><br><img

      care of every single piece of grass, rock or acid lake to create the most surprising
