    reviews: "\u201CFootball Tactics is the most captivating indie PC game I have\
      \ played. In addition to the strategic gameplay and management aspects, the\
      \ fact that games play out quickly helped keep me going \u201Cjust one more\
      \ turn.\u201D In that way, it is very much like bigger strategy titles, like\
      \ the aforementioned Civilization series. Plus, it is polished and charmingly\
      \ animated, with easy to read menus and a very helpful tutorial.\u201D<br><a\
