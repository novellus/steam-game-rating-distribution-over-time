    review: Ectolibrium is a weird game for weird people. Falling somewhere between
      flOw and Oddworld, it presents you with a living and bizarre world to explore
      with an equally bizarre alien character. The platforming is solid, thanks to
      tight controls, unique movement and organic symbiotic powerups that open up
      new degrees of freedom for your character. As you fling, float, and crawl through
      through the level you spread ectoplasm, like a bee spreads pollen, which changes
      the barren levels into thriving alien ecosystems. Don't expect that all your
      questions will be answered from just the first episode, you won't even know
      by the end whether you made the right choice or not. Instead, anticipate scratching
      just the surface of Ectolibrium's rich lore.
