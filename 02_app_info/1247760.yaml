    review: "I never gave roguelikes a chance. At 35yrs old, Qud changed my  perception\
      \ of what it takes to create an immersive experience. I've since gone on and\
      \ tried many more. And while they all have their own quirks and flair...they\
      \ aren't Qud. It took me a while to realize  exactly what it was that brings\
      \ me back because  I assure you I'm not good. \n\nIt's the ambiance, The soundscape\
      \ in this game in unmatched.  \n\nYou ever eat too many mushrooms and then lay\
      \ curled up in a ball on your couch for 3hrs? Bouncing back and forth between\
      \ \"this is terribly uncomfortable\" and being one with the universe. Despite\
      \ the ups and downs you tell yourself it was worth it. That is how I feel about\
      \ this soundtrack. It doesn't exist to make you comfortable.. It's only goal\
      \ is to transport you somewhere else.\n\nThanks. You killed it.\n\n"
