    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Inspiration:</h2>The game is a classic western\
      \ RPG inspired by the games from the 90s. Basically, it\u2019s the kind of game\
      \ I personally find missing nowadays. Light, fairy tale, epic, heroic and slightly\
      \ humorous. One that does not take tons of hours to complete or require endless\
      \ grind to progress. Something that caters to players like me who don\u2019\
      t have tons of hours to beat one game but still like to play and have a sort\
      \ of nostalgia for the way games were made in the old days.<br><br><br><i>It\
      \ was inspired by Dungeon Master, Eye of The Beholder 2, Might &amp; Magic 3-5,\
      \ Crystals of Arborea (a not so well known prequel to Ishar series), GoldBox\
      \ series (Champions of Krynn, Dark Queen of Krynn, etc).</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Core Design Choices:</h2><br>1) Classic, 90 degree rotation, FPP, turn-based,\
      \ tile movement RPG.<br>2) Party-based (7 heroes, either predefined or manually\
      \ assembled upon new game).<br>3) Open world with a big overworld to explore.<br>4)\
      \ Fast paced combat. Quick travel. Easy inventory management. No grind.<br>5)\
      \ Light, fairy tale like fantasy, epic story about heroes on a noble quest.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Mechanics:</h2>Mechanically it\u2019s 100% turn based (so\
      \ you can go and make tea in the middle of a fight) with grid movement and 90\
      \ degree rotation. All this is very fast paced, both combat and travel is really\
      \ fast. The goal was to cut down the boring parts and flesh out the fun parts.<br><br>Overall,\
      \ the mechanics are pretty traditional and straightforward with modern additions\
      \ like weightless bag combined with equipment encumbrance system.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">World and Storyline:</h2>Storyline is a fairy tale, mythical heroic\
      \ fantasy. You are the good guys on a quest to fight the forces of evil. The\
      \ world is non linear, with very few locked areas. You basically can go anywhere\
      \ and do things in different order. In addition you can choose a different set\
      \ of quests to finish the game (but those are not mutually exclusive, so you\
      \ can finish all quests if you like). It\u2019s more world driven than story\
      \ driven. The priority was to make the world feel alive and let you explore\
      \ it as you wish than follow a linear list of quests.<br><br><br><i>The game\
      \ starts when the royal wizard finds out about an old crown that belonged to\
      \ the royal family for generations. Yet, strangely no one ever heard about the\
      \ crown and there was just a single mention of it in the royal annals. Upon\
      \ further study he discovered that there has been cast a powerful spell of forgetfulness\
      \ of unknown origin which caused everyone in the whole land to forget the crown\
      \ ever existed. Without knowing who or why someone went to such trouble to conceal\
      \ the existence of the crown he decided to investigate it. He summoned a party\
      \ of noble heroes and tasked them with finding whereabouts of the mysterious\
      \ crown and the origin of the spell.</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FAQ:</h2>Q: How\
      \ long it takes to beat the game?<br><br>A: According to Early Access players\
      \ it can take between 20 and 50 hours to finish the game (I estimate a typical\
      \ playthrough would be 25-40 hours for most players).<br><br>Q: Can I create\
      \ party members or are they predefined?<br>A: Yes, you can create all party\
      \ members upon start if you wish (there is also a quick start option)."

    review: I only recently found out about Legends of Amberland and quickly made
      my purchase. It was just what I was hoping for. A fun little game that captures
      much of the essence of Might and Magic 3, 4 and 5. Most of what I experienced
      in those classic games is here. While my feelings are overall positive, I did
      have a few minor quibbles. While the dungeons are rather generic for the most
      part, they are filled with treasure and enemies alike. Unlike the grid based
      over world, the towns are simply single screens with icons that allow you to
      navigate to the usual locales. They get the job done though. There are plenty
      of characters to interact with and some of the dialog shares the humor of the
      games that inspired it. There are plenty of quests and side quests to complete.
      However, the game posed little challenge at the default level. Still the game
      gave me the nostalgic dose of a bygone genre of games that should still fully
      exist in my opinion. A little more content in the somewhat barren over world
      and dungeons would have been welcome. Maybe a secret door or wall here and there
      to make exploring every nook and cranny a more rewarding experience? A few more
      ongoing collectible hunts or something of that nature to flesh things out a
      bit more. Grinding isn't an issue and by the time I finished the game, I surprisingly
      made quick work of the final enemy. As fast as I completed the game, I enjoyed
      myself the whole time. Kudos to the creator of this title. An overall solid
      success! I hope that a sequel is being considered. I've already recommended
      this game to friends.
