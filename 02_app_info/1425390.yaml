    about_the_game: Eat or DIE! is a game that goals survival under water. You control
      a small fish that gets bigger when it eats another fish smaller than it. For
      now game includes only five maps with single player. So because it is a early
      access game, by time our goal is to add;<br><br><strong><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Multi-Player<br></li><li><u>Endless
      mode with endless map</u><br></li><li>Story Mode<br></li><li><u>New fish to
      control and add abilities for every fish</u><br></li><li>New enemies<br></li><li>New
      Animations<br></li><li>New Languages</li></ul></strong><br><br>So It is it for
      now but during development process we think we will have better ideas with community's
      support! So game is simple like bigger fish eats smaller fish!

    developer_response: 'Hello,


      Only by myself, I am trying my best to delevop the game. Development process
      could take up to 2 years like i mentioned under early access title. Multiplayer
      and story mode will be added as mainly but bugs will be fixed as well. So while
      I am trying my best to develop game by myself as lone developer, your comment
      made me upset, because I thought I was making process. The game will be better
      by time. But thank you for, you tried my game and your precious comment.


      Sincerely.'

    review: 'The game is short, derivative and poorly put together. Its been in early
      access for months but there''s still ridiculous bugs like the 5th crashing constantly,
      Endless Mode ending after 93 fish (....), being able to fall off the screen
      pressing down in level 4, and its short and lack in content, while little has
      been added to it in the months its been in EA.



      You can find better games like this for free just googling fish eating game'
