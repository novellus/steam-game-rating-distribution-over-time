And plus some items too. However, all of this is for multiplayer. So unless you are an enthusiast/collector there is no need to buy this separately, especially at this price. This DLC is part of both the Season Pass and the Deluxe Edition of AC3 so you could possibly get it through there.\n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] To activate the DLC, write down the CD-key Steam shows you (you cannot copy+paste it), start the game, go to Extras and then to Redeem Code (if it does not work go to uPlay and redeem the code there too), restart the game.\n\n[b][u]*Note: No longer possible to buy.
