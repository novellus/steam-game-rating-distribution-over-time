    review: "The devs have just announced that they intend to use deliberately unfair\
      \ matchmaking to \"allow for more comfortable gameplay\" for people who purchase\
      \ \"Battle Hardened status\" (previously just an economic bonus) for their vehicles\
      \ with premium currency.\n\nYes, they actually publicly announced pay-to-win\
      \ matchmaking and they are trying to sell it as a feature.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/games/ArmoredWarfare/announcements/detail/2753341279118232121\n\
      \nAs for this specific vehicle, it is just a stupid-looking version of one you\
      \ can unlock by playing. It's actually inferior because you can't change the\
      \ skin (unlike the vanilla version) and it isn't connected to the tech tree.\n\
      \nMore importantly, My.games treats customers like cattle to be milked and mistreated\
      \ in that order. (So buying from them is kind of self-destructive.) \n\nShort\
      \ version: The community managers are corrupt, post factually inaccurate things\
      \ they didn't actually write as their own work, and perma-ban people who correct\
      \ them. \n\nCustomer service is even worse. They will lie and delete support\
      \ requests in an attempt to hid their connections to the corruption mentioned\
      \ above.\n\nAfter buying a LOT of DLC and putting more than 800 hours into the\
      \ game (I started my own clan) I was perma-banned from the forums in a case\
      \ CM abuse so blatant that Steam actually overturned it (as you probably know,\
      \ Steam usually sides with the CMs if there is any ambiguity regarding a ban.)\n\
      \nNot coincidentally, the same CM who banned me was one who had previously posted\
      \ an article as his own work which contained both factual errors (claiming that\
      \ the Rheinmetall 120mm L55 was invented in Korea) and sentences like:\n\n \"\
      The K2 \u201CBlack Panther\u201D MBT is, without any doubt, one of the most\
      \ advanced tanks in the world \u2013 if not the most advanced one because, unlike\
      \ so many other designs that claim to be next-gen, it can actually back this\
      \ claim up with the very best technology the Republic of Korea can develop,\"\
      \ \n\nwhich STRONGLY suggested that at least part of the article had originally\
      \ been written by a super-patriotic Korean.\n\nhttps://aw.my.games/en/news/general/black-panther\n\
      \nWhile I didn't mention the latter point directly, I did point out the factual\
      \ errors and shortly afterwards, the CM deleted all the comments on the post\
      \ as you can see here:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/443110/eventcomments/1754654019204234445/\n\
      \nThough I did save this screenshot of myself politely correcting him because\
      \ I somehow knew that he was going to try something unethical:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2126034055\n\
      \nAfter Silent Stalker banned me and before Steam removed the ban, I went to\
      \ the AW discord to ask the CMs for help where \"Soren\" gleefully banned listing\
      \ \"thanks for the feedback\" as the reason for the ban. He literally didn't\
      \ even pretend to have a good reason.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2127547497\n\
      \nI then went to customer service where \"Ilya\" transferred me to \"Arthur\"\
      \ who literally pretended that he had no authority (an obvious lie since Ilya\
      \ transferred my case to him BECAUSE he had authority.)\n\nA live-service is\
      \ only as good as the people running it and I cannot recommend any product run\
      \ by such unprofessional, lazy, and dishonest people."
