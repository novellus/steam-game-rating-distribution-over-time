    review: 'I really didn''t like this game.


      [b][u]Lifespan :[/u][/b] If you don''t try to get the collectibles, you can
      finish it in under 30mins and I don''t see anyone playing this twice except
      for achievements.


      [b][u]Story :[/u][/b] There''s a crow that gives you vague sentences all throughout
      the game and it ends up with a quick written epilogue that makes you feel like
      you''ve missed half the story. You''re supposed to be a blind girl but the way
      you see feels more like you''re on drugs than your blind character giving images
      to sounds and you''re always running and jumping everywhere...


      [b][u]Gameplay :[/u][/b] There''s a weird mechanic that enables you to "see"
      where you''re going... but it''s done horribly. Some strokes of colour appear
      around objects when you get close enough to things or when there are sounds
      next to them ( for exemple when you throw the cute hamsters to walls ). But
      these strokes of colour are often just chaotic and personally they gave me a
      headache. At first it was okay, because you''re next to the sea, there''s a
      lot of wind=noise and everything is easy to see when you get closer. But then
      it''s all dark, the said strokes appear out of nowhere and disappear just as
      fast. Sometimes you see something really far ( go figure ) and when you try
      to reach it you bump into a huge wall. You''ll get lost a lot, you will never
      be completely sure of where you are. There are some parts with enemies where
      I got stuck and the solution was (maybe?) to just go around ? But again, it''s
      so horrible to find your way in this game that I ended up just jumping and running
      everywhere until I made it.

      What annoyed me the most was that it would seem like you could go somewhere
      ( like a huge forest on the side of the road ), but if you tried, it would get
      all buggy ( which made me feel even more sick ) and I would get kinda stuck
      and had to jump and run sightless until I either found my way back to the working
      map or was killed by the game for going too astray.


      [b][u]Achievements :[/u][/b] ~2h to unlock them all with a guide, much more
      on your own.

      Some will unlock for no reason, for exemple I got the "stand still for 30secondes"
      just by starting the game and "Complete the game in under 30 minutes" even though
      I took much more time. There are two grindy achievements : "Drown 50 mokos"
      ( the hamsters ) and "Throw 1000 mokos"... This is going to take some time,
      it''s just sad to think it will take you more time to finish this than to finish
      the game. And finally, the collectibles... there are little blue lights hidden
      in the game, 50 to be exact and this is a nightmare. Because of the epileptic
      lights I really didn''t want to explore and still tried and still only got half
      of them. There are places where you technically can go but it feels like you
      weren''t supposed to and sometimes you even have to commit suicide to get out
      of there... the problem is, if you are used to hidden collectibles you''re going
      to look in every corner, but here I would often lose a lot of time getting somewhere
      for nothing, add to that the fact that''s it''s horrible to keep track of where
      you are and where you''re going and you''ll end up running in circles going
      mad.


      [b][u]Another game with the same theme I recommend playing instead of this:[/u][/b]
      "Beyond eyes" which is a pretty and nice slow game and "A Blind Legend" where
      you actually navigate only using sound.'
