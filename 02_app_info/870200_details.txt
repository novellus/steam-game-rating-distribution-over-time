Sharing is a core concept in SR2 and it has built-in capability to easily share crafts, saved games, and even planets with the community. With SimpleRockets 2, it is easy to get started, but advanced players can dig into technical details if they are interested in the math behind rocket engines and orbital mechanics. Included are 17 different challenges to put your creations to the test. This is actual rocket science!

Choose from the pre-built engines, such as the Mage, which is a powerful kerosene-fueled engine. Or choose the very weak, but highly efficient Ion Engine.

From there you can change engine size, nozzle length, throat radius, and chamber pressure, which allows for endless combinations of engines.<br><br>Use interstages to split your craft into multiple stages and piece together modular fairings to protect your precious cargo.
