It has a few very well done elements (voxel-based mining, explosion sound effects and animations) however, there is not enough content to justify a ten dollar purchase at this time. When steam has such a vast array of polished indie games for a similar price, it is difficult to see myself choosing this over a different game. If this was only a dollar, I could perhaps recommend it on the basis that in the future it may have more content than the hour it took me to finish the game, and perhaps is worth playing for that amount for the novelty of the destructible world system.\n\nOverall:\n\n4/10--  Some good ideas, lack of follow-through and execution, Needs More Content","timestamp_created":1596423259,"timestamp_updated":1596423259,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4t7iP2fMCeKeKmQI="}
