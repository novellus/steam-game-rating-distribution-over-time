Alright! Updates have returned! With the promise of more updates in the future I am very excited to see where this game will go.\n   Currently, the game is not that long. You can maybe knock it out in about four to 6 hours. Still a good amount of time for how much it costs. The world itself could use a bit more to it but they have shown in these past few updates that they know this and are on the case. The crafting system is enjoyable but be ready to dedicate a huge chunk of your ship to it. You also will slowly begin to rely less on the environment for survival as you progress which is a good thing because it is right around the time you will be more focused on building for fun. The air ship is still a bit touchy on navigating and I even managed to escape the world at one point but still a good system. \n   A major problem though is in my opinion, once you get a knife the seeker, main enemy of the game, is a nonthreat. You just poke him in an easy quick time event and take no damage. Also if you build a tier 2 bed you lose no items on death. So definitely makes it more casual friendly but less hardcore if that is your style.\n  I definitely recommend this game if you enjoy your crafting survival games as it is a definitely new experience in the genre.","timestamp_created":1587773257,"timestamp_updated":1609900747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.746962845325469971","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4j/3j6vYCf5mhgwI="}
