It is very good that they are nonthreatening, because otherwise it would probably just be very frustrating. The flashlight simply does not work, it puts some distracting/nauseating curves on the ground at your feet but does not actually illuminate the environment at all. Very short (<20 minutes).\n\nTerrible performance, never makes 90fps with my 980ti, i7, 16GB RAM. I would call out the minimum/recommended specs being totally wrong, but most likely simply nothing could actually run this. Also most likely it could be fairly easily fixed, if the devs weren't MIA. \n\nThis is one of the few VR games to genuinely make me sick, playing it the first time with motion smoothing turned on. I had to turn off smoothing and just suffer with the terrible FPS to get through it, and there wasn't anything exceptional to make it worth the trouble. Do not buy, even at a dollar or less. Do not play if/when it goes free, unless they fix it.","timestamp_created":1544296608,"timestamp_updated":1544296621,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.441767066717147827","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vIzQx+cCc/bmtAE="}
