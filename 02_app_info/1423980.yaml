    review: 'Quite possibly GOTY. I know this game has been in development since 2008
      and oh boy does it show that. Everything from the map to the character models
      is expertly handcrafted to create this masterpiece. I was suprised to hear only
      one man made this. He will be up there with the greats of Notch and Scott Cawthon.
      Ignore any negative reviews this game is awesome. Also please buy the game to
      support the developer as I sense a lawsuits coming.


      TLDR; Loading screen from GTA San Andreas, built on an engine for platformers,
      with an awesome online mode and with graphics that rival that of Cyberpunk 2077
      and Grand Theft Auto 5 what''s not to love.'
