    review: "[h1] A fully handdrawn roaming platform slash & shoot against pretty\
      \ unique monsters with particular musical scores! [/h1]\n\n[b] I don't need\
      \ to play a game like this that long, in order to have an impression of it.\
      \ [/b]\n\nYour sword of absolute slashyness has a cooldown if you use it too\
      \ yolo-ish, so you need to change weapons sometimes. That is pretty cool, because\
      \ in most games, you can just spam using one weapon throughout an entire game.\
      \ Not with this one. Plus the fact there are chests in the game, AND it's fully\
      \ handdrawn and doesn't look like crap, AND it has some particular music scores:\
      \ This game has scored a lot of points already!\n\nIf you were looking for a\
      \ ninja type of game ( I know, I know, this is a monster hunter, not a ninja,\
      \ but my impression of this guy feels like a ninja, maybe he was a ninja, but\
      \ decided to become a monster hunter instead ) or just searching for a special\
      \ platform game that offers a little bit more then the usual with a wide range\
      \ of different types of monsters, big & small, with impressive boss battles\
      \ and lot's of action? \n\nThen look no further, this might be that little gem\
      \ you were waiting for. Made by somebody who was probably searching for the\
      \ same thing, but couldn't find it and decided to make it himself... And exceeded!\n\
      \n[h3] I didn't played it that long, but for what I have tasted so far, it's\
      \ a decent game for it's genre, totally doesn't feel like utterly crap and it\
      \ offers a bit of a challenge! A cocktail, worth to drink up! [/h3]\n"
