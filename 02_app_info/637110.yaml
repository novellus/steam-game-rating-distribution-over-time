    review: "Their first game was much better. This game uses the carbon copy of the\
      \ first game (even the map is same) just to add \"Magic talisman\" mechanic.\
      \ They just stripped the story script, voice-acting lines, slapped a half-baked\
      \ \"look! now you have a few more ways to cast spells\" mechanic, and released\
      \ it. I don't know why they did not put the first game on steam instead of this\
      \ second downgrade version. \n\nI've just bought this game for the sake of nostalgia,\
      \ and giving it a thumbs up, for the sake of first game (that is most unfortunately\
      \ not on steam)"
