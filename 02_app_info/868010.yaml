      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nAI is good, enemy ships are not passive targets, they are\
      \ smart and dangerous. They will shoot not where you are, but where you will\
      \ be if you keep moving. So you will have to maneuver. They will dodge your\
      \ missiles, will hide behind asteroids, will maneuver to approach you from a\
      \ tactically reasonable angle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe variety of enemies is\
      \ wide, there are 25 different enemy ships. Not just differently looking, they\
      \ use unique weapons and tactics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are RPG elements,\
      \ you can upgrade your ship the way you like.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 10\
      \ different weapons your ship can carry. Five of them can only be picked up\
      \ in the battle. Other five can be purchased and upgraded in the armory. THe\
