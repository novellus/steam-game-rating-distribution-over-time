    about_the_game: Ava is the young daughter of the brilliant-but-aging scientist
      Dr. Cavor and Selene, the former queen of the moon. As a selenite, Selene's
      life depends on the special energy only moon gems can provide. With none left
      and time running out, Dr. Cavor enlists his daughter to <strong>raid the moon</strong>
      of as many gems as she can find! <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1327810/extras/W2_Hidden_Small.gif?t=1599733830"
      /><br><br>Ava must survive the <strong>treacherous catacombs</strong> deep beneath
      the surface of the moon. Her enemies, a legion of corrupt aliens that now rule
      the moon with force, are far less primitive than they first appear. Their world
      is full of <strong>terrifying technology, deadly traps, and armed soldiers</strong>
      at the ready. Ava soon realizes that the only way to save her mother is to <strong>save
      the moon from itself</strong>.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1327810/extras/W8_Boss_Small.gif?t=1599733830"

    review: "I'm on area 4, nearly half way through the game. Is this the deepest,\
      \ most complex groundbreaking game ever? No, however, it is fun. If you have\
      \ played a previous title from the developer, Ammo Pigs, you can see how this\
      \ game is an evolution of that. Ammo Pigs is a fun game, but a deeply flawed\
      \ game mostly due to it's buggy nature. \n\nI can happily report that absent\
      \ from this game. This game is a solid platformer with some mega man and metroid\
      \ elements thrown in for good measure. I personally love the art direction and\
      \ the music. As long as you are not looking for innovation, if you want a solid\
      \ retro like title complete with difficulty and the occasional cheap death,\
      \ then this one is an easy recommend."
