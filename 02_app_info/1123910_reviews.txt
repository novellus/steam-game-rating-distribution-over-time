If this game actually got updates to fix a couple major flaws, or if it was even play-tested before release to discover parts of the map being inaccessible then that'd be cool. But it hasn't, and it wasn't, and what you're left with is a bare bones game that you can play for 5 minutes before the sheer amount of spawned entities causes the game to run at quarter speed. Needless to say, don't get this.","timestamp_created":1586887778,"timestamp_updated":1596841140,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8sPJ5fMCfb3jgAI="}
