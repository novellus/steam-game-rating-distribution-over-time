The claims of full controller support are false, even with Steam's controller configuration options.\n\nThis is a collectathon type game with a HUGE amount of unnecessary trolls.  The level design is really lousy with them.  I'm talking about VERY hard to see spike traps and falling blocks that blend in perfectly with the background.  WAY too many unfair deaths.  This game is not fun.
