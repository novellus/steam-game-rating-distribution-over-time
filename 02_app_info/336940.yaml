    about_the_game: Basingstoke is a <strong>tense roguelike</strong> that mixes <strong>stealth
      and arcade action</strong>. Explore the smouldering ruins of apocalyptic Basingstoke,
      UK, a world of <strong>extreme peril</strong> where reanimated undead and ferocious
      alien monsters roam!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/336940/extras/GIF-test.jpg?t=1593159572"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Scavenge and Craft</h2><br>Loot and craft as you explore.
      <strong>Lob</strong> a tasty sausage roll as a diversion, or <strong>poison</strong>
      a kebab for bait. <strong>Sneak</strong> up and knock a monster out with a <strong>whack</strong>
      from a cricket bat, or <strong>slice</strong> them up with a chainsaw. <strong>Tranquillize</strong>
      them with a dart fired from a homemade blowpipe, or <strong>set them alight</strong>
      with a DIY flamethrower. There's over a hundred useable items to loot or craft!<br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">No Second Chances</h2><br>Use stealth to <strong>sneak</strong>,
      weapons to <strong>attack</strong>, or if all else fails, <strong>run!</strong>
      But be very careful - one bite and you'll be <strong>ripped apart</strong> to
      become a tasty snack for monsters! Violence is your last resort. <strong>Sneaking</strong>,
      <strong>skullduggery</strong>, and <strong>ambush</strong> are your tactics.<br><br><img

    review: It's dark, it's a bit creepy. Mildly frustrating to live on the knife
      edge of doom at all times. One bite and it'll kill ya! No save/Reload for you
      millenials and youtubers though... you would hate this game... it won't hold
      your hand, pat you on the head and make sure your pronouns are pronounced correctly.
      It's just a boot that is trying to find the perfect angle to cause most discomfort
      for when it gets delivered.
