    review: 'An absolutely brilliant puzzle game. I would recommend for anyone who
      doesn''t mind struggling with puzzles for a bit.


      The place that is really quite poor (and I really wish they had done nothing
      rather than what they did) is the story. It... exists but really I think if
      they have given it a simpler story it would have been better. The animations...
      are pretty horrible. The music actively made the game worse and I ended up muting
      it.


      However, this was a small game that I paid around 3 pounds for. If you like
      puzzle games this is pretty great. If you want to play it for any other reason...
      don''t.'
