The audio/video stutters so badly you can't work out what anyone is saying or what's going on. The devs have known about this since 2017 and yet did nothing. \n\nI regret wasting money on this. Saw it in the summer sale, impulse bought it, and now discover it's an unplayable trainwreck and the devs don't give a crap to fix it. Sadly because I waited so long to install it, now it's too late for a refund.\n\nDO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS BROKEN TRASH - THE DEVELOPERS ARE THIEVES.","timestamp_created":1609699812,"timestamp_updated":1609699812,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqrzl5PYCfY2UwAI="}
