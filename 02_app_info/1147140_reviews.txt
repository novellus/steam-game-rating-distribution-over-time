No clear instructions on how to move, etc. Found it really easy to avoid the cops, could play all day and not get caught if I wanted too. I had to hard exit the game. Even the movement was off. Not fun at all :(.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3t_brwCIs","timestamp_created":1567779046,"timestamp_updated":1567779046,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554652929306030273","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp7i6g+0Cf8zh0QE="}
