Without me trying to give away spoilers, I think the ending has a lot more potential.[/b]\n\n[h1]Pros/Cons[/h1]\n\n[b]+ Well written\n+ Nice sound\n\n+/- ‘Okay’ visuals (suitable to ambiance), and I did like the animated design of the personas a lot (including the ‘eyes’ and ‘sun/light’ signs – I think I fully understand their meaning), and the mansion. However I did not like the images of the church and road, that look too much like regular photos made black-white, and also didn’t really blend in with the story.\n+/- Short, but I knew that before I got the game. The length of this visual novel is fair to its price.\n\n- Story is cut of at the end[/b]","timestamp_created":1608695705,"timestamp_updated":1608695870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo97vxvYCdKisvAI="}
