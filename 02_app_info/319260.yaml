    review: "The game in itself offers an amazing VR experience. Nothing pulls your\
      \ senses more than a roller coaster in VR. \nYou can change the angle at which\
      \ you ride and there are plenty of exciting vertical drops and speed.\nUnfortunately,\
      \ this 'game', after just one week of VRing has demonstrated to me my susceptibility\
      \ to cyber sickness. \nI managed, uncomfortably to get half way through the\
      \ second coaster before I was too ill to continue... ... Damn it, I so wanted\
      \ to ride a coaster, I looked high and low for a coaster sim and finally found\
      \ it here, and bliddy eck I can't watch it as the main reality sense for me\
      \ is nausia and drunkeness ;)\nIn fact, this was so bad for me that I still\
      \ feel slightly, in the backgroundish of my senses, two days later giddy. So\
      \ if you're like me then it's dangerous, but if you're okie with it then it's\
      \ a must."
