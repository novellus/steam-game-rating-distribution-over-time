    review: "I'd like to be able to give this game a positive review, because it's\
      \ great to see a developer who keeps at it after their game's initial reception\
      \ is less than stellar. And I don't think the actual gameplay is as bad as reviews\
      \ overall make it out to be; there's what could be a decent if somewhat content-light\
      \ game here, with a few interestingly non-standard features, like mining and\
      \ colony priority. But...\n\n1) The bugs. Oh, the bugs. Like sometimes not being\
      \ able to load my savegame, because the game just sticks on \"Loading...\" forever.\
      \ Not being able to [i]save[/i] the game, because the save button is permanently\
      \ grayed out. Having the End Turn button permanently break, and the key command\
      \ for going to the next turn only work if I first go into the help video menu\
      \ and close it again. Having help videos only play if I go into the menu, spam-click\
      \ one for a while, close the menu again, wait for the video sounds to start\
      \ playing even though the menu is now closed, and then re-open the menu and\
      \ hope I didn't miss too much. Having the game freeze after a battle, or just\
      \ randomly. Galaxy map navigation controls that sometimes don't work.\n\n2)\
      \ The AI. In Astra Exodus' defense, it's hardly the only 4x to break down when\
      \ faced with a peaceful strategy, but in my game as a Charismatic species, I've\
      \ successfully established a long-lasting peace with everyone and am far ahead\
      \ and close to victory (if I can convince it to load my save...*sigh*), with\
      \ the only warship I've had to build being one I produced in the late-game for\
      \ fun, just to go monster-hunting. I've only had to give one gift, even, though\
      \ I did hire a +diplomacy hero to help me out. In other games, even if the AI\
      \ is eventually going to fail against friendliness, it'll resist a bit more\
      \ at the start, and make me have to do some more wheeling and dealing to get\
      \ into a winning position. \n\n3) The messiness. Some of this is aesthetic,\
      \ e.g. different graphics appearing side-by-side but having different art styles\
      \ (stars and planets, for instance) and inconsistent pixel sizes, certain pieces\
      \ of text distorting during zoom and scroll, empire and peculiarity icons becoming\
      \ illegible when downscaled for display under planets on the galaxy map, and\
      \ inconsistent fonts. But then on top of that, you have the interface, which\
      \ has some weird quirks (like having to drag pops around on the planet screen\
      \ by their heads because of the way the \"Board\" button is designed, or having\
      \ to re-create a ship from scratch when modifying the design-- why can't it\
      \ just copy over the existing stuff to a new design for me, instead of showing\
      \ a pop-up message telling me to start over?) the numerous instances of poor\
      \ grammar and awkward writing (which pretty much killed any interest I might\
      \ have had in playing the campaign mode), the sketchy math where you're sometimes\
      \ not sure whether a particular building or ship system is bugged or not because\
      \ the combination of limited documentation and limited display in the UI doesn't\
      \ give you enough information to know if it's doing what it's supposed to, or\
      \ even [i]anything[/i], plus the definite bugs, and it all adds up in terms\
      \ of the overall impression. \n\nI hope that, over time, this game continues\
      \ to improve, and eventually makes it to a state where I can recommend it. As\
      \ it is, there's not enough content or originality to balance out the flaws\
      \ and price."
