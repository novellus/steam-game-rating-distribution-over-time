The owned DLCs ranked:\n\n1.  Waldsee\n2.  Manor lake Farm\n3.  Bergsee.\n\nI can't believe I spent $18 on the 3 lakes, more than I spent on the game when I bought it on sale.  It is nice having a big choice of lakes and the 3 DLC lakes flesh out the game.\n\nThe forest seems a little blurry in Waldsee (not a deal breaker), like playing in an average skill painted painting.  But it still looks fairly nice being surrounded by forest and there is an island in the middle of the lake you can't fish from\n\nI am glad I bought all three lakes, makes upgrading my fishing gear more fun.  I only have 1 hour with each lake,  but I feel I can review them in an early impression kind of way.  I mostly fish at 7 A.M. so I still have the graphics during the middle of the day and end of the day to look forward to which I haven't seen yet in most cases.","timestamp_created":1529703145,"timestamp_updated":1529703145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575732827186584473","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44rPalOQCevLoowE="}
