You can imagine my surprise when this exact same developer has brought out SEVEN games (as of this review) out before giving any sort of major update to this game. The 20 levels that they promised? Not here. As for the graphics they look alright but do give off a sorta 'I bought a unity asset pack and thrown it into a blender with a plethora of other things I have bought.' vibe. I'm of course not accusing the dev of asset flipping but the quality of this game is giving off a lack of care like most 'asset flip' developers. The core gameplay is decent in some parts but dreadful in others. The ai are pretty dumb and easy to kill. This enemies in the first few levels will run as you without a care in the world, some even in a straight line! But when enemies get guns they seem to be able to have some sort of LMAOBOX hacks installed as even when you see the bullet whizz past you it still hits and takes health off. Other than that the game is just very boring and a redesign would be needed. Think of other settings, not just a road with loads of cars for cover and a few turns. Something like the inside of buildings or something along those lines would actually liven up the monotony of playing the exact same bare bones levels. I've played a lot worse on steam but I simply cannot recommend this game in its current state. I spent 57p on this and still feel a little ripped off.","timestamp_created":1599346061,"timestamp_updated":1599346061,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ47IWdsPQCdaWGoAI="}
