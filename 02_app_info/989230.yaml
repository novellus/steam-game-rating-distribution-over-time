    about_the_game: You are a wrongly imprisoned square, who must smash your way home.<br><br>Smasher
      has rules, but you will have to find them.  Many of them involve smashing.  This
      is unfortunate, but you must get home.<br><br>You should know that Smasher can
      be quite difficult at times.  Escaping can involve fast-paced action situations.  Perhaps
      a description of the controls will help to determine if you like this sort of
      challenge.<h2 class="bb_tag">Controls</h2><br>The left stick moves you around.<br>(You
      can also use the D-Pad or WASD on the rebindable keyboard.)<br><br>The right
      stick is the smash stick.  Be careful.<br>(Also ABXY buttons or IJKL on the
      keyboard.)<h2 class="bb_tag">Game</h2><br>With these sole powers, you must manipulate
      your environment, and escape the labyrinth of levels.   If you succeed, the
      external reward is a simple home screen, as befits a square.  Of course, the
      real reward is always the journey, which has perhaps made you more than a square.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Editor</h2><br>Or you can make your own Smasher games, full of
      your own Smasher levels.  The built-in editor has full controller support.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Features</h2><br>Smasher features a custom-built engine for its
      own crafted feel.  It includes a soundtrack appropriate for smashing, performed
      by its own homemade synthesizer.<br><br>Thank you for smashing.
