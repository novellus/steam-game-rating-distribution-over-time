      were the victims of the cruel Kehana during &quot;The Long Swim.&quot; Now the
      Kehana Flumes is beset by catastrophe and the violent Fishmen are on a swim
      of their own. They flood the streets of Marsales and threaten war across the
      city. Who is behind the fiery disaster and their desperate exodus? The fate
      of the Doreen, Kehana, and perhaps all Caribdus depend on the answer!<br>Fire
      &amp; Earth is a three part Plot Point Campaign that may be run within the normal
      50 Fathoms saga, or afterwards to extend your crew''s sea-faring adventures!
      It requires the Savage Worlds core rules, 50 Fathoms Setting Book, and free
      50 Fathoms Update to play.<br>The threats of Fire &amp; Earth are best suited
      for Veteran crews. Even without the menace of the Sea Hags these are dangerous
      waters, and a green crew is likely to find themselves sleeping in Davey Jones''
      locker. You''ve been warned, matey!<br> <i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:</i>
      <strong>Kevin Doswell</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Requires:</strong> An active
      subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license
      and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds ruleset.'
