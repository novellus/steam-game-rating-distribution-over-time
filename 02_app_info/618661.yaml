    about_the_game: Encompassed by a darkness so thick that your torch light cannot
      penetrate it, are you brave enough to venture deeper into the depths of the
      Dungeon?<br><br>No adventure is complete without a perilous dungeon, and no
      dungeon is complete without monstrous horrors to face! This pack contains two
      dozen monsters (including sprite sheets for movement, down poses, animated side-view
      battlers, over-sized static front-view battler, faces, busts, and more), tons
      of tiles for dungeon creation (and can be freely mixed and matched with all
      other Medieval tiles), numerous animated objects from doors and gates to light
      sources and magic orbs, and several ready-to-use prisoners to occupy the lowest
      cells within your dungeon.<br><br><strong><u>Features:</u></strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>13
      Tile sheets for dungeon construction, ranging from rubble and ruins to furniture,
      statues, decal overlays, fixtures, ritual alters, torture devices, and much
      more!<br></li><li>17 build-your-own-pit pieces (plus 4 already made pits).<br></li><li>An
      additional 21 large dungeon props (giant statues, extra rooms, platforms, and
