I felt on the Rift S I could do with a little supper sampling to sharp it out. The game runs very well. Lighting is nice and so is the textures. The maps designs are vivid and different in design. (3 levels to play)\n\nAudio is really funny when a Goblin dies or gets hit by an arrow. It had my making noises in laughter that I have heard come from me before. Overral the audio is fine. No 3D audio and the music is louder than the SFX.\n\nGameplay is really fun and addictive. Not a surprise for a wave game as they can be. This game has power ups and many types of monsters to killer. You can teleport to different platforms to get better angles of shot. It like a tower defence game were you're the towers.\n10 waves to get through the best you can to climb the global leaderboards.\n\nThe game cost is very cheap. Â£5.19 about $6.49 somewhere in-between for Euros.\nI personally enjoyed this early access game and found zero bugs. I would recommend it.","timestamp_created":1588428240,"timestamp_updated":1588428240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwyO7s6vECfI6GhQI="}
