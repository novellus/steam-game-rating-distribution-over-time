      \ to fast expansion is to ensure the supply of four basic resource classes.\
      \ The challenge is to deal with whole planetary ecosystems and their natural\
      \ limitations in fossile resources and environmental resilience. Do research\
      \ for renewable energy sources and develop sustainable production lines to avoid\
