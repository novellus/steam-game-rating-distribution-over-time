That being said, it's a different kind of HoG than I'm used to playing, which made it a bit refreshing.\n\nWhile this game had an interesting concept, it had a habit of being a little frustrating.  There were too many objects you are looking to find and many of them required a specific location to click on it to get it. Not only that, but the slider feature just stopped working once I got past the horse and rider fountain scene. Without the slider functioning like it should, I couldn't get the last piece to progress to the next scene. I'm thoroughly disappointed by that, as I shouldn't have to start a game entirely over to see if the issue is resolved or still there.\n\nI would highly recommend if you're looking to play it, don't pay full price for it.","timestamp_created":1605404979,"timestamp_updated":1605404979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48/3l5PUCc6C4rgI="}
