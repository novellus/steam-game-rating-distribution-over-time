    review: 'One of the most challenging games I''ve EVER played.

      The first challenge begins simply when you start the game. How do you fullscreen?
      CAN you fullscreen? I never discovered the answer but I''m still convinced it''s
      OUT THERE somewhere.


      Second challenge, you pick up a flashlight, BUT how do you use it? Is it a button
      on your keyboard or does the flash light never work? AGAIN, I''m not sure if
      there is a proper answer.


      I''m left with metaphors, smoke and mirrors, more ambiguity than answers. A
      mystery that will haunt me til my dying day.


      10/10 PERFECT GAME'
