    review: 'A short and somehow worse-balanced sequel to Solenars Edge Rebirth, launched
      from within the game but with no save-file carryover from the main game or anything,
      in which almost all of the characters you played as in the original game are
      killed off by people who think "archieve" is a word.


      Notably, the pay DLC part features the worst boss fight in the entire game as
      its final boss - you can permanently stun Vivvian, but can you effectively hurt
      her? Well, no. So you''ll be there for twenty minutes or so.'
