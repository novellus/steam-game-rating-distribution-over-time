And I think if it will have multiplayer it will be the ultimate Mid to Late Cold War Wargame experience.\n\n","timestamp_created":1609186357,"timestamp_updated":1609186357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517196297645568848","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48OW+1fYCcLKbvgI="}
