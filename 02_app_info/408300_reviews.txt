Are we really going to drive the $hitt!est car in America? We can't find another vehicle that isn't the un-wiped @sshole of cars? This hobo dumpster fire breaks down so frequently and is such a pain to fix that it becomes a chore and starts to feel like a kick in the dick. \nOtherwise this harrowing journey through a ruined post apocalyptic America is second to none. I absolutely adore this game, and can't say enough fantastic things about it. \n\nTo all those who made this game, thank you, I love you.\n\nCombat: 10/10\nExploration: 10/10\nAtmosphere and immersion: 10/10\nSoundtrack: 10/10\nShitbox car repair: Get ready to be butt-*ucked without grease.\n","timestamp_created":1602082167,"timestamp_updated":1602082167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510703384876251221","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jbvigfUCeq+2pgI="}
