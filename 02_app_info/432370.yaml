    about_the_game: Sethian is a sci-fi puzzle game in which you master a fictitious
      language. An archaeologist in the distant future, you venture to the far-flung
      planet of Sethian, investigating the mysterious disappearance of the people
      there centuries ago. An abandoned computer may have the answers you seek, but
      it only operates in the lost native language. Master their language, unravel
      their mysteries, and challenge their philosophy.<br><br><strong>An Original
      Language</strong><br>Unlike in other games, Sethianese is a more earnest attempt
      at creating a fictitious language, using its own unique grammar and vocabulary
      rather than simply substituting words and letters one-for-one with English.
      The game's language borrows elements from Chinese, American Sign Language, and
      other real world languages, in addition to some features which have no real
      world counterpart.<br><br><strong>Over 100 Handwritten Pages</strong><br>Assisting
      you in your investigation are your handwritten journal and dictionary, easing
      you into the game's bizarre language, providing you with a reliable reference,
      and introducing you to the literature and lore of the world.<br><br><strong>Multiple
      Endings</strong><br>Those who comprehend the game's language will find peace,
      but only those who master its world will truly see the end of Sethian.

      language. The only surviving speaker is an ancient computer. Does it hold the

    review: Holds your hand too much then not at all, a combination that is confusing
      at best and is likely to leave you unprepared for the harder language stuff.
      Also, I have played what I would consider to be quite a hefty number of games
      where you talk to computers about cerebral issues, and for the most part, the
      conversations are lackluster. If you're interested in the language aspect, it's
      not quite the same, but Heaven's Vault does a much better job at both a more
      even difficulty curve and presenting a mystery with cerebral topics.
