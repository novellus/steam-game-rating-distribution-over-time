Can't beat the first boss yet, it reminds me of the old Megaman games, but in a 3 point perspective.\n\nKind of makes me wan to die though, as a Dark Souls, Cuphead, and fan of a challenge, to not be able to get past a little robot spider means developer did it right. Going to make you want to break your computer I think (dont do it though)\n\nI NEED the soundtrack though, really 80's, can't wait to hear more.","timestamp_created":1532188371,"timestamp_updated":1532188371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454601705074310303","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g+Xi3uQCdp3IpgE="}
