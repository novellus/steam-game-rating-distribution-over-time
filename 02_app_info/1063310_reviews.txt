I've tried four different times to play this game and I have absolutely no clue what to do or what's going on. Single-button prompts appear on screen every now and then, but only in some cases do they actually do anything. I'm mostly just flying around while absolutely nothing happens. If things actually do happen in this game, they're way too hidden behind secrecy and symbolism. I'm just a crow/raven flapping my wings in a vast desert. That's not much of a game.","timestamp_created":1609973899,"timestamp_updated":1609973899,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ474P77PYCeIqRwQI="}
