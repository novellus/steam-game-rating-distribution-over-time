You have to try to stall it, by clumsy stick inputs. It turns very easily and will out-turn every plane in the game aside from Spitfires and Hurricanes; and against these, it can't be defeated in a turn, but rather forces a stalemate. \n\nAs a virtual pilot who enjoys dogfighting and light planes with crisp handling, the Yak-9 has just barely replaced the Bf 109-F4 as my favorite pure dogfighter in the game. \n\nThe only drawback is the low ammunition count; which is a problem in all Russian planes. I'd suggest using the alternate gun sight available: the iron ring one. This was used in real life, if I'm not mistaken, because Russian reflector sights of the period were of spotty quality. Indeed, I don't care much for the Russian reflectors in the game either. I find the iron sights easier to aim with at close range and deflection shooting, in the latter case because of the clearer sight picture. \n\nFor people who can't decide between this Yak-9 and the 9T (the one with the 37mm cannon), I can say the Series 1 is the better flyer, while the 9T is the better killer; the 9T's handling is degraded by the weight of the cannon, so that it's similar in performance to older Yak variants.","timestamp_created":1609622059,"timestamp_updated":1609622059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/+684vYCdc3tvwI="}
