    review: one of the most uninteresting tank combat games i have ever played, to
      the point that i disliked every second i was in the tank and rather be on the
      back or the ground than be in that tin can. and the "cinematic's" killed all
      in vestment in what ever im doing. also the directions were vague and unclear.
