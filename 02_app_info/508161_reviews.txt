She reacts grumpy when someone is rude, shes flustered if its the situation but shes not overly anything. The writing conveyed a fully fleshed charcter wich you shape with your reaktions one by one. I really enjoyed seeing this instead of one blunt character!\n\n[h1]This particular Route:[/h1]\n+ Overall this route was very interessting. You learn a lot about the world, the characters (wich you shoud know from other rutes already) and the main mystery of Shizuha.\n+ Taku as a person is written pretty good, not the best of the bunch ut believeble albeit sometimes beeing a bit extreme in his uuuh let's say \"outbursts\", wich at times makes the writing / his character a bit questionable and more fiction-esque than realistic\n+ their relationship is one of the more fuctional and realistic ones, its especially nice to see important or \"hard\" topics being dealt with and solved through conversations wich is not seen often in fiction (sadly)\n(- at times i found the protagonist a bit out of control (just like his ourburts) but the given excuse (beeing that shes just way to in love with him and tbh a bit clingy) is enough to make me stand it )","timestamp_created":1548182556,"timestamp_updated":1548254623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40dbKvegCdIv+uAE="}
