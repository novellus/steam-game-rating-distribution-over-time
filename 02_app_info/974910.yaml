    about_the_game: Eldest son and heir of an old European noble wizard family, you
      have been raised in wealth and privilege. Now you want the chance for a fresh
      start. That was why you chose to become an exchange student in the distant land
      of Vermont, in the United States of America. There, you will attend Iris Academy,
      a school of pentachromatic magic, and study alongside other wizards and witches.
      Perhaps then you can meet people who like you for yourself.<br><br>As a student
      wizard, you will learn new spells, face puzzles and monsters in the school dungeons,
      join clubs, run for class office, fight duels, investigate ghosts, outwit demons,
      and try to find a date for the May Day Ball.  But keeping secrets isn't always
      easy. Trust the wrong person, and you could lose your honor, your life, or even
      your soul...<h2 class="bb_tag">FEATURES:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Customisable

      notes: Contains romantic relationships, including same-sex, and some suggestive
        dialog. Very brief mention of alcohol laws. Some discussion of past sexual
        assault. Some depiction of unhealthy relationship dynamics and non-graphic
        violence which can be upsetting.
