Yes there may be a couple of kinks that needs to be worked out but once you see past this, you psychologically feel the poetry that is within. The graphics are 10/10 no 1000/10 they are a straight masterpiece. I will continue to love and appreciate this game and I hope that the amazing speed run community will too.","timestamp_created":1609459075,"timestamp_updated":1609459075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+5DP3fYCec6fvwI="}
