The concept and idea about the world and characters fascinated me. I enjoyed the humor and references in game. Artwork is beautiful although some character models are lacking. \nDownside is that it get's too easy at times and at times it's very illogical with it's puzzles. I wouldn't say that the story and dialogue are very strong in this one.\nThere are also some bugs with the objects and models, and the dialogue can get stuck sometimes.\nBut... 99 cents for this game is a steal considering all the effort put in this game. It's by no means a masterpiece, but an unpolished diamond in my opinion. \nIt saddens me that it's likely we never see that sequel \"Space Travesty\" for this game because it didn't get enough kickstart funding. I really really would've wanted to see that one, especially because this project had some veteran game designers like Steve Ince working in it.","timestamp_created":1609100367,"timestamp_updated":1609100367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yeL20vYCcvDuvQI="}
