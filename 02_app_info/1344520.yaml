    developer_response: 'Edit: Thank you, that is such nice feedback! :) You can be
      sure that we are always working on the game. Here it has only begun.


      We are sorry that you don''t like the current state of the game.

      There will be an environment and graphics update first that we gonna release
      in the next coming days. As mentioned on our steam page a gameplay/combat bug
      fix etc. update is in the making and will follow a bit later.


      The current gameplay is only a rough design of what is planned.

      Due to the difficult times everything has been more delayed than expected but
      our silence was just for the time being.


      Feel free to drop us any kind of suggestions here or on Facebook.


      Thanks for being a part of this! Please lean back and watch how the game develops!'

    review: I have changed my review from thumbs down to thumbs up! As I mentioned
      in original review, I thought the team may have launched and left. As you can
      see with the latest update I am happily wrong! I am actually very excited and
      pumped to see this update and that the team is building on this foundation.
      The game has SERIOUS POTENTIAL, to be one epic RPG. Time will tell but they
      made me a believer and more important a player.
