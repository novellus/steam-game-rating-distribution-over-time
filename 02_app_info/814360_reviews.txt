I feel as if my decisions actually mattered at the end of the game. Most games of this nature, it feels like the outcome is always going to be the same no matter what, but this felt different. Granted, I have only gotten through one cycle. It does feel like Amar (my chosen god) would have handled things different should I have interacted with him differently. It is kind of short though, and I feel like there isn't much replay ability outside of getting other gods and maybe slightly different endings. Collecting the pages, completing the fables, and talking to the NPCs I can see becoming mundane rather than fun rather quickly. \n\nThe game is also very beautiful, I like the character designs very much, and the art style is very pleasing. The colors are vibrant without being too much, and they really set up the atmosphere very nicely. Nothing felt out of place or ugly. The animations are fluent and very well done.\n\nI also very much adore the characters, and found myself becoming attached to them and wanting to learn more. I especially adored the twins, as they felt like they have very real emotions, and really portrayed the way kids would feel and act in their situation. [spoiler]An angry bitter defensive exterior, but in reality they're just scared confused and sad.[/spoiler] The same goes for Amar. [spoiler]He's very outgoing and doesn't seem to care, but once you get to know him better it might not be the case.[/spoiler] Lutra was a bit lacking for me, but I understand I don't think they were supposed to be a very strongly developed character (considering they don't even speak in full sentences, and their entire story line (for me at least) centered around [spoiler]eating[/spoiler]). That could've also been my fault, though, as I did not give enough attention to Lutra and sometimes did not say the right things. The fact that characters grow and change throughout the story and through your interactions with them is lovely, and adds so much to this game. \n\nOverall, I couldn't recommend this game enough. The sheer lack of attention it has gotten is rather unfortunate. If you've got $15 to spare, I'd say definitely give it a try. I certainly for one do not regret it. \n\nEdit: I haven't actually touched this game since finishing it the first time around. I still do recommend it, but it has definitely lost my interest after the first play through..","timestamp_created":1604254194,"timestamp_updated":1606478420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwguvkhPYCd+/OqwI="}
