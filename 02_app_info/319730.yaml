      \ The <strong>Multi character control (MCC)</strong> is the most unique feature\
      \ of the game, allowing players to control a party of up to three characters\
      \ at a time. The approach to this style of game play makes Granado Espada feel\
      \ like a hybrid MMORPG and RTS. <br><br>Granada Espada's automatic hunting system\
      \ called <strong><i>\u2018Keep Mode\u2019</i></strong> is a function in the\
      \ game that players seem to respond to positively. Players can grow their characters\
      \ and family without the &quot;grind&quot; most MMO's are notorious for. <br><br>There\
      \ are over 100 characters to add to your party of three to control in each battle.\
      \ This is where the strategy mechanic comes into play, as each battle, monster\

      \ While not as intricate as some other MMOs, the dynamic of having three characters\

    review: P2W trash.  Works on windows 10 thanks to receant update!!! I played years
      ago and got 1 shotted by a credit card user with glowing gear.  Graphics are
      decent.  Game is dying due to the patches that add more P2W garbage.  They will
      pull the plug on this disaster ^_^  They are selling the game again to an even
      worse publisher expect NO MORE PATCHES JUST P2W TOP UP SHIT
