    review: "[b][h1]The Worst Scamming Dev On Steam[/h1]\n\nThis guy revoked 10,000\
      \ keys for Pit Blocks 3D two years after they were in two Indie Gala bundles\
      \ and legitimately sold through other third party sites.\n\nWhen people reacted\
      \ angrily but reasonably to this outrage he deleted all threads pertaining to\
      \ the key revoking as well as banning anyone who complained and then threatend\
      \ legal action against all those he had defrauded.\n\nHe then started a war\
      \ of words with Indie Gala.\n\nhttps://forums.indiegala.com/threads/game-from-bundle-removed-from-my-steam-account.2296/\n\
      \nAvoid him, his company SRM Games, and anything he is involved with.\n\nHe\
      \ is the archetype of a malicious, lying developer and a clear and present example\
      \ of why Valve should exercise more oversight concerning who shouldn't be permitted\
      \ to sell their products on Steam.\n\nI bought the game from Steam in order\
      \ to write this review. That's how strongly I feel about this hatemongering\
      \ dev. It cost me \xA32.89 and it was worth every penny. This verbally abusive\
      \ developer cannot revoke this key as it is a Steam purchase. \n\nUltio.\n[/b]"
