      /><br><br>Did you suddenly lose the desired thing which is very necessary for
      you right now? For example, you're late for a meeting with friends and you can't
      find a gift that is carefully prepared for them. How much time have you spent
      on this? Were you late for the meeting? Maybe this happens to you constantly?
      If so, then this game is designed to help you develop your ability to quickly
      find necessary items. The gameplay is simple, but fascinating. Before your eyes
      suddenly there is a huge pile of all sorts of items, while mercilessly the second
      counter, counts down, which marks the end of the round. During the game you
      need to find all the necessary items before time runs out,  it may not be as
      easy as it seems. Compete with friends in speed or just have fun collecting
      items, which in ordinary life would have seemed too funny. Where else will you
      be able to meet a number of octopus' and cabbage, Or mushrooms and a ship anchor?
      This is the essence of the game. Hours of fun waiting for you!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/698300/extras/os.png?t=1505379410"

    review: An apparent asset-flip that just can't be recommended. Malwarebytes/WD
      pointed out some of the files as malware as well, which is concerning even though
      Steam has stated before that it most often is false positives. Can not recommend
      this one.
