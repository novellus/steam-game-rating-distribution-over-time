    review: Another brilliant little old school RPG. Love old style better than most.
      Alot of the conversations have me giggle whilst reading. The comedy injected
      is quite great I think. Would recommend for anyone whom likes old school rpgs
      old school graphics and fight styles. Great game overall. I am enjoying quite
      well.
