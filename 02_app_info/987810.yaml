    review: "Fully underrated neat lil indie game. flying takes getting used to but\
      \ it feels great, after a few upgrades you can fly anywhere at pretty decent\
      \ speeds. Lore is entertaining and lighthearted, visuals are really nice while\
      \ soaring although if you look too closely at things like your characters face,\
      \ it's a little weird. \n\nThere's plenty to do for the price, 40+ races to\
      \ test your skills, loads of things to collect, armour sets and locations to\
      \ discover and read about. Clearly some love has been put into this game, it's\
      \ sad to see it go unnoticed. \n\nI hope a couple more updates come in the future\
      \ although I fully understand if not, still enough to play with for \xA311.\
      \ \n\nOne issue which stands out to me right now is; I can't seem to find the\
      \ \"disable low poly clouds\" option."
