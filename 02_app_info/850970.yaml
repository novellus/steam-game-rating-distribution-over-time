    about_the_game: Plunker is a short, and heavily comedy based indie VR game based
      on exploring for easter eggs and extremely goofy interactions with the world
      around you. The player investigates suspicious scenes, trying to find anything
      out of order. You can expect to be strung along by jokes, replayable VR minigames/puzzles
      with unique mechanics, and a surreal, sometimes nonsensical story. Plunker was
      made by one person while streaming live on Twitch.tv and also working a full
      40+ hours a week for a good portion of the last three years. All of the art,
      all of the code, all of the ideas, all of the testing. At the end of it you've
      got 45~90 minutes of playtime.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/850970/extras/snailsDescriptionImage.jpg?t=1600712668"

      notes: There are swear words, and some tongue-in-cheek sexual themes, and implied
        nudity (punching a guy who's on the toilet where you don't actually see anything
        for instance).
    detailed_description: <h1>The Story of Development</h1><p>August (AuggoDoggo)
      Yadon left his San Francisco programming job to move to Cleveland, Ohio and
      work full time on his first VR game. Almost all of the early development was
      streamed live on Twitch, where a small following grew. Everything in the game
      is made almost entirely from scratch in Unity3d, Blender, and Gimp. To read
      more about the challenges, success, and behind the scenes, read on our website.</p><br><h1>A
      Note on the Length of the Game</h1><p>A regular playthrough will last <strong>45-90
      minutes</strong>. A number of people have read the description and advised me
      to make more content to increase the length of the game, pushing it past <strong>Steam's
      refund policy window (120 minutes)</strong>. I've been working on this game
      for 3 years, and it's a comedic piece of art that I'm proud of. In the same
      way that a musician shouldn't add a few extra songs immediately before release,
      and why a director shouldn't do the same with scenes in their movie, I also
      don't want to dilute Plunker's experience by adding filler content just to hit
      a certain <strong>time requirement</strong>. I enjoy this goofy little game
      for <i>exactly what it is</i>. I'm ready to move forward and let the world play
      <strong>Plunker</strong>.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Plunker is a short,
