The art style is where it shines. it's good for some time just to see the black and white drawings. But controlling the bird isn't very fun. There is a wind mechanic that kind of takes away the fun of just flying around as the bird. It's kind of a rail shooter with the shooter aspect. I like that idea, but in the best rail shooters it is fun to move the ship. it's not fun be the bird.","timestamp_created":1608699737,"timestamp_updated":1608699737,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ur7+xvYCfuGtvAI="}
