The result was the iconic MSX title Knightmare II: The Maze of Galious. \n\nMini Ghost is, in its own bite-sized form, one of a small handful of true-to-the-source-material respinnings of the elements that made MoG so awesome:\n1) a big but succinct map where individual screens are accessible from multiple horizontal and vertical points,\n2) a generally low difficulty level where exploration and item discovery eclipses combat and platforming, and\n3) a sequential yet open-feeling progression through increasingly difficult zones with imposing bosses.\n\nFor a price that won't break anyone's piggy bank, it's hard not to recommend this game emphatically. The addition of a map and character editor sweetens the deal, but if you're at all a fan of games like La-Mulana and Unepic, this one'a a no-brainer, folks. While you're at it, check out Maze of Galious the gem that inspired these worthy spiritual successors, as well as the rest of Metroidvania-dom.","timestamp_created":1609189560,"timestamp_updated":1609189560,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7IHL1fYCfKmdvgI="}
