    review: "The description here is a bit vague on what this and the other collections\
      \ are, so I'll try to clarify a bit. \n\nBy \"short version\" it means the version\
      \ you hear in game, none of which have changed since the original Xbox 360 Live\
      \ Arcade version of Moe Mekuri 1, so what you hear in any version of the game\
      \ is representative of what you get here. \n\nYou can listen to all 3 Vocal\
      \ Collections and view lyrics in game without this DLC, it's all unlocked by\
      \ default for you to cycle through by clicking on the collection's title, so\
      \ you can sample each collection there, or just have the game open in the background\
      \ if you don't wanna get the DLCs. \n\nWhat the DLCs actually does is give you\
      \ a folder with:\nMP3s, plain text Files with Lyrics, and the album's front\
      \ cover. \nAnd just the front cover, no disc cover, back cover, or inside covers\
      \ even though you can see the back and disc covers in game for Vocal Collection\
      \ 2 and 3.\n\nThe no Language Support warning on this page refers to the fact\
      \ that the lyrics you get are in Japanese only with no translations, it's the\
      \ same in game, though all the song titles are in English. \nJust note if your\
      \ PC doesn't properly support unicode that besides the lyrics, the songs themselves\
      \ have metadata in Japanese.\n\nThe \"long versions\" referred to in the other\
      \ two Vocal Collections is the full non-looping version of the songs, but that\
      \ shouldn't be the main reason to get those since it's just the endings and\
      \ some intermissions you're missing.\n\nThere are no long versions of the Moe\
      \ Mekuri 1 songs since it never got a matching physical CD release to go with\
      \ it like Moe Mekuri 2 (plus 2.5) and 3 did as far as I'm aware, or if there\
      \ was it was still the short versions anyway.\nOnly Moe Mekuri 2 and 3's remixed\
      \ versions of these songs in the corresponding Vocal Collections are full length.\
      \ \n\nAlso it might be worth noting that while there's no direct overlap between\
      \ 2 and 3's non remix songs, they both take from 1's OST, so in particular Honey\
      \ Trap and Love Potion had a version for each game, so they're also in each\
      \ collection."
