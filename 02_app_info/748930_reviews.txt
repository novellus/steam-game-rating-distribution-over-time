The graphics are nice and software runs fine, without bugs, but there isn't better to say. The mechanics is good at theory: there are 9 types of towers, each one with 4 parameters to upgrade 4 ranks, and about the same number of foe kinds. \n\nBut gameplay soon reveals that there ins't freedom to choice emplacements, zoom cannot be fixed to desirable distance so maps are too small, there isnt way to know in advance when a wave begins and which kind of enemies will come, destroying the sense of build planning typical of the genre, and the worst issue: upgrades are expensive but aren`t permanent, must be bought on every map.  \n\nTowers can be repaired, but regeneration system is slow, expensive and all repairings stops when player runs out of money, needing to be reset on every damaged building. As towers haven't status visual bars and there isn't an ingame pause option, is easily to loss buildings due a lack of repairs, and the missed ones are hard to replace due their high costs: loss 3 towers generally lead soon to see a \"game over\".\n\nAll enemies attacks towers directly, and would not be a problem if it weren't for the maths has been implemented wrongly or in an evil way: it may be that towers are too weak, or enemies are too strong, or repairings are too slowly or money gains and prices are bad calculated or balanced, but the truth is product degenerates into a puzzle controlled by the developers, dictating what should be done without margin to player's improvisation. \n\nIt can only be recommended to puzzle fans, because players who wants a Tower Defense game must abandon after 5 levels: less of 20% continue playing 10 more to finish campaign. There are 8 infinity mode maps, but due to the horrible design of game itself, they are can barely playable after 12 minutes: less of 4% players endurances 37 minutes. A pity.","timestamp_created":1539642020,"timestamp_updated":1539891362,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550152242183685303","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwja+rxOYCef/grAE="}
