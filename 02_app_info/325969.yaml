    review: "Conclusion first:\nThis DLC does not only contain a great loco, but the\
      \ whole package with loco, rolling stock, comprehensive manual, scenarios (8\
      \ instead of the listed 5) is absolutely worth the money - even outside Sale.\n\
      It's an amazing loco and even if you are not the most skilled steam-driver (like\
      \ me) you surely will be capable to drive the K1 with just minimal practising.\
      \ I give it a 9.5 out of 10 as the overall \"package\" really impresses me which\
      \ is far above the average of other \"PRO\"-locos and DLCs as such.\n\nPros:\n\
      (+) very detailed model in 3 different liveries (clean, worn, LNER Green) and\
      \ various logos to choose for the tender\n(+) 'standard' and 'advanced' driving\
      \ mode which you may toggle on/off whenever you like\n(+) advanced mode gives\
      \ you (respectively it gave me) the extra-kick to cope with the challenges,\
      \ but reading the manual is a \"must\" though\n(+) great driving physics and\
      \ very convenient to drive and operate\n(+) great sound (I have to admit I have\
      \ never heard the real K1, but it sounds great to me in TS)\n(+) great 'feeling'\
      \ to drive looking at all details in combination with sounds, steam, etc. looks\
      \ \"real\" to me\n(+) EIGHT (not 5 as per the steam-description) (career) scenarios\
      \ which I find immmersive and a pleasure to drive. Difficulty various from easy\
      \ to advanced, but all achievable without any problems and a great help to get\
      \ familiar with the K1.\n(+) comprehensive manual which I recommend to read\
      \ (you then have paid for it anyways :-)\n(+) a lot of little features such\
      \ as opening the roof, windows, etc.\n(+) various rolling (girders, trusses,\
      \ various pipes, steel plates, etc.) stock which completes the package\n(+)\
      \ ...and quite some more => read the description on steam\n\nCons:\n(-) ....\n\
      ...nothing that I'm aware of, except a real minor one for scenario creators:\
      \ I did not succeed to figure out how to switch-on \nthe headlight if you use\
      \ the K1 as AI in your scenarios."
