    about_the_game: "Gravity in Space is the ultimate synthesis of an astrodynamics\

      \ games you are actually bound to Newton\u2019s laws of motion\u200A\u2014\u200A\
      you cannot control where you go <i>directly</i>, but only indirectly through\
      \ acceleration impulses that add to your current velocity vector. Controlling\
      \ a spaceship is totally different compared to an aircraft. It is much harder.\
      \ No air resistance, no maximum speed, no limits. You have to completely rethink\
      \ the basic idea of flying. Float around several gravitation centers and use\
      \ them to get to your target. But you must not lose focus on your enemy! You\
