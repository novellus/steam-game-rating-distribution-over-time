    review: "Edit: This is a neutral recommend. This are some big problems but good\
      \ parts too.\n\nPokemon with tits and ass. Solid writing, self aware and funny\
      \ with lots of meta jokes, and adult humor. The gameplay is a solid pokemon\
      \ type rpg. Gallery system for viewing the monstergirls. It has lots of promise.\
      \ I wish steam had a neutral recommendation. In its current state I cant recommend\
      \ it without caveats. Its riddled with bugs, and could use a huge polish pass.\
      \ \nAs far as I can tell none of the equipment works, thankfully the healing\
      \ consumables work or it would be a whole lot harder. The Nympapedia (pokedex)\
      \ doesn't show info about any of the girls or their moves. Sometimes when you\
      \ load your game, your items or girls wont load. restarting usually fixes things.\
      \ Changing the keybindings doesn't seem to work. Gamepads sometimes stop working.\
      \ No manual saving, and sometimes that leads to having to redo areas. and the\
      \ most egregious problem is the uncesor method seems not to work.\nThat being\
      \ said, even with the number of bugs its still playable if you have a high tolerance\
      \ for weird stuff.\n\nWorst of all, the devs last comment seems to be about\
      \ 4 months ago, meaning none of this will likely be fixed. \n"
