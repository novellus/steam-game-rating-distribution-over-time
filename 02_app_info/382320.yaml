    review: "I give this game a thumbs up with heavy caveats... \nI really wanted\
      \ to like this game, as it's the first ORK Framework game I've played, and I'm\
      \ developing a game using the same plugin.\nHowever, there are just some rough\
      \ edges that made it very tough to enjoy. That, and the fact there doesn't seem\
      \ to be a new chapter of the game, despite the game finishing on a cliffhanger.\n\
      \nSo first, the positives.\n- Graphics are nice, though admittedly they are\
      \ asset store purchases.\n- Battle system is adequately balanced\n- Has the\
      \ seeds of a good story\n\nThe negatives:\n- In the dialogue, there are case\
      \ issues and a few spelling issues\n- The dialogue seems rushed, especially\
      \ in the second half of the game\n- There don't seem to be any real stakes in\
      \ the story. At one point both characters die, and then they are resurrected\
      \ and continue on like nothing happened\n- The game only has one boss, really,\
      \ and I didn't even realise it was the boss until after the battle was over.\
      \ There should have been some different music or something.\n\nSorry to be so\
      \ harsh. I didn't feel like my time was wasted playing, but I hope if you ever\
      \ release the next chapter, you will fix some of the issues that prevented this\
      \ from being a great game."
