      \ Series were built in 2003 and were equipped with either AC or DC traction\
      \ motors, according to the customer\u2019s request. Four models in the Series\
      \ were produced for the North American market, the ES40DC, ES44DC, ES44AC and\
      \ ES44C4, all with a low emission four-stroke diesel engine.<br><br>The ES44DC\
      \ replaced the Dash 9-44CW model in GE\u2019s locomotive roster, and are similar\
      \ in appearance to the Dash 9 and AC4400CW, although small differences are evident.\
      \ In total, more than 1,100 models were built primarily for BNSF, CSX Transportation\
      \ and the Canadian National Railway. Barring those damaged in accidents, the\

    review: "**THIS PACK ONLY INCLUDES 1 LOCOMOTIVE NOT 2! THE PICTURES ARE MISLEADING!\n\
      Includes: BNSF ES44DC in Heritage 2 paint scheme. \n\nPros:\n-It has working\
      \ dynamic brakes, you can use them on any mountain route.\n-Above average headlights\
      \ (effect). Its almost as bright as the F59PH, F59PHI, P42DC, Dash 8-BWH headlights.\
      \ This means you can see the headlights at a distant which makes this DLC more\
      \ realistic with that respect.\n-Interior lights\n-Heritage 2 paint scheme,\
      \ will make your consists more diverse.\n\nCons\n-Reused engine sounds from\
      \ CSX, NS, & CP ES44ACs. Of course you can always just use sound mods. \n-Windows\
      \ and doors inopperable.\n-Incorrect Horn. Same horn as the H3 BNSF ES44DC\n\
      -PRICE\n-No rolling stock included.\n-Only 1 loco.\n-You cannot use this DLC\
      \ outside of the US!\n\nGrade: D\nNeeds to be updated in terms of Sounds, Price\
      \ and the description.\n\nOnly buy when there is a sale. Sure it will make any\
      \ BNSF scenario more diverse but its not worth the price."
