Unfortunately the game won't even start. The launcher has script errors. It probably works on older computers witn older Windows. But I can't get it to work even after setting the launcher to a Windows 7 or 8 Compatibility mode.\n\nIt's too bad. I wanted to get into this game. But it just wasn't meant to be. It's probably not getting updated for newer systems. Uninstalling.\n\nAll of the help guides have nothing on what to do to fix this either.  So based on not getting past the script errors to even start the game it sucks.","timestamp_created":1532800409,"timestamp_updated":1532800409,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42sOB8eQCc6WLpwE="}
