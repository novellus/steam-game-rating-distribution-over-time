Could be better could be worst ( you use only WSAD to move + space bar for \"special\") + no controller support.\nThe funny thing about the map is that it's most of the time half in use. You've got 2 main pars the city and the forest and only the first part is used mainly.\nIF the dev would make the game better then maybe just maybe I can recommend it but not in this shape.","timestamp_created":1578300165,"timestamp_updated":1597620430,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy6Tm/PMCeMCf6gE="}
