    review: This game is a hidden gem! It has great potential to be as big as speedrunners.
      It is already very fun but it will become even better once there are more mini
      games released. One critique I have of the boxing mini game instead of dying
      right away getting punched should knock you back and the motive should be to
      knock other people off.
