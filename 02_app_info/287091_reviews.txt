It shows the British paratroopers in Arnheim as well as the advance across the bridges to the south, like watching the movie A Bridge Too Far. Its  also quite challenging with all the urban combat in Arnheim. You'll have to make full use of the scout units. It really shows just how much of an obstacle the Tigers, Panthers and 88 millimeter guns were; you'll have to take a lot  of losses to knock them out.","timestamp_created":1603075143,"timestamp_updated":1603075143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41a6un/UCc+jgqAI="}
