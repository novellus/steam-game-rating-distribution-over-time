There can be good or bad games, there can be realistic or unrealistic physics. There can be tons of game variants. I've sen everything. But I have NEVER seen a game where it's almost impossible to aim the cue stick. That until I played this game. You have to drag your mouse to aim your shot, this when even in the 8-bit era it was common and comfortable to place a cursor in the desired spot to aim the shot. But it's not that that the problem. The problem is that the stick seems glued to the table, being so hard to move it. It can take several seconds before you reach the desired position. Do we really need a game like that? Apart from that, the physics are not convincing. I've seen much better games thirty years ago.","timestamp_created":1586437832,"timestamp_updated":1586437832,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1IfEr/ECda21/wE="}
