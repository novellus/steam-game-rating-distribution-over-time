It's cheaper than going to an arcade and inserting two quarters and the gameplay was pretty much the same as a flash miniclip game. experience wasn't bad for me and its a good game to just have in the background while you chat with friends or watch them stream other games","timestamp_created":1594192477,"timestamp_updated":1594192477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tNfRlvMCfZ/dkwI="}
