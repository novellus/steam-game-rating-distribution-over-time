The game may not be completed, although the developer has said the game will still be worked on (supposedly), but will take much longer, as in 2+ years.\n\nAlthough it is sad to hear about this, I cannot recommend the game to future players, not until more big updates get released.  I would say follow the game and put it on the backburner to see if anything gets done.  Otherwise save your money.\n\nI will be changing this review to a \"do not recommened\" for now.  I will leave my original positive review below for those that are curious about the game.\n\n\n\nPrevious review:\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game, especially to those that like top-down shooters.\n\nReasoning:  \n\nI may be a bit biased as I love top-down shooters, but I feel this game has a good foundation already in which everyine can enjoy regardless if youre a fan of the genre or not.\n\nThe gameplay is very solid and satisfying. Currently there are two modes, 1 campaign and a survival mode.  At the moment the campaign consists of getting from point A to B while fighting zombies.  Survival is based on fighting waves of enemies, while preventing the zombies getting past you, if they do you lose. \n\nWith that said the combat is very enjoyable combined with the mechanics in the game, make for a great experiece.  It is your standard zombie killing, but this game makes it fun.  You have a handful of guns to use which you have to purchase by earning money killing zombies.\nSo what separates this from other top-down shooters is you can headshot the enemies for more damage.  \n\nAlso another which goes along with the headshot mehanic is the ability to only shoot in two directions, left and right.  There is no full 360 aiming or even 8 directional aiming for that matter.  And enemies too move in one direction left/right but can also move up and down.  Yea this may sound lame, it did to me at first, but when I played the game it felt very intuitive and any ill feelings toward this issue was dismissed quickly.\n\nthere is online  co-op multiplayer (yay!) and runs quite smoothly (for me).\n\nthe graphics, it has a charm to it.  Nothing like triple-A stuff, but very warming to look at.\n\nThere are customizable options such as changing your characters clothing and head.  Not a whole lot at the moment, but i can definitely see more being added.  \n\nMy gripes so far is the weapons interface is a little bit cluncky.  Not much content at the moment either in terms of modes and campaigns.\nOne other issue which might turn off some is if you read the early access statement on this page.  The development time is estimated at 2 years, this is a long time.  So if you are patient and dont have a good interest to play this game I would wait.\n\nOverall I can see a lot of potential in Zombie hunter inc.  It is very early access, but the foundation is there, so I can only see this game going up as time goes on.  Definitely pick this game up!  It is my nee go-to top down zombie shooter that I will definitely enjoy playing as development goes on.\n\nLastly I would like to add a note about the developer.  They are super nice people and take feedback very well.  I had an issue with this game and the dev spent an hour with me trying to solve my problem, after the issue was fixed we ended playing a couple rounds of survival online.  Seriously, I dont know any other game where you get this kind of awesome attention and service!","timestamp_created":1453323512,"timestamp_updated":1458068300,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54844897985458374","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwjpTpvdMCesniTg=="}
