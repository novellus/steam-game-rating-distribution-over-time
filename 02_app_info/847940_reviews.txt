I like the new skills and the balance between healing/physical attacks/magic.  This game makes you pay attention to the dialogue and learn what each character is best at.  It is challenging but not difficult enough to be frustrating.  The story is cute and funny and of, course, cat girls :).  A game well worth the few bucks.","timestamp_created":1533082815,"timestamp_updated":1533082815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497434675693511963","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oem2+eQCc9qppwE="}
