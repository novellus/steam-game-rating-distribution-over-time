      /><br>Haunt Chaser is a 4 player online co-op horror game you can play with
      other players. You and your team use all the hunting equipment in order to banish
      an evil poltergeist and save the poor souls from torment while uncovering deeply
      disturbing secrets.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1450180/extras/Layer-1.gif?t=1604164865"

      /><br>Haunt Chaser will start with Season One Orphanage. Then we will continue
      to release more different themed seasons for free. The orphanage is where you
      will start to experience the terror with your other four Chaser friends. You
      must work together, then maybe... maybe you can survive. Remember it will smell
      your skin, every step you land will be heard by the darkness himself. The children
      didn't know that! At least, now you know what is waiting for you there!<br><img
