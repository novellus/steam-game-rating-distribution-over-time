    review: 'Ignore everything below - with the overhaul of steam''s music library,
      somebody fixed all the gripes i had with it, so i changed this to a positive
      review. The text below is only kept for archival purposes.


      (Also, this is pretty much the only thing the overhaul fixed, but this isn''t
      the place to rant.)






      [quote=Me in early 2019][i]I really can''t criticize the music. The other reviews
      are right, absolutely lovely. But what made me downvote this is the way the
      FLAC files are presented.


      It is, carefully worded, a complete train wreck. It''s not that track numbers
      are missing, no, they do exist. But they are all wrong, to the point where some
      tracks share a number. This is annoying, but can be sorted out easily, it it
      wouldn''t be for something else:


      The albums are incorrectly labeled, too. I can understand putting the base game
      OST and the AMPLIFIED OST in the same folder. I can even understand that you
      just put them on the same album. I can not understand how somebody managed to
      mess this up.


      Example? Sure, after downloading, have fun with your "Chipped of the NecroDancer:
      AMPLIFIED" OST. Except it has exactly one track (Voltzwaltz).


      I''m not saying you shouldn''t buy this (when you''re reading this, you made
      your decision most likely anyway), i''m just greatly annoyed that you have to
      sort everything yourself.[/i][/quote]'
