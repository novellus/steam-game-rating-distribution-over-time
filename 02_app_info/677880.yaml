    review: 'Pros:


      -Good enough controls

      -Achievements

      -Great Gameplay

      -Making levels is very fun

      -Enjoyable Soundtrack

      -Acceptable graphics

      -Creative concept



      Cons:


      -Partial Controller Support

      -No Trading Cards

      -The level editor needs slightly more features

      -You have to wait until you can play the next ''''season'''' (unless you pay
      with the in-game currency), like a free mobile app, even though you already
      paid for the game.



      Other notes:


      Game is family friendly: Yes

      Hardware Requirements: Low

      Difficulty: Variable

      Game''s overall recommendation: Very Recommended



      **EXTRA NOTE**: I strongly recommend making your levels using MS-Paint, or any
      other drawing program.'
