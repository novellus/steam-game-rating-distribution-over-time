      \ with the stunning DB BR 204 diesel locomotive!<br><br>In the 1950s, the Deutsche\
      \ Reichsbahn were keen to get dieselisation underway, replacing steam locomotives\
      \ with a modern fleet of standardised locomotives, that between all variants\
      \ could cover any duty required on the network. Many locomotive designs started\
      \ cropping up, including the V60, V90 and V164, however none managed to fill\
      \ the 1,000 horsepower (746 kW) market, and so a further design was established.<br><br>Named\
      \ the \u201CV100\u201D, the first of this new 1,000 horsepower locomotive was\
      \ built in 1966 (following the production of two prototypes) and the result\
      \ was a double-ended locomotive with the cab situated in the middle, allowing\
      \ for seamless operation in either direction. In all, over 860 of these locomotives\
      \ would be built, and they were put to use on all medium-weight freight traffic\
      \ throughout East Germany.<br><br>Many locomotives were rebuilt during their\
      \ lifespan in order to excel at more specific duties, one such in particular\
      \ was retrofitted with a 1,475 horsepower (1100 kW) engine, and these were classified\
      \ as the DR Class 114. With the Reunification of Germany and the merger of Deutsche\
      \ Reichsbahn and Deutsche Bundesbahn, these locomotives were reclassified once\
      \ again to become the DB BR 204 and started to see more widespread use, particularly\
      \ as shunting locomotives.<br><br>Now, you can experience the classic DB BR\
