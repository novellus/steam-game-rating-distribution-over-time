    about_the_game: You wake up in the middle of the Colosseum with no memory.  You
      start your struggle to survive in the Colosseum without knowing who you are
      and where slaughtering is just entertainment.  In the middle of the Colosseum,
      all you can rely on is your weapons, shields and skills.  It's up to you whether
      you're going to be a Gladiator that cuts off the heads of countless enemies,
      or you're going to be one of the thousands of bodies that can't be recorded
      anywhere in the history books.<br><br><strong>&quot;Become A Gladiator VR&quot;</strong>
      is not a perfect physical simulation game containing real-world like interactions.
      This is a <strong>PVP specialized VR</strong> action game that prioritizes action
      itself rather than focusing on historical research. It is designed to <strong>allow
      players to feel and learn when and how to swing swords and shields</strong>,
      which is temporarily impossible to control or immobilize due to collisions between
      weapons and shields.<br><br>Due to the characteristics of the game, players
