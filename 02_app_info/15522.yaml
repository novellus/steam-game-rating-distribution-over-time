    review: Now, i love this game. I love it to death and i got this pack expecting
      to have some fun with a good challenge, instead what i got was unfair punishment.
      Cruel and un-diserved punishment. The game is all ready picky with points to
      get above a freaking 2 stars, and to be honest, i didn't find it as fun as i
      expected. Could i edit some files and maybe some registry to get these levels?
      Eh probably, I dont know if i suck or if i just cant stand how much points are
      taken away when you die and get rewound to a checkpoint. Oh, and i cant get
      past the first level, you know how i said "The game is picky with points?" Well,
      i can get 4 and 5 stars on the Summer level almost every time, but i cant even
      get a 3 star on the first level where it requires 4 stars to get past the 1st
      level, why not make it use teeth? Maybe make the cap at 3 stars? I dunno. But
      i struggle to recommend this one because its at Mario 2 levels of cruelty. And
      yes, i know its meant to be hard, but atleast put this one with For The Awesome's
      DLC (which was epic) If your just a new player, a okay/good player then i cant
      recommend this one, however if your a veteran like me and apparently cant do
      these levels, also dont buy it. Unless your a die hard fan who wants a massive
      challenge, whipping out the 5 stars on every level while kicking so much butt,
      then i could recommend this one, but just stay with For The Awesome.
