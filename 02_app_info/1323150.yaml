    about_the_game: Oirbo will ultimately have 5 different areas to explore. The demo
      takes place in the <strong>Nature </strong>area the &quot;2nd&quot; area of
      the game. This is subjective since after the first area (the warehouse) you
      can pretty much explore all the other 4 areas at will (although you won't be
      able to fully explore any of them without finding and unlocking all skills).
      The remaining area code names are <strong>Medical</strong>, <strong>Mechanical</strong>,
      and <strong>Control</strong>.<br><br>The demo will have 2 unlocked skills, the
      <strong>Night Vision</strong> and the <strong>Dash </strong>enabling you to
      explore about 3/4 of the area, the only aspects that you won't be able to explore
      are sections that require some skills unlocked later in the game. <br><br>Since
      the entire nature area is open to exploration, the demo time can vary depending
      on the route you take and what side content you decide to see. You can expect
      between <strong>30 minutes</strong> to <strong>2 hours</strong> of content depending
      on how far you explore the Nature area.<br><br>The demo ends after you defeat
      the area boss, but you can play it as many times as you wish. <br><br>We disabled/blocked
      a few game features for this demo, such as the lore memories, the spacecraft
      logs, fast traveling, all borders to adjacent areas, and the game save system.
      The latter implies that every time you exit the game or go back to the main
      menu, the demo will restart from the beginning.
