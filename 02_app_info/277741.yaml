      \ the 1950s there was a desire to produce an electric locomotive that could\
      \ operate at speeds up to 200km/h. These were unveiled at the International\
      \ Transport Fair in Munich in June 1965 as the Class E.03 (which became Class\
      \ 103.0 when the new numbering system was introduced). Exhibition runs operated\
      \ the train between Munich and Augsburg, achieving 200km/h on a regular basis.\
      \ The fastest speed recorded on a Class 103 was 283km/h (176mph).<br><br>Following\
