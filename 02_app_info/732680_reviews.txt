Checked their site; these games have free trial versions you can download from them directly, so it's a really low blow trying to monetize the free trial. In essence they're trying to get you to pay for it twice.\n\nAvoid any games from this developer on Steam like the plague; I myself will never purchase another game of theirs via Steam ever again.\n\nGameplay wise, it's Bejeweled; if you liked Bejeweled, you'll probably like this.","timestamp_created":1511924489,"timestamp_updated":1511924489,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.628975272178649902","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4spvuguACfMfSkAE="}
