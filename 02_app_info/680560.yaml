    review: "Pretty disappointing.   I really did not want to put a no recommendation\
      \ because this is such a great idea and from the video you can see that these\
      \ guys put lots of time and effort into this.  However, I just can't recommend\
      \ this experience in its current form.  The video quality is just not good enough.\
      \  \n\nYou can move around in the circle area and even jump.  You can look all\
      \ around.  But the video 360 quality is just so poor that it's very difficult\
      \ to enjoy the experience.  It's also a very cloudy day, so you mostly see clouds.\
      \  That could be exciting but not with such poor video quality.  It's really\
      \ a shame.  I wanted to like this.  I won't ask for a refund.  But this is not\
      \ worth anything really in it's current state.\n"
