It absolutely requires like a 3 button mouse an wheel and keyboard to even think about playing it (so if you're on some one button laptop... good luck) but even if you get it cruising and up, the camera is garbage, the controls are unintuitive, the RNG is everywhere.  \n\nLike, i get the impression that, the game, at the core, might be good.  But all these programming problems prevent you from playing it.  Like, it has complicated tactical turn-based interactions, but it crashes. it clunks, it lags.  Didn't work well on the first computer I tried it on.  Now I am i7-9700 @ 3.00 GHz, 16 GB RAM, and a GeForce GTX 1660, still clunky.  \n\nWhen it comes done to it, why bother ever with this thing.","timestamp_created":1609701591,"timestamp_updated":1609701591,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/aDs5PYCd5iVwAI="}
