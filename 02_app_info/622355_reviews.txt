However when I read the thumbs down reviews I was begining to think this was a bad purchase!. even at half price. well i am very pleased to say having taken basic advice like going in to FSX Scenery Library and un-ticking boxes and Disabling any other Scenery add-ons that were not required for the area I was Flying over. I have already installed VFR Scenery South west England/wales and the two add-ons work brilliantly together. Oh and I also reinstalled Farm strips a second time which seemed to help. Lastly I Verified the FSX -SE files using Steam's Properties Menu. well what ever I did it worked and is Fantastic even if loading times are still a little slow.","timestamp_created":1518975357,"timestamp_updated":1518975357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.614035129547119141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hJL/1OECecWsmQE="}
