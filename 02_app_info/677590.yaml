    review: 'One of the most depressing and PUZZLING games I''ve ever played and a
      realistic portrayal of slowly losing your mind - realistic as in there are barely
      any "horror game insanity effects", but rooms suddenly lead to unexpected rooms,
      people you once loved are there for a moment and then gone again. Often you''ll
      feel trapped and don''t know what''s expected of you in these strange escape
      rooms featuring cold, technical CAD graphics overlayed with crayon characters,
      a contrast that in some rooms works quite well and in others it only looks jarring.


      [i]Hope[/i] doesn''t provide much feedback when trying out item combinations,
      the English translation is wonky at best, but SOMETHING about it, maybe the
      sternness and total lack of self-awareness, draws me in. But it''s definitely
      not for someone looking for an easy, relaxed experience, more like... playing
      with a rock you found on the lawn, all by yourself.'
