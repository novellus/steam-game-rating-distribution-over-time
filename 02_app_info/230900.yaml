    review: 'For 2 Bucks you can have two new units to your arsenal...


      Actually they are kinda cool.  I mean they are more or less ranged units and
      are made of paper BUT they are a cooler alternative to some of the other ranged
      units that are made of paper.


      But keep in mind if you want to use these units you WILL have to go to your
      profile and equip them to your units pool.  I''m guess this was supposed to
      be expansive with more units as DLC to add and take away but... well you get
      vampire and snake ladies.


      Good for discount... and well those who don''t mind spending 2 bucks either.'
