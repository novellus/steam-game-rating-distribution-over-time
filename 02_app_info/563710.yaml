    review: 'Man, what a let down.


      I really loved the Loops of Zen that was available on Kongregate as a flash
      game but this is not the same.


      First, what they have in common:

      * The mechanics are simple but the interaction between them creates interesting
      puzzles which are fun to solve.


      Now what this does different:

      + It has nicer although unneccessary graphics and provides a soundtrack which
      may just as well be muted because I''d rather listen to something more appealing.

      - The animations are sluggish. Similar levels take far longer to solve because
      of how slowly the tiles turn around.

      - The possible size of the puzzles are far smaller making this basically a dumbed
      down version for people with less perseverance.

      - You can''t really know how far you''ve gotten because the game doesn''t tell
      you, how many puzzles you''ve solved and they also become far more repetitive
      because the size restriction reduces variance.


      This appears like some guys were told to add a skin and make it tablet friendly
      so it can be sold as a premium version of the original but honestly I believe
      the original (which was without any monetization) was much better, so I regret
      paying for this.


      Sadly it''s in flash which isn''t supported by modern browsers anymore.


      Because of this comparison I just can''t recommend it.'
