      \ - Ford, BMW, and Ruf.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIntroduced in 1964, the Ford Mustang\
      \ quickly became one of the company's most-recognizable models, single handedly\
      \ starting the Muscle car revolution that shaped the American car market for\
      \ more than a decade.<br />\r\nAfter the first one million road cars of the\
      \ original Mustang had been build, Ford gave its best-seller an extensive upgrade,\

      \ the now-iconic Fastback body style.<br />\r\nNow, in 2015, the Mustang GT\
      \ is the newest addition to Ford\u2019s iconic range. Powered by a massive 5-liter\
      \ V8 engine and delivering more than 428hp of power and 528 Nm of torque, buyers\
      \ can choose between a full manual and automatic six-speed gearbox, the latter\
      \ coming with genuine shifting paddles \u2013 a first in the long history of\
      \ the Mustang.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBased on the Porsche 911 3.2, the 1987 CTR\
      \ Yellowbird is one of Ruf\u2019s most iconic models that has helped build Ruf's\
      \ reputation for building no-compromise sports cars. The 3.4 liter twin-turbocharged\
      \ flat six engine provided 469hp from two large turbo chargers &amp; intercoolers\
      \ and had been equipped with a new Bosch Motronic as well as an ignition setup\
      \ originally designed for Porsche\u2019s 962 Group C race car. Thanks to extensive\
      \ weight-saving measures such as usage of fiberglass and aluminum, the CTR weighs\
      \ just 1150 kilograms, resulting in a very impressive performance.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nBMW's 2002 Turbo road car made the history books in 1973 by becoming\
      \ Europe's first-ever mass-produced road car powered by a turbocharged engine.\
      \ The 2002 Turbo's two-liter four cylinder engine provided 170hp of power, a\
      \ figure that made the 2002 one of the most powerful cars on the road during\
      \ its time. Unfortunately, the 1974 oil crisis forced an end to the 2002 Turbo's\
      \ production after just one year as gas prices were soaring across the world.\
      \ Only 1672 cars were produced during the model's limited production run, making\
      \ the 2002 Turbo one of BMW's most iconic and most sought-after classics.<br\
      \ />\r\nBuilt to the Super 2000 touring car regulations, the 320TC is BMW's\
      \ weapon of choice for competition in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC)\
      \ and countless national touring car series around the globe. <br />\r\nWeighing\
      \ 1170 kilograms, the car is powered by a 1.6 litreDI-turbo four-cylinder engine\
      \ and a full adjustable six-speed sequential gearbox. Driven by veteran touring\
      \ car aces such as Tom Coronel, Franz Engstler &amp; Stefano D'Aste, the 320TC\
      \ clinched five world championship wins."
