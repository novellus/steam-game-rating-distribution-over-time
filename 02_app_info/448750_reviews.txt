If you like that, it's not terrible - it's at least got some character to it, even if it could have used some proofreading. Gameplay-wise, it's mostly okay, with a fixed party of four characters who aren't very customizable, but with at least some interesting equipment eventually. Monsters can get pretty grindy, running away stops working reliably after the first \"dungeon,\" and the enemies in the second \"dungeon\" with full-party paralysis attacks get a special mention as being able to cause an arbitrary game-over easily when you first arrive. Plus the boss-tier random enemies with 10000 or so life in the last areas of the game, but at least you can run away from those.\n\nI can't really recommend Infinity Saga, but I think the developer doing art and/or maps for a different game would be neat. Or just doing better with the parts they didn't get down right this time, either way.","timestamp_created":1602637114,"timestamp_updated":1602637209,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553305566310882568","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42uOnkvUCdpfepwI="}
