I only had 1 crash in 12 hours of play. its a little rough on the eyes but I can still read things so I guess it's not that bad and perhaps I can tune it when I have a moment. Its only after like 5h of gameplay that I got used to pipboy navigation but finally got the hang of it. I highly recommend the product for the price (25$ CAD).","timestamp_created":1609896886,"timestamp_updated":1609896886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw75/V6vYCfYbwwAI="}
