Yes, the moving parts come in at a reasonable time in the series of puzzles, but that is about the only redeeming feature. Most of the puzzles are not even slightly puzzling, requiring only a few pieces to be moved, and often not all of the rotatable elements. There are also many pieces on each board that serve no purpose, either to confuse or to block.\n\nAnd, as others have mentioned, the Y-axis rotation is inverted, making the viewing confusing and off-putting.\n\nAnd to think the idea had so much potential. For rotations to be repeatable, or to undo when a piece was moved off. To be combined with the board rearrangement of the second version. To fully use all dimensions.\n\nInstead, we get 50 throw-away puzzles undeserving of the name.","timestamp_created":1609177341,"timestamp_updated":1609177341,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xLOc1fYCfvOVvgI="}
