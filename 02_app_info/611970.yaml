    review: "This is the kind of game that gives Early Access titles a bad name.\n\
      \nhttps://youtu.be/UMTMOyiGmpE\n\nTimeToDie has some major issues that I can't\
      \ believe the dev(s) didn't know about when they released their game and priced\
      \ it at $19.99. I've played far better free to play games. I rarely refund games\
      \ but this title will join that very small list of titles.\n\nLets start with\
      \ everyone's favorite topic. Locomotion. We get no options for trackpad or teleport.\
      \ We just get a trackpad locomotion option. My preference lies with trackpad\
      \ locomotion but options always trump being forced into one or the other.\n\n\
      The bigger issue though is the frequent sliding. At times I felt like I was\
      \ on ice. I'd tap to go forward just a bit and slide 10 feet away from where\
      \ I wanted to be. It doesn't make sense with the terrain and is just plain frustrating\
      \ when you're not expecting it.\n\nMoving on from locomotion, the sound was\
      \ either non existent or waaaay off from what it should have been. Background\
      \ music was hit or miss and weapon swings either had no audio cues that you\
      \ landed a hit or a delayed, overly loud, explosive sound.\n\nThe HMD auto-adjusted\
      \ my height to a fixed point even when bending down to pick up a weapon, resulting\
      \ in the world jumping around me and my height drastically changing while playing.\
      \ I imagine for most this could cause serious comfort issues.\n\nGraphically\
      \ the game was just so-so. There have been better and there have been worse.\
      \ I did like the lighting however the visual fidelity of the game didn't match\
      \ the price tag.\n\nI haven't even talked about the two elephants in the room\
      \ yet.\n\nWhat's a key componant of a hack and slash game? The weapons? Yes.\
      \ That's right, the weapons. The things I couldn't pick up roughly 50% of the\
      \ time I tried to play. Whether tapping grip or pressing and holding, certain\
      \ weapons would not slot into my hand. They would fly off into the distance\
      \ like a kernel of popcorn. This alone makes the game pretty close to, if not,\
      \ unplayable. \n\nThe thing that DOES make the game unplayable is that I crashed\
      \ to desktop 3 times in a 30 minute play session.\n\nThis game reeks of a dev\
      \ that either didn't care enough to test his game before putting it out into\
      \ Early Access or a dev that knew exactly what he was doing, hoping he could\
      \ make a few quick bucks by dropping a VR roguelike into a RPG starved community.\
      \ My gut leans toward the latter and I'll be requesting a refund as soon as\
      \ this review gets posted.\n\nI firmly believe games and devs like this are\
      \ the issue with the EA system. I hope you all vote with your wallet on this\
      \ one."
