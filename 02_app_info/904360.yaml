    review: 'cute lil game that gives nice freedom and moral choices leading to new
      outcomes, well abit short, its highly replayable with the different playstyles,
      4 endings and new game+


      some bugs here and there messing with the days, saves and getting stuck on fences
      but nothing that ruined the game


      deftiently a good concept for hopefully a bigger future game where the choices
      and its rewards can be more expanded upon over a longer campaign


      8/10

      give this one a try'
