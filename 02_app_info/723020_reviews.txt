Personally I love procedural games.)\n\nCons:\nUnoptimized (I have a decent PC and sometimes my FPS were above 30 and sometimes under 30.)\nUI (I played with 1920x1080 and the UI was very small and looked odd.)\nPhysics (Furnitures are as light as feathers and flew around everywhere.)\nMouse (The mouse movement was bad. The mouse smoothing is way too high.)\nFirst Person (Too much headbobbing and doesn't feel \"good\".)\nThird Person (In small areas the camera was sometimes in the roof.)\n\n\n\nI wish I could enjoy the game, but in the current state I cant. It's unplayable for me. I hope this feedback is helpfull and I hope I can enjoy this game one day.","timestamp_created":1545440963,"timestamp_updated":1545440963,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569370865821838379","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4m7Xd6ecCdNr3tQE="}
