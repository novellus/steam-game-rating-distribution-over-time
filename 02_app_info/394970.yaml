    review: "Sidescrolling Hotline Miami. With undead.\n\nThis is probably one of\
      \ the most original games I've ever touched in terms of control schemes and\
      \ gameplay. Instead of getting a top-down view, you are instead given a 2D view\
      \ horizontally slicing buildings, displaying enemies on different stories. If\
      \ you're curious why they went with this decision...\n\n[spoiler]Vampires[/spoiler]\
      \ walk on the ceilings.\n\nSuch a simple little gameplay gimmick forces you\
      \ to switch strategies, since you can't take cover from enemies shooting at\
      \ you from the ceiling, and guards up there spot you easily. However, none of\
      \ these guards ever thought to bring a flashlight, so taking out the lights\
      \ is a valid strategy for messing up enemies. \n\nThis game is hard. As in \"\
      I stealth killed 20 enemies and destroyed a safe, then the objective changed\
      \ to 'GET OUT' and about 40 enemies suddenly stormed in through the front door\
      \ and are heading straight in my direction.\" Thankfully, you have the [strike]least[/strike]\
      \ most useful ability to turn into smoke, so long as it's to travel through\
      \ vents. While occasionally lifesaving, its usefulness varies quite dramatically\
      \ depending on the stage layout, which I found frustrating since you can't depend\
      \ on it.  \n\nThe game is also somewhat short, featuring a total of [spoiler]27[/spoiler]\
      \ levels, but these include jarringly well-handled boss battles, a rarity for\
      \ games similar to Hotline Miami. Story is surprisingly compelling, and workshop\
      \ content is available to add more stages and content to the game for those\
      \ interested. Lore is pretty interesting and very in-depth for such a short\
      \ title, very good work on the developers' end - would love to see a sequel,\
      \ especially after seeing their work with Risk of Rain 2. \n\nIf you like hard\
      \ games that keep your heartbeat racing and demand split-second reactions, this\
      \ might be for you - look up some gameplay, and see how you feel about it."
