But there's one thing that never stopped bothering me about it: The hand brake is always on in the tender and there is no way to release it. Clicking on it in the coupling&handbrake management bar doesn't do anything. The Loco still goes pretty well and doesn't lose too much steam or anything when it starts running, but it stalls easily. Is it normal, or is it a bug?","timestamp_created":1552690508,"timestamp_updated":1552690508,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjp7kwekCffWRvQE="}
