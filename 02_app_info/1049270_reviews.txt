It's been a while since I've hid my controller from my friends so they can't see when I press the buttons.\n\n5 fast and fun minigames.\n[list]\n   [*] Hackers: Each player must compete to control a number of computers to open their escape.\n   [*] Cops & Rats: Convict players try to destroy a number of cameras before escaping while the cop(s) try to shoot them. There are clone AI convicts so that the cop(s) will have to pay attention and guess which prisoner is the player(s).\n   [*] Gang Wars: Each player must control slums to spawn AI gang members that attack the other player(s) and their gangs. Last player alive wins.\n   [*] Prison Break: AI convicts and player convicts are lined up in a \"Simon Says\" fashion and must reach the end before other players shoot them.\n   [*] Watch Towers: Same as Gang Wars, but no one is allowed to directly fight each other, and the slums are sniper towers which aim randomly. Players can control towers and control when they fire to kill other players and their gang members.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1] The Cons [/h1]\n\nAt first the game can be a little confusing as to what you're suppose to do for each minigame. Although this doesn't affect experienced players, it can be a small issue when getting started.\n\nThe game is quite simple, but I wouldn't necessarily call that a con, just something to keep in mind before you buy the game.\n\n\n[h1] The Bugs [/h1]\n\nThe first bug being that many of the settings that you can adjust for each of the minigames are bugged. The settings for the minigame \"gang wars\" worked properly (for example AI convict numbers, convict speed, slum spawn/capture delays), but the minigame settings for the other four minigames all are titled: \"AI convicts\", and sometimes the number showing you the amount didn't change at all when adjusted, leading to an annoying experience of adjusting the settings without knowing what will happen, and then testing the minigame to see what changed. It is such a simple-to-fix bug, but it breaks a fun part about the game.\n\n\n[h1] Last Thoughts [/h1]\n\n[b] This game has a lot of potential [/b]\nBut until they change these small bugs, I must not recommend this game. I hope the company develops this game more because I would be more than happy to adjust the minigames and play new minigames that they may come out with.","timestamp_created":1594798301,"timestamp_updated":1594798301,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49NvYqPMCc46zlQI="}
