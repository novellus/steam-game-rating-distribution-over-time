It's fairly bare-bones and designed to be played through in one sitting or a few short sittings (I think this would do good on mobile). It's almost too bare-bones come to think of it, it could've benefited by a few extra systems in the gameplay of it, perhaps a ship upgrade system that forces you to choose between uses for your repair parts or the like. Either way though for the low price that it is, i'd say it's worth it.","timestamp_created":1588117932,"timestamp_updated":1588117932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/pDN4fECeMGYhAI="}
