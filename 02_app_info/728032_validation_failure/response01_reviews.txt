The missions are immersive and the voiceovers are authentic. It's set up so you have to do everything you would in free-flight ie. cold-start, radio frequencies etc... but the voiceover for your pilot does all the talking, so it's easy for beginners and a good way to learn. The routes are scenic and the weather and the way you fly each leg is different so it's a bit of everything. Worth every miserly NZD I spent on it.","timestamp_created":1522570572,"timestamp_updated":1522570617,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548615336418151855","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ivyRwOICdteUnQE="}
