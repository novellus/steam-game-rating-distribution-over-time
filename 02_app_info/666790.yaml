    short_description: Knossos is a game about mazes, offering true 3D mazes, not
      just 2D ones with 3D graphics. You can design your own mazes to share with others,
      or play in randomly generated ones. Mazes can be 2D, 3D, and even 4 dimensional
      or higher.

    review: "[h1]Enter the labyrinth.[/h1]\n\n[b]TL DR:[/b] You should try this if\
      \ you like mazes. It is a completely new experience. Otherwise, wait for a discount,\
      \ because you won't last long,\n\nHave you ever tried to understand 4-th dimension?\
      \ Knossos is a game that beat all the 2-D thiniking of you. Basically, it is\
      \ a game where you can create 3-dimensional maze with 3 axises: 2x2x2, for example,\
      \ will make you 8 rooms cube with max of 7 steps to the exit. In 5x5x5 version\
      \ you should get from (1;1;1) to (5;5;5) (125 rooms total). \nWhen you replicate\
      \ your 3-D cube and point rooms that have kinda portals that connect the same\
      \ places in different cubes, for example, (2;1;2)[1] and (2;1;2)[2]. Which means\
      \ you've just added fourth axis to your maze. You can see markers for that portals\
      \ from a distance, so your goal now is to find exact portal in [n-1] cube, that\
      \ bring you to correct isolated 3-d net of rooms in the [n] cube that have an\
      \ exit in it.\nIf that story amazed you more than scared, this game is for you.\n\
      \n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[b]+[/b] Good basic 3-d maze creator\n[b]+[/b] Challenging difficulty\
      \ \n[b]+[/b] Rich variety of settings\n[b]+[/b] System of clues\n[b]+[/b] Bach's\
      \ music\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[b]-[/b] Terrible controls with no gravity (so if you\
      \ are not accurate with axises, you will get lost in 3 dimensions)\n[b]-[/b]\
      \ Bad sound of walking\n[b]-[/b] Brain-pain"
