Probably got at least 8-10 hours on it then and just saw it on steam and bought it yesterday. Its a throw back to god games like Black & White back in the day. Very fun and well worth the price point if you like sim building.","timestamp_created":1609775180,"timestamp_updated":1609775180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwjv2E5/YCeq22wAI="}
