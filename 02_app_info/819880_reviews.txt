It is in a very early state but has potential I feel. I'm going to give it a thumbs up because it could develop into something very good with a few tweaks.\nThey need to rotate the shield relative to the controller so it is like holding an actual shield. Right now it is 90 degrees off.\nIt needs haptics. There is no controller reaction to hitting a ball. That is just unsettling.\nSeems to play music from YouTube only right now. I think playing local files should be a given.\nNeeds more environments and more levels. I'm a pretty experienced Audioshield player and it was strangely hard to play which is weird. \nThe price is certainly fair for the current version. Hopefully they will continue to develop it into a good Audioshield competitor.","timestamp_created":1522295160,"timestamp_updated":1522295160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458370238542556763","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwzJf3t+ICd5LvnAE="}
