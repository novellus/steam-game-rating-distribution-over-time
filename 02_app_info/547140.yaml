      /><br><br>Owari is a variant of Mancala where players strategically attempt
      to capture stones from their opponent''s row.<h2 class="bb_tag">Easy to learn,
      hard to master</h2><br>Owari is a very simple game at it''s core: grab the stones
      in a pit, sow them around the board. Landing in a pit with 2 or 3 will result
      in some points. First to 25 points, wins. The game includes a tutorial to get
      you through the basics.<h2 class="bb_tag">Practice makes perfect</h2><br>Owari
      will come with 3 levels of AI difficulty that should offer up different levels
      of challenge to the player. The easy AI will greedily attempt to capture all
      that it can without much regard to defense, while the medium AI is a little
      more careful about leaving itself open. Finally, the hard AI will attempt to
      think one step ahead in order to defeat the more advanced players.<br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Two is better than one</h2><br>Be it local or online, Owari
      will allow you to play with a friend (or stranger) with it''s different multiplayer
      modes. If you''re playing online, you can choose from hosting a private lobby
      for a friend, or waiting/joining a match in the public lobby.<h2 class="bb_tag">Extra
      Info</h2><br>Owari was heavily inspired by the DOS game &quot;Wari: The Ancient
      Game of Africa&quot;, redone with a modern aesthetic. It is meant to be a very
      simple, play-it-during-your-break sort of game. Special thanks to Rachel Franco
      and Marius Ioan for their help in testing and debugging.'
