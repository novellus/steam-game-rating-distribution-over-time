    about_the_game: "Roman territorial expansion after the Punic Wars has led to major\
      \ political, economic and social changes. Among one of the results of the victorious\
      \ conquests, there is a huge influx of slaves into Italy which creates long\
      \ term dramatic consequences. This large mass of costless manpower quickly leads\
      \ poor Roman free workers to misery, inactivity and anger. This proletariat\
      \ will be the base on which ambitious and demagogic politicians will play, offering\
      \ 'bread and games', to make them their clients against the Senate.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nAs for the thousands of slaves, they replace the former free workers\
      \ as laborers for all the hardest tasks, in the mines, careers and Latifundias,\
      \ the large estates of the rich Roman citizens, usually in Southern Italy and\
      \ Sicily. Whereas a few slaves, usually employed at home, could become freedmen\
      \ after earning their liberty from their masters, the great majority could envision\
      \ no hope and were badly treated. <br />\r\nIn 133 and 101 BC, two revolts had\
      \ degenerated in large servile wars in Sicily, and took years to be crushed.\
      \ But in 73BC, no one could envision that the small light ignited by the escape\
      \ of a few Capuan gladiators would turn all of Italy aflame...<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nFrom the ludus (gladiator school) of a so-called Lentulus Batiatus in\
      \ Capua, the Thracian Spartacus leads his fellow men into escape, carrying brands\
      \ with which they put the local militia to flight. <br />\r\nHaving taken refuge\
      \ on the slope of the Vesuvius, they were besieged there by the troops of Praetor\
      \ Glaber. Using wild vine plants to cross the cliffs, the gladiators take their\
      \ opponent by surprise and send them routing. Upon hearing the news, thousands\
      \ of slaves, shepherds and poor people join Spartacus' ranks.<br />\r\nThis\
      \ was the start of an epic that would see Rome tremble for three year, and the\
      \ full mobilization of all the forces of the republic was required in the end\
      \ to crush that mortal peril!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter having set Italy ablaze,\
      \ the slaves armies were finally beaten by the wealthy and ambitious Crassus,\
      \ at the cost of thousands of deaths and executions. Spartacus will fall among\
      \ his breathens in the midst of a battle, and his body will never be found.\
      \ Pompeius, coming back from Hispania, will crush the last band in Northern\
      \ Italy and will claim the whole glory of the wars which had nevertheless been\
      \ won by Crassus."
