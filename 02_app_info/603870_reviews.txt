Unfortunately, I encountered several bugs that make the game unplayable and my post in the forums about it went unanswered, which is why I can't recommend this game for anyone.\n\nThe specific bugs I had to deal with are listed below, although I should note that I'm running Windows 10 on dual monitors, one 4K and one 1080p.\n\n[list][*] [b]Saves won't actually save:[/b] I've typed in the save name, pressed \"Save\" but then nothing shows up, so I'm unable to save/load.\n\n[*][b]Windowed mode doesn't work:[/b] When playing in windowed mode, the game loads up but fails to recognize my mouse. I can't click on anything and the in-game mouse cursor doesn't work at all.\n\n[*][b]Fullscreen mode resizes my windows:[/b] I can play the game in fullscreen mode, but when I quit it momentarily disables my second monitor, changes the screen resolution on my main monitor, and consequently resizes all of my windows (Steam, Chrome, Discord, etc etc). \n[/list]\n\nAt this point I don't think the devs are pushing any more fixes for the game, which is a shame because I really wanted to be able to play it. If they ever do push a patch that enables me to actually play, I'll come back and change my review.","timestamp_created":1608341569,"timestamp_updated":1608344209,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45qCyvPYCfp2puwI="}
