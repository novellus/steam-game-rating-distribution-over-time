Not something bad, though. I like Yousei's art style.\n\nA little bit disappointed this game still not finish, though. I didnt read carefully and I thought it was a trilogy when purchasing and now I dont know when will the fourth part will come... I hope it will done soon.\n\nAs for the game Yousei itself, it was a fun play. More endings to approach was fun, and the story just make you want to know more. Also you know, even though I find it fun to solve the killer mystery, I wouldn't mind a title with no murder and more of approaching the main story itself. I just hope I will see this series come to end before I forget everything.","timestamp_created":1584813554,"timestamp_updated":1584813554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525139689445495605","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlfeP//ACfbLq+QE="}
