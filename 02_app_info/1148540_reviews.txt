The game was developed by Big Up Studio and published by 8 Floor Games.\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are no game difficulty modes to choose from. Each puzzle has its own difficulty.\n\nThis is a logic puzzle game, but it is also known as the following: Picross; Sudoku; Nonograms; Paint by Numbers and Griddlers.\n\nThere are two game modes: Adventure and Training. The adventure mode contains six chapters with  hundred twenty different logic puzzles to solve. The training mode is the tutorial levels.\n\nThere are eighteen different achievements to unlock from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game only.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is moderately high. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1602087717,"timestamp_updated":1602087717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57558053731918335","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iNH3gfUCdcu4pgI="}
