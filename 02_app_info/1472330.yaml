    about_the_game: "Originally released in 1985 by Ocean Software, N.O.M.A.D. pushed\
      \ the boundaries of what the 8-bit computers of the day could achieve with both\
      \ their graphics and their gameplay. This remastered version by Purple Viking\
      \ is faithful to the original, offering retro fans and casual gamers alike a\
      \ chance to experience the same thrill as the first generation of players had\
      \ back in the day. This modern version also includes a new inertia-based system\
      \ which can be selected in the settings menu. Good luck N.O.M.A.D. 471 (Nemesis\
      \ Organisation Mobile Attack Droid)!!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">According to the original\
      \ instructions:</h2><br><strong>The Game</strong><br><br>Out in the vastness\
      \ of space lies the heart of an Intergalactic Criminal Network, TALOS, a man-made\
      \ asteroid slowly spinning through the void, spreading its evil through the\
      \ Universe. At the head of this seemingly unstoppable force sits one man, the\
      \ unspeakably vile Cyrus T. Gross.<br><br>A name spoken only in whispered voices,\
      \ Gross is the embodiment of all that is criminal. Avoiding any attempt to curtail\
      \ his ever-spreading empire, he has crushed all opposition and seems invincible,\
      \ ruling his depraved Zealots with a fist of iron and a heart of ice.<br><br>In\
      \ a last-ditch attempt, the rulers of the Free Worlds have called in the Nemesis\
      \ organisation, a hardened cadre of humanoid and robotic freebooters who have\
      \ assigned N.O.M.A.D. 471 (Nemesis Organisation Mobile Attack Droid) to penetrate\
      \ Gross\u2019s heavily armed home-world and destroy this vile despot once and\
      \ for all.<br><br>Your mission is to guide N.O.M.A.D. through the four sections\
      \ of Capital City towards Gross's inner sanctum. You arrive at the spaceport\
      \ and must then progress through the slums, into the city centre and penetrate\
      \ the HQ; &quot;Dun Dentin', before you reach his personal quarters for the\
      \ final deadly confrontation. Many dangers await you in all sections of Capital\
      \ City. In true cowardly style, Gross has installed magnotrons, heat-seeking\
      \ missiles, and an infinity of equally deadly obstacles, all of which must be\
      \ confronted and conquered.<br><br><strong>Playing Features</strong><br><br>Inertia\
      \ - Your droid will not stop instantly if you cease acceleration but will slowly\
      \ decelerate. If you apply the 'brakes' the deceleration will obviously be greater.\
      \ However it is also possible to slow down by turning 180 degrees and then applying\
      \ acceleration. (This is useful for shooting things that are chasing you.)<br><br>Magnetic\
      \ Walls - Cyrus has placed large banks of Magnetrons along some of the city\
      \ walls. When active these devices will attract N.O.M.A.D.'s metallic armour,\
      \ luring him towards the guns and slowing him down.<br><br>Homing missiles -\
      \ These appear from silos in the surface of the Asteroid and once targeted are\
      \ difficult to lose.<br><br>Artillery - The whole Asteroid is heavily fortified\
      \ and Cyrus has some of the most efficient heat guns in the known Universe.\
      \ Even to be caught in the blast from one of these shells is instant death.<br>Robothugs\
      \ - Cyrus has a whole planet dedicated to producing his personal protectors,\
      \ the Robothugs. These delightful examples of the roboticist's art are programmed\
      \ to make a suicide run at anything or anyone who looks as if they may be even\
      \ thinking about attacking their master.<br><br>Gateways and Switches - The\
      \ various sections of the Asteroid have many gateways to partition them. These\
      \ can be opened and closed by brushing past the switches on the side walls.\
      \ However because of the appalling maintenance droids, pushing a switch may\
      \ not necessarily open the door that it should!"
