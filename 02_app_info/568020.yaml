    review: A short visual novel. Personally i didnt mind the length of it. Key features
      of this game noted, the adaption for people who are visually impaired was an
      interesting feature but the key part of this VN that i was most fond of was
      not only does the story touch one physical impairment, but mental impairment
      also and how both can be equally damaging on a relationship if not nurtured
      right. Did notice a couple of errors in grammar but not enough to take away
      the enjoyment. Insightful. Thanks again Michaela
