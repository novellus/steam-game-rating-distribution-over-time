    review: "Pretty good game, I liked it a lot.\n+The atmosphere is really good with\
      \ lots of tension without relying on lame jump scare\n+The story is interesting\
      \ even if only delivered through notes\n+Nice graphics\n\n-Why would you need\
      \ to wait to take a picture when you pull out the camera? \n-Couple of glitches\
      \ like some attacks not working or the magitama dissapearing from the infentory\
      \ even tho I didn't use it). Understandable since it's an indie game but it's\
      \ still a problem. No crashes or soft locking bugs tho.\n\nSolid game for a\
      \ very cheap price, totally worth it."
