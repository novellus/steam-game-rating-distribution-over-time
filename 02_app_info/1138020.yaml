      \ and fierce. It can parasitize and control every weapon or defense component\

      \ cores is to summon 12 sniper rifles to shoot your opponents.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nAs a new comer we recommend you begin from first level as weapons are\

      \ menu to have 5 rounds game with all the mechanism."
