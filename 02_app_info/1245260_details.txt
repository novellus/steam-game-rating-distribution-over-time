I’m not a World War II guy by any stretch, but watching Clint Eastwood’s Letters from Iwo Jima (with the superb Ken Watanabe as Kuribayashi) made me jump at this review. Some 21 hours of gaming later, I am glad I did. Easy to learn, easier to play, tough to master and deadly accurate, you will understand why Marine Corps General Holland Smith said:  &quot;I don't know who he is, but the Japanese General running this show is one smart bastard.&quot;”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.wargamer.com\/reviews\/battle-for-iwo-jima\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >wargamer<\/a><br><br>“.. this is a nice one to add to your collection whether you are an experienced wargamer or someone looking for an entry point into the genre.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.awargamersneedfulthings.co.uk\/2020\/03\/battle-for-iwo-jima.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >a wargamers needful things<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1245260\/header.jpg?t=1590015939","website":"http:\/\/www.yobowargames.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br><\/li><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7, 8, 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel i5<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 2 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Anything in last 5 years<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 250 MB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> Any<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br><\/li><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel i5<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 8 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Anything in last 5 years<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 500 MB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> Any<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br><\/li><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> OS X 10.0<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Core i5<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Anything in last 5 years<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 300 MB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> Any<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br><\/li><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> OS X 10.0<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Core i5<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Anything in last 5 years<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 300 MB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> Any<\/li><\/ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>"},"developers":["Yobowargames"],"publishers":["Yobowargames"],"price_overview":{"currency":"USD","initial":1299,"final":1299,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"$12.99"},"packages":[432132],"package_groups":[{"name":"default","title":"Buy Battle for Iwo Jima","description":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","save_text":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","subs":[{"packageid":432132,"percent_savings_text":" ","percent_savings":0,"option_text":"Iwo Jima -
