In addition, you can unlock more characters over time. The controls feel a bit clumsy at first, and it takes some time to get used to. If you can overlook the fact that the title is not a graphics bomb, you can look forward to a solid arcade racer with fun gameplay elements. Fans of the old Moto Racer parts should definitely try Moto Racer 4, as the game is not offered at full price either.","timestamp_created":1609779219,"timestamp_updated":1609779219,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o7GU5/YCdNe4wAI="}
