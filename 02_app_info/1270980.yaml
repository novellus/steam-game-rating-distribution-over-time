    about_the_game: Rise Of  Three Kingdoms is a Three Kingdoms history simulation
      strategy game. To make the product more realistic, we have browsed Records of
      the Three Kingdoms, Book of Later Han, ZiZhiTongJian and The spring and Autumn
      period of Emperor Xian. We also sort out material with eight hundred thousand
      words as the reference resources for the game design. During the period of study
      the details of Three Kingdoms, we have found many interesting facts. For example,
      Liubei was actually a man with nor beard; Jianggan, who stole the books was
      a handsome guy; the mother of Zhanglu had secret relationship with Liuzhang's
      father, who was the enemy of the former one... As we designed the game, we tried
      to put as much details as possible into the game and provide you a more realistic
      Three Kingdoms world.<br>As a lord of a certain territory, you will appoint
      your interior officers to search and visit the celebrities and input them to
      the generals list of Three Kingdoms. You can use different arrays and the advantages
      of the terrain against enemies with more soldiers than you. Military and strategical
      movement will be launched on the map. Welcome to prosper the Han Dynasty!<br><br><br><u>The
      game is in the stage of preemptive experience, and we will continually fix bugs
      and optimize the details. We will also add up many new contents and game plays,
      which will be updated on Steam. If you have any problem during the period of
      your playing, or if you have any suggestion and opinion, please tell us . We
      will provide you with better game experience and fun!</u><br><br><br><img src="https://media.st.dl.pinyuncloud.com/steam/apps/1270980/extras/touxiang-nan.gif?t=1607665205"
