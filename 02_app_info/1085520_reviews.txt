It feels like developers just shit on my face. Guys, do you even saw the keyboard? 'E' to accelerate, 'Z' to brake, 'D' to turn right and 'X' to turn left - are you f****ng serious? And you know what is funny? It's impossible to switch the controls to arrows keys because there is action on it that you can't change! \n\nOptimization is pretty bad (cyberpunk on my pc has more FPS) and VFX turns image into mess.\nThe only one thing i like in this game - is how the tracks looks.  But that's it. It's almoust impossible to ride on it - it feels like shit. Most of the time you find yourself in mid-air, and just look how you falling down - this is not interesting. But yeah, when the wheels touching the ground it still fells like shit too. \n\nEven with 99.9% discount it doesn't worth it.","timestamp_created":1609792843,"timestamp_updated":1609792843,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z63I5/YCdq/AwAI="}
