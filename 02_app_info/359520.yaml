    review: "2019 Update\nBecause of a change in the contents of this DLC I cant tell\
      \ you what the new content is like. \nHowever, it looks like as if the new gun\
      \ gets a similar performance boost in its steam version.\nBack in the days I\
      \ made the mistake to buy this package.  It was a mistake because it turned\
      \ out that the weapons were easy to research. As you progress with your level,\
      \ you will get stronger guns for free. Sure you get a 25% credit bonus by using\
      \ the gun but whats the point if you are not competetive on the high levels?\
      \ \n------------------------------------------------------------------\noriginal\
      \ 2015 review:\n\nDont expect this DLC (just like the other 2 DLC) to enrich\
      \ your game experience! All weapons in this package are effectively available\
      \ for free in the game. They can be purchased with silver, a currency generated\
      \ by your play activity. The only  difference featured with this package that\
      \ is worth to mention is the reload speed, which is marginal. (10% faster)\n\
      I will not review the weapons that are in the package - at least not as the\
      \ game is still in the beta phase and weapon characteristics may still be changed.\n\
      \nWhy do I still recommend this package?  Vostok Games, the developer of Survarium,\
      \ in  my opinion established a premium weapon  sales model that is not pay2win.\
      \  What you basically do here by purchasing of one of these DLCs is crowdfunding.\
      \  Survarium is the spiritual successor of the Stalker series and a good number\
      \ of  its former developers now work on Survarium. Because Stalker was a fantastic\
      \ game, It means a lot to me to support these people\xB4s future.\n\nWe can\
      \ not expect Vostok Games (an indie developer) to create a triple-A title quality-like\
      \  MMO survival shooter with the little resources they have.  Thats why it gives\
      \ me a good feeling to support them now.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
      Please leave me a comment in case that you didnt like something about the review\
      \ so i can improve it."
