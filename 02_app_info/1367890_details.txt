{"1367890":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"mod","name":"Portal: Crossover","steam_appid":1367890,"required_age":0,"is_free":true,"detailed_description":"When most people think of crossover games, they imagine 2 or more characters from different franchises coming together in some way (to team up against a villain, tell a story, fight each other, etc.). And the fans of each franchise are introduced to the other, benefiting both parties. However...... that's not what this game is. I have a very different &quot;cross over&quot; in mind, and it is not like anything else in existence. The story of this mod will be 100% non-fiction, covering nearly every facet of human existence. Do not think this to be a silly little joke intended for a few laughs, for this crossover is one of science, math, history, philosophy, technology, and more, with the ultimate goal of not only discovering the purpose of life, but creating the very format needed to explain it. I actually planned on writing this story as a book, but it proved to be far too limiting for what I have in mind. The context added through visuals, sound, 3D environments, and puzzles allows a new type of context to communicate the story through. And since I've been designing Portal 2 maps since 2012, this was just the most logical route to take.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDespite everything listed above (and some skepticism I've been met with), yes, this will be a 100% real, legit, serious Portal 2 mod complete with real puzzles and a complex story with many plot twists. Having good puzzles is actually crucial to the plot, for the story itself revolves around human nature and examining why people like playing games so much. There are many philosophical and scientific reasons for this, but I hope to explain it in a way that hasn't been done yet, a way that provides more &quot;impact&quot;, if you will. It will be the first game ever about explaining why you like or dislike the game you're playing, whilst providing examples, basically being the most meta game ever (well, other than Stanley Parable, except this is an actual game lol). Also, the entire story will be told within a mathematical framework. Literally, the mathematical ordering of the maps has been precisely plotted such that the visuals and story foreshadow later plot twists in a future map when added or multiplied a certain way, which resurface and converge in different ways as higher numbers contain more multiples. And yet, the story is coherent and chronological from beginning to end. That probably sounds bizarre, maybe even impossible, but it will only make sense when you see for yourself. I'm not kidding when I say this thing is absurdly complicated. :P<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe story covers lots of world history, such as ancient Egypt, Rome, Greece, Israel, and Europe (things relevant to the history of science, technology and entertainment) It also covers various modern cultures in the world today, including Japan and Africa, for purposes that you'll just have to play to find out. I do reference a lot of movies and games throughout this mod, but it is always in context of the larger story and doesn't extend beyond simple factual information, such as release dates and shared directors\/ composers\/ actors (another way in which the math correlates across maps). And pretty much 99% of jokes and references all have to do with the fact so many movies have portals in them, because this is, after all, PORTAL Crossover ;) It's literally just things like &quot;hey look, this movie has a portal in it!&quot; I highly doubt anyone could find any real copyright issues with it. I have carefully considered the laws of fair use, and made sure not to include anything that could be considered infringement. Simply put, there is no copyright on movie titles and facts, so I can talk ABOUT them all I want. Besides that, the movies I cover have already had their content used in FAR more egregious ways by Youtubers without any problems whatsoever, so I don't see why it should be an issue for me just because the medium is different. This is literally just a documentary ABOUT the history of technology, art, and entertainment, which these movies just happen to be a part of. It's not my fault your movie is part of reality and the factual historical canon of humanity....<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTo summarize, here's this mod in a nutshell: 26 chapters, 85 maps, very hard puzzles, complex story, explain the purpose of life in one sentence, and introduce a new solution to climate change. Oh wait, did I not explain that last part? Well, it's gonna be the grand finale of the story, so i don't wanna spoil too much; but let's just that the story involves documenting the history of technological advancement up to present day, as well as a bit into the future, ending with delivering a new invention idea to the world that could solve the problems of climate change. Look forward to it. ;)","about_the_game":"When most people think of crossover games, they imagine 2 or more characters from different franchises coming together in some way (to team up against a villain, tell a story, fight each other, etc.).
