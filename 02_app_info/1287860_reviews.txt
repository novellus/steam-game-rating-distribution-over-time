The most succinct way of describing the experience is \"short and sweet\". I completed essentially everything I wanted to in approximately 5 hours, which is about the same for everyone else, but at the price point I would say that it is well worth it. The absolute strongest point in the game's favor is the world building and lore. I'm always on the lookout for new IP, and this game is refreshing in how they tackle traditional fantasy tropes.\n\n8/10, would definitely recommend.","timestamp_created":1597604387,"timestamp_updated":1597604387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i4up/PMCfqPxmwI="}
