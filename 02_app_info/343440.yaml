      \ /><br>We at M2H love games with a lot of freedom. It\u2019s no surprise that\
      \ this is the very core of Crash Drive 2. Drive around freely and explore the\

      \ /><br>When starting a game of Crash Drive 2 you will be automatically matched\
      \ while playing. This guarantees populated matches and saving you the hassle\
      \ of finding an active match. All game \u201Crooms\u201D reserve extra friend\
      \ slots (10 players per game) so that your friends can ALWAYS join you through\
      \ the Steam friend join feature.<br><br>Whenever an online connection is not\

      \ /><br>Ready for a car RPG leveling system that we\u2019ve gone crazy?!<br>Every\
      \ car has four statistics: top speed, nitro, acceleration and grip. By using\
      \ nitro, you increase this car\u2019s nitro capacity, by driving at top speed\
      \ you increase your top speed...you get the drift? When a car has all of it\u2019\
      s four statistics raised to 10/10, you will gain an overall level which allows\
      \ you to buy a new car and earns you prestige on the in-game scoreboard and\
      \ the Steam leaderboard.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/343440/extras/cd2store_tank.png?t=1599138737\"\
      \ /><br>Since the tank is such a popular vehicle in the main game modes, we\
      \ decided to dedicate one entire game mode to it. In CD2: Tank Battles you choose\
      \ one of five unique tanks and strive to dominate the arena. Shoot or bump opponents\
      \ off this sky arena to score points, extra points are awarded for special achievements\
      \ such as multi kills, revenge, air shots and so on.<br>When playing this game\
      \ mode offline, bots(A.I.) will fill the opponent slots. This way the singleplayer\
      \ is also fully playable.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/343440/extras/Cd2store_Steam.png?t=1599138737\"\

      \ The steam version does not have advertisements nor &quot;in-app&quot; purchases<br></li><li>\
      \ A big starting cash boost of 200,000 extra cash (would\u2019ve cost over $5\
      \ in the original tablet game)<br></li><li> Optimized for PC, Mac and Linux;\
      \ better graphics, performance and controller support<br></li><li> Further fixes\
      \ and small tweaks to the game<br></li><li> Steam integration (including friend\

    review: 'a great flash game, for 50 cents and 2 copies is more than worth it


      doesn''t have many players past the first stage and tank battles is just broken,
      still very fun!
