You will have to rely on many different aspects of ruling your state, including developing infrastucture, maintaining (hopefully!) friendly diplomatic ties with the tribes living outside your kingdom, warfare, and [strike]bullying[/strike] politely but firmly requesting fancy new titles from the Emperor.\n\nIt is quite involved, and will take some time to play, but it's an incredibly rewarding experience to play through an asymmetrical yet finely balanced game such as this.\n\nThe quality of this DLC is incredible with 3D models replacing some of the tokens from the physical game, as well as a very satisfying array of sounds when certain kinds of tokens are flipped over.\n\nAnd finally, if you are a fan of the Three Kingdoms era (be it through Dynasty Warriors, the classic novel, or anything in between), you must try this game. But it is in no way necessary to know anything about this to enjoy the game.\n\nIf you're looking to try this game out or want to learn it, feel free to get in contact. I am always happy to get this to the (virtual) table and share in the experience!\nAdditionally, join the [url=https://discord.gg/dKkz2WE]Discord group dedicated to players of this very game[/url].","timestamp_created":1543286673,"timestamp_updated":1586339884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.691979885101318359","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvrXOrPECcuXUswE="}
