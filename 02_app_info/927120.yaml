    review: "****DOWNLOAD DEMO FIRST DO NOT BUY GAME WITHOUT PLAYING DEMO FRIST OR\
      \ THE DEMO WILL NOT RUN!!!\n\nfeatures incomplete, duh it is early access. Very\
      \ little detail between the space worlds of the single player and muliplayer.\
      \ I saw a floating turd and about died in laughing. This game is lovely show\
      \ of the GAME ENGINE itself not the game. The game menu is very self explained,\
      \ but it is more of a logical lay out than artistic pretty buttons, (normal\
      \ for early access but way more games with early access with more feature complete\
      \ at similar pricing). Lay out of Modes are very text file look than an option\
      \ of choice. Most people would understand, 10 bucks, I would like at least ONE\
      \ complete level or mode of some type. \n\n****(this is normal in beta games)****Another\
      \ problem, once I paid for the main video game, demo, the demo will not run\
      \ once you installed the normal game. Actually, no option to actually play the\
      \ demo without completely uninstalling the game, making a new account. I seen\
      \ more complete early access games, again this game is sample of the engine\
      \ behind it. That is something, yet, most of these features have been seen being\
      \ used in other game engines by using plug ins already created by community\
      \ of gamers and programmers alike. \n\nThe fact I am being asked for 9.99 for\
      \ this game, is false, I am paying 9.99 for an engine software being built.\
      \ I cannot recommend the game but I can with the engine behind it, its game\
      \ demo of future game engine, which we seen games come out amazing from that\
      \ even if they were over done due to the publishers example halo below. As a\
      \ game this is not worthy 10 buck game. the engine is worth it, that is why\
      \ I am recommending the game, is for the engine to be more complete. \n\nIf\
      \ you read this review, have no bloody idea how much work it is to lay out engine\
      \ from the ground up, realize, making a new software with tools for people to\
      \ use is very hard. Why not Unity... well seems like the makers have something\
      \ to prove.\n\nBeing around many studios from AAA to indie in my personal life\
      \ and business life. I do not doubt this engine along with this game will be\
      \ amazing and complete, it will be many more years before we see something like\
      \ NO MAN SKY, at least when its complete, it will not release in failure like\
      \ NO MAN SKY. You see what you get from this game and the photos. The team isn't\
      \ trying to hide how the game is. \n\nGood example of a Game Demo turn into\
      \ bad ass game was HALO, we knew back then the studio was smaller with a big\
      \ publisher. HALO was a demo for the xbox hardware and engine. This game, I\
      \ feel can be better from the start, by avoiding the AAA publishing motto of\
      \ business and keeping to the indie way. I recommend the game for the game engine\
      \ behind it, like I said HALO was my favorite game it was basically slap together\
      \ demo by AAA publisher over hyped, this game Quantum Covenant can be better\
      \ than HALO or NO MAN SKY, don't need the hype. Also the fact it will have its\
      \ own engine, it will be up there with the Doom for game engine hall of fame\
      \ in my personal eyes which got me to start gaming was the engine. I would love\
      \ another engine for my son to be able to use without some charge behind it\
      \ with multi ways of connecting the pieces together."
