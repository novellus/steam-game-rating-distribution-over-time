I do NOT recommend this! I can't find any reason why this should be an innovative concept in education? It is a very simple Jump 'n Run game with worst controls, which are not customizable or with the support of common controllers.  But it's not only simple, du to the terrible controls, precise jumps are nearly impossible. And these are often at the end of a level, when you die you have to do the whole boring level again... ðŸ¤¬\n\nFrom time to time you have to answer some simple questions to turn off some laser beams or so. Not really educational, I think. For this money, you can buy a beginners book about programming and create the game yourself - for example with scratch or python. Obviously in 1 hour with a book you can learn a lot more about the fundamentals of computer programming than with this game - and enjoy your favourite games afterwards. ðŸ•¹\n\nThe only good thing on this \"game\" is the cute design of the bunny robot.\n\nDear developers, I'm looking forward that you bring updates to turn this into the promised educational gem. \nMaybe you can let the player find code-lines hidden in the world and you can use them to learn new functions like jumping, shooting (shooting upwards to destroy these annoying cameras that'll attack you), create bridges, control enemies or to automate more stuff.\n\nI will follow this game and hope the best for this game - and if it is what it should be, than it will receive my best rating!!!\nGood Luck!","timestamp_created":1597680927,"timestamp_updated":1597680927,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.600829422473907471","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1597930784,"developer_response":"Thank you so much for your review. We have taken everything you said into consideration and will be using it to improve our game in the future. We are a small team so we'll start by fixing the things we can immediately. We hope to improve the game further to the level where you would be satisfied with in the future.\n\nThank you once again"}],"cursor":"AoJ4kYjN/vMCfrWHnAI="}
