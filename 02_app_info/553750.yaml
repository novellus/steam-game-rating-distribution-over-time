    about_the_game: Steve Bellafiore (played by Cameron Palatas) is a very special
      kid. A bright, religiously devout teen that yearns to become a football starter
      and works twice as hard as his high school peers to accomplish that goal. Steve's
      work ethic and kindness radiate through his life. Currently upset by his parents'
      seeming estrangement, Steve is even more disturbed by the message of hatred
      and intolerance espoused by Franklin Baumann (played by Jon Gries), a fanatically
      Christian candidate for Congress. Steve wants to make the point that Baumann's
      exclusionary and fear-based doctrine has very little to do with his Christian
      perception of Christ's teachings. In retaliation, Steve announces his own candidacy
      for Congress. What begins as a tiny movement soon grows into a phenomenon, as
      people throughout the area embrace Steve and his Faith Crusade, whose &quot;Pass
      the Light&quot; campaign unites the community as never before.
