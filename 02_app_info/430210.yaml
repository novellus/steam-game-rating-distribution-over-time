      first-person superhero game, and save Earth from an alien invasion. Be careful
      though - you are so powerful you can destroy entire skyscrapers (unintentionally)
      when you miss your otherworldly target...

    review: 'I think this is a great game, but the VR controls are awful. The blasts
      come out of your camera, not your hands, making aiming quite awkward. You also
      can''t shoot directly below yourself, instead flinging your blasts at an odd
      angle. The flying is also strange in VR, but I didn''t really give myself a
      chance to get used to it because the VR experience is terrible.


      Not Recommended for VR

      Recommended for casual play'
