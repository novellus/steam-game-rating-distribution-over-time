Even stopping briefly to write up this review, I'm kinda wanting to just jump back in and retry beaten stages to Gold Star them. This is clearly made by someone who knows his way around old-school arcadey game design. Thankfully you don't actually have to put quarters in to keep playing.\n\nAlso that soundtrack is freaking fantastic.","timestamp_created":1571940276,"timestamp_updated":1571940276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8qK8/+0CfN7U1AE="}
