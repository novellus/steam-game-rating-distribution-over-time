It's really the best episode till now with amazing artworks, nice music, convincing voice acting and a satisfying/tearful story about memories, forgetting, desperation and change mixed with cuteness and humor. \n\nIf you liked Episode 1/2 you definitely will get your moneys worth and if the devs can keep up the established standard, well then there is probably much more to come in the future and I'm positive that Studio Coattails won't dissapoint.","timestamp_created":1605133104,"timestamp_updated":1605133104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52702707052230835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuO7Y3PUCdpXqrQI="}
