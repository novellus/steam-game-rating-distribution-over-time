    review: "*edit*  It is sad to say that the developer has expressed to us that\
      \ development of the game has been significantly slowed due to issues that have\
      \ cropped up.  The game may not be completed, although the developer has said\
      \ the game will still be worked on (supposedly), but will take much longer,\
      \ as in 2+ years.\n\nAlthough it is sad to hear about this, I cannot recommend\
      \ the game to future players, not until more big updates get released.  I would\
      \ say follow the game and put it on the backburner to see if anything gets done.\
      \  Otherwise save your money.\n\nI will be changing this review to a \"do not\
      \ recommened\" for now.  I will leave my original positive review below for\
      \ those that are curious about the game.\n\n\n\nPrevious review:\n\nI wholeheartedly\
      \ recommend this game, especially to those that like top-down shooters.\n\n\
      Reasoning:  \n\nI may be a bit biased as I love top-down shooters, but I feel\
      \ this game has a good foundation already in which everyine can enjoy regardless\
      \ if youre a fan of the genre or not.\n\nThe gameplay is very solid and satisfying.\
      \ Currently there are two modes, 1 campaign and a survival mode.  At the moment\
      \ the campaign consists of getting from point A to B while fighting zombies.\
      \  Survival is based on fighting waves of enemies, while preventing the zombies\
      \ getting past you, if they do you lose. \n\nWith that said the combat is very\
      \ enjoyable combined with the mechanics in the game, make for a great experiece.\
      \  It is your standard zombie killing, but this game makes it fun.  You have\
      \ a handful of guns to use which you have to purchase by earning money killing\
      \ zombies.\nSo what separates this from other top-down shooters is you can headshot\
      \ the enemies for more damage.  \n\nAlso another which goes along with the headshot\
      \ mehanic is the ability to only shoot in two directions, left and right.  There\
      \ is no full 360 aiming or even 8 directional aiming for that matter.  And enemies\
      \ too move in one direction left/right but can also move up and down.  Yea this\
      \ may sound lame, it did to me at first, but when I played the game it felt\
      \ very intuitive and any ill feelings toward this issue was dismissed quickly.\n\
      \nthere is online  co-op multiplayer (yay!) and runs quite smoothly (for me).\n\
      \nthe graphics, it has a charm to it.  Nothing like triple-A stuff, but very\
      \ warming to look at.\n\nThere are customizable options such as changing your\
      \ characters clothing and head.  Not a whole lot at the moment, but i can definitely\
      \ see more being added.  \n\nMy gripes so far is the weapons interface is a\
      \ little bit cluncky.  Not much content at the moment either in terms of modes\
      \ and campaigns.\nOne other issue which might turn off some is if you read the\
      \ early access statement on this page.  The development time is estimated at\
      \ 2 years, this is a long time.  So if you are patient and dont have a good\
      \ interest to play this game I would wait.\n\nOverall I can see a lot of potential\
      \ in Zombie hunter inc.  It is very early access, but the foundation is there,\
      \ so I can only see this game going up as time goes on.  Definitely pick this\
      \ game up!  It is my nee go-to top down zombie shooter that I will definitely\
      \ enjoy playing as development goes on.\n\nLastly I would like to add a note\
      \ about the developer.  They are super nice people and take feedback very well.\
      \  I had an issue with this game and the dev spent an hour with me trying to\
      \ solve my problem, after the issue was fixed we ended playing a couple rounds\
      \ of survival online.  Seriously, I dont know any other game where you get this\
      \ kind of awesome attention and service!"
