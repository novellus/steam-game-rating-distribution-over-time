I don't know, maybe I'm completely blind. Considering the otherwise polished and high quality game I don't understand how this is possible.\n\n#2 The game starts off WAAAAAAAY too slow and easy. Everytime you die and start a new run the first 5-10 minutes are mind numbingly boring and easy with no way to speed things up while you are waiting for enemys and things to spawn. \n\nThis might be resolved once you unlock further modes, but after an hour I still only have the first mode unlocked and I have no idea how much further in the progression I will unlock the rest, but I can't force myself to be bored for potentially another hour+\n\n------------------------\n\nAside from these 2 extremely major problems. The game looks, sounds, and plays great.","timestamp_created":1594254513,"timestamp_updated":1601681201,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49vLo9fQCdZH2kwI="}
