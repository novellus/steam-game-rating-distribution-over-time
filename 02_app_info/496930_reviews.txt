The puzzles themselves require somewhat \"perfection\" in your guesswork. It is visually appealing. Though it also makes no reference at all really to Sumeria in story. As to which I bought this game for, as I like Sumer history a lot. So in that respect, alongside how hard it was, I found this game unappealing. I finished it though... took a huge amount of time even with the hints to draw perfectly what they had shown. Found it pretty frustrating due to needing to draw absolutely perfectly. Likely suited only to those who liked Art class.","timestamp_created":1604928950,"timestamp_updated":1604928950,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540000021457672119","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw74nO1vUCdJ6srQI="}
