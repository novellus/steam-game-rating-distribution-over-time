    review: If you're a fan of more sports based horse games you'll probably like
      this one, I know people have said the original is better but I haven't played
      it and I enjoyed this one pretty well. It took about 8 hours for me to beat
      all of the competitions and my biggest complaint is that probably an hour of
      that was caring for horses or grinding stats to get to the next competition.
      The graphics and controls are pretty bad too but that's pretty normal for horse
      games.  I personally found the dressage most enjoyable because there aren't
      many games with dressage in them and it was a pretty well rounded system that
      got more difficult as you progressed. The show jumping was also good, it was
      enjoyable and I really liked the courses at the higher levels. XC was very easy
      because basically all you need to do is keep kicking, so it got a little boring.
      Overall I liked the game!
