    review: 'I bought Diery Heaven and it took up to the ten minute mark before I
      had an idea on who this game was designed for and maybe another ten to fully
      confirm that theory. Diery Heaven is a secret fetish game for sadomasochists
      and I know that because I''m pretty sure completing it makes me one of them.
      At minimum I''m an unpaid intern. At numerous points I was ready to tear my
      hair out and it hurt so good.

      Diery Heaven is a game that costs less than two bucks and feels like one of
      those things you put together as a final project at a game dev boot camp. It
      consists of five jumping puzzles and I use the term puzzle in the loosest sense.
      Essentially you are making precision jumps over a variety of moving and stationary
      platforms and dodging barrels that fall from the sky.

      It''s funny that the game advertises itself as a calming experience because
      I honestly can''t remember the last time I felt this stressed while playing
      such a simple indie video game. There''s no time limit or score or competition
      to speak of, but Diery Heaven ramps up the stress levels by making each section
      tough as nails. It doesn''t help that the controls are somewhat inconsistent,
      your character''s interaction with the environment is rough, and things move
      way too fast.

      Diery Heaven is one of those games that is going to frustrate you until the
      puzzle clicks and you figure out how to work around the systems. And then it''ll
      infuriate you as every fall sends you back to the start. I honestly have a lot
      of respect for the creator ThroneLab because despite the minimalist style you
      can tell that a fair amount of thought went into each section.

      First person platformers are difficult to pull off and Diery Heaven makes this
      easier by letting you see your body which helps in precision landing. Movement
      even in the air is pretty precise except during the massive spinning staircase
      bit and ultimately four of the five sections are quite gratifying to finally
      conquer. You want to stand up and give your computer double middle fingers just
      to reinforce that you beat it.

      The last stage isn''t good, and I''m not entirely sure that this method is what
      the developers had in mind. But it worked, and I did it my way. So tough cookies.

      I took about 50 minutes to beat the game and that doesn''t include the time
      I spent punching the wall and throwing every curse word in the dictionary at
      my computer. By the end of it I had a splitting migraine but an odd sense of
      satisfaction and several potentially fractured knuckles. For two dollars you
      can have some fun with a short game that doesn''t expect anything further from
      you in return. There''s a paper thin plot in there somewhere that could fit
      on the back of a Kraft Dinner box and who cares.

      Check it out. I give it a B-
