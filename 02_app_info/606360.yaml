    review: "[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]\n\n\
      So the whole game took me a little less than 1 hour to complete. I had a lot\
      \ of fun. I think it's a good deal for the normal price at $3.99USD and one\
      \ of the better deals on the VR Spring Sale on Steam for $1.59. \n\nThis is\
      \ fast-paced arcade action shoot 'em up with arm-swing locomotion and the game\
      \ also has some stealth portions. You have a gun on one hand and a shield on\
      \ the other. Both gun and shield gun have reloads. So you do have to use your\
      \ shield strategically when you can't dodge. You have to reload when it's safe\
      \ to do so or you'll die. Everything dies in one shot, including you and enemies.\
      \ There's some enemies that you have to place strategic shots though.\n\nI loved\
      \ the stealth portion. Keep in mind, every part of this game is set pieces.\
      \ So you traverse the map, but most of the action will go down exactly the same\
      \ way. So with stealth as long as you memorize the patrols, it shouldn't be\
      \ too hard to get by the enemies. Still it was fun for me to figure out where\
      \ the hiding spots were and how to best get by the patrols.\n\nI was able to\
      \ get finish the game with a 2 sensor setup, but I don't recommend that. I would\
      \ definitely go full rooomscale. It'll be easier to run and gun that way. The\
      \ graphics and sounds are not the best, but the gameplay is fast and fluid.\
      \ This is definitely a purchase I am happy that I made during the Steam VR Spring\
      \ Sale.\n\nSale Price Rating 8/10. Normal Price Rating 7/10."
