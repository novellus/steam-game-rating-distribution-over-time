I'd like to have a few more scenarios for it to be worth the asking price though, but I guess you can consider it supporting the developer. Overall I enjoyed it and recommend for any fan of the franchise. Definately a good purchase at a sale.","timestamp_created":1579356998,"timestamp_updated":1579356998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl+nA3O8CdZTR7AE="}
