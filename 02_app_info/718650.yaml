      \ /><br><br>After a devastating war between ancient mages, a powerful spell\
      \ is all that holds together the shattered planet of Driftland. Faced with the\
      \ destruction of their entire civilization and life on the planet, the warring\
      \ factions called a truce and tried to repair the damage \u2013 but it was already\
      \ too late. By using all their remaining magic to cast a powerful spell, they\
      \ managed to keep their world in relative balance.<br><br>Many dark ages passed,\
      \ but when all seemed lost, a ray of hope emerged once more: new sources of\
      \ magic appeared, and new mages were given birth to across the planet. Now,\
      \ as the dormant conflicts once again surface, this rediscovered power will\
      \ determine whether Driftland is restored to its former glory or wiped from\
      \ the cosmos entirely.<br><br>You take on the role of a Mage Overlord with your\
      \ own castle, tower, and a small realm on one of the landmasses. With your unique\

    reviews: "\u201CDriftland: The Magic Revival is a bit of a unique beast, being\
      \ an RTS in the old mould of 'build stuff in real time and send units around\
      \ to do war' Age of Empires style, but with several tweaks that makes anything\
      \ but the basic buildings unrecognisable.\u201D<br>80% \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.strategygamer.com/reviews/driftland-the-magic-revival/?fbclid=IwAR0wr0twOJr-ne4rnrZB-N07q81bmxuq12pgobmhxKDZuXUuGOY7eotntMM\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >STRATEGY GAMER</a><br><br>\u201CIt's\
      \ a gentle gardening game where you nurture a city into existence, lassoing\
      \ new districts with magic as you expand. The lack of micromanagement also lets\
      \ you concentrate on casting magic spells. You can fireball bridges and then\
      \ steal islands from other factions, or carve up an enemy force with a lightning\
      \ storm, or a tornado, or both. It's an odd mashup of Populus, Dungeon Keeper\
      \ and Warcraft in a colourful setting\u201D<br><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/build-a-beautiful-empire-of-floating-islands-in-driftlands/\"\

      \ time with the floating islands of Driftland, and its indirect control scheme\
      \ is well compensated by a great AI and a smooth UI. After an adjustment period,\

      \ the flow of a huge empire.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://saveorquit.com/2019/06/29/review-driftland-the-magic-revival/\"\

    review: "This game is fun and easy to understand, with little bugs, but the fun\
      \ is not endless and can turn into boredom. At the time of this review I have\
      \ completed two of the four campaigns and I'm on the last mission on the third,\
      \ and I don't know if I'll complete it.\n\nI'll start off by saying that there\
      \ is a lot of content for a $30 game. Four campaigns with five missions each,\
      \ four playable races, perfect soundtrack for the game, and in a unique world.\
      \ That's more than some AAA games. There are multiple difficulties, but even\
      \ on the second out of five difficulties (Brave Mage) I have to spend a minimum\
      \ an hour to beat the A.I per mission. The A.I isn't hard to beat, it's just\
      \ there is a very clear way to win and it takes time. For example, the reason\
      \ I may not come back to complete the game is because the mission I'm on starts\
      \ the player off with just a castle (home base) and very limited resources and\
      \ you are expected to beat a well established enemy. It will probably take me\
      \ an hour to an hour and a half to make an economy strong enough to start to\
      \ beat the enemy and, then another forty minuets to an hour to actually beat\
      \ the enemy. I ain't got time for that. Also, because I'm not completing the\
      \ last mission I wont unlock the campaign for the last race. Four campaigns\
      \ and four races, but you have to complete a campaign to move on or unlock the\
      \ next one, like in Age of Mythology. So, to get to the point where you can\
      \ unlock the last race you have to put in around the same amount of hours I\
      \ have, maybe more.\n\nThe only reason to put in more hours than me is because\
      \ you like the game play, you enjoy multiplayer, or you love the lore. I foresee\
      \ the slapfest that a multiplayer game would be, so I have no interest and probably\
      \ never will play one. For the lore, I have to compliment them and say they\
      \ definitely put in the time to add the lore and make it more than just a few\
      \ references to throughout the story, but I'm just not interested in it. Before\
      \ the loading screen there is a short cutscene that will catch the player up\
      \ on the current timeline, but everything else is in scripted dialogue except\
      \ for a few voiced sections. So, I end up not really knowing why the campaign\
      \ is taking place without having me go back and do extra research. \n\nI believe\
      \ this game is still worth buying, though like everything wait for a sale. It\
      \ offers unique game play, no useless microtransactions, no game breaking bugs,\
      \ cool animations, and all for half the price of a AAA strategy game. Though\
      \ the game does have its flaws, mostly with the A.I and missions sometimes being\
      \ long and to much of a grind. I'll be interested in future games the studio\
      \ makes.\n\n6.7/10"
