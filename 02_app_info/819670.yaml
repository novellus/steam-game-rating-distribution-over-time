    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers[/h1]\n\nI'll\
      \ be honest and state that I'm making some assumptions when writing this review\
      \ which may make my review inaccurate. The reason for that is because I'm stuck\
      \ on the last level. I'm assuming that third level (snowmen in the graveyard)\
      \ is the last level for this game. I review games based on content, quality,\
      \ and price.\n\nIf this game only has those 3 levels, then in my opinion, it\
      \ is very light on content for the asking price. Especially given the quality\
      \ of said content. Don't get me wrong, I had fun. This is a casual puzzle game.\
      \ It's not really anything ground-breaking. I've seen this type of game in VR\
      \ before, but it's done nicely here.\n\nBasically, you're teleporting around\
      \ a certain area, but you can only teleport in that area. So you have to manage\
      \ how to get from point A to Point B and your perspective changes as you can\
      \ go sideways or upside down. You start off by having to throw these little\
      \ squares to the goal where gravity is directing the little squares in a certain\
      \ direction, all while you may lose your sense of direction as your perspective\
      \ changes. Later on you'll be having to use switches and even make some accurate\
      \ throws if you want to get to the goal with the little square. \n\nI liked\
      \ the first two levels. I thought they were a casual puzzle challenge for a\
      \ simple looking game with a brisk pace that held your interest. Unfortunately,\
      \ the third level seems to have jumped the shark as they say. Suddenly you're\
      \ forgetting all the restrictions and instead just moving directly to snowmen\
      \ that you kill with your sword and having to direct a laser to get their shield\
      \ down. That's quite a jump from what you were doing. And although I got stuck,\
      \ it was a pretty boring level design. Honestly, I'm not sure if I'm stuck or\
      \ if it's a bug. I'll assume it's my error and that I missed something.\n\n\
      [b]Sale Price Rating 5.5/10. I got this on sale for $2.49 USD in the Steam Winter\
      \ Sale. In my humble opinion, it should be more like a $1.99 game (normal retail\
      \ price) I would probably have rated negaively at $5 USD if I had paid that\
      \ much [/b]"
