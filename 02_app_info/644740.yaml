    review: 'Great workout! Simple but nice!

      I think I lost couple of pounds on my first session :D When you hear the monster
      right besides you,  you get this adrenaline rush and you start running even
      faster. Love that feeling. Also it''s cool that I can run forward and look behind
      to see where the monster is.

      Holding the grip to run was a bit uncomfortable at first, so you have to get
      use to it (update on that would be a good thing).


      Really looking forward on what the developers have to offer in the future.'
