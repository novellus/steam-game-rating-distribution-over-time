The artistic style translated well in video game format....but I'm afraid my praise ends there. The game is essentially a side-scrolling beat 'em up in the vein of Final Fight or Streets of Rage....but while those games had excellent controls....this game does not. They are simple....don't get me wrong....but you pretty much spend your time either moving forward to escape the re-spawning enemies....or being boxed in by said enemies....and getting knocked back and forth like a cat playfully swatting a mouse. Sometimes you just feel helpless....especially since there is no jump maneuver to get you out of a tight spot. The hit detection is wonky as well....and sometimes you'll get hit by an enemy that's a different elevation or seemingly not there at all. I played the game for a couple of minutes....until I got to an area where my path was blocked by piles of green goop....and I just quit playing when the game wouldn't let me destroy them or move past. At just under a dollar....the price was cheap....but as with everything else in life....you get what you pay for.","timestamp_created":1570720500,"timestamp_updated":1570720500,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkpmP2+0CeNLu0wE="}
