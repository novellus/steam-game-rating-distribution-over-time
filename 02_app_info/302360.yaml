    review: 'I played Pandora''s Directive  for one and only time back in 1996 when
      it first came out.Since then i am considering this game as the best adventure
      game and my all time favorite and the series along with Fallout my 2 favorite
      video games series.

      But all this years i have forgot why i thought that game was so good since 2
      weeks ago when i decided to give it another playthrough.

      I enjoyed every part of it, i played it slowly without rushing (it took me 27
      hours to finish it) just to listen to Tex commending on everything around the
      many different locations of the game.

      I loved it all for from the begining and for second time in my life, the humor,
      the story the beautiful women, the atmosphere, everything!

      So yeah, i wasn''t wrong when i was 15... this game is the best adventure game
      ever!

      Ps. This time i got the good finale!'
