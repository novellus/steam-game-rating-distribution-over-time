      This will not make you all powerful in the world, your goal will not only be
      to make lots of money, but to print money and become a Federal reserve...

    review: When I was reading the description, the graphics and the castle in the
      background immediately reminded me of the Middle Ages, where money and gold
      were only a dream for ordinary people. That's what I thought. But this opinion
      was wrong! :) If you look at history, the 15-16th century was the period of
      formation of the banking system. The usurers were replaced by banks. So I was
      to try the game and see if I could achieve the heights at that time... but with
      today's knowledge :D
