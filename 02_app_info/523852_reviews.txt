The first episode introduced main character Nikolay, and took place in a hospital. The second episode took place in a school and had a story about some ghost girl, students, and faculty. The third episode was a semi-murder mystery in the abandoned factory that used to house Nikolay's job. This fourth entry is the first, and only, time that we get to see his character model, and it takes place in a theatre; it also sports a semi-murder mystery vibe as well.\n\nEssentially, your goal is to find out the identity of the arsonist that burned down the theater. Nikolay's employer from Episode 3 makes an appearance, which will lead players to ultimately conclude that he's some sadistic freak who is responsible for all of the crazy murders, and is in charge of the VERSA Corporation. Though this is never actually spelled out as there's no actual conclusion to the game, it's the only reasonable assumption. The storytelling in this final episode is better than its three predecessors, but it's still incredibly confusing.\n\nFor some reason, the puzzles take a huge leap in difficulty, and as such In Fear I Trust's fourth episode is the longest one, clocking in at well over an hour. Of course, this depends on how good you are at sliding puzzles in particular. There are a couple others that require in-depth problem solving as well. As usual, not all of these puzzles have to be solved in order to complete the episode, but the most complex ones do.\n\nAs a whole, In Fear I Trust is a convoluted mess of a game. It starts off promising enough, with a creepy hospital/deranged mad doctor vibe, but it just seems like the developers had no idea what they actually wanted to get out of the game. Is it a murder mystery? Is it a psychological thriller? Is it a supernatural/paranormal investigation? Who knows. Certainly not me. Except for one character that shows up in two of the four episodes, there seems to be no connection between any of the episodes, and the story is far too complex. For the most part, the puzzles are far too easy.  Regrettably, the end of Episode 4 isn't worth the three-and-a-half hours it takes to reach, and at no point does the plot become any clearer. Just avoid this mess entirely, I wasted a good chunk of my night off on this crap.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]2.0/5.0[/b] - It's not awful, but it's not great.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore\n\n[h1]Related Reviews:[/h1]\n[b]Review for In Fear I Trust - Episode 1: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/THNEmbalmer/recommended/522690]Here[/url][/b]\n[b]Review for In Fear I Trust - Episode 2: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/THNEmbalmer/recommended/523850]Here[/url][/b]\n[b]Review for In Fear I Trust - Episode 3: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/THNEmbalmer/recommended/523851/]Here[/url][/b]","timestamp_created":1521962952,"timestamp_updated":1521963015,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.710939109325408936","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tZOEruICd/nEnAE="}
