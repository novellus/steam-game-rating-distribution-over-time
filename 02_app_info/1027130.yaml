      class="bb_tag">YURA SCENARIO</h2>Through a series of crazy circumstances, the
      Houjou household has grown into quite the large family upon taking Maya and
      Ritsu into the fold. Yura, on the other hand, is staunchly opposed to this change
      and wants to win over Haruki's affections. Finding herself unjustly punished,
      she tries faking a runaway from home. And when she reaches the park, she sees
      some girls from Haruki's class gossiping. But about what, exactly...?<h2 class="bb_tag">TAMA
      SCENARIO</h2>Tama has awakened to her sense of justice through the joys of magical
      girls. Taking a short break from her ninja duties, she keeps herself vigilant
      of her master and tries her best to deliver justice wherever it may be served.
      Thus, Tama begins her new journey (?) of magical girl shenanigans to keep the
      peace around town.<h2 class="bb_tag">RITSU SCENARIO</h2>Ritsu wants to set herself
      apart from her lackadaisical cohorts and is determined to do proper work to
      help support Haruki with family expenses. Her job hunt begins, along with a
      display of surprising... talents?<h2 class="bb_tag">MAYA SCENARIO</h2>The skill
      gap Maya has with everyone else is apparent to Maya and she finds herself at
      a loss on just how to fill it. Trying to get away and take a breather from everyone
      taking her lightly, she goes to the park where she finds a lost kitty. As a
      fellow feline (?), Maya can't find it in herself to abandon the little guy,
      so she demands to let it stay at the house and keep it, making Maya a mommy...?<h2
