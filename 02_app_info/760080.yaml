      /><br>A dangerous survival adventure in space station labirynths. Turn-based
      combat, character progression, the atmosphere of impending threat. Collect and
      modify weapons, stock up on ammunition and first-aid kits, use your brain and
      think two steps ahead. Between you and the exit from the station - a horde of
      enemies who know nothing about fear or mercy.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760080/extras/Features.png?t=1606137702"

      /><br>The &quot;Wanderer&quot; station is full of secrets for you to uncover.
      Perhaps, that''s how we will find out what happened there and how the arrival
      of Max is connected with that. Or maybe not only that. The main thing to survive!<br><br><img
      src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760080/extras/Banner_3_eng_apng.png?t=1606137702"
      /><br>If you think that the layout of the premises in the future will cease
      to be the fruit of the maniacal misanthrope''s sick mind - you are deeply mistaken.
      Max will have to wade through the mazes, crowded with traps, enemies and other
      surprises. A simple straight path is for wimps!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760080/extras/Banner_4_eng_apng.png?t=1606137702"
      /><br>From rusty knuckles to super-mega-blaster - feel like a master gunsmith!
      And do not forget about your battlesuit: it makes you strong, dexterous, skillful
      - demanding energy instead. Lots of energy. Tons of energy!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760080/extras/Banner_1_eng_apng.png?t=1606137702"
      /><br>If the enemy is unresting - provide him with the eternal rest! For this,
      there''s a whole arsenal of various weapons at the &quot;Wanderer&quot; station.
      Grenades, machine guns, brass knuckles, pistols... Not enough? Each weapon can
      have an elemental damage module!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760080/extras/Banner_2_eng_apng.png?t=1606137702"
      /><br>Zombies, mutants, mutant zombies, monsters from laboratories, zombie monsters
      from laboratories ... Max and you are not going to get bored!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760080/extras/Banner_5_eng_apng.png?t=1606137702"
      /><br>Have you explored the station, remembered the compartments'' layout, taken
      notes of the traps and stashes? Here''s a new walkthrough for you! Each new
      attempt feels like the first time, cause the levels are generated procedurally.<h2
      class="bb_tag"><strong>Story:</strong></h2>It''s 2115. Something terrible has
      happened on board the research space station Wanderer, and the former space
      marine Max Carnage becomes an unwilling participant in these events.  To survive,
      he will need to remember his military past.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760080/extras/onemorething.png?t=1606137702"

    review: Its just a bad copy of Darkest Dungeon. Even some animation are copied
      wholesale (like the howler) Some game mechanics don't work. Tactics is  - just
      kip hitting with strongest weapon and win. There are better game out there.
