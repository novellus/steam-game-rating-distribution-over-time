      \ /><br>Life is an experiment here at Mount Moira Hospital, a first-person survival\
      \ horror game where you must try to survive.  <br><br>*Early Access is its own\
      \ full story* <br><br>As a worried brother you take on the role of Alan Mason,\
      \ explore Mount Moira Hospital and try to survive long enough to discover its\
      \ terrible secrets and attempt to recover your loved ones who have been trapped\
      \ here for years, if you dare. <br><br>Synopsis: <br><br>In a remote location\
      \ hidden away in the mountains, horrors wait inside Mount Moira Hospital. A\
      \ long-abandoned home for the mentally ill, the sick, and the weak minded. A\
      \ place of mystery, here people were experimented on and unfortunately changed\
      \ forever, both mentally and physically. The doctors who ran this place conducted\
      \ horrid actions against all matters of life to create &quot;new&quot; beings.\
      \ Grotesque creatures now wander the halls of the facility and you must find\
      \ the evidence to take the corporation responsible down. You will have to face\
      \ your fears as you explore the demented world of Awoken. Monsters and tormented\
      \ creatures wander the grounds of Mount Moira Hospital and you will either face\
      \ them to the best of your abilities or run and hide if you can escape their\
      \ clutches. With scarce resources, you will have to search for safety and for\
      \ items to either defend or keep yourself healthy.  There are clues and puzzles\
      \ that you will have to solve and piece together to fully understand the horrors\
      \ that haunt Mount Moira Hospital and uncover the truths to its workings. In\
      \ Awoken, you will experience the true meaning of Survival Horror. <br><br>Awoken\
      \ is only Chapter One of our Reverie Series and is a true survival horror experience\
      \ which aims to show that the most terrifying things come from the human mind.\

      I was fortunate enough to get a chance to play Reverie in the middle of 2019.\
      \ This game constantly has you on edge... you know you aren\u2019t alone. I\
      \ loved the horror/spooky theme of the game setting and the monsters... oh,\
      \ yeah the monsters... that\u2019s why you aren\u2019t alone. I can\u2019t describe\
      \ the monsters fully but imagine a nightmare stitched together with rope and\
      \ twine and then add body parts dumped on top of it for good measure.  When\
      \ the final game hits I\u2019m hitting the game!\u201D<br>5 \u2013 <a href=\"\

      \ upcoming games Alpha stages for &quot;Reverie\u201D back in July of 2019.\
      \ Reverie is a horror-themed game where you are put into the role of the victim\
      \ being chased by unknown creatures while attempting to figure out why you are\
      \ there in the first place. It was an interesting concept, the game had great\
      \ depths to it for being in their early stages. Intense moments and that feeling\
      \ of \u201Cconstantly being watched\u201D, makes for a fun and scary experience.\
      \ Looking forward to the future development of this game.\u201D<br>5 \u2013\

    review: "https://youtu.be/PKV8PW1N7jI\n\nDid you just have your Facebook friends\
      \ post 5/5 reviews for and then post them to your game page trying to pretend\
      \ they were actual people in the industry?\n\nI'm just going to talk about the\
      \ list of \"Key features\"\n\n\"A True Survival Horror Experience: If you wish\
      \ to survive the horrors of Mount Moira Hospital, your only chance is to run...\
      \ hide... or find items to defend yourself however be warned not everything\
      \ is at it seems.\"\n\nRunning and hiding aren't really options since some of\
      \ the enemies will follow you anywhere you go and just wait outside of the room\
      \ you are hiding in. There's guns in the game, at least I'm assuming so, but\
      \ I couldn't be fucked trying to find them\n\n\"Explore Mount Moira Hospital\
      \ without limitations, a full immersive world.\"\n\nNo idea what this is suppose\
      \ to mean. There are plenty of places you cannot go and you cant interact with\
      \ almost anything so I don't get the full immersion and without limitations\
      \ part.\n\n\"Flashlight mechanics are realistic and use a battery system, be\
      \ sure to stock up on batteries.\"\n\nOh get fucked! Have you ever used a flash\
      \ light? How is it realistic to have the batteries run dead every 2 minutes.\
      \ Not to mention changing the bastards are a pain in the ass.\n\n\"Immersive\
      \ Graphics: AAA-quality graphics give players a detailed, terrifying realistic\
      \ world to explore by taking full advantage of Unity\u2019s HDRP render engine.\"\
      \n\nFuck, I had to restart the game several times and fuck with the settings\
      \ to even get the game to work right. After that there was still plenty of dropped\
      \ frames and clipping textures on top of having a super obnoxious motion blur\
      \ that wouldn't go away even after I toggled it off. It seems you cant even\
      \ edit most of the settings from in game but instead have to do it all from\
      \ the main menu.\n\n\"Unpredictable Enemies: Players cannot know when \u2013\
      \ and from where \u2013 one of the hospital\u2019s inhabitants will catch you.\"\
      \n\nMost of the times the enemies are just standing in the hall not doing anything\
      \ so you definitely know when and where they are coming. They wait till you\
      \ get close and then slowly walk towards you and somehow have the ability to\
      \ clip through walls and doors. These aren't frightening enemies they are just\
      \ slow moving annoyances.\n\n\"Search the facility for information and resources\
      \ to help you complete your objectives and come out of this alive.\"\n\nIts\
      \ such a dark cluttered mess that's its hard to pick out what's important and\
      \ what's not so basically you get to wander around in circles while enemies\
      \ slowly follow you.\n\n\"Real Horror: Awoken, Mount Moira Hospital, all of\
      \ its creatures, and its setting are inspired by real asylum, cases of criminal\
      \ insanity, and folk lore.\"\n\nI doubt it.\n\nThis game is a giant mess of\
      \ \"Things that might be scary\" thrown in together and called a game. Slow\
      \ moving enemies, jump scares, a mannequin, psycho patient stuck in cell. It\
      \ feels like the dev googled top 10 things that are spoopy then  found some\
      \ free assists and called it a game. 50$ (29.99 on sale) Is an insane rip off\
      \ for this game and I suggest everyone stay away."
