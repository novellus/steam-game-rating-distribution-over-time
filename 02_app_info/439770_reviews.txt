CYOA's tend to fall into two sections, either stat-driven and more focused on statistically advancing your way to the top overtime as power-creep sets in, or stats which are easily raised as long as you don't do anything too crazy, and you can probably get through just fine with middle of the road stats.\n\n\nThis one falls extremely into the first camp, and doing anything which isn't your focus, is rewarded with failure, and rending apart your character in later installments. Failure to follow what your character is good at, and attempting to read situations to know what stat is going to be used, is more important then actually reading the book because of the extreme difficulty later on.\n\nHowever, it is an interesting story, fun to read, and I went into this thinking that maybe people just didn't really prioritize too much, and I decided to fully build my character in a select few skills, only to end up not even having enough at the third installment, which is frustrating to say the least, and resulted in me just putting it down out of not wanting to rush through three other books, get the optimal choices and secrets, just to complete the end.","timestamp_created":1593596790,"timestamp_updated":1593596790,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz6jxhPMCceDvkQI="}
