    review: "I was never particularly fond of point-and-click games, even considering\
      \ that I have played some in the past. However, Whisper of a Machine's premise\
      \ interested me enough to get it (that and the fact that I wanted a simple game\
      \ with a nice story). It did not disappoint. What started as a simple detective\
      \ case eventually unfolded to greater schemes at large. Some of the puzzles\
      \ needed to continue were really confusing and vague, but being able to solve\
      \ them feels gratifying. There's also the option of searching up walkthroughs\
      \ for certain parts that you really can't figure out. \n\nNow for a review of\
      \ the thematic discussions touched on by the narrative and story. If you want\
      \ to play the game completely blind, you need not read further. \n\nIn a genre\
      \ that has an extreme variety of stories, the sci-fi title Whispers of a Machine\
      \ manages to still find a unique angle with which to explore its themes. The\
      \ story takes place somewhere in the future, in a post-war, anti-AI world. This\
      \ in itself was already interesting in that the plot transpires in a setting\
      \ where AI had once been ubiquitous but is now all but forbidden. Thus, most\
      \ of the narrative themes revolve around this idea of whether an AI singularity\
      \ would bring more harm than good to humanity. \n\nThe Conduit is a group introduced\
      \ in the game of members who zealously wish to bring AI back into the world.\
      \ More than that, they wish to achieve a singularity and believe that this superintelligence\
      \ will save the world.\n\nThe game repeatedly likens their ideology to the concept\
      \ of creating a child that surpasses them, or to create a God that lives on\
      \ after them. Moreover, it posits the argument that humans that are diametrically\
      \ opposed to the idea of an AI singularity are simply afraid of that which becomes\
      \ greater than them. If people were to let go of this fear, the world could\
      \ potentially improve in unprecedented ways, or it could be disastrous for mankind.\
      \ It is an unknown venture, but one that some argue to be worth it regardless\
      \ of what happens. \n\nWhispers of a Machine also touches a bit on the counter-ideology\
      \ to what could be the cyberculture of the future; when the world becomes overrun\
      \ with AI, technology, and hedonism arising from complacency, it is likely that\
      \ traditionalists will rise to meet this change. After all, any sort of change\
      \ major is bound to be met with strong pushback with ideals of what was perceived\
      \ as good in the past. \n[i] It was better before [/i] \n\nIn the game this\
      \ was represented by one of the most traditionalist organizations you can think\
      \ of: a religious church. An apt contrast to AI zealots. \n\n\nThe story also\
      \ touches more on themes of observer bias on the perception of reality, the\
