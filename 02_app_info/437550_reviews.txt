These bugs I often notice playing with friends and can be annoying, but Early Access game is gonna Early Access game.\n\n[h1] The Level Editor [/h1]\n\nLevel editors can be confusing, especially with 3D level editors, but it's not hard when you understand it. I really do encourage people to make maps especially with the low amount giving lots of potential for originality. There are bugs within the Level Editor, like the menu breaking to unknown reasons and blocks automatically inverting, but those are redeemable with a simple save button. (Thank god those bugs don't crash games)\n\nI give this game a:\n\n[b] 7/10 [/b]\n\nI recommend you try this game out if you're looking to buy it with some spare change.","timestamp_created":1609483234,"timestamp_updated":1609483234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502372026443481445","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwraWr3vYCf/6ovwI="}
