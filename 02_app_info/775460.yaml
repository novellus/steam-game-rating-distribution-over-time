    review: It left a bad taste in my mouth at first, largely for reasons that other
      reviewers have already pointed out. However, after revisiting it nearly a year
      and a half later, I've actually come to appreciate it far more. I think the
      main issues are the somewhat disappointing ending, and the game as a whole not
      being as good as the original. Everything else was actually pretty good. The
      author has made plenty of other great games, so I'm sure the sequel to this
      one will be better.
