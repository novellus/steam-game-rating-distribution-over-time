    short_description: Death Point is a classic stealth-action, which not only should
      inspire player but also surprise him. At first glance, you get almost traditional
      game, tightly staffed with hard levels and various tasks. Instead you are immersed
      in a different world, fully associating yourself with the main character.

    review: 'its a fun small indie stealth game, one of the best attempts a indie
      dev has made, way better than many competitors, would love a sequel fixing all
      the issues with the game. so the problem with the game is how the movement and
      unpolishdness of the levels feel. its a good game, just need mroe polish, if
      you want to develop stealth games or are a stealth conoisseur this is an interesting
      game to have a go at


      it poorly tries to implement mechanics from mark of the ninja, without properly
      telling how alert enemies are, how visible you are, and having an indicator
      on how the enemies  are seeing you. weirdly it has indicators for cameras and
      lasers, but not for npcs.

      I also wish you could look further, its like you are as blind as everyone else,
      the Q button lets you use scan, but its not so useful because how much it depletes.
      Also the movement is too slow and crouched doesnt do much. play other stealth
      games instead'
