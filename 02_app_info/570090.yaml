    review: "Whilst an investment, it is an amazing tool for really complex storylines.\
      \ \nThe documentation is quite good, I was even able to make some mod (plugin)\
      \ to help my team with my workflow.\n\nIf you are an intermediate/experienced\
      \ developer working on a project with a strong narrative, I fully recommend\
      \ AD3.\n\n I have a few reservations with the Unity plugin because of the way\
      \ I want things to work, so I export JSON (or .docx if for readproof) and made\
      \ a wrapper to import that exported JSON data on demand. \n\nAs for the tool\
      \ itself, it's an amazing data management system. It's missing one tiny feature\
      \ (list of struct-like properties) to be the best thing ever created, but it\
      \ might get there too, maybe. Hopefully. We'll see.\n\n10/10 would recommend."
