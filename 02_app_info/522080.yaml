    review: 'I might write another review when I play more, but for now here is what
      I think after reaching the first boss. (I won''t be talking about the sound
      since my laptop was muted)


      I had played Gemstone at Insomnia awhile ago and enjoyed it. I brought it yesterday
      since it was on sale and sat down to play it today. I really did enjoy it and
      like how simple the controls are and how simple the game is so far. I do expect
      it to become harder.


      However, there are two things I need to make aware. The first is the bright
      purple light when you enter a portal and the bright red light when you beat
      a boss. Although I do not suffer from epilepsy, I found it too bright, harsh
      and sudden.

      The second problem that could have been my own fault is that the first boss
      can trap you in the corner and chip away at your health. I was able to escape
      but it still something that I feel should be brought up. But again it might
      have been my own fault.


      I''m sure if the first issue is dealt with soon, the game would be much better.
      So I give this a recommend.'
