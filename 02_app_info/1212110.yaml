    about_the_game: "<strong>This is early alpha software. Gameplay will change over\
      \ time.</strong><br><br>You and your adventurous buddies are experimenting with\
      \ some magical trinkets after your last quest when you hear moaning in the forest.\
      \ You turn and see a hideous bug-eyed zombie wielding a copper frying pan and\
      \ charging right at you. Instinctively,  you throw a nearby rock at the undead\
      \ creature \u2014 and down he goes!<br><br>\u201CHey, that was kinda FUN. What\
      \ happens if I combine a rock and sticky snail snot?\u201C<br><br>This first-person\
      \ wave defense game is built for maximum fun for one, or groups of two, three,\
      \ or four. Knockback is filled with magical weapons that enable you to eliminate\
      \ zombies in your own personal ways.  Work with your buddies and have fun defending\
      \ against hordes of zombies, keep from being overwhelmed, last out all the rounds,\
      \ and kill the boss for the win.  And it\u2019s all about how you do it!<br><br>Knockback\
      \ is a physics sandbox that challenges you to ask yourself  \u201Chow many ways\
      \ can I destroy the zombies?\u201D Go ahead play with fire! Throw \u2019em into\
      \ a building or smash \u2019em with a log rolling down a hill. Wanna suck the\
      \ zombies into a tight ball and zap \u2018em with lightning? You can do that.\
      \ Rain down sticky stones of fire onto their heads? Gotcha covered. Hit \u2018\
      em with a giant rolling stone that bowls down the baddies? Go for it!<br><br>Now\
      \ get out there and stick a snail snot rock to an unsuspecting zombie chin!<br><br>Notable\
