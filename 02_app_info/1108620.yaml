    review: 'What do I have to say about Gangsta Woman...


      This game is not only the peak of human evolution and engineering but this game
      is the perfect representation of the united states today. Yes there may be a
      couple of kinks that needs to be worked out but once you see past this, you
      psychologically feel the poetry that is within. The graphics are 10/10 no 1000/10
      they are a straight masterpiece. I will continue to love and appreciate this
      game and I hope that the amazing speed run community will too.'
