Well, it reminds me a bit of the Zelda series because the main character looks a bit like him, and the game play is quite primitive. Your overall goal is to recover some sort of emblems to restore something to somewhere. Story is the usual fantasy drivel, but the game is a fun slash and explore. It doesn't have a perk system or stat system, so when you level up the game just increases your hit points. You do collect coins which can be used at shops to buy such helpful things as health refills and bombs. Though it isn't open world, there are several different islands that open up once you get off the tutorial island, which should be renamed Tedious Island because of how boring it is. Though the islands don't have to be visited in any particular sequence, certain islands can not be opened up without getting something from some other island. I do wish the islands were easier to transverse. To get anywhere you have to weave your way through a series of ladders and bridges. A bit tedious and frustrating at times.\n\n\n\nconclusion\n\nsimple slash and explore. Zero customization and cliched story doesn't subtract from the simple primitive fun. Get it cheap.","timestamp_created":1610035825,"timestamp_updated":1610036359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49aXp7vYCda2nwQI="}
