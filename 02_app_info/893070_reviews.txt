Published 2018 with only a handful of reviews?  \n\nWant a validation of the quality of this game? = Look at the duration of gameplay from each review.\n\n[B] [u]This does not constitute a game.[/u] [/B]  I did not play for an hour.  I adjusted the settings for 20 minutes, finished the \"sample concept\" in 15, and tried to find anything else appealing the remainder of the time.  This is what happens when a content developer tries to create a game by themselves.  Beautiful dystopian playfields, poor environmental & character interactions, and zero replay potential.  The game is so short you will be scratching your head as to why it on Steam in the first place.\n\nI wanted to believe that it had to be a proof of concept or a kick starter because no one would call this an actual game, but then I have read enough to know this is the intentional finished product.  What little was made, is stunning and beautiful but a game is more then just a nice back drop.  It should present some challenges and have a storyline that does not just stop abruptly because the developers gave up.\n\n[b]Here is to hoping that this is a prelude to better games, but as it is I cannot recommend this one.
