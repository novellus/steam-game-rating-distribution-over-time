There has been an update and I can now see other bonus content so I am assuming the bonus game is working now.  I played this game on an other computer so I would have to play this game again to even see if the bonus game was there let alone to play it.\n\nI really disagree with the practice of needing a bonus game to finish the story which is why I never recommended an ERS game on big fish. But as there is only the CE version being sold on steam it's not as big a deal here.  This was one of the best series of games at the time of release years ago, it does feel dated but still a good game and hopefully now I can finish this game and play the others back to back I will finally understand the whole story! :) \n\n[strike]There are 2 other reviews saying the same thing and it's still not fixed- there is no bonus/extra content at all and this includes the bonus game.  There is a strategy guide and in it, it says the bonus game can be accessed in the extra area in the main menu the problem is there is no extra content.  I don't know why as this never happens in any other game, but I thought maybe the extra content would show up after you finish the main game but it doesn't.  To make matters even worse the main game ends on the worst cliffhanger, doesn't even attempt to try and finish the story and you need the bonus game to finish the story (as you do in all this series and a lot of ERS games).\n\nAs the dev knows about the problem as it's been reported in the reviews months ago, they are either unsupportive, deliberately false advertising a CE when it's a SE, either case is unacceptable and they need to be held unaccountable until this is fixed.  I have the other 2 games in this series in steam, but haven't played them here (I've played the SE version in big fish) both seem to have extras and although I can't see the bonus game I take it is there, as no one has said anything about it missing and it's just this game that has the problem.\n\nFor anyone who thinks we just don't know where the extras are, you can see from the big fish walkthrough where the extras are supposed to be in the main menu and you can see from my screenshot there isn't anything anywhere.\n\nhttps://www.bigfishgames.com/blog/walkthrough/haunted-halls-revenge-of-dr-blackmore-walkthrough/\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1751866927\n\nIf it says it's a CE then the very least it should have is a bonus game when you know there is a bonus game.[/strike]","timestamp_created":1558894806,"timestamp_updated":1592091777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521276593208312988","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/pKE2PICe8OGwgE="}
