    review: "Okay where to start, I got this in the sale and its not worth \xA33 and\
      \ before you think it yes I know thats cheap so why complain, its really glitchy,\
      \ I completed 4 out of 13 successfully, not because I suck but because every\
      \ time it would load with a car stuck inside the bus and you cannot move. The\
      \ only choice you have is to cancel the mission. The road is FAR too small for\
      \ the bus which makes it hard to turn around the corner which is worsened when\
      \ you have a bus stop right beside traffic lights and you need to turn right.\
      \ The game also glitches with the traffic lights if you back end in still in\
      \ when its amber it fines you and says you have run a red light. Its hard to\
      \ go faster around the corners right beside the lights due to narrow. I have\
      \ also had it when I have pulled up at a red light. It says I cut the light\
      \ but was no where near. Another bad thing is the camera, urk! when you pull\
      \ up to a stop if flips around so now you see the bus from the side, this is\
      \ so you can see the passengers go in (will explain glitch on this too) problem\
      \ is once you have shut the doors the camera spins but not at correct angle.\
      \ If you move the camera yourself so you can drive off straight it spins again\
      \ side to side as if the game doesn't understand you have moved it. Both versions\
      \ if you leave it or correct it will make you hit property and again be fined.\
      \ The camera has also got a tendency to flip so you are looking at and angled\
      \ side and you cannot drive straight and again hit things. Passengers glitch,\
      \ when they go inside they stand but you can hear a cash kaching noise when\
      \ they have paid. This sort of indicates that the NPC has now finished it action\
      \ and you can close the doors. How WRONG! I have killed three people and I'm\
      \ currently hiding behind my sofa waiting for the po po to break down my door\
      \ and have me on murder charges. I have even waiting after the noise to see\
      \ if they move or sit and they do not and still they die (my story I am sticking\
      \ to it lol). The game seems to have a lot of spacial recognition problems.\
      \ This tends to fine, break, kill or glitch with stuck car spawns the game,\
      \ it does the same with the stops, they're a white border which glows (like\
      \ a seven shape) you fit in this by lining up you nose with the line. Doesn't\
      \ work well, sometimes you will be over or under or miles away. You do know\
      \ your route, if you press M you will get a map up which has a highlighted green\
      \ path for you and dots which show your stops the next stop ahead is red. The\
      \ game is a good concept and I won't deny I'm a bit let down as I was looking\
      \ forward to playing this and having some fun but its really ropy for me and\
      \ the glitch (mostly the car, made me think is it two transformers getting it\
      \ on the way they are stuck together) drives me crazy. My advice, I'd avoid\
      \ and look for another version ."
