      \ trouble again.</i><br><br>For the sake of convenience, vampire lord Reimilia\
      \ Scarlet release scarlet mist to blind the sun. No doubt such stupid behavior\
      \ will definitely result in a tragedy. Look! Reimu and Marisa are coming to\
      \ teach her a lesson.<br><br>What is different is that Reimu and Marisa use\
      \ dummies called \u201CNil Souls\u201D to defeat opponents this time. Come on!\
      \ Let\u2019s choose your soldiers , pick up your weapons , dodge opponents\u2019\
      \ bullets and beat them down.<br><br>We firmly believe that this brand new scarlet\
      \ mist anomaly will keep company with you during your playing of about 20 hours.<h2\

      \ turn-based barrage system.</h2> <br> <br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/941300/extras/gameIntro01.jpg?t=1586743410\"\
      \ /><br><br><u>1-1 What is the turn-based barrage system?</u><br> <br>To cut\
      \ a long story short, it is a system syncretizing turn-based game and barrage.\
      \ A system in which the barrages will move according to preset trajectory after\
      \ players complete operation. A systemwhichletsplayersthink twice before every\
      \ character\u2019s every step so that their characters won\u2019t be hurt by\
      \ changing barrages. So this unique system requires players to have the ability\
      \ of deducing situation they will face after several rounds and scan changes\
      \ of battlefield in the dynamic perspective.Just think about how you try to\
      \ guess your friend\u2019s next step when playing chess, then you may understand\
      \ the system better.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/941300/extras/gameIntro02.jpg?t=1586743410\"\
      \ /><br>\u25B2 This turn-based barrage system nearly like this in the game.<br><br><u>1-2\
      \ How can I enjoy the turn-based barrage system?</u><br><br>The answer is the\
      \ diversity of barrage itself. In this aspect, TouHou Project\u2019s official\
      \ games and other barrage games have given us a lot of reference. Barrages in\
      \ the game can be classified as:<u>regular barrages</u>,<u>random barrages</u>,<u>tracking\
      \ barrages</u> and <u>blocking barrages</u>.Meanwhile, bosses\u2019skills can\
      \ add more changes to barrages. Let\u2019s see two examples. Rumia can hide\
      \ barrages, which means palyers can\u2019t see her barrages completely. As a\
      \ result, players have to deduce trajectory of barrages according to their acquaintance\
      \ with barrages and then dodge them. Hon Meirin is good at knockback, so chances\
      \ are that even if players have dodged barrages, Hon Merin can still use her\
      \ skills to beat them back to the area surrounded by barrages or even to a barrage.\
      \ We hope that we can combine bosses\u2019skills with rules of barrages to create\
      \ more plentiful experience.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/941300/extras/gameIntro03.jpg?t=1586743410\"\

      \ How can we cope with barrages?</u><br><br>We provide three ways:<u>dodge</u>,<u>just\
      \ stand still</u>and<u>elimination</u>.Here we don\u2019t to talk about the\
      \ first and second ways more. As for the third way, players\u2019 characters\
      \ will have the ability of eliminating barrages. For example, we design some\
      \ skills which allow players to eliminate barrages in a certain area, and some\
      \ spell cards which can attack bosses while eliminating barrages in a large\
      \ area. We believe that properly using skills of eliminating barrages while\
      \ attacking bosses, together with barrage itself, will create something interesting.\
      \ We hope we can make the system more attractive as possible as we can.<br><br><img\

      \ Here is Master Spark, eliminates abundant barrages in a line, releases powerful\

      \ sure you can refuse such a mighty spell card?<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/941300/extras/gameIntro05_e.jpg?t=1586743410\"\
      \ /><br>\u25B2 Besides active attacking skills, some supporting skills also\
      \ have the effect of eliminating barrages. How to use these skills properly\

      \ developing skills in the following days. After all, combos between skills\
      \ decide whether the game is attractive. So far, we\u2019ve designed and classified\
      \ skills as following:<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/941300/extras/gameIntro06.jpg?t=1586743410\"\

      \ as an opponent. Servants have their own action patterns as well as interactive(with\
      \ their masters of course) action patterns. How and when to cope with these\

      \ System of team</u><br><br>\u2018TouHou Nil Soul\u2019 is a turn-based barrage\
      \ game requiring all characters ally against opponents. At most five characters\
      \ are permitted in one team. More characters will be unlocked with the exploration\
      \ of storyline. Each character has different position and feature. Using these\
      \ features properly to foster strengths and circumvent weaknesses will make\
      \ your combat more efficient. What\u2019s more, each character will have following\
      \ designing:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Potential combating statistics.<br></li><li>\
      \ Three or four innate skills(we will improve this aspect in the following editions)<br></li><li>\

      \ of items</u><br><br>We design the system of items of course. Putting different\
      \ items into right slots can considerably raise characters\u2019 statistics,\
      \ which will do help to your following battles. Here is some information about\
      \ items:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The only way to gain items so far is:\
      \ First, win a battle. Second, go to Kourindouand get some dormant items. Third,\
      \ infuse \u2018Nil Soul\u2019 into items and waken them. Now you can use them.<br></li><li>\
      \ Wakened items have random statistics.<br></li><li> Different levels will randomly\
      \ drop different items. For example, if you get a Reimu\u2019s weapon in \u2018\
      Hakurei Shrine\u2019, then next time you may see this weapon in another level\
      \ instead of \u2018Hakurei Shrine\u2019. The reason why we design this mechanism\
      \ is that we hope we can avoid letting players play one level repeatedly just\
      \ for one specific item.<br></li><li> So far, each character has her private\
      \ weapon but armors and accessories can be used universally<br></li><li> All\
      \ dormant items you get from all levels will only exist before next time you\
      \ get new dormant items. In other words, if you don\u2019t waken dormant items\
      \ you get from the last battle during the period between the last battle and\
      \ next battle, these dormant items will be replaced by new dormant items</li></ul><br><img\

      \ /><br>\u25B2 fter you win a battle, you can get some dormant items in Kourindou.\
      \ Since the \u2018Nil Soul\u2019 is finite, it deserves to think twice before\
      \ wakening items.<br><br><u>3-3 System of levels</u><br><br>We design a map\
      \ ranging from Hakurei Shrine to Scarlet Devil Mansion.What\u2019s more, you\
      \ will see some special landmarks on this map, they correspond to battlefields\

      \ area.<br></li><li> You can challenge every area repeatedly.<br></li><li> You\

      \ first and second ways more. As for the third way, players\u2019 characters\
      \ will have the ability of eliminating barrages. For example, we design some\
      \ skills which allow players to eliminate barrages in a certain area, and some\
      \ spell cards which can attack bosses while eliminating barrages in a large\
      \ area. We believe that properly using skills of eliminating barrages while\
      \ attacking bosses, together with barrage itself, will create something interesting.\

      \ items:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The only way to gain items so far is:\

      Hakurei Shrine\u2019, then next time you may see this weapon in another level\
      \ instead of \u2018Hakurei Shrine\u2019. The reason why we design this mechanism\

      \ weapon but armors and accessories can be used universally<br></li><li> All\
