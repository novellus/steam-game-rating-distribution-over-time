    about_the_game: Minako is kind of like a tower defense game.  The goal is to defend
      your castle for 30 nights.  To do that you need to hire local villagers and
      assign them jobs.  The key to victory is to keep in mind each villagers stats
      (str, dex, int) and skills and assign them accordingly.  For example villagers
      with high strength will do better collecting wood or iron and will fare better
      on the front lines of battle.  But it's not as straight forward as that.  Keep
      a sharp eye and observe them well to develop your own strategy.

    review: 'Hard game! But I liked it very much!


      Pros

      - Nice pixel style

      - Finding everything out was joyful for me

      - If I had paid 3 bucks I wouldn''t be unhappy

      - Hard to master

      - More complex than it seems in the beginning


      Some suggestions, maybe the developer will update the game in the future.

      The building sound has a lot of bass, it was a little bit annoying.

      You get coins but pay in G like Gold? Why not C?

      Other music for the night instead of no music?

      I had a weird bug where a villager hadn''t enough to eat but wouldn''t work
      but also wouldn''t eat. The villager turned completely useless.

      Evade seems a bit overpowered.

      Scrolling in the menus was very slow.

      It''s a little bit on the slow side.

      Maybe make the intro skippable on the second playthrough.

      Translation of the little bit of text? Maybe German? I would happily do it :D


      But! I still liked the game and can recommend it, especially for this bargain
      price :D If there is an update in the future I would be really happy!'
