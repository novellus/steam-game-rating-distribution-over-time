    review: "I love how clunky and buggy this game is. The lighting was 10/10. I was\
      \ amazed by the insanely good jumpscare in the ''W.C'' don't know what that\
      \ stands for... I'm assuming washroom but idk. Love how I could barely get up\
      \ the stairs in the lighthouse because the game is just that clunky. You even\
      \ had to tell us to jump at one point on the lighthouse stairs because they\
      \ are just so poorly made. Also you guys barely put any effort into helping\
      \ the player find damn keys. I couldn't even get passed the bar because... Well?\
      \ Where's the damn key for the locked door? And the flashlight. Oh man you guys\
      \ nailed it. Once it goes out you can't see shit! And the battery drains so\
      \ god damn mother broccoli fast it's unbelievable. At the end of the day. it's\
      \ just another terrible product on steam. \n\nP.S: I could make a better game\
      \ with my beautiful furry eyes closed in a week. It's not that hard just saying.\
      \ Stop scamming people for their money. I hit the refund button on this game\
      \ so fecking fast it's funny. I rather my money to go in to quality instead\
      \ of garbage. \n\nP.S: My grammar is better than yours and my main language\
      \ is French. SMH\n\nP.S: yes i'm a furry and you just got rekt"
