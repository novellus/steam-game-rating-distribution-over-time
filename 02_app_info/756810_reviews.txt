I've played it +1000 hours on a different account. \n\nIt's very simple, easy to learn, a lifetime to master. \n\n5 different types of humans, plus a pod species much like Alien(s). You can choose or do it random. Six different maps. 1-on-1 up to 5-on-1. You can call it a city builder, but then again, you could call Napoleon an adventurer.\n\nNever plays the same way twice.","timestamp_created":1608788078,"timestamp_updated":1608788078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw273PyfYCdLTXvAI="}
