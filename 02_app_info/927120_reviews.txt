Very little detail between the space worlds of the single player and muliplayer. I saw a floating turd and about died in laughing. This game is lovely show of the GAME ENGINE itself not the game. The game menu is very self explained, but it is more of a logical lay out than artistic pretty buttons, (normal for early access but way more games with early access with more feature complete at similar pricing). Lay out of Modes are very text file look than an option of choice. Most people would understand, 10 bucks, I would like at least ONE complete level or mode of some type. \n\n****(this is normal in beta games)****Another problem, once I paid for the main video game, demo, the demo will not run once you installed the normal game. Actually, no option to actually play the demo without completely uninstalling the game, making a new account. I seen more complete early access games, again this game is sample of the engine behind it. That is something, yet, most of these features have been seen being used in other game engines by using plug ins already created by community of gamers and programmers alike. \n\nThe fact I am being asked for 9.99 for this game, is false, I am paying 9.99 for an engine software being built. I cannot recommend the game but I can with the engine behind it, its game demo of future game engine, which we seen games come out amazing from that even if they were over done due to the publishers example halo below. As a game this is not worthy 10 buck game. the engine is worth it, that is why I am recommending the game, is for the engine to be more complete. \n\nIf you read this review, have no bloody idea how much work it is to lay out engine from the ground up, realize, making a new software with tools for people to use is very hard. Why not Unity... well seems like the makers have something to prove.\n\nBeing around many studios from AAA to indie in my personal life and business life. I do not doubt this engine along with this game will be amazing and complete, it will be many more years before we see something like NO MAN SKY, at least when its complete, it will not release in failure like NO MAN SKY. You see what you get from this game and the photos. The team isn't trying to hide how the game is. \n\nGood example of a Game Demo turn into bad ass game was HALO, we knew back then the studio was smaller with a big publisher. HALO was a demo for the xbox hardware and engine. This game, I feel can be better from the start, by avoiding the AAA publishing motto of business and keeping to the indie way. I recommend the game for the game engine behind it, like I said HALO was my favorite game it was basically slap together demo by AAA publisher over hyped, this game Quantum Covenant can be better than HALO or NO MAN SKY, don't need the hype. Also the fact it will have its own engine, it will be up there with the Doom for game engine hall of fame in my personal eyes which got me to start gaming was the engine. I would love another engine for my son to be able to use without some charge behind it with multi ways of connecting the pieces together.","timestamp_created":1607195434,"timestamp_updated":1607197867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4v6edmvYCf8nJtwI="}
