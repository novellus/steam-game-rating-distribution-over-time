    about_the_game: "Hello everyone, I am a college student who just graduated in\
      \ 2019. After graduation, this game has been independently developed for half\
      \ a year. Procedures, planning, numerical value, conception, creativity and\
      \ so on are all completed by myself. Of course, I also want to thank the art\
      \ students who participated in the production of this project.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nFirst of all, I'd like to say sorry to you that although all the pictures\
      \ of this game are hand drawn by art students one by one, there are still many\
      \ shortcomings in our game pictures. What we do is a kind of Isaac dungeon game.\
      \ However, because of the funds and other reasons, the pictures are far from\
      \ Isaac's, which I have to admit It will be improved in the future development.\
      \ However, this game is very interesting in playing methods. All the players\
      \ who have played this game say that the mechanism of picking up weapons is\
      \ very fun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe core of the game is similar to Isaac, but\
      \ there are many differences. In this game, players can absorb their weapons\
      \ by killing the enemies (there is a maximum number of absorption), and can\
      \ freely combine absorption to define their own attack mode. The combination\
      \ mode is also changeable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, there are many features\
      \ in this game:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1.6 roles with different abilities.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\n2. More than 60 different monster types.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3. Various\
