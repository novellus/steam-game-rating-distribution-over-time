    about_the_game: Shepherds of the Abyss is an action-packed, multiplayer tower
      defense game - one inspired by some of the best tower defense mods for Warcraft
      3. Some of its key features include:<h2 class="bb_tag">&quot;mazing&quot;</h2>&quot;Mazing&quot;
      is the art of filling a wide-open space in a tower defense game with your towers
      to build the longest possible path (the maze) that the enemy's units must travel
      before reaching your throne. &quot;Mazing&quot; is a core skill in Shepherds
      of the Abyss, and it's put to the test with random obstacles and waypoints spawned
      each game to prevent you from memorizing the strongest maze setup.<h2 class="bb_tag">unique
      Unit Buffs</h2>Every unit in Shepherds of the Abyss is granted various buffs
      with significant strengths, such as making them heavily armored, increasing
      their movement speed, granting them high regeneration, or giving them shields.  The
      towers all provide hard counters to these buffs, so building the correct towers
      in optimal locations is key to success.<h2 class="bb_tag">empowering towers
      </h2>Shepherds of the Abyss is a dual resource tower defense game.  Gold is
      used to build and upgrade, while the power of souls you've collected from dying
      units is used to empower towers on a wave to wave basis.  Empowering towers
      unleashes additional strength and functionality to help them overcome the units'
      buffs.  For example, some towers gain damage over time while others snare units
      they attack.<h2 class="bb_tag">round Separation</h2>Gameplay is separated into
      multiple phases - Preparation Phase, where all building, upgrading, and empowering
      is done, and then Combat Phase, where units attack all players at once and souls
      are harvested.<h2 class="bb_tag">Incoming Wave Manipulation</h2>All of the buffs
      possessed by the incoming wave of units appear in a grid during Preparation
      Phase (see screenshots above).  Buffs that are adjacent multiply each other's
      strength, so it's important to move matching buffs apart.  However, the movements
      of these buffs are limited, so you must study the entire grid and make your
      moves carefully.<h2 class="bb_tag">included Game Modes:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Single-player
      Survival - survive as many waves as possible.<br></li><li>Cooperative Survival
      - survive as many waves as possible with the help of a friend.<br></li><li>Head-to-Head
      - play against another player in a 1v1 battle.</li></ul>

    review: Here is a "tower defense" game that falls very flat. It just lacks variety,
      not nearly enough variety in towers. It gets boring very quickly. The soul catching
      mechanic is very awful, you end up getting nothing for many waves because of
      its cool down, just an awful way to do this. This is obviously a game that the
      developer probably planned much more for and then gave up half way through and
      just released it.
