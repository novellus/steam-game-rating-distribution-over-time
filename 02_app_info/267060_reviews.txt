But it's often on sale and I got this in a bundle for no extra cost. It's an OK game for $1 or less if you like dumb angry birds clones.\n\nSteam needs a neutral option, it's not borked enough for me to thumbs down, but I don't really like it as much as a thumbs up normally implies. It exists, it's OK and it's a typical time waster that doesn't bother to be anything special.\n\nThumbs up but only for free in a bundle or super cheap on sale.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]","timestamp_created":1589139567,"timestamp_updated":1609000473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494041591882705688","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mtr5z/YCcLj0hgI="}
