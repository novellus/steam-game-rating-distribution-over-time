I can tell that dev put a lot of effort into it,  but it's one of the most frustrating 'platformers' I ever played (intentionally). One of those experiences that are designed to kill you just to make a joke, I am talking like constant beginner traps, confusing navigation, and difficult platforming - not by mistake. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's just really annoying. You may have noticed a huge number of achievements that are attached to things like deaths, makes for a good achievement hunting game, I guess.  The sad thing is, it's one of the more creative games that I played recently and it has some funky mechanics, so the difficulty even on low settings can be an obstacle. I am actually really excited to explore it, and at the same time, I just don't want to play it due to ******* checkpoints. If I dare to say this, some people might like this as an experimental exploration game (reminds me of Zzzz-Zzzz-Zzzz a lot). However, I think that I would enjoy the game a lot more if it was a bit more friendly and focused on exploration instead of subverting my expectations by intentionally killing me. Not a bad game, not for everyone though. If I would fix one thing - make more checkpoints between the chapters, I don't want to climb mount Everest each time I misjudge a distance.
