    about_the_game: Ruine is a 2D dungeon crawler that scratches the classic fantasy
      RPG itch. Fight creatures to level up. Delve into the darkest corners of derelict
      ruins in search of treasure and gear. But to keep what you find, you must first
      make it out &quot;alive.&quot; <i>Using the term loosely.</i><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1071660/extras/Promo_1.gif?t=1608716261"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>The rules of nature have become rather twisted,
      you see. Long ago, the kingdom entered an age of darkness and decay. Fog covered
      the land as unrecognizable things crawled from the crypts, and once tamed beasts
      turned feral with little regard for their owners. Now not a soul is left alive,
      nor are they allowed to die, mere husks doomed to seek fleeting joy in the forgotten
      kingdom of Ruine for eternity.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1071660/extras/Brothers2.gif?t=1608716261"

    short_description: Ruine is a sidescrolling fantasy RPG with roguelike elements
      and a souls-like setting. The world of Ruine is amorphous, its past long forgotten
      by most. Forests and ruins are inhabited by creatures that once lived, and now
      refuse to die. Use what you can find, craft or purchase to eradicate them.

    review: "Pro\xB4s:\nPrice\nNice items,weapons and armor stats.\nThe graphics in\
      \ bit style:Monster,animations,etc.\nCharacter stats:Str,Agi,Int,Con (RPG Love)\n\
      (-2nd Edit-)\nThe developer listens to suggestion and executes it well with\
      \ the game, 2nd map has ranged enemies.\nLow dodge works and hits for some enemies\
      \ good addition.\nNew cool relics.\n+Relic upgrade is very nice so relics can\
      \ get stronger.\n\n\nCon's:\n(Lack of content:The developer is working on it)\n\
      \n\nSuggestions:More skills,versatile attacks:combos,spells,talent trees,\n\
      crouch or low dodge(also for enemies),Push enemies away,ranged enemies(ranged\
      \ weapons),\nmaybe ladders to platforms to escape enemies or use as tactics\
      \ to fight,\nmaybe co-op,Higher difficulty,RNG random dimension entrance,for\
      \ reward or curse),Gambling for gold or item chance,\nEnhancing items and give\
      \ effect fire dmg etc.\n\nJust suggestion you pick whatever.\nThanks for the\
      \ game :)"
