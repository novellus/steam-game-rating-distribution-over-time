    about_the_game: The Class 31 is a classic British workhorse just waiting to get
      to work in Train Simulator. <br><br><br>At a time when steam traction looked
      dated, the Class 31 was designed to modernise freight and passenger haulage
      and was part of the new modern image sweeping across British Railways. Since
      its introduction in 1957, where it was originally intended for service in the
      Eastern Region, the Class 31 has become increasingly common in both Western
      and London Midland regions too. Whether it was passenger or freight duties the
      Class 31 was and is a very versatile locomotive and has survived in service
      for 53 years. The Class 31 for Train Simulator includes the Class 31 in BR Blue,
      Railfreight Grey and Civil Engineers Grey and Yellow Liveries, as well as appropriate
      freight wagons.<h2 class="bb_tag">Includes</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Class 31
