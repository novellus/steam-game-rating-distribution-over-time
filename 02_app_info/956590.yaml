    review: "One of the worst and absolute LAZIEST snake games I've ever played in\
      \ all my days (and I've played a ton of these snake games in my years)\n\nThe\
      \ game has NO OPTIONS and EVEN NO WAY TO EXIT THE GAME!  You literally have\
      \ to ALT-F4 Hard close the game just to exit the game!!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D3TD6adg9I&feature=youtu.be\n\
      \nThere is NO WAY TO DIE.. \n\n..THERE IS NO THREAT.\n\n..THERE IS NO SCORE.\n\
      \nTHERE IS NOTHING EXCEPT ZZZZZZZZ until you decide to quit.. and then the most\
      \ action you'll get is needing to forcefully close the game to beat it!  You\
      \ just closed the game!  You're a WINNER!  ...Don't be a loser and buy and play\
      \ this game ...You automatically WIN!  \n\nMy Score:  A BIG FAT ZERO.  \n\n\
      There are a thousand much better snake games available for FREE, both on phones\
      \ and online.    \n\nTry any of these options below for FREE for a much better\
      \ snake game experience:\n\n- Slither.io\n- Snakes3D\n- glTron (glton.org)\n\
      - playsnake.org\n- Wormax.io\n- Worm.is here on Steam"
