And some of the translations (subtitles) are on the formal side... you know? Like when English isn't the first language of a well-educated person (if that makes sense.)\n\nThat was forgotten after the first two minutes. It's a well-crafted game with a unique charm. This is FMV at its best.\n\nI feel I got an incredible value for my $. I got in on sale, but it's totally worth the regular price and more. \n\nBye, I've got to go now. Eger needs me.","timestamp_created":1605999880,"timestamp_updated":1605999880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526627242565155029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9KzD9vUCfpXirwI="}
