    review: This is one of my favorite games--It's like a cross between Clue and Mafia/Werewolf,
      with a few extra puzzle elements thrown in to make it fresh and interesting.  So
      long as you have at least one person to join you (you can add bots to games
      if you don't have more than one), I'd say you're getting your money's worth.  Even
      without other people to play with, simply playing against bots is a fun way
      to pass the time and get your brain working in a new way without wearing it
      out.
