    review: 'This is good scenario. Best I''ve played so far. I''ve never had so much
      fun playing this game till now. With this, Keen made something unique in this
      game. Kind of a story with journey of lone survivor.


      I didn''t try it when it was released, having this in library, and thinking,
      it''s just next game mode, some setting with some planet. But it turned out,
      that it got nice and evolving story with expanding situation, which makes it
      good. And it''s done well I would say.

      It''s nice difference to standard survival gameplay, With this, starting in
      some abandoned base where some systems are working (and some not), and having
      vehicles at start was very nice difference. Along the play, scenario gives you
      next vehicles, ships and bases to explore, to repair and use, which makes it
      somehow different than just a survival, it makes you feel a journey. It''s like
      a different game. Construction of it work like with triggers, when you drive
      to next base, you get some new clue, or GPS marker so you may follow next.


      Its a good balance between survival and roleplay with interesting story. Maybe
      some of you which expect first person shooter would be bored, but this Space
      Engineers not FPS. Here shooting happens from time to time but it''s not main
      purpose of game. It''s important to get feeling of presssed and attacked. And
      this is how it works, you dirve somewhere? You got attacked by missile drones,
      better get prepared. But also it is about more realistic slow pace eploration.
      Where fights are done with caution and approaching. Distances are far, travel
      requires vehicles, wheater makes harsh visibility. Lack of resouces force you
      to loot bases and move all this back to base by truck. Its making you feel of
      lone survivor. Really nice.


      Pros:

      - Interesting storyline

      - Good pace for fight, not so much, so you got time for travels and repairs

      - Nice exploration, bases, vehicles, broken system to repair, bases to loot

      - Good locations in mountains, weather system makes feeling of planet really
      well, blizzard creates harsh visibility, and gives feeling of bad conditions
      (I got lost few times in snow roads)

      - Very nice loot, its planned nice, you dont need to drill&mine, you mainly
      shoot and loot, which then allow you to repair and expand

      - Nice vehicles and machinery to find in journey, to repair and use. You don''t
      need to create vehicles from scratch, just explore, find, repair and you got
      it. I even learned form it how to create some of nice machinery,


      Cons:

      - Due to many bases and objects, also AI flying around, it may freeze ocassionally.
      But this is common problem for SE, and older computers. There is just sometimes
      the point, where it''s too many objects and things to handle in one time by
      computer, so it may freeze for moment. Same can happen in survival, when you
      will build few bases here and there. It''s really depends on what toster you
      use for playing.


      From all scenarios, and game modes, this one gives best roleplay + survival
      + fight combination. In my opinion.


      Good one, and worth it.'
