Sometimes my sessions are as short as 4-5 minutes before it suddenly crashes. I'm not a fan of the games artstyle, and the game uses far too many memes in its jokes/card art to the point were it danced dangerously with the line between \"referential humor\" and outright plagiarism due to poverty of ideas. \n\nThe game itself is actually kind of fun. The equip mechanic is pretty novel and a neat concept. I didn't get too far due to all the crashes, but I felt there was a lack of interesting card types. I was playing the wizard and I simply could not find any other new spells to add to the base starting deck, so I had nothing to spend my currency on. Nearly all of them are some variation of \"deal X damage to target(s) on Y number of squares.\" It made nearly all the spells feel very samey. \n\nIf not for the crashes, for $0.99 I would say it is worth the time and money to try out to spend some downtime on. However, until that is figured out, your better off saving your money for something else.","timestamp_created":1606964116,"timestamp_updated":1606964116,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwos+hk/YCerfztgI="}
