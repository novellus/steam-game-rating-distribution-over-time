    review: 'A decent, if short game. I found it decent for the price.

      Part of a set of games, that all follow the same style, with mostly only what
      characters are available, and the scenery seeming to change (rather like the
      Street Fighter series)


      The gameplay involves moving from one room to another, with a fight in each
      room.

      The mechanics involved in that are explained early on and clearly.

      Most rooms you fight a single enemy, some you fight two.

      Most of the gameplay focuses on learning the attack patterns of each enemy,
      while focusing more on dodging than attacking, as there is no time limit to
      any fight I have seen.

      There are several characters you can choose from, and the only negative I can
      say for the game is the trial/error in picking your preferred character, as
      you can only test their abilities after no longer having the ability to swap
      (most carry one of several weapons, and only the pure-melee character is labelled
      as such in game)

      3 carry a basic machine gun (including the default) one carries a shotgun, two
      carry miniguns, two carry sniper rifles, and one carries only a sword.


      Upgrading stats happens after each fight, as each boss drops several items that
      do so, though you get to pick only one each fight. Every several rooms will
      be a quiet room, with 1-5 upgrade items (that again, you get to pick only one)

      Focus more on Luck (the clover) as it upgrades the strength of the other items
      (IE at Luck 1, you will mostly only see +1 items, at Luck 10, you will rarely
      see less than a +3)


      All in all, short and simple, but for the price very well made.'
