It is easy to forget which direction you are heading.\n\nThe combat system is excellent. Each character has a number of magic spells and special skills to choose from, and each enemy is weak against some of these. But since magic can run low, and special skills are not always available, the strategy depends on the situation specific to each battle. By the time you figure out the best strategy for a particular group of enemies, your characters have levelled up with new skills, or you've moved on to a different area with new enemies. In this way, the battles stay fresh.\n\nI have to admit, I quit the game at a point early enough that I may not be the best person to review it. Returning to the game weeks after I left, I was stuck at an intersection where I was coerced to fight a boss which was impossible to beat at that time, and had a choice of three paths to take. One of them was back the way I came, but I couldn't remember which one. After unsuccessfully challenging the boss several times, I got discouraged from continuing. I might come back and finish it later, then possibly rewrite my review.","timestamp_created":1493225562,"timestamp_updated":1493225562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574045002460479736","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+bvL1dsCe9/Zdw=="}
