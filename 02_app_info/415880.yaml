    review: "The Good: A fun, solid spiritual successor to Windjammers that's easy\
      \ to pick up and play and difficult to master\n\nThe bad: Built around a Overwatch/Rocket\
      \ League model that requires multiple games to unlock anything, most of which\
      \ are pallete swap skins, rarely used emotes, and easy to miss avatars/player\
      \ titles. Or you can spend forever trying to get money to unlock the three extra\
      \ characters. With a game built around online play, there aren't enough players\
      \ to find a game regularly, except MAYBE on certain peak hours/days. You can\
      \ play against ghosts of online players that somehow behave like the real players,\
      \ so as long as you have some internet access, you can always play a game against\
      \ bots, but without it, there's only offline couch co-op/Lan - I don't think\
      \ there is offline bot play. These problems make it tough to recommend spending\
      \ money on this game unless you get it on sale.\n\nOh, and it's one of those\
      \ microtransactiony games, where you don't earn much out of standard play. The\
      \ good news is that the highest cost currency bundle costs about $20, which\
      \ I think will be enough to unlock the remaining characters and some loot boxes\
      \ for skins and such, but i wouldn't be surprised if it didn't unlock everything.\
      \ \n\nDiscJam is worth a purchase on sale, especially at less than $4. But the\
      \ lack of players, near online-only requirement, and MTX model makes it tough\
      \ to recommend @ full price."
