So don't consider this game as part of this package.\nThe rest of the games are as described: concentration and some math skills required which gives some good exercise for your brain.  \nI would recommend this game even with its obvious '3Solitaire' flaw because of its low price.","timestamp_created":1574794988,"timestamp_updated":1574794988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnpHG1O4Cd8P13AE="}
