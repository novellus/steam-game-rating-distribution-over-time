    about_the_game: "Tip Top is an arcade style climbing game with procedurally generated\
      \ routes that never repeat themselves!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt features a gripping\
      \ single player campaign that has you exploring all corners of the globe while\
      \ making sure not to fall to your (perma)death.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe player\
      \ uses the innovative control scheme to move the characters hands from one hold\
      \ to the next while making sure to be as efficient as possible. You only have\
      \ a limited amount of stamina to use in order to reach the peak. If you run\
      \ out of stamina or miss a hold you'll fall!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut! The twist\
      \ on the roguelike genre is that you never have to die. Careful players will\
      \ try routes several times while clipping their rope to the wall before taking\
      \ any risks. Skilled players will be those that find the right balance between\
      \ risk and rationality and reach the peak in peace. Players that climb too carefully\
      \ may never reach the top, as they\u2019ll waste too much energy clipping in\
      \ to the bolts."
