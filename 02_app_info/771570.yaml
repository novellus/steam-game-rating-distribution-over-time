    review: "Could have been a good game, but seems like the developers abandoned\
      \ it. The sounds are uneven, as explosions are extremely loud compared to other\
      \ sounds. After surviving it gets WAAY to difficult.. Too hard to survive the\
      \ other rounds. \n\nOverall: Not worth it."
