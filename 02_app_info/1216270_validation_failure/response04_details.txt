An exoskeleton is all that keeps you standing, however it is just a help, so with broken legs giving inputs is not a good idea. But you managed to save a grappling hook and a laser pistol from your shipwreck. One for each hand. The crash was so hard you now are in a deep cave-system in the comet you crashed on. It all is quiet, until you hear some weird noises and see some green being running towards you...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis game is played with just 2 keys, by default LMB (shoot the laser cannon) and RMB (shoot the grappling hook\/hold to grapple towards it). It is a jump and run adventure with the twist that you cant jump... or run. Broken legs are not made for that kind of action.","about_the_game":"The crash on the asteroid really hurt you.

The asteroid you landed on, however, is not a safe place. Danger is just around the corner and the entire comet seems to be about to collapse.","supported_languages":"English<strong>*<\/strong><br><strong>*<\/strong>languages with full audio support","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1216270\/header.jpg?t=1585931620","website":null,"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br><\/li><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo E7500<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 128 MB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Intel G41 Express Chipset<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 128 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>"},"legal_notice":"All visual, audio, design, or other forms of art, in the product named \"Asterook\", belong to \"Maffin e.U.\".<br \/>\r\nYou are allowed to use this art inside the bounds of the \"Creative commons\" license.
