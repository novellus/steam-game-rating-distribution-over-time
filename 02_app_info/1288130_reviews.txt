Where to begin...\n\nStory mode:\n\nChapter 1 - Managed to beat all the levels here. Level 2 took me 2 or 3 attempts to complete since that had a slight difficulty spike, and the last level of the chapter... holy frick is the timer tight (managed to get it second try, somehow). Fun overall, though.\n\nChapter 2 - The first level of this chapter is hot garbage. It's too dark, and even if you turn the brightness up to max, it doesn't really make it fun, even if it makes it playable. Like, you get poked by an enemy and you gotta restart, mister. What even is my goal in this level? lol. So yeah, I never cared about chapter 2 because of this.\n\nChallenge mode: Level 1 took me 3 tries to complete because the jump in this game is a major cuck (try jumping along the back bit of the level... ugh). Level 2 was super creative; loved that one. Level 3... very cool idea, but the jumps are WAY too precise, and ended up giving up after a few attempts. What's worse is that if you die, the level doesn't auto restart, you need to pause and restart yourself lol (the game basically just softlocks until you do that). I actually did make it to the final jump once, but when I failed that, that was the final straw.\n\nMultiplayer: Had 1 game against myself and won 9-0. In other words, this mode is dead because literally nobody bought this game. Which is a shame.\n\nGeneral stuff: If you're wearing headphones, depending on what camera angle you're at in the story levels (and multiplayer, I guess), the audio will sometimes only play in 1 ear, which can be super annoying. I actually had to check my headphones and ears the first time to make sure they were working properly, lol.\n\nOverall? It's ok, 6/10 for the concept and effort. Not sure if I'll play anymore though, and still on the fence about refunding it or not. But err...\n\nBUY THIS GAME SO MULTIPLAYER WON'T BE DEAD ANYMORE, DAMMIT!","timestamp_created":1604328454,"timestamp_updated":1604328454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw967bxPUCdPHnqwI="}
