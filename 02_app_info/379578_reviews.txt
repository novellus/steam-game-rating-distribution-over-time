The W10 version is indeed speedy for a high wing single engine. It handles really nicely, and is a great local sightseer type. There are dozens of liveries between the W8 and W10 versions as well as many different seat colors. Nothing flashy, but a darn good plane for short trips at low altitudes. \nThe GPS and auto pilot work great and I like that the window obstructing struts can be removed by the flick of a switch. \nThe tail dragging variants are tougher to take and line up from the cockpit view, but it’s not much of an issue if you switch to an external cam.","timestamp_created":1565916898,"timestamp_updated":1565916898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrfT6y+wCfoe30AE="}
