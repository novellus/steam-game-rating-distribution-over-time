I cant even figure out how to start a new game in explore mode.  should be simple.. just delete the old game and start new..nope not this p.o.s  when devs screw up simple simple things and make just trying to start a new game an impossible feat, it sucks every ounce of fun to be had right out of the game. I am really dissapointed with this game. I just wanted to start a new game, and spent an hour trying to figure out how. now I will just delete the game and never play it again.","timestamp_created":1610020904,"timestamp_updated":1610020904,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513888895511627197","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxKuu7vYCedygwQI="}
