    review: "This review will go over the units one by one.\n[b]--APC--[/b]\nThe APC\
      \ is extremely great, especially when paired up with the Special Force due to\
      \ its ability to be spammed. Seriously, the ability to spawn 65 AP units that\
      \ are tanks at the cost of 140 AP, and most importantly, [i]for free?[/i] Hell\
      \ yeah, I'll take that!\n[b]--Fanatic Rider(?)--[/b]\nMotorcycle dude that will\
      \ just crash into enemies. It's a bit costly, but for the damage it can deal\
      \ the risk could be worth it. Not really worth putting in as a unit unless you\
      \ just want to go with all Special Forces or.. something.\n[b]--Special Force--[/b]\n\
      The best unit by far in this pack, and my personal favorite. An absolute tank,\
      \ having about or over 1000 HP, allowing him to just be flung back by a laser\
      \ beam of Jupiter King, and able to tank about 3 shots from a Giridia-O (i think).\
      \ 65 AP and high production rate (or moderate) means you can always use this,\
      \ and when used in combination with the APC, it has great synergy. The landmine\
      \ has the capability of stopping projectiles, such as Rebel Riflemen bullets\
      \ or Bazooka shots, even tank shells as well. \n[b]--Stone Turtle--[/b]\nNot\
      \ really worth your time or even putting in as a unit due to how slow it is.\
      \ However, it works extremely effectively as a walking wall, having over 20k\
      \ health at approximately level 5 or something. 800 AP for a walking slab of\
      \ health like this doesn't sound bad, until you take into consideration that\
      \ it's a close range unit only. Its only attack is a stomp and firing rockets\
      \ via its special, so uh, not too bad, but its stomp deals a lot of damage.\n\
      [b]--SV-001 SLUG VER PM(?)--[/b]\nA mediocre tank unit that's pretty fast and\
      \ mobile with a tank cannon that.. fires tank shells. Its not too special and\
      \ its special attack can be something that is pretty mediocre or on par with\
      \ other tank units, and it doesn't have anything special to bring to the table.\n\
      [b]--TOWER BOWLING BALL TANK THING WITH THEE GUERILLA DUDE--[/b]\nI got lazy\
      \ and couldn't search up the name of this or even log onto the game to find\
      \ out myself. Its pretty useless and is on par with the NOP-03 Sauriba(?) and\
      \ is bassically just a reskin. Less armored and lower profile is all I can most\
      \ likely say.\n[b]--BLACK HOUND--[/b]\nMediocre and pretty bad tank for its\
      \ cost. Over 300 AP for a crappy long range attack, bad close range attack and\
      \ a bad special? Its special can only really mow down infantry, and its close\
      \ range attack is something that shoulda been its long range. The long range\
      \ is a mortar which goes over the heads of infantry if they get too close, which\
      \ just sucks. \n[b]--RESKIN REBEL VEHICLES--[/b]\nThe Bradley is alright I guess,\
      \ or just plain out bad or on par with the already existing one. its special\
      \ attack is replaced with more rockets,w hich is neat. It might have longer\
      \ range or something. Don't bother using it.\nThe DI-COKKA is pretty alright\
      \ or on par with the actual DI-COKKA if you can't manage to get it. Nothing\
      \ special to say.\nThe Giridia-O is on par with the actual Giridia O, but might\
      \ have more health. Its damage output might be the same though.\n\nJust get\
      \ it for the special forces."
