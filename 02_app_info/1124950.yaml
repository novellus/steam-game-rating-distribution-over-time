    review: 'The Supaplex remake in full 3D. Looks and feels quite different, but
      it''s still Supaplex, with its 111 levels.

      There are quite a lot of remakes of this classic arcade/logic game, but adding
      an additional dimension to the graphics after so many years make it totally
      worth to replay at least some of the levels.'
