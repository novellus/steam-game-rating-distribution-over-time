    review: "A failed Tower Defense game, indeed it is rather a puzzle game. The graphics\
      \ are nice and software runs fine, without bugs, but there isn't better to say.\
      \ The mechanics is good at theory: there are 9 types of towers, each one with\
      \ 4 parameters to upgrade 4 ranks, and about the same number of foe kinds. \n\
      \nBut gameplay soon reveals that there ins't freedom to choice emplacements,\
      \ zoom cannot be fixed to desirable distance so maps are too small, there isnt\
      \ way to know in advance when a wave begins and which kind of enemies will come,\
      \ destroying the sense of build planning typical of the genre, and the worst\
      \ issue: upgrades are expensive but aren`t permanent, must be bought on every\
      \ map.  \n\nTowers can be repaired, but regeneration system is slow, expensive\
      \ and all repairings stops when player runs out of money, needing to be reset\
      \ on every damaged building. As towers haven't status visual bars and there\
      \ isn't an ingame pause option, is easily to loss buildings due a lack of repairs,\
      \ and the missed ones are hard to replace due their high costs: loss 3 towers\
      \ generally lead soon to see a \"game over\".\n\nAll enemies attacks towers\
      \ directly, and would not be a problem if it weren't for the maths has been\
      \ implemented wrongly or in an evil way: it may be that towers are too weak,\
      \ or enemies are too strong, or repairings are too slowly or money gains and\
      \ prices are bad calculated or balanced, but the truth is product degenerates\
      \ into a puzzle controlled by the developers, dictating what should be done\
      \ without margin to player's improvisation. \n\nIt can only be recommended to\
      \ puzzle fans, because players who wants a Tower Defense game must abandon after\
      \ 5 levels: less of 20% continue playing 10 more to finish campaign. There are\
      \ 8 infinity mode maps, but due to the horrible design of game itself, they\
      \ are can barely playable after 12 minutes: less of 4% players endurances 37\
      \ minutes. A pity."
