      first person roguelike. Become the incarnate form of a magical, sentient Sword,
      protecting a realm of dreams from the shadows of its own tormented soul, and
      stand as an eternal guardian against the infinite darkness that threatens to
      consume all.<br><br>Meticulously inspired by the classic RPG experiences of
      the early 90s, this turn-based roguelike drops you into the infinite realm of
      Ahkranox, a dream-world in the mind of a sentient sword. The world is infinite,
      the loot is infinite, the quests are infinite and the possibilities are infinite.

      this game does not babysit you. You will learn to run. You will learn patience.
      You do not start out an unbeatable hero. You will start as a scavenger, doing
      what they can to scrape by, but that will make your inevitable success even
      sweeter.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/268930/extras/SteamBannerB.jpg?t=1572347460"

    review: I believe this game is going to be either a hit or a miss depending on
      what the gamer prefers. The game is very difficult but it is not fast-paced.
      In fact, the entire game requires some strategic thinking and a little bit of
      luck. First, regarding the genre of the game, it is a blobber. Specifically,
      it is a blobber where you are alone and there's no party turn-based battle system
      like Etrian Odyssey. Instead, the battle system is turn based on the square
      movement grid. You move around, you bump into monsters, and you hit them and
      they hit you back. Each square you move consists of a turn. Even more, the entire
      game is almost completely randomly generated except for maybe the starting area.
      For the programming expert, the random generation is basically a "seeded" random
      generator. That is how the world is persistent. So is the game decent? It really
      depends on your taste. If you like blobber games where you delve into dungeons,
      look for loot while avoiding and disarming traps, fight monsters turn-based
      and have to think a little and ration your potion supplies, and want an infinite
      gameplay version of that, this game is for you. The amount of dungeons and places
      to clear is simply huge and all of your level ups will feel like you have achieved
      them. The downside, however, is that once you understand this game and know
      what to do, the game can sometimes be a bit monotonous. The game suffers from
      a lack of monster variety, and the randomly generated quests needs more variety
      as well. The game is not vast and filled with different mechanics and build
      abilities like some rogue-like games such as Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. However,
      I believe it does a good job in creating the first "infinite" blobber and I
      can see huge potential for this game. For me, I personally enjoy this game and
      I would rate it an 7/10. Your experiences will differ from mine depending on
      what you like. However, I find it astounding that this game is developed really
      by 1 person and that there is still an upcoming expansion for it. I hope the
      expansion can really make the game much better and add in the necessary content
      to make the game more interesting.
