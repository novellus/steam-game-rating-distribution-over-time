    review: " There are various problems with this game. I don't often come across\
      \ these shameless ripoffs. I have put every problem I have in this game on a\
      \ list:\n\n1. It's a rip off. The game, \"The Binding of YOU\" is a sad copy\
      \ of \"The Binding of Isaac\", which I've personally played. The game shares\
      \ many similar aspects with The Binding of Isaac, that being the Title, Character\
      \ selection, the rogue-like structure... It's just horrendous. \n\n2. The Visuals.\
      \ The visuals are poor. They seem like a whole bunch of sprites just copied\
      \ and pasted from Unity's asset store. Nothing seems to fit, and you are left\
      \ confused as to what in the hell you are playing. Some visuals are lazily added,\
      \ (The controller support buttons displayed for example).\n\n3. The Audio. This\
      \ game is wayyy to loud. The damage noise is ear piercingly loud, and there\
      \ is poor audio controls. (That being 5 selections of 0,25,50,75,100 and master\
      \ volume being 50, and 100.) It's very obnoxious.\n\n4. Mechanics (Manly speed).\
      \ The characters just blaze through the levels, and are often very hard to control\
      \ due to their acceleration. I easily slip past my destination and straight\
      \ into enemies. \n\n5. Immunity Frames. The one thing this game needs. You get\
      \ stuck between 2 enemies, and they just collide into you without immunity frames.\
      \ You go from max health to zero in a matter of seconds. It is very upsetting,\
      \ and should probably be fixed.\n\n6. The chest. The chest contain items that\
      \ are either really good, or really bad. They only seem to hold weapons, sometimes\
      \ one chest will have a very bad weapon, and other times good. They also appear\
      \ way to often. (Like 2-3 chest in one room)\n\n7. The story. The story makes\
      \ no sense. There is no lore, no \"meat\" to the game. Just a book that opens\
      \ up every time you play, that flips through the pages too fast. \n\nIn conclusion,\
      \ this game is really bad. It's a shameful ripoff of a good game, that aims\
      \ to ride on the fame of its target. There is no clear objective, just shooting,\
      \ getting hit without immunity frames etc. The only good thing I can say about\
      \ this game is that it's playable. And when I say that, I mean barely. Also,\
      \ the game was like 60 cents, so I didn't really lose a lot. I will say that\
      \ it does state \"Poor man's Binding of Isaac\", to give credibility where it's\
      \ due however. I am not by any means denoting the developer, I am rating the\
      \ game based on how I see it. \n\nAll I can say is this: It's definitely not\
      \ ready for a full-fledged release. There are still many mechanics that can\
      \ be changed if the developer puts more time into his project. I admire game\
      \ developers for their creativity and the integrity they put into their games.\
      \ 2/10"
