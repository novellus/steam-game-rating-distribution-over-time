Just want to say, as always, I'm a bass player over all, and to be honest, I haven't even tried playing these on guitar yet. Moving on.\n\nBass players, this pack is great, but one song properly stand out as the most fun to play: Overlord! That song's very fun to play, and you get to do cool bends! Unfortunately the song is in Eb Standard (A@440Hz).\n\nThe other two songs are fun too, but not that challenging. The bass tone on them is really nice though and I can really see myself playing these a lot in the future! Big downside though is one of them is in D Standard (A@440Hz), so they'll probably be played with the Motley Crue pack, also all in D Standard. The last song is in D drop C (A@440Hz), so you're gonna need to have spaghetti strings or take out the bass you use for Dethklok and System of a Down, although the C string (E in standard tuning) is hardly used. I know sometimes Rocksmith can have trouble picking up my bass when it's in C using normal strings as the strings bend very easily. Try being gentle, it's the best fix for Rocksmith to pick up spaghetti strings.\n\nAll in all: I think this is a must buy for the sheer fun! If you don't want the pack, at least get Overlord, so much fun to be had despite the lower tunings.","timestamp_created":1459952014,"timestamp_updated":1459952014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.627681314945220947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq/r69dMCctj5VA=="}
