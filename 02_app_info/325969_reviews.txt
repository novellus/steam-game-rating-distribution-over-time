I give it a 9.5 out of 10 as the overall \"package\" really impresses me which is far above the average of other \"PRO\"-locos and DLCs as such.\n\nPros:\n(+) very detailed model in 3 different liveries (clean, worn, LNER Green) and various logos to choose for the tender\n(+) 'standard' and 'advanced' driving mode which you may toggle on/off whenever you like\n(+) advanced mode gives you (respectively it gave me) the extra-kick to cope with the challenges, but reading the manual is a \"must\" though\n(+) great driving physics and very convenient to drive and operate\n(+) great sound (I have to admit I have never heard the real K1, but it sounds great to me in TS)\n(+) great 'feeling' to drive looking at all details in combination with sounds, steam, etc. looks \"real\" to me\n(+) EIGHT (not 5 as per the steam-description) (career) scenarios which I find immmersive and a pleasure to drive. Difficulty various from easy to advanced, but all achievable without any problems and a great help to get familiar with the K1.\n(+) comprehensive manual which I recommend to read (you then have paid for it anyways :-)\n(+) a lot of little features such as opening the roof, windows, etc.\n(+) various rolling (girders, trusses, various pipes, steel plates, etc.) stock which completes the package\n(+) ...and quite some more => read the description on steam\n\nCons:\n(-) ....\n...nothing that I'm aware of, except a real minor one for scenario creators: I did not succeed to figure out how to switch-on \nthe headlight if you use the K1 as AI in your scenarios.","timestamp_created":1536678174,"timestamp_updated":1536735841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567084074020385742","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4roGm5uUCdri6qgE="}
