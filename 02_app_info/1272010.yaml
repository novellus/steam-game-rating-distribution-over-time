      The U-Boat Hunter is an interactive war thriller which seamlessly blends tactical
      WW2 anti-submarine warfare simulation with a gripping storyline, presented through
      Hollywoodesque, interactive cutscenes. Take command of a meticulously reconstructed
      Fletcher-class destroyer and lead your crew against nazi U-Boats in the Battle
      of the Atlantic!<br><br>The story unfolds through a choice and consequence mechanic,
      allowing the player to shape the fate of the crew plunged into a deadly struggle
      against a devious and stealth enemy. They will have to overcome both the underwater
      threat and their own shortcomings in order to make sure that the convoy they
      are protecting makes it safely across the pond.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1272010/extras/destroyer_radar.gif?t=1608280872"
      /><br><br>Lead a whole destroyer squadron and make tactical decisions to protect
      your sheep from the steel wolves. Track contacts and plot anti-submarine attacks
      using authentic equipment. Experience war at sea from the perspective of a tin
      can sailor, and shape the story as it develops, making key decisions both in
      and outside the heat of battle.   <br><br>It is all in your hands, captain!
      Will you lead your men to victory by making sure that your convoy reaches its
      destination, or will it fall prey to enemy torpedoes, depriving the allied war
      effort of the precious supplies you were trusted to protect? Only you can answer
      the question!'
