    about_the_game: "Lifeblood is based in a fantasy world where players must team\
      \ up to compete in a forested battle arena. As a fatal shroud engulfs the land\
      \ in dark energy, contestants must fight to the death in order to stop its spread.\
      \ In a land ruled by the Gods, it is decided that only one team may remain.\
      \ Ensure your survival by harvesting resources from natural nodes and crafting\
      \ armor. Armor can be reinforced with additional resources to a maximum of three\
      \ tiers. Take control of the relentless Berserker, the mystical spellslinger,\
      \ and other many unique classes! Together they form a completely unbiased and\
      \ fresh take on class-based PvP. Classes may be changed as the game progresses\
      \ by equipping different weapons, each granting the classes' abilities to the\
      \ wielder. Become a force to be reckoned with as the shroud pushes survivors\
      \ to the final destination, a central tower untouched by the shroud's dark energy.\
      \ Make your final stand here and be granted the favor of the Gods!<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nLifeblood is not limited to Battle Royale as we will release other\
      \ game modes with newfangled concepts for PvP on the horizon. What makes Lifeblood\
      \ different from other class-based games is how there is no 'role' a player\
      \ must fill, such as a tank or healer. Lifeblood is not centered around solo\
      \ gameplay. We strive to create an environment where players must communicate\
      \ and work together to be effective.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLifeblood is developed\
      \ by Homage Studios, an independent game developing company started in 2017.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nComing Soon:<br />\r\nNew Classes: additional classes will\
      \ be added, including Assassins, Rangers, and Crusaders<br />\r\nShrines: points\
      \ of contention on the map where players can exchange Etherium for special gear\
      \ and items. <br />\r\nParties: groups of five will be able to compete in the\
      \ battle arena. <br />\r\nRanked Play: players will be matched according to\
      \ a ranking system and play under competitive rule. <br />\r\nSolo Queues: only\
      \ one survivor may remain in this game mode."

    review: Purchased game, and haven't had a chance to play it since purchasing it..
      For one i cannot give a good review considering each time i try and load the
      game it isn't loading just stuck to  "Connecting" is it still up and running?
      If it isn't then this game needs to be removed from STEAM so further purchases
      do not occur for a non existent game....
