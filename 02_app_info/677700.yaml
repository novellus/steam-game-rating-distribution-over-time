    review: "This game is basically a 8 bit version of Dead Ops Arcade. Its a good\
      \ game has lots of potential but sicne its eraly access it does have its bugs.\
      \ but anywho lets get into the juicy details.\n\nsingle player\nCo op 4 player\n\
      Co op Online (Hamatchi) 4 player\ntons of weapons\n9 diferent lases iwt their\
      \ own abilities \n5 differently bilt and themed maps each with a different difficulty\n\
      \nPros: \ngood default keybinds\ngame is pretty stable\nonline co op works\n\
      lots of customizable stuff\n\nCons:\nco op is harder then singleplayer\nunbalanced\
      \ weapons(ak47 does 2 dmg yet lazer rifle says 2dmg in shop but in reality is\
      \ like 0.75)\nsome door spaces need bigger on maps\nlacks detail and description\
      \ on the classes 2 abilitys and the items you pick up (the checkerboards)\n\
      games not really known so there isnt much of a community\ngames exploitable\
      \ by cheat engine and probably other ways (please fix)\n\nConclusion\nThe game\
      \ is good with its varity of crap like different weapons maps and classes. but\
      \ yet lacks detail on important in game se of abilitys and loot pick ups. game\
      \ is in beta so it does have bugs. all in all i recommend bying this product\
      \ it has potential.\n\nKnown Bugs\n\nSingle Player\nsometimes the wave auto\
      \ starts sually happens to me on wave 6 and 10 randomly\n\nOnline co-op (hamatchi)\
      \ \nprobably might of been internet issues not sure  but id liek to report them.\
      \ a buddy of mine and i were playing it said rond 7 for us both his enemys left\
      \ said 0 mine said something like 8267843648 we had no enemies both readied\
      \ up and it was broek til i left the game then enemies came in. then latter\
      \ on my end he was frozen but i cold move i died mid wave on his end he said\
      \ but he cold move arond use the shop and continue the waves i cold only move\
      \ arond and use the shop bt on my side he was frozen and on his side i was frozen.\
      \ dont know if wee desync or what. this could be latency issues not sure but\
      \ enemies at times can lag or teleport or often skip."
