    about_the_game: "-Survival on the Frontier of Ancient Rome. <br />\r\nYou must\
      \ avoid starvation and frostbite while working under the thumb of a corrupt\
      \ census taker, and turn the tables on him. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n-A Unique Blend\
      \ of Genres. <br />\r\nFrom farmsim to survival, role-playing to strategy, FreeHolder\
      \ presents a compelling and revitalizing blend of classic game genres. <br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\n-Detailed Character Evolution. <br />\r\nWith seven classes and\
      \ over thirty skills (with many more of each planned), you can be everything\
      \ from a master sculptor to a hardened warrior to an efficient rancher. <br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n-Roguelike, not Roguelite. <br />\r\nChallenging and highly\
      \ replayable, like games should be. Over a dozen procedurally generated factors\
      \ gives you a new experience each game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Original Retro\
      \ Soundtrack by Blue Mage. <br />\r\nDrawn from a lifetime of obsessive involvement\
      \ with video game music, the soundtrack for FreeHolder has been crafted to evoke\
      \ memories of the classic console era. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Story of FreeHolder\
      \ - <br />\r\nYou and two comrades are escaped slaves who while fleeing Roman\
      \ territory, stumble across a recently-raided farm, and although almost everything\
      \ of value has been taken a small amount of wheat, a few tools and a couple\
      \ silver denari might allow you to eke out a stealthy existence on the fringe\
      \ of Roman lands. Unfortunately, you agree to run the farm together just as\
      \ the Roman census-taker is knocking on the small home's door. <br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nOnly slightly terrified of being found out, you are unable to convince\
      \ the Roman that you are anything other than escaped slaves. However, this particular\
      \ census taker is, 'flexible' and offers the fugitives a deal: if they run the\
      \ farm and produce enough wheat to fulfill the wheat quota demanded by Rome,\
      \ and toss a bribe on top for himself, they can go on running the farm instead\
      \ of being sent back to face their master. With no other options, and no way\
      \ out, you and your compatriots agree hastily. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis state\
      \ of affairs does not have to last, however. A slave you may have been but you\
      \ can choose to resist the Romans by stealth, subterfuge, or brute force, and\
      \ by allying with the northern tribes. Or you can purchase freedom for yourself\
      \ and your friends and buy your way into Roman high society. With ten different\
      \ classes from agronomist to ranger, engineer, rancher, witch, and gladiator,\
      \ with multiple different upgrade paths and special actions, you can play exactly\
      \ the way you want to."
