    review: 'Bought specifically for VR. Unfortunately it''s teleport-only, there''s
      no configuration, and the only way to turn without physically turning is by
      pressing a button which turns you some amount to the right (what a terrible
      way to do that; note I use Oculus Quest and Link, so MAYBE something was screwed
      up and there should be a button to mash to turn to the left? Still absolutely
      terrible mechanic). I prefer smooth locomotion but I can enjoy teleport in games,
      but the fact I have to physically turn makes it unplayable for me and the setup
      I have.


      I really think you should have smooth locomotion in this game, teleportation
      doesn''t seem efficient for the goal of moving around quickly and knocking things
      off of surfaces.


      Admittedly I did not play the pancake (2D) version, I was expecting it to be
      the same in VR but it appears to be significantly restricted.


      Even if there was a turn mechanic better than hitting a button to turn one direction,
      I don''t think I could play this with teleport mode. Seems way to sluggish to
      teleport around instead of smooth motion.'
