    review: '"Banyu Lintar Angin" is not a game, it is a 34-page comic book with a
      single background track. I usually downvote such items, but it is so much better
      than the most of the "universally acclaimed masterpieces BAFTA GOTY 10/10" that
      I simply cannot bring myself to leave a negative review.'
