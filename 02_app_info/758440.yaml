      with all sorts of cute yet weird beings. In the past few weeks the waters have

      notes: "Some of the female characters feature cleavage and/or revealing clothing.\
        \ Nothing you wouldn't see on a summer beach (non nudist).\r\n\r\nThe story\
        \ can get a bit spooky at times, but nothing that could cause a heart attack\
        \ or leave long lasting emotional trauma.\r\n"

    short_description: A weird plague sweeps the land, in the form of an endless rose
      garden. Two lost souls were chained together to fix everything. I hope they
      don't mess it up again.

    review: "Maybe I put a lot of hopes in this game. I was expecting it since I\u2019\
      ve read about it a year ago. Content is poor for my taste. It's not bad but\
      \ I really can\u2019t recommend it as it is. I finished it in 5 hours. Story\
      \ is basic. Very repetitive gameplay. It funny but very old fashioned. I hope\
      \ the free update from the developer could add the fun that was missed along\
      \ the way.\n"
