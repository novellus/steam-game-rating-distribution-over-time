    about_the_game: "Frag Grounds is a multiplayer first-person shooter game which\
      \ incorporates the classic game modes such as team deathmatch, deathmatch and\
      \ capture the flag, as well as a more strategy-oriented Conquest mode played\
      \ on large, open maps which includes taking and controlling objectives for your\
      \ team's advantage. Some of those objectives are land vehicle and aircraft factories\
      \ as well as advanced equipment facilities capable of producing weaponized exoskeletons\
      \ and other hi-tech gadgets that will bring doom upon the enemy's ranks and\
      \ headquarters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlongside that, there also are more dynamic\
      \ game modes for those who seek a greater thrill and challenge. Teams aren't\
      \ always equal, as each one will have their pros and cons. Players can, for\
      \ example, compete with each other in a robot vs human setting. Robots may be\
      \ faster and tougher, they can also use heat vision. The human team however,\
      \ has their own tricks up their collective sleeve, be it regenerative abilities\
      \ highly coveted by the robotic lifeforms, or hi-tech equipment offering various\
      \ advantages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoy classic player versus player combat in\
      \ a military setting, try out the various vehicles including cars, armored personnel\
      \ carriers, tanks, mechs, helicopters and VTOLs as well as some nifty plasma\
      \ or laser rifles, or, if you're tired of mortal imperfections, take a crack\
      \ at the robot vs robot mode for an especially stimulating gameplay.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nChange or adapt your strategy at any given time by making use of\
      \ the weapon attachment system - swap your reflex sight for a tactical scope,\
      \ put on a suppressor or a muzzle brake for quieter or steadier firing, and\
      \ more."
