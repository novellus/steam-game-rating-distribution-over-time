    review: 'Typically, I enjoy word games so much, and thought this would be worth
      a try - I was wrong - So Wrong!


      3/10 - I feel compelled to leave a review, since this game is over ONE YEAR
      OLD and has ZERO Reviews - odd, IMO.


      When I bought [i]Ace of Words[/i] (By same Dev), Slide Ride Arcade was available
      at a discount when bundled, so I went for it. It was money down the drain in
      my case, since the gameplay didn''t engage me one bit, and just felt boring
      and unimaginative. In case anyone cares, I''d give the companion game - Ace
      of Words a 5.5/10 - and slim thumbs up. Cheers


      (BTW - Time in Game reflects approximately 1 hour of actual gameplay and remainder
      of time was game idling overnight for Trading Card drops)'
