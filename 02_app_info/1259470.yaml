    review: "CHARACTER:\nCasus offers six unique character classes and an interesting\
      \ combat system. The six primary classes each have their own skill trees, with\
      \ three secondary classes offering another skill tree to use. Leveling up raises\
      \ hit points and stamina, while crafted equipment raises stats.\n\nCOMBAT:\n\
      The combat is challenging and requires thoughtful consideration of which body\
      \ parts to attack on your enemies first. Since the player's party is only a\
      \ single character, multi-enemy attacks or status effects are a must to survive.\
      \ Skillful use of confusion skills can effectively add enemies to your party\
      \ for a few turns. \n\nPROTIP: Stamina, which lets a character use skills, such\
      \ as healing, goes very quickly. Since Defending in combat  restores hit points,\
      \ you'll need to abuse it to restore health when one weak enemy remains. This\
      \ certainly gets tedious, but survival without it will require many fortunate\
      \ drops of stamina restoring items.\n\nThere are no temples to heal, and resting\
      \ costs experience points (25% of a level). So, again, exploit defense in combat\
      \ to heal.\n\nCRAFTING:\nThe crafting system is simple, but effective. While\
      \ the initial recipes are obvious keepers (attack up + defense up), later recipes\
      \ offer trade-offs. For example, you'll need to decide if you want more Luck\
      \ or Healing ability or poison resistance.\n\nMAPPING:\nThe mapping tool works\
      \ well enough. It's a little touchy, in that you'll need to \"paint\" the ground\
      \ before adding an icon to a square. But overall, it works. If anything, some\
      \ more interesting icons would be nice.\n\nDUNGEONS:\nAt this point, I've reached\
      \ Level 7. Based on the info in the game, it appears that there are 20 levels.\
      \ I'm not sure if there are any bonus levels. The first five levels lacked any\
      \ real puzzles beyond some stronger enemies and doors locked from the other\
      \ size, but they are very large. Level 6 introduced spikes, which can mostly\
      \ be avoided. Level 7 is named, \"Switches,\" so I anticipate more puzzles there.\n\
      \nCONCLUSION:\nSo far, it's been a fun game. I've played almost 20 hours and\
      \ got through 1/3 of the game. I'm a completionist, so not sure what your playtime\
      \ will be. \n\nMy primary complaint about the game is that I've really had to\
      \ rely on the \"Defend to Heal\" approach just to survive. This extends combat\
      \ time quite a bit, and gets very tedious. A re-balance of the stamina cost\
      \ or increased drops of stamina recovery items would help."
