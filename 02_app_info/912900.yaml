      notes: The game contains some graphic violence when enemies are killed, but
        it's not very realistic looking or detailed since it's a strategy game with
        a top down view. For example, enemies may blow to pieces with some blood particles
        when killed.

    review: "Nice tower defense. This game builds off of what I already love about\
      \ the TD genre and throws in some new aspects, like a card system that adds\
      \ modifiers to your towers/abilities. \n\nI think it has a good mix of strategy\
      \ vs struggle. I felt challenged enough to try different strategies, but not\
      \ so challenged that it was frustrating. It also seems like the enemies and\
      \ maps are trying to prevent a meta build by requiring you to switch towers/commanders.\
      \ I like that, as the planning is part of the fun.\n\nI think this one could\
      \ be a real gem as it keeps developing. Don't get me wrong, as is, I think it's\
      \ worth the buy."
