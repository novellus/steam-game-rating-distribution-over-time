So you can't go wrong with this as a basic male model for whatever you like to do. However for obviously reasons the biggest pro of this course also is it's biggest con. Like if you want to create a child, a woman, an older person or even a bit more average and less muscled model you have to be more advanced as a beginner may be just because you have to tweak A LOT. On the other hand once you've understood the technics and the concept it's not that hard and the results are even better. But remember all you get is a naked male basic model! No hair, no clothes, no animations. Don't complain after!\n\nBut anyway it's absolutly worth it's price even with the little disadvantage of only getting a stream version. I know you can download it at Udemy but considering atm it's 3 bucks less on steam and the artist may get less from steam sales I can deal with that. Happy the artist even sales it for an acceptable price.","timestamp_created":1556308239,"timestamp_updated":1556308239,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qeTMreoCfMSDwAE="}
