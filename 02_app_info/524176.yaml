    review: "This is the Allied Operation Market Garden, September 1944, broken down\
      \ into a number of smaller scenarios. \n\nA solid amount of research must have\
      \ gone into creating this DLC as it very realistically portrays the planned\
      \ objectives, the units that were deployed (Allies and Germans), the terrain,\
      \ weather etc.\n\nIf you enjoy Command Ops 2 and if you are interested in said\
      \ operation, you will definitely enjoy this campaign. And you will get a real\
      \ feeling for how difficult it would have been to pull off this operation (spoiler:\
      \ it was unsuccessful)."
