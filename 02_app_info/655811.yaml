    short_description: "Gabriel hears that her older sister is heading to Earth and\
      \ seems troubled. Which really comes as no surprise, as her older sister, Zelel,\
      \ is known to be very efficient in Heaven. She\u2019s a very powerful angel,\
      \ who is known to be serious and strict, and is referred to as the Hand of God."
