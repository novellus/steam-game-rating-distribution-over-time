Just Fantastic! \nWhat I absolutely love (PRO's):\n- Just like the old \"Operation Wolf\" game but then 1000X more immersion.\n- Genius use of VR to feel you are right there shooting like a bad*ss.\n- fantastic \"force feedback\" from my Oculus Quest 2 controllers\n- The mini games are super immersive\n\nWhat could be improved (Cons):\n- The option (switch on/off) to have a little tutorial entering a mini game. Not an issue, there is just a slight learning curve but that is part of the game and replayability.\n\nConclusion: Buy this! It is amazing! I love playing this on Oculus Quest 2 through Virtual Desktop and love it.","timestamp_created":1609646087,"timestamp_updated":1609646087,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tcOY4/YCftX5vwI="}
