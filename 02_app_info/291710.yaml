    about_the_game: Unravel an ancient mystery and search for an ancient treasure
      on England's fog-shrouded coastline, famed for its legends of smugglers, pirates
      and ghosts. Join ghost-hunters Nigel Danvers and Lucy Reubans as they investigate
      a tale of horror and haunting. Wielding the tools of the modern-day ghost-hunter
      in a cinematic, richly detailed interactive world of wind-swept coastlines and
      crumbling crypts, you will be captivated, taunted and teased by mind-bending
      puzzles and interactions with the town 'locals'. But, be warned, there are those
      who will stop at nothing to prevent Nigel discovering &quot;that which should
      stay hidden&quot;. With nerves of steel and wits to match, in your search for
      The Lost Crown you will soon discover long lost secrets previously known only
      to the dead!<h2 class="bb_tag">Key features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Spine-tingling

    review: "I went into this game not expecting much, since I had my problems with\
      \ the Dark Fall series. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. I can confidently\
      \ say this is one of the most atmospheric point-and-click games I have played\
      \ in a long time, including the creepiest. \nThe sound design is fantastic in\
      \ almost every scene, making the paranormal situations downright terrifying\
      \ with their realistic ambience and very well done ghost voices (no cheap BOOs\
      \ or cheesy lines here!). This game's audio scares you not in a screaming blood-murder\
      \ way, but in the chill-down-your-back, always-looking-over-your-shoulder-for-shadow-people\
      \ way that is just great, especially with headphones. Big applause on that piece.\n\
      The art design and graphics of the game are great as well for a 2-D point-and-click,\
      \ mixing photography and pixel animation surprisingly well, to the point where\
      \ you almost forget the characters are not \"in\" the background. The imagery\
      \ used for the different hauntings were also excellent, with plenty of scenes\
      \ making me nervous or unnerved with the subtle approaches they took. Luckily,\
      \ there's little to no jumpscares, so everything relies on creep-factor (which\
      \ is always a big PLUS in my book if done correctly). A few more claps for the\
      \ game!\nThe story and lore are interesting and enthralling. While I'm not versed\
      \ in the actual history of the actual town of Saxton, England, so I can't say\
      \ if the history in this game is real or imagined, the story and history presented\
      \ in this game is well laid and well written, providing a background that is\
      \ full of mystery, legend, and powers beyond what we can even start to guess\
      \ at. It's all fascinating and actually makes you want to slow down and learn\
      \ about everything you can, instead of giving you mindless facts that have no\
      \ reason to hold your interest. The fact that you're sometimes not even sure\
      \ what year you're in sets a great mood and extra layer of mystery to the story.\
      \ The characters are also interesting and engaging, with some backstories to\
      \ them as well (with some mysteries left to them still). More claps to you.\n\
      Now, the \"eh, it's okay\" parts of the game were the puzzles and the voice\
      \ acting. Most of the puzzles are either too easy or the solutions were a bit\
      \ too hidden/nonsensical. The bit with the cat took me forever to figure out\
      \ and I still don't know why that solution worked. There was also a puzzle that\
      \ relied on knowing how to identify music notes by ear, which makes the puzzle\
      \ impossible for non-musicians like me. As for the voice acting, for most of\
      \ the game, it's alright. Not the best, but definitely not the worst. Also,\
      \ the worst was from our main protagonist at the start of the beginning, but\
      \ her got better as the game went on. \nAs for the cons of the game, there are\
      \ only a few from me. The biggest is the WALKING. While I appreciate being able\
      \ to double-click to move to the next scene quickly, when I have to go across\
      \ the whole map to get where I need to go (or think I need to go, that's always\
      \ great when I'm wrong), waiting for my character to walk into frame for the\
      \ scene quickly frustrates me. The fact that I have to go through 10+ scenes\
      \ multiplies that frustration by the same count. A fast-travel function to the\
      \ main areas of the game at least would have been very welcome. The dialogue\
      \ is also a bit disappointing, as no response you select affects the game other\
      \ than moving the story forward when needed (no relationships to build or alternate\
      \ endings here). However, I can understand if the creator wanted to keep to\
      \ one ending and just give the player more freedom to their dialogue within\
      \ of just listening to a whole conversation start to finish. So I'll let that\
      \ slide. The only other disappoint is the ghost find on the tracks. It looked\
      \ more like a alpha version of the final product rather than the final product.\
      \ It's about the only place where the visuals just don't work and looks unimpressive.\n\
      \nAll in all, this is a great game. It has some flaws, as all things do, but\
      \ this really is a diamond in the rough. I hope to see much of the same or better\
      \ performance in the sequels!"
