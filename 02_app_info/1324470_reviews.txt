Rolling random skills for new characters is weird why on earth would a god tier mage start with 2 physical moves? This wouldn't be as frustrating if there was a way to forget or replace old skill but no you are just limited to 4. The gameplay is really fun and it's pretty satisfying my only real qualm is how long it can take to find a run that's actually playable.\n\nThis DLC should be in the base game there pretty much isn't a base game without it.","timestamp_created":1604444162,"timestamp_updated":1604444214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr/qUyPUCfveRrAI="}
