I then proceeded to play it to see how bad it was, maybe even have a few laughs, and oh boy, it's BAD. I forced myself to sit down and play this horrid game for over an hour because I'm addicted to gaining achievements, and surprise... It doesn't give it to you.\nAddiction is bad kids. Don't do drugs... or dirt cheap steam games in this case.","timestamp_created":1594718680,"timestamp_updated":1594718680,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvP6opvMCf+qYlQI="}
