After completing all 3 missions in a single evening, I would like to share a few thoughts.\n\nSimilar to the previous DLC, Once Upon A Time, some of the top reviews at this time seem to be suggesting that this DLC is difficult compared to all other content in the game and therefore is unenjoyable. Again, this DLC didn't feel particularly difficult when played on Normal so I'm unsure what playstyle makes these more challenging than other missions from the base game. \n\nI will also reiterate that complaining about only having three missions when the description clearly states this is what you are buying is more than a bit silly. If you don't want to play just three missions, don't buy it! But if you want a few new missions and enjoyed the base game missions, it is absolutely worth a consideration. Yes, we would all love to see even more new things to play with such as heroes, spells, traps, and creatures but I didn't buy this DLC expecting those things so it doesn't affect my view of it. \n\nAs for the mission themselves, they felt varied enough from one another and the base game to be enjoyable for me with each being appropriately themed around a Pirates-styled setting. Many seem to be complaining about one of the missions requiring escorting an NPC across the map and I suppose if you simply don't enjoy timed missions than this one may leave a bad taste although it moves so slow and gives you ample warning when you should be ready, so it feels easy to plan for. \n\nAs far as criticisms,  I would have wished to have the Pirate Thalya outfit unlocked as an optional Extra that could be toggled on and off for playing in the future. Also, some of the missions felt a bit overly long. Mission 1 and 2 require you to wait before you can complete the objectives and even though I enjoy building up a big dungeon, I was long done clearing out the overworld before I could finish the mission. \n\nOverall, this took me about 4-5 hours and I enjoyed my time with it. A solid, new, 3 missions for someone who already enjoyed what the base game had to offer.","timestamp_created":1605627979,"timestamp_updated":1605628216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrMi56/UCfs76rgI="}
