    about_the_game: "Polaris is Polytopia\u2019s third Special Tribe! From the frozen\
      \ wastes emerge the Polaris, servants of the mysterious Gaami, who are hellbent\
      \ on freezing the Square into a new frigid paradise. Imbued with icy powers\
      \ granted by their overlords, the Polaris construct adorable Mooni, freeze the\
      \ waters, shatter their foes, and diligently work their way toward an unforeseen\
      \ fate...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlike the other tribes, the Polaris have a unique\
      \ style of gameplay. Their most prominent trait is their ability to freeze terrain,\
      \ transforming the land and water into frozen versions, and replacing terrain\
      \ features with their own. Due to being able to transform water into ice, the\
      \ Polaris do not have access to a navy, and are instead given replacements,\
      \ the Battle Sled and Ice Fortress for Ships and Battleships, respectively,\
      \ which can effortlessly skate across the ice. Instead of beginning the game\
      \ with a Warrior, the Polaris start with a Mooni, an adorable ice construct\
      \ which can freeze adjacent terrain or nearby units, rendering them helpless\
      \ until they thaw. The Polaris replace their normal Archers with Ice Archers,\
      \ which deal no damage but freeze units from a distance. The Polaris also replace\
      \ their Giants with Gaami, physical avatars for their extradimensional masters,\
      \ which can instantly freeze nearby terrain and bring an entire army to its\
      \ demise. Lastly, due to not having waters or ports, the Polaris replace their\
      \ Customs Houses with the singular Ice Bank, which provides stars based on the\
      \ amount of frozen terrain on the Square.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Polaris take\
      \ everything you know about naval combat and throw it out the window, as their\
      \ lack of a navy means that they\u2019ll have to get creative when conquesting\
      \ over the seas. Using Mooni and Gaami in conjunction can stop an opposing navy\
      \ from even leaving the harbor! The ice will grant the Polaris forces movement\
      \ bonuses and allow for their sleds to operate, which are designed to defend\
      \ the land they\u2019ve frozen. Freezing the terrain will also provide the Polaris\
      \ with an income, should they acquire their Ice Bank. Freezing a unit will stop\
      \ it completely, preventing actions such as movement or counter attacks, allowing\
      \ Polaris forces to destroy opposing units with impunity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      If you like tribes with incredibly powerful ice magic that freezes their foes,\
      \ or simply want to spread a world-wide Winter Wonderland, then the Polaris\
      \ are the perfect tribe for you!"
