In a nutshell, the game is about the end of the world. Multiple extinction level events have taken place, including the raising of the dead, an alien invasion, and the awakening of an Eldritch God.\n\nThe Door in the Woods is a nihilistic reminder of the inevitability of death. The earth is left in pieces, and there is no hope for the recovery of mankind. The writer actively mocks you as he flaunts the idea of hope right in front of you, and then proceeds to destroy any semblance of it. The ASCII graphics only adds to this unnatural atmosphere of hopelessness, it's simplicity simply allows your mind to fill in the blanks. Although I do prefer to be shown rather than told, the writing is sublime and is genuinely poetic at times, and I do believe that plenty is hinted at throughout the game world. \n\nI cannot recommend this game enough, even if rogue-likes aren't your thing.\n\nI would highly recommend you play this game knowing as little about the story as possible (even if I had just spoiled the basic premise in this review.) I would honestly say this is a must play title in the current year. The Door in the Woods should not go unnoticed.\n\n        [i]\"Has something essential been stolen, to raise edifices that we cannot understand?\"[/i]","timestamp_created":1598642415,"timestamp_updated":1609632987,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565675199031829834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ498bm4vYCevGvngI="}
