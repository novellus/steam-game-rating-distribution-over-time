      \ /><br>Rena is a sweet funny girl that is serious when it comes down to business.\
      \ She is pretty short, but despite that, nothing scares her and she can talk\
      \ back to anyone. The girl only teases the people that mean something to her\
      \ and that's what happens with the protagonist too.<br>She has a great business\
      \ and is one of the best talents regarding potions, but never brags about it.\
      \ The girl knows that people don't take her seriously because of her looks,\
      \ but she managed to show them how imposing she is by her hard work.<br><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1418160/extras/Sana.png?t=1608647290\"\
      \ /><br>Sana is a elf warrior but that's not what her whole personality revolves\
      \ around. Despite her stern look, she is a person that values life more than\
      \ anything and thinks it is better to retreat sometimes from fights and try\
      \ again than to die a hero.<br>She is a smart, strong woman that has some love\
      \ for humans and other people, despite them being against her kind. She knows\
      \ Rena and that helps her trust the mc more since he came from her.<br><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1418160/extras/Georgia.png?t=1608647290\"\
      \ /><br>Georgia is a strong woman, both physically and mentally. She leads a\
      \ bunch of men in her blacksmith shop and doesn't respond to anyone. She is\
      \ a very important person and the best in the town, making weapons and armors\
      \ for the king and people close to him.<br>She lost a close friend in a battle\
      \ but doesn't tell anyone about it. Since then, she swore to not participate\
      \ anymore in these sorts of things. Although she makes items that kill people,\
      \ she doesn't see all battles as something that should never exist but more\
      \ like a necessary evil. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1418160/extras/Angami.png?t=1608647290\"\

      \ MC but despite that being an inconvenience for her, she barely complains about\
      \ it.<br>She has to train the recruits all over the kingdom and despite her\
      \ tough look, she loves to joke around and tease, especially with people close\
      \ to her. The woman is older than the mc by twelve years but no one else knows\
      \ that about her. She started this by helping Georgia, but warmed up to the\
      \ protagonist and even bring him food from her place.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1418160/extras/Yuna.png?t=1608647290\"\

      \ Despite her sexy attitude, she is overwhelmed by the MC's kindness and falls\
      \ in love for the first time in her long life. She is made to attract people\
      \ so that was never a problem for her, so she can't explain how the protagonist\
      \ managed to refuse her advances in the first night.<br>She is almost never\
      \ serious, but gets interested in what humans do and even cooks for the mc as\

    review: 'No achievement for playing on Normal, rather than Easy.


      Entirely luck-based. Not just for the gem placement, but for what enemies you
      end up fighting as well. Some of the mechanics are interesting, but when enemies
      call for 50 reinforcements or you have no matches and die on turn 1, it becomes
      a very big headache.


      I restarted the game on easy mode after failing chapter 3 50 times. I can''t
      even get past chapter 1. It''s a massive grind that feels like a lottery, where
      the odds aren''t in your favor. I have no idea what the endgame looks like with
      all of the upgrades. I just hope it''s not as painful as the early game.


      Edit: Play Isekai Quest, if you want a game that has a better chance of winning.
      Stats are halfway upgraded and I''ve yet to take down chapter 3. I reached wave
      9 (out of hopefully 10) and the enemies doubled to an unbearable amount. The
      cheap, randomized combos you get whacked by are the biggest issue. The fight
      gets out of control and you take a LOT of damage in 1 turn.'
