    review: 'Coffee Rush is a match-3 game with some light strategy elements.  You
      run a coffee shop and the matches you make are used to fulfill customers'' orders,
      wherein each order requires a certain quantity of various items.  Each customer
      has a certain amount of patience, and the longer it takes to fulfill their order,
      the more their patience decreases, and the less they will pay for their order.  As
      you make certain matches, "treats" appear on the board, and when you match these
      treats, it increases a customer''s patience value..  You can also purchase treats
      which can be used at any time to increase a customer''s patience.  This is where
      the light strategy elements come into play -- managing the patience level of
      each customer (up to four at a time) while you work to fulfill their order.


      There are a total of 50 levels ("days", as the game refers to them) and it took
      me 7.9 hours to finish them, so I''d say it''s well worth the price.


      In my playthrough, I found only two potentially negative things.  First, the
      game does not support the Steam overlay.  Second, the store pages show the game
      in widescreen mode, but it actually runs in 4:3 aspect ratio (in windowed mode
      and in full-screen mode).  I don''t see either of those as a big deal in this
      game, but I know some people do, so I wanted to point it out.


      If you don''t like match-3 games, or you don''t like time-sensitive tasks and
      want relaxed games only, then this isn''t for you.  However, if you like match-3
      games and don''t mind working against a clock, then I definitely recommend this
      game.'
