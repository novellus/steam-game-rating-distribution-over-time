This happens way too often in NWN modules, why does nobody understand that bosses should have some effective counter for multiple classes.  Its not my fault that there isnt a single rogue weapon in the game with a high enough enhancement bonus to actually damage the boss even slightly.","timestamp_created":1605092301,"timestamp_updated":1605092301,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498480260372161865","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jJu92/UCcdbcrQI="}
