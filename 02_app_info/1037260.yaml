    review: 'I do not write reviews, so this one is my first and probably last one.
      I in no way want to shit on the dev, but I want people to know what they are
      buying for such a price.


      Let me give a lil backstory. Diacrisis was in development since 2014 and was
      (presumably) first shown on dev''s Newgrounds account. It did get my attention
      (though honestly, I don''t remember when), but due to the lack of updates and
      me focusing on other games I eventually forgot about Diacrisis. And then yesterday,
      it suddenly appeared on Steam store with a ridiculously high price! Curiosity
      and interest took over me and so, I still decided to buy this game and give
      it a shot.


      So, where do we start? Well, let''s talk about visual representation and design.
      Personally, I would say that game looks and feels like, um... A fancied up Flash
      game or one of those free/pretty cheap games that you would play to kill some
      time. 3D aspect is nicely done for the most part, and there are pretty nice
      views and places, much thanks to the visual effects such as lighting and falling
      snow. 2D aspect is not that bad, but as you can see from trailers and screenshots,
      it just screams "Hello Flash games from 2000s and early 2010s!", and btw, do
      not believe the release trailer, even on high graphical settings 2D looks the
      same like in the previous trailer (worse). As for design, well, as I already
      said, some places look nice, the others are unimpressive and some make no sense
      at all, like a room with an electric chair surrounded by holes with spikes that
      you need to run through quickly. Also, the game''s main menu is ugly.


      Now that we are done with that, let''s talk about the plot. As description says,
      we are playing as a captain of Canadian supermax prison guard named Matthew
      Diacrisis who receives a distress call about something terrible happening in
      said prison, which turns out to be a zombie outbreak. In general, the story
      is quite cheesy and has that feel of B-Movies and (here we go again) flash games
      which are trying to be serious. I would say it''s kind of a plus, but it depends
      on how you look at it. The main problem is that it''s really rushed and choppy.
      Like, all the characters are interacted with only once and are never brought
      up or seen again after you meet them, with exception of a one-eyed prisoner
      in a coat and face bandana accompanied by a prisoner with AK-47 (btw, where
      did the prisoner''s get AK-47s from?) who are game''s only bosses, and the leader
      of prison''s neo-nazi gang. And it''s not the only case when it feels like story
      is missing something.


      Now, the gameplay! It''s pretty simplistic, so are the controls, you just move
      on and kill everyone that is trying to eat or murder you. Weapons are pretty
      basic - knife, pistol, shotgun and assault rifle. Besides weapons you also have
      an infininte amount of flares that help you in the dark places. Unfortunately,
      the combat is really clunky, as in order to hit or shoot the enemy you need
      to be right in front of him. That''s kinda problematic due to the fact that
      besides left and right, you and them can also move up and down, and even when
      it seems like you are standing at the right spot, you will still miss, even
      if you are using shotgun. What makes it even worse is that sometimes your view
      will be blocked by parts of the location, most of the fights take place in narrow
      and small areas where you can''t maneuver much, and sometimes zombies appear
      from one or both sides out of nowhere. In some situations you have explosive
      barrels at your disposal, but besides the right spot it also requires a good
      moment to hit them if you want to take out a lot of zombies with it, and such
      moments are uncommon. Oh yeah, if you will knock the barrel over, don''t even
      bother, you won''t hit it.


      But for me the most irritating part was actually how the game''s load/restart
      system works. Your progress is being saved at invisible checkpoints, but if
      you die you don''t restart from them, oh noooo, you actually get a relatively
      long loading screen that sends you back to main menu, then you gotta press "Load
      Game" to start from the last save! Seriously, who the hell makes crap like that,
      let alone in 2019!? Luckily, at least you have an extra life that allows you
      to spawn from the last checkpoint and continue the game.


      Well, what about the variety? Is there, any? Not really. The only thing that
      is a liiiiiiittle varied is what kind of enemies do you encounter. Your main
      enemies are zombies that come in 4 types: 1) A guy in orange prisoner jumpsuit;
      2) Tattooed prisoners with black tank tops who are the slowest and weakest ones;
      3) Black prisoners in yellow prisoner jumpsuits, who are the most annoying ones,
      because they can sprint; 4) Bearded prison guards. Other enemies are psychotic
      prisoners with knives who kill you in one hit and can be properly dealt with
      only with shotgun, but only three of them are encountered and only in one section
      of the game. And of course the aforementioned boss fight with odd-looking prisoner
      and his pal with ak-47. Thought you would fight that neo-nazi gang and it''s
      leader? Aha, forget it.


      There is also something to be said about things that are promised in Key Features.
      Statement about 5 hours of gameplay is not really true, I finished the game
      in almost 3 hours. And even then, some of that time is game loading on the start,
      me dying and going through the main menu, pausing the game a couple of times
      to make breaks, all that zombie shooting and that bonus level that I didn''t
      finish. The last level of the game is just a joke. After finding prison warden,
      you end up in a place that looks like a Renaissance town (yeah, in Northen part
      of Canada and close enough to supermax prison) and you just climb and climb,
      and climb one building up, fighting hordes of zombies on each floor, until you
      reach some empty street, only to see a "TO BE CONTINUE" (yes, CONTINUE), then
      a end cutscene with that leader of neo-nazis escaping and Matthew vowing to
      find and catch him, but first going to protect a nearby town from zombies who
      broke out. And here comes that bonus level. As I said, I didn''t manage to finish
      it, because I died and got sent to the beginning, cause there is no extra lives
      or checkpoints. Let me tell you that it''s a really long, tedious and bland
      level, not sure how long is it exactly or if it actually has a end.


      As for the other promised features. Exploration? Well, there is VERY little
      of it. The game is actually pretty linear and straight-forward for the most
      part. Puzzles? Didn''t see any, unless you somewhat count finding shotgun to
      destroy a huge crate blocking your way in one corridor. Thing is, at the beginning
      you may get the feeling that you''re probably getting some sort of side-scrolling
      Resident Evil game, but eventually, it will turn out to be false. There is also
      notes that you can collect, most of which are ramblings of crazy inmates, some
      of which are kinda obscured from the view and some are even hidden.


      I am not gonna lie, I actually had fun with Diacrisis and even enjoyed it despite
      all it''s problems, but what makes it so disappointing is how lacking and really
      overpriced it is. It sure has some potential, but so far it feels like playing
      through a beta version that pretends to be a full game.


      Thank you for reading my review, hope it helped! Check comments for updates!'
