    review: My play space is 3.9m x 3.2m and I still can't play this game unfortunately.
      I really want to, but I can't reach certain things that are outside the play
      area. Ah well, otherwise it's a great concept, I just wish it was actually supported,
      or a sequel is made. Still thumbs up because it's cheap as hell.
