Honestly though, I don't think they are worth such a price even during a sale. Most items you can buy or find in the base game are also very good. All oft them allow you to customise your character in a way you want and still look dope. \n\n[b]I woudln't recommend buying this DLC or any other similar pack.[/b]","timestamp_created":1593415565,"timestamp_updated":1593415757,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zN2+//ICcoKhkQI="}
