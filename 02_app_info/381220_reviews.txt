It's a bit unpolished and the UI isn't great, but there is a good variety of towers and enemies, your character gains levels and can attack, and you can boost yourself or your towers through a city upgrade system. If you like TD games, I'd say it's worth checking out, especially if it's on sale.","timestamp_created":1570928541,"timestamp_updated":1570928541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5071868896484375","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41Oeo4e0CepKB1AE="}
