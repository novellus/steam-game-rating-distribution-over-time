I've played both Time Ramesside and Sacred stone... and both I've had to refund after 15 mins of play because it's so awful. Note, I do not refund games often... I have most of Digital Homicide's crap in my steam library, and alot of generally awful games (rpg maker games that appear to be done by 10 year olds with no spell check). I enjoy bad games. I actively search for bad games to collect  them just to have them.\n\n... I refunded both Time Ramesside and this game. Do you understand how bad a game it has to be for someone that loves bad game to say this is too bad to even have sitting in their library? Purchase it yourself... when you do have fun downloading the 8gb file... god help you when you enter the game. \n\nYou know in minecraft when you try to dig to the bottom of the world? That's Jason Welge's games. His games are the bedrock... the absolute bottom of the barrel.  I doubt you can get worst than his shit... other games are bad, but charmingly adorably bad... his game is bad in a way of watching a newborn puppy being flogged with a sack of quarters YOUR QUARTERS THAT YOU PAID TO SOME SHADY MAN... you look on in awe, disgust, and  feeling sorry for the puppy. Just as you feel you need to look away the puppy looks in your eyes... and it's just ... no... NO JASON STOP! STOP MAKING GAMES! This is awful... this is awful... save the puppy, stop beating it. Unreal Engine isn't supposed to produce this crap.\n\nThe worst part is there is not even one god damn mermaid cannon in this game.","timestamp_created":1456141374,"timestamp_updated":1456141692,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":37,"votes_funny":17,"weighted_vote_score":"0.639551758766174316","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwxt2zhNMCdb/JUQ=="}
