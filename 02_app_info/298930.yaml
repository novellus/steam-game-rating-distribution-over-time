    review: 'Great Lovecrafftian adventure/horror story.


      As a police detective, you need to find out what happened to Clark Field and
      why he was murdered and what the connection was with Loath Nolder.


      Like many of these type of games, there''s lot of reading involved. Find notes
      and books to gather clues and solve the mysteries of this adventure. In order
      to find all clues required to complete the game, you''ll not only need to find
      notes and items, but also mark specific words or sentences correlating with
      the things happening around you, and this is quite a clever system. You cannot
      find clues to things you haven''t learned about yet, so that adds a lot to realism.
      Now, in the highest difficulty setting, you have to ffind everything yourself.
      And since notes and books are spread out over several areas, it can become quite
      a hassle to remember where you''ve read what. So, to be sure, make some notes
      yourselves.


      After you''ve found some clues, you might need to combine them to come to certain
      conclusions. This part I liked a bit less because some obvious connections couldn''t
      be made while other more vague combinations are required to discover every little
      secret.


      While it''s already an older game, the rooms and objects are detailed enough
      for good immersion.  Sound, music, voice acting, are all well done and fits
      the game nicely.


      Really enjoyed this one.'
