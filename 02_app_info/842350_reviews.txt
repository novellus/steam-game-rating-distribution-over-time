But it's only multiple choice \"coding\". Maybe in the latter levels you actually get to code stuff, I highly doubt it though. \n\nThis should be a mobile game at best, and would still be bad then. Graphics are very bad as well as the animations. Not worth the money.\n\nAlso, it only runs on Mac.","timestamp_created":1558210010,"timestamp_updated":1558210132,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":47,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.793473899364471436","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgvej5uoCcfe3wQE="}
