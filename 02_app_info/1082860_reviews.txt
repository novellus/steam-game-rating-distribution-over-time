But no complaints there, as creating party, leveling up, battles and the story was all well connected.\nCommon, devs never tried to sell this as AAA or AA project, look at the price ... hence IMO, it well worth the money.\nJust set your expectations right and you will have your portion of fun.","timestamp_created":1600448565,"timestamp_updated":1600448565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48OGK0fQCf5HNogI="}
