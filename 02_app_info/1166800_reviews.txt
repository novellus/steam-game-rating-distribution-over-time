The adventures of my Omen continue, as I continue to unhealthily obsess over my beloved wannabe Dark Lord Aurion, skirt around my mother's overbearing shadow, unleash armies of fantasy students upon my enemies, and kick rules to the curb because evil, baby!! Seriously, I love this series so much and hope to see it continue on into junior and senior year. At least let it end happily with my glorious destiny rulling a vast dark kingdom from the lap of my wonderfully evil Lord Aurion. MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! (seriously, need more games like this that just let you be the villain you want to be. =D)","timestamp_created":1574583737,"timestamp_updated":1574583737,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qqOgzu4CfdOn3AE="}
