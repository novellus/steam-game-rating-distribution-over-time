    review: "ASTEROIDS MILLENNIUM takes everything that makes the classic ASTEROIDS\
      \ so much fun and polishes the rough edges. The classic Hyperspace mechanic\
      \ has been polished into something truly wonderful here. Also, in the original,\
      \ you had to press a button for each attack shot and had a limit to that repetition\
      \ before it would skip shooting a bit before continuing which created a unwelcome\
      \ break in the steady repeatitive shooting. AM polished that, and you can fire\
      \ repeatatively without a skipping a shot. Pure Awesome.\n\nThe Music, Sound\
      \ Effects and Graphics are awesome. \n\nI Hot-Keyed the game as follows:\nMOVEMENT\
      \ = WASD Keys\nFIRE LASERS = UP Arrow\nHYPERSPACE = Spacebar\n\nASTEROIDS CLASSIC\
      \ is fantastic fun for what it is! MODERN is fun as well, but I prefer CLASSIC."
