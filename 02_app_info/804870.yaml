    review: "It's not totally a wreck of a game but heck..\nIt got some nice ideas\
      \ and good graphics. That's on the good side\nPoor and clunky controls, glitches\
      \ and bugs, unbalanced difficulty settings (no difference between the skill\
      \ levels detectable), unfair difficulty in mode 'base defense', bad story, stupid\
      \ AI, generic level design and I could mention much more make this game forgettable.\n\
      Shame, because with some effort it could have been good. These work shows though\
      \ some skill and love of the dev. \nMaybe next time, I wish so!\n\nHolyMoly1984\
