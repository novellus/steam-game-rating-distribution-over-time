    about_the_game: All you asked for was a quiet night of mind-numbing puzzle solving.
      Just a few simple math problems to ease your mind into the shallows of slumber.
      But this cursed puzzle keeps giving you numbers for blocks you haven't solved
      yet. And your friend's score keeps climbing, while yours has stumbled backwards
      thanks to that wayward misplaced digit from a minute ago. Why did you agree
      to a base-16 challenge? You're an upstanding model citizen, a firm believer
      in the banality of decimals. Hexadecimals are for hackers and wizards, and you
      wonder how strange it is to wish for an extra three fingers to sprout on each
      hand.<br><br><strong>Suddenly, you see it.</strong> You scan up and down, and
      realize a thin sliver of empty blocks snaking up the puzzle leaves an opening
      for your glorious comeback. A momentary rush jolts your brain as you hover over
      the lonely block hanging perilously from the very end of the puzzle. If you're
      wrong, game over. But if you're right, <i>ah</i>, if you're right, then you
      cannot wait to see the look on your friend's face in the morning, the grimaced
      annoyance at your snatching away their sure victory from the jaws of defeat.<br><br>You
      exhale the breath you didn't know you were holding, and <i>click</i>. . .<h2
      class="bb_tag">SYNOPSIS</h2><br>Modulo is a puzzle game based on modular arithmetic,
      where you must not only deduce the modular difference between blocks but strategically
      place your answers to net the highest scores possible.<h2 class="bb_tag">FEATURES</h2><br><ul

      from gentle 5-digit decimal-based puzzles to exotic base-64 one hundred digit
      marathons, you can find the challenge perfect for you. And as your skill grows
      you can aim for higher and higher grades from the in-game rating system.<br></li><li>GLOBAL
