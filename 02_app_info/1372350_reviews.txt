Now that I said that, I also like the whole vibe the game has, like the colors it uses, being it on the text or the textures, it just looks good like a whole environment, and I feel like some music could help that chill atmosphere (and I just remembered that I liked the cutscene at the start a lot xd).\nAt this point I feel like the game doesn´t give me enough reasons to search for materials, I enjoyed the fact that there´s cannonballs, and maybe there´s more to look at (Ill be playing the game again on these days, and I´ll update this review), but the inventory is just overwhelming, there should be a way to prioritize some items over others, and there´s the fact that everything has this similar color palette (which works well like I said before), but in this particular case it just feels way too messy.\nAlso, from what I understand the whole game is kinda the same, but I feel it would be good to exploit the sense of discovery this world offers and reduce a bit your field of view and add some danger zones with idk, floating enemies like sky fishes or something like that, where the islands soil is darker and the sky too or... Yeah you get the idea. Although this is just a recommendation.\n\n\nIt would be great if you configure gamepad input, right now I can walk with the L-joystick, and jump with Y, the game feels very fluid at least while jumping and walking.","timestamp_created":1607823104,"timestamp_updated":1607823104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgLPurPYCcLHWuQI="}
