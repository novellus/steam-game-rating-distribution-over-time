In a game trying to support and encourage speed this is almost nonsensical. the second thing is that the leader boards just arent accurate. they will always say you're 6th or 8th or whatever number you get no matter where you move until you are actually in the top 10 when it cant possibly mess it up.\n\nAlso turning animations off either didnt turn them off entirely or doesn't work at all. really hard to focus and move at speed when theres a flash going across the whole screen so i cant even see what the board looks like. Audio also just doesnt work for me and im not sure why? probably something on my end but still frustrating.\n\nBut overall its a good game that really just needs to fix those few problems to become great. If what i said turns you off from this game in any way and it isnt on sale i wouldnt recommend. but if you just want a good looking minesweeper experience its absolutely worth it.","timestamp_created":1609786447,"timestamp_updated":1609786447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yfqv5/YCe+G8wAI="}
