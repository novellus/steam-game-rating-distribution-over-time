      \ Played 6+ matches with friends and nobody could figure out how to make larger\
      \ donuts consistently; there's no tutorial or anything to tell us what we are\
      \ doing wrong, just driving in a circle and it doesn't make donuts unless you're\
      \ going the minimum size. \n\n+ Modes are fun"
