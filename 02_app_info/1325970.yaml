    review: "\u263C Graphics \u263C\n\u2610 Ugh\n\u2610 Meh\n\u2611 Good \n\u2610\
      \ Beautiful\n- Standard realistic assets used. Everything was proportionate\
      \ and worked well with each other.\n\n\u266C Music / Ambience \u266C\n\u2610\
      \ None\n\u2610 Random sounds\n\u2611 Alright\n\u2611 Spoooks\n\u2610 Good \n\
      \u2610 Beautiful\n- The spooky sound effects leading up to triggers were a nice\
      \ touch and did not feel over-used. The ambience worked well, but some parts\
      \ did not have a seamless loop.\n\n\u2620 Difficulty \u2620\n\u2611 Easy \n\u2610\
      \ Average\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Hard\n\u2610 Smh\n\
      - Brain power can be set to CRUISE for this game.\n\n\xA7 Bugs \xA7\n\u2610\
      \ Rip power cord out of wall\n\u2610 Consider calling Pest Control\n\u2611 A\
      \ bug or 2\n\u2610 Nothing encountered\n- Only bug encountered was after the\
      \ blue-lit hallway, when the soccer game was on the TV. A noticeable drop in\
      \ frames was present until the end of this segment of the game.\n\n\u262F Story\
      \ \u262F\n\u2610 There is none\n\u2610 Back to the drawing board\n\u2611 Decent,\
      \ but surfacey\n\u2610 Captivating\n- There is a functional story, but since\
      \ the game is short, the story stays on the surface and doesn't really get intimate\
      \ with/for the player. Voice-over could've enhanced this.\n\n\u2694 Gameplay\
      \ \u2694\n\u2610 RAGE\n\u2610 Boring\n\u2610 Confusing\n\u2611 Terrifying\n\u2611\
      \ Fun\n\u2610 Challenging\n- A straightforward experience that had smooth mechanics\
      \ and progression. The jump-scares/triggers complimented the gameplay, and did\
      \ not feel over-saturated and random.\n\n\u06DE Game time / Length \u06DE\n\u2611\
      \ Short (0 - 3 hours)\n\u2610 Few hours (4 - 8 hours)\n\u2610 Long-form (10\
      \ - 20 hours)\n\u2610 Completionism (40-60 hours)\n\n$ Price / Quality $\n\u2611\
      \ Full price \n\u2611 Wait for Sale \n\u2610 Don't buy\n- The game is only $2.99,\
      \ so paying full price shouldn't be an issue. But, it seems like it is not fully\
      \ fleshed out, so waiting for a sale wouldn't hurt.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZmFaxexV1Tw"
