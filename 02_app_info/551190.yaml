      yourself confused with blood on your hands in a dark house with only a flashlight
      to guide you.<br><br>As clarity and cognizance begins to set in, the confusing
      haze you were feeling was almost a comfort compared to the harsh reality, that
      you... are not alone.<br>The air is putrid, and all you can feel are the eyes
      of the dead upon you. When there is nowhere to run, all you can do is hide.

      tall skinny pink creature is the Greeter (Revenge) - much like her cousin, from
      SMS1, she enjoys taking her time and hanging around dimly lit areas. She just
      wants to say hello.</strong><br><br><strong>The brown short creature is the
      Screamer. He is quite passive and will not go out of his way to harm you. He
      will however stop what he is doing to scream at you, alerting either the Seeker
      or Greeter to your whereabouts. He also can be stopped with perfect timing and
      a light in his face - which will cause him to panic and leave.</strong>

    review: 'This is a horror hide-and-seek type game with free roam where you hide
      from puppets. At the seek part, yu have to find an orb, which has a line moving
      towards it, for like  15-20 seconds, if you''re wondering, but you still have
      to hide from the monsters.

      This game tells us much more about the story in the 123 Slaughter Me Street
      world than the first one, so if you''re playing for the story, I recommend this
      one more, of course, you should play that one, too.

      The atmosphere is great again, but while the first one wasn''t really scary,
      this made me feel very anxious and stressful.

      I definitely recommend buying this game, especially with this price, but you
      should play the first one, too. Both of them is worth the purchase.'
