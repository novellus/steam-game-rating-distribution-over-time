It is a blatant money grab by a \"developer\" who uploaded multiple no-effort titles within a few days of each other, all under different dev names in order to disguise himself. Forest Monster, Zombie Variant, Devil Flight, Urban Riots, Undead Zombies and 去死吧蝙蝠, Escaping maze are other examples. There are more.\n\nThis one is a tiny Unreal level packed with so many skeletons that you can hardly move. There is no advertised wagon, trade goods, combat or roleplaying; all you can do is slog your way through a circular canyon until you get struck down in four blows (each hit takes off exactly 30% of your health, which is noted by a tiny piece of text called \"PH\", I assume for \"Player Health\").\n\nThere's one spot where you can escape the map, where you will then find yourself in a wondrous land of invisible walls and missing polygons.\n\nThere is no options menu; starting the app just throws you into the game, which is set to a very high detail level and completely unoptimized, meaning sludgy framerates even on a  high-end machine. This also means it's not possible to quit without pressing ALT+F4, resetting your computer, or smashing it with a hammer.","timestamp_created":1593241424,"timestamp_updated":1602485701,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mOnljfUCf6rPkAI="}
