      \ France</h2>Our  humanity\u2019s first masterpiece was created 36, 000 years\
      \ ago in Ard\xE8che, France. Within Chauvet Cave lies thousands of drawings,\
      \ enclosed forever. The Dawn of Art is a Virtual Reality experience, including\
      \ both an immersive film and a virtual visit of the cave that invites you to\
      \ meet your prehistoric ancestors, the first humans who ventured in a deep subterranean\
      \ world and left their marks preserved on the walls. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1236560/extras/thedawnofartCrane_612.jpg?t=1587978626\"\
