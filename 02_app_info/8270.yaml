    review: 'Sam and Max Season One, Sam and Max Season Two,

      Sam and Max Season Three and Tales of Monkey Island

      are hands down the best Point and Click Adventure games that Telltale has ever
      done.


      If Telltale did work on more games like this and didn''t go into a path of garbage
      Walking Dead Season 1 clones with fake "choices matters" while taking tons of
      license deals over the past 6 years they would not need to be shut down and
      their games removed from stores.


      I mean WHO could predict that?

      Oh right..... anyone beside Telltale.


      So.... good job Telltale.

      You had everything and then you decided to throw it away into a thrash for fake
      "choices matters" screen and brain dead gameplay.


      Congratulation!

      You won an award for the dumbest studio thus far.

      I hope you all and other studios will learn from that.'
