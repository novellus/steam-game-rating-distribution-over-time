    reviews: "\u201CI\u2019ve always enjoyed story-driven RPGs and this game definitely\
      \ falls into that genre. The storyline is very interesting and the fact that\
      \ it comes with multiple endings is definitely a plus as it puts more pressure\
      \ on players to play the game in a certain way to get the outcome that they\
      \ want.  The combat in the game is also another thing that I really enjoy in\
      \ the game.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://sea.ign.com/there-is-no-tomorrow-pc/156995/feature/this-game-was-made-by-a-solo-game-developer-is-it-too-ambitious?fbclid=IwAR1RGu5hS1QiZe5b7KbnL7BMQLHXWSRmrmawd5Nz_au3NSTUuCzollc9Yek\"\

    developer_response: 'Hi, sorry to hear about this. The majority of the bugs should
      be fix in the first few months of release after the feedback but I probably
      missed some hidden ones.


      Can you describe specifically which areas of the game it crashed and falling
      off areas? Is it in the first level where you wake up? thanks'

    review: "I wanted to love this game but I couldn't even get past the first section\
      \ because of all the bugs and the game crashing and falling off the map with\
      \ no checkpoint system at that point. I'll check next time to see if there was\
      \ actually a patch update on this before I try it again, I'll change the review\
      \ if everything works better. \n\nEDIT EDIT: To the dev it's the ENTIRE start\
      \ of the gameplay. Everything leading up to getting the doll head, I posted\
      \ in the bug reports about exactly what happens. My weapon passes through the\
      \ enemies and I get hit also."
