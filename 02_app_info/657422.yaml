    review: "It pains me to vote down any Pinball FX3 product cause even at their\
      \ worst they are still polished and good looking tables, one and all.\nBut this\
      \ pack is a bit of a turkey.\nSo world I hope you understand that getting licensed\
      \ products + music+actors voices is not always possible, its a minefield.\n\
      But thats pretty much whats wrong with this pack, it just feels a bit false,\
      \ not quite the real McCoy. \nNow the Star Wars packs give an old 70s boy like\
      \ me actual goose bumps while im playing. \nSo I use my skin as a guide, and\
      \ this pack leaves my epidermis as flat as a witches teet.\nStill worth a sale\
      \ buy cause the tables are still good to play.\nI LUV PINBALL FX3!"
