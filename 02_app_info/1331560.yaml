    about_the_game: "PANDOREX... Nobody really knows what is up with it.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nAbout the story:<br />\r\nAnd then there is Harry. Harry is a simple,\
      \ not very social guy. His best friend is his dog. Unfortunately he lost his\
      \ dog. And since his dog is the only thing that is important to Harry, he starts\
      \ looking for it, willing to do everything as long as he gets his dog back.\
      \ And that\xB4s where the story begins. Harry is only a very small piece of\
      \ the puzzle, but in the end he could be the most important one. The one piece\
      \ that holds the universe together or is responsible for the demise of the universe\
      \ and therefore the demise of all life not only on earth, but on all the planets.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout the game:<br />\r\nYou are responsible to aid Harry\
      \ in his adventures, help him to choose the right decision and solve puzzles\
      \ and riddles that come across Harrys long journey of finding his dog and hopefully\
      \ not destroying the universe. Pandorex is a humorous and funny narrative-driven\
      \ point and click adventure with a small tick of social criticism and a lot\
      \ of pop culture and subgenre references. This game does not take itself very\
      \ seriously, so you should not do it either!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br\
      \ />\r\n - Narrative-driven point and click adventure<br />\r\n - Riddles and\
      \ puzzles need to be solved to make progress<br />\r\n - Decision making: you\
      \ have to decide what the character will do or say. Based on your decisions\
      \ the story path may change."
