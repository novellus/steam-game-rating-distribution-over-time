I'm not exactly sure if I'm going to keep playing the game due to these. (1.2 hours at the time of this writing). \n\n1) When you click on a menu your mouse teleports to where the dev thinks you'd want it. When you're done the mouse teleports back to where it was before you were in the menu. This is just like a micro annoyance that builds up over time and makes me never want to look at my inventory/character screen etc. \n\n2) I have 20/20 vision but I cannot get the text at any resolution to not hurt to read. I *can* read everything but it just seems like WORK to do it and I can't quite put my finger on why I hate reading the manual so much. Also, the game refers you to a paper manual  for some things which of course you don't have. \n\n3) There are a LOT of spells and feats that you can use in battle. Here's how to cast one. Click the spell button, click spells, click the level range of the spell, click the spell, click 0-3 times to find your target, click cast spell. If you have a spell on one of the three quick cast buttons then you can reduce the amount of clicks you need down to 3-6. Given that 2 of your 4 characters are meant to be primarily spell casters this is just too much work. I understand this is an old school RPG, and an old one at that, but I need a better quality of life.\n\nAlso I'm already kicking myself that I forgot to use my silver level drama star which may make or break my ability to get out of the first dungeon alive.. This is actually a fine mechanic in the game but I'm so used to game states being saved completely that I forgot.\n\nOTHER THAN THAT...\n\nThe actual meat and potatoes of the game is fantastic. The underlying mechanics of the game is completely revealed to you via a very verbose combat log and a LENGTHY manual.","timestamp_created":1588559020,"timestamp_updated":1588559250,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpdDg7vECeJq1hQI="}
