    review: "I will be entirely honest out the gate; This game is far, far too short,\
      \ and has an abrupt, and annoying conclusion, that forces you into one of very\
      \ few categories. While I DO recommend this for those who enjoy COG Choose-Your-Own-Adventure\
      \ style games, I warn anyone that it will not end how you think it will, and\
      \ is simply... Bland.\n\nI had initially fallen in love with this game after\
      \ playing the demo some odd years ago on the COG website, having liked the Mobster\
      \ theme, and the setting and general premise were all top tier, in my opinion.\
      \ So, upon seeing it finally up on steam, I jumped at the chance to buy it,\
      \ alongside a few other games that caught my interest. My hopes were high, due\
      \ to loving the demo so much.\n\nHowever... (( Spoilers Ahead, please do mind\
      \ them ))\n\nA majority of the game IS the demo. After the demos end, there\
      \ is barely anything left afterwards to play, and nothing that truly affects\
      \ your ending in any material way. Or, at least, none that I could see after\
      \ being forced to replay the game over and over and over again, due to not having\
      \ the right stats to achieve the endings I was attempting.\n\nI feel as though\
      \ I was tricked by the demo, setting up the most interesting parts of the game,\
      \ yet not really doing anything with said parts by the end. There was not enough\
      \ attention paid to where it should have been, the focus trying to force you\
      \ into an unwelcome romance with Alexander/Ellie, and to make you into less\
      \ of an interesting character, by giving you supernatural powers.\n\nThe supernatural\
      \ powers I would have been fine with, as I love a good genre flip... Yet, the\
      \ way it was done was one of the worst ways I have ever seen in anything that\
      \ I had even a vague interest in. It was handled akin to a fresh-faced 13 year\
      \ old writer, newly acquainted with an anime fandom of your choice, writing\
      \ whatever it was that seemed to come to their creative, and overly energetic\
      \ mind.\n\nWere it not obvious, I despise the forced romance with Alexander/Ellie.\
      \ If I had a choice to not pursue it by the end, and to just completely ignore\
      \ them, and instead romance The Pitt, Lulu, The Police Captain( Forgot his name,\
      \ do forgive me ), The Dragon, or even The Bull, I would have been much happier.\
      \ I would have taken anyone over Alexander/Ellie. \n\nThe character whom I had\
      \ decided to play as was named Wulfric, as a nod to the fact he saw himself\
      \ as nothing but a dog, to be commanded by The Bull and do whatever they told\
      \ him to do. Religious, and regretful of how his life had turned out, but accepting\
      \ of the fact he would never be more than a flee ridden mutt, doomed to die\
      \ in the gutter. However, by the ending, he was forced into the role of being\
      \ a power crazed lunatic, hellbent on rescuing a man who he loved, but was not\
      \ interested in pursuing for romance, due to being a broken human - Yet the\
      \ only ending I could complete with this build of the character, that did not\
      \ involve going to purgatory, was the one where he and Alexander run off together.\
      \ It was annoying, to say the least.\n\nSpeaking of; The Endings. They are all\
      \ very specific stat-wise, and you cannot complete a majority of them if you\
      \ play as a remorseful character, with a soft heart. You HAVE to play a certain\
      \ way to get most endings, and while I generally do not have a problem with\
      \ this, the fact of the matter is that it's frustrating in NOLA is Burning.\
      \ I gladly replayed other games to get their various endings, but with this\
      \ one it was an absolute slog, and I simply stopped caring at some point. Thus,\
      \ I have not collected all that I could, as it was just... Too cumbersome of\
      \ a task.\n\nAnd, finally, it was underdeveloped. There is very little to this\
      \ game, as I had previously stated, and it shows as it can be beaten within\
      \ an hour, at most. The game could have gone for much, much longer, and expanded\
      \ upon all of the things, plot points and the like, that it started, but finished\
      \ in the most bland of ways. The writing in general is good, I enjoy the style\
      \ quite a lot, but again, it would have been better if it were larger of a game,\
      \ and allowed more freedom, and did not rely on stats as much for the ending.\n\
      \nIn conclusion/tl;dr; It was 'Okay' at best. The story was too short, not enough\
      \ time spent on expanding the characters or story, was tedious to replay, and\
      \ was generally lackluster. Also let The Pitt live, and let me romance him since\
      \ he very obviously had a crush on the PC, thank you."
