This is a pretty standard RPG but with a cool cyberpunk theme. Just keep in mind, though, that it is still early access, so the game is incomplete and there are a few bugs that you're bound to run into. Having said that, it'll provide you with a interesting story and fun battle mechanics that are a bit of a throwback to years past.","timestamp_created":1607392124,"timestamp_updated":1607392124,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwxquCoPYCftaLuAI="}
