I played this for a couple of hours and loved the decision making and in depth story/characters, but I did have a few issues. I had to reload my save multiple times because the game wouldn't load the next day, I also had to start a new game as I couldn't progress based off the previous choices I had made. The art style is amazing and it has a lot of attention to detail, I really like how so far all of the characters seem very diverse. Overall for the price I would say its worth checking out, its a fun experience, just needs a lot of polish and maybe some less repetition when starting a new game.","timestamp_created":1598272454,"timestamp_updated":1598272454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629754304885864258","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1598275511,"developer_response":"Hey there!\nThank you for your time in reviewing MC\n\nAs you know, the game has just been released in Early Access to let us understand how to improve it and, of course, polish it!
