Upon reaching level 6, the levels begin to require the player to use coloured patterns that have not been unlocked yet rendering further progress almost impossible. I guess you can keep restarting in the hope of getting a playable set of pots to make but I got fed up with it.\n\nEdit: I have now tried contacting the developer, but their advertised external website is no longer active so I cannot contact them. I stand by my advice not to buy this \"product\".","timestamp_created":1561763902,"timestamp_updated":1561792973,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538381755352020264","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jLGH0esCe8HNxAE="}
