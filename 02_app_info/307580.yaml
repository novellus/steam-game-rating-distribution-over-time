    review: It was a decent game. I quite enjoyed the puzzles, although the characters
      were pretty one-dimensional and the storyline could've been more original. After
      for instance Darkside Detective this was a more challenging treat. The world
      was interesting although it felt more like what people in the late 1980s might

      exactly that :)
