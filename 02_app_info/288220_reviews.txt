It has plenty of replay value, it gives you plenty to do, plenty of routes and endings. It's beautiful art, clever use of the 'otome' game, giving you side games to do. Time management, even what you wear can be important to your endings. This is a game I recommend for everyone.","timestamp_created":1609105140,"timestamp_updated":1609105140,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkv2I0/YCcunxvQI="}
