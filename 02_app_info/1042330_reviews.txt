No sweat in the play and doesn't require too much brain work.\nThe control can be a bit tricky though, because the cat has a habit of sliding off blocks, especially during teleportation. The most challenging part of this game is probably wrestling with that sliding problem.","timestamp_created":1609674730,"timestamp_updated":1609674930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9caG5PYCfOSFwAI="}
