    review: Tried playing this on Linux when it came out - was very buggy, kept falling
      through walls and couldn't get past the first jumpy pillar. Tried it months
      later on Windows and turns out I'm just terrible - still can't get past the
      jumpy bit! Haven't rage quit this hard since Dark Souls 10/10 would recommend
