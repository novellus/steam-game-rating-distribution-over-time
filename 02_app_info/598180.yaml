    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">What is it?</h2>Arcane Mapper is a mapping
      tool designed for Digital or Virtual Tabletops and printing for physical play.
      Put together high quality maps for D&amp;D, Pathfinder, GURPS, Hero or any other
      Pencil and Paper RPG system - whether on the table top or virtual. It features
      a simple to use interface for drawing out rooms, adding objects and adding atmosphere
      with high quality lighting. Ideal for dungeons and interiors with support for
      outdoor environments coming before the full release.<h2 class="bb_tag">What
      is the idea?</h2>Arcane Mapper is an easy to use tool for creating maps for
      roleplaying games. The tool can produce top down, forced perspective 3D looking
      environments that mesh well with simple images for objects - no modeling or
      3D experience required. With free assets available for private use on the internet,
      this software allows you to put together high quality maps for your games with
      less effort, without constraining you to predefined map pieces, tiles or limited
      assets. Easily render out high quality images for Virtual Tabletop games or
      print out maps for a physical tabletop game. Even save out .PSD files that preserve
      the layers for Photoshop if you are more artistically inclined.<h2 class="bb_tag"></h2>Longer
      term after the initial release, I am planning on adding Digital Desktop and
      possibly Virtual Desktop features with high quality real time lighting and fog
      of war with an easy to use interface for GMs and players.<h2 class="bb_tag">What
      editing and mapping features does the software support?</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>
      Rendering high quality images (such as JPG, PNG, PSD) for use with Virtual Tabletops
      such as Roll20.<br></li><li> Printing high quality images from your maps for

      The ability to import and export libraries where assets are already setup with
      scaling, lighting and shadow settings.<br></li><li> Easy to use interface for

    review: Honestly I was hoping for more. I haven't seen a lot of reviews and I
      couldn't understand some of what people were saying. so that being said, it
      would've been a great project to complete and use to create RPG and DND maps.
      However with the heavy lack of content you just wasted 10 dollars and good luck
      understanding the instructions. You have to import custom images to your library
      and you don't even get any  of the basic library tool that are advertised. If
      anything what they provide in the images is a form of false advertisement, they
      do not come with the software and you have to find a way to create or import
      other peoples work for those images
