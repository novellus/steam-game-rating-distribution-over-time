      /><br>A dozen dozen dazzling donut dilemmas await you, that's 144 (and, perhaps
      more...) puzzles to please your particular puzzley passions. To excite and delight
      there are mechanics galore; from splitters to pushers, mergers and cloners,
      randomizers, teleporters, and more!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1070790/extras/slideshow.gif?t=1607113738"
      /><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1070790/extras/deliciousdonuts.gif?t=1607113738"
      /><br>What's your favorite donut? Sweet and sprinkled... a jolly jelly-filled...
      perhaps a marvelous maple bar? What about one shaped like a pumpkin, a snowflake,
      or a star! Discover many a whimsical shape as you explore a sweet skyscape of
      pastry possibilities.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1070790/extras/donutboxes_bigger.gif?t=1607113738"
      /><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1070790/extras/sweetsatisfaction.gif?t=1607113738"
      /><br>With pleasant pastels and mesmerizing machines the satisfying scenes will
      catch your eyes and mesmerize! Each of a dozen donut boxes brings its own fetching
      flavor; a taste of autumn, a sip of summer, a whisper of winter. Days in the
      sun. Nights under the moon. And each world with its own special tune. The lullabies
      of these pastel skies are all unique and each reaches its peak when you find
      your way and set your factory to play!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1070790/extras/ModernLoop.gif?t=1607113738"
