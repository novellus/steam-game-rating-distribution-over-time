This makes it really hard to make money in the game, and if you have very few ways to make money in a game it becomes 'game breaking'\n-Battles are bugged, especially scenario battles. In normal battles, your ship stops completely sometimes, and you can move only 3 clicks, b4 you have to repeatedly click the range and then engage button when world map traveling. And when you encounter the story battles, and you destroy the ship your battling, and it still has 1 hp left while its on fire of debuffed when you destroy it, the ship is destroyed but the 1 hp remaining still shows, which leaves you stuck in the battle... another 'game breaking' bug.\n\nIm sure there are a ton more that i havent encountered, but those are the ones that i encountered in the first 2 hours of the game, and have restarted, deleted and redownloaded the game 8 times now b4 i got fed up with the bugs.\n\nThis game has good premise, and has great game play ideas, and would probably keep it in my library, but looking at the slow update, it may take a while for the game to finish, so ill just not recommend it until many of those game breaking bugs are fixed.","timestamp_created":1604644951,"timestamp_updated":1604644951,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4vdqSzvUCeM3PrAI="}
