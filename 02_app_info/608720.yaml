    about_the_game: Ever been so moved by something that has no physical properties?
      Only the most pure of all auditory sensations can so strongly alter a human's
      emotion. THis. is exactly the kind of effect the masterful vibrational manipulations
      known as the Ticket Original Soundtrack (Ticket OST) has. Once entered the brain
      through yoru audio receptors (ears), you are not yourself anymore. You are nothing.
      You, there is no, &quot;you&quot;. you are everything, all is one, one is you,
      you is nothing. Nirvana is reached. Thank you.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/608720/extras/OST_1600_stretched_ss.png?t=1594516845"

    review: "A truly amazing soundtrack, probably almost the second best that I've\
      \ heard in my life, and the only one to give me a sense of wirbels\xE4ulenschauer.\
      \ It meanders the gamut from ASMR inducing to transcendentally horrifying. Heh\
      \ i guess you could say that it is like AURAL sex ha ha i guess you could say\
      \ it gave me an EARGASm"
