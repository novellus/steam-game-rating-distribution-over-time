It's a solitaire collection. From Interplay. That is on Steam, for some reason, with $12.59 price tag on it. That costed $1.25 on a sale. That I bought last evening, while, as it seems, I was drunk as a lord.\n\nIts graphics looks like the game was made in late 90's or early 2000's, but actually it was made in 2017 on Unity engine. Surprisingly, it has no music, and its primitive interface reminds me of old free games written in HTML. And there is nothing that connects this project to Interplay besides the logo on a title screen and a picture on a deck...\n\nSo, Interplay Solitaire is a shameless cash-grab trying to strike on your nostalgic feelings simply with the word \"Interplay\" in a title. It was made in 2017, but it has simplistic graphics, lazy art-design, poor interface, and it's completely deprived of any music (all you will hear is a rare sounds). I still can't believe that this pile of code was released under \"Interplay\" brand. \n\nAnd you know what's funny? I found Interplay Solitaire on Google Apps - and it's completely the same game! For free, for mobile phones! But for $12.59 on Steam!
