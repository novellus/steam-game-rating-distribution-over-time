    review: "Beyond purchasing to support the developer and his 3d artist:\n\nLike\
      \ it says on the tin, this DLC imports the missing Digger faction into VD2 from\
      \ VD1 and updates them for VD2's art style. It features an alternate start that\
      \ integrates early acquisition of the Big Red carrier/dreadnought into both\
      \ the story campaign and sandbox play. It is initially able to build the Vulture\
      \ heavy fighter, Welder repair fighter, and Loader EMP ramming fighter. It starts\
      \ out only armed with a heavy drill array for mining and ramming, and a small\
      \ autolaunching hanger of Loaders to support disabling targets for ramming.\n\
      \nFrom a quality of life perspective it can mine immediately on its own and\
      \ automatically access the auto-dock feature of bases as an oversized ship.\
      \ It can be heavily upgraded while docked at a base to add multiple turrets\
      \ and unlock onboard production of the remaining Diggers ship designs noted\
      \ in the DLC description. This is balanced by most of the upgrades being relatively\
      \ expensive to obtain in the early game, and the carrier fleet upkeep cost being\
      \ an ongoing drain of credits during the early game before you have a proper\
      \ economy set up. \n\nFrom the story campaign perspective, uncomplicated direct\
      \ access to a second ship list for variety is welcome. From a handling perspective,\
      \ their ships are tough but generally focused on ramming and close ranged combat.\
      \ Behind the scenes, the engine updates for this DLC add a few additional functions\
      \ to the modder's toolbox that will be useful.\n\nUnfortunately, this DLC does\
      \ not add the Diggers as an independent pirate faction on the map, and does\
      \ not add bases for them. The DLC explains this away by presenting this as the\
      \ last Digger carrier when you acquire it. The overall Digger ship list also\
      \ lacks ships for the ship capture and base capture roles. The community will\
      \ have to rely on modders to extend the Diggers for these aspects, hopefully\
      \ doing so in a manner that does not rip off the DLC itself.\n\nMy only serious\
      \ complaint is that the first person camera position for Big Red was set at\
      \ a point on the ship model where a set of heavy safety cage bars are obscuring\
      \ most of the camera. While 'realistic', it borders on unusable - it obscures\
      \ too much of the screen from combat awareness, and gets in the way of lining\
      \ up the drill array for mining or ramming. I found myself defaulting to chase\
      \ camera view while piloting it, which is something I normally don't do for\
      \ most of the other ships in this game.\n\nCertainly worth the value of the\
      \ asking price, in my book."
