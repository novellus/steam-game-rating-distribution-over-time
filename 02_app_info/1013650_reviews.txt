After you complete the dungeon you can do the achievements or do trial runs. While the dungeon was somewhat short, it was quite enjoyable.\n\nOnly thing that felt a bit off were the controls, seemed a bit janky to me. Might be due to the fact this is meant for phones.\n\nFor the price, its pretty good though.\n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1608243041,"timestamp_updated":1608243041,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rqqwufYCc+OFuwI="}
