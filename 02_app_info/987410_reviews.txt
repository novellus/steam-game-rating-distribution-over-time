The game chuggs the whole time. The worst thing about this is when you play as the ninja and using the pole to swing, when you are launching yourself and try to latch on to the next point, you can't see the frame that would let you easily see if your going to hit it correctly, which doesn't make it impossible, but just more difficult than it should be. While you are very young you can't perceive that sort of thing, but if you are a person that is revisiting it later on you will notice it. Still good though. Fun gameplay, good sprite work, nice music.\n\n\nNow, on to the version this game was based on, the megadrive/genesis version. Obviously the graphics look worse, mainly from everything having strange lines and dithering.  All the strange stuff going on with the ingame art was actually very purposeful, if you played it through Coaxial/av on the real hardware, everything smooths out and actually looks very similar to the PC version. Sound is very bad though. Only one sampled sound effect can play at a time and they sound terrible. The FM style effects are better, but still a bit flimsy sounding. The pc version uses the exact same sound effects as the genesis version, so the sampled SE sounds way better, but the FM noises are still there. It seems like they reprogrammed some the noises to an FM synth that had more operators, they sound way better (read: more complex) than their equivalents on genesis. Still, most of the noises are 88kbps wav files, with a few being 176 kbps. You can freely swap sounds out which is cool. Aside from those things the games are the same between those versions.\n\nIf the core gameplay you play here is enjoyable enough for you but the framerate is a dealbreaker, you might want to seek out the genesis version thats more consistent if you can deal the downgrades i discussed above. The genesis version was is only released in 50 hz format, but if you look online you can find that someone modified it to play at 60.\n\nEDIT\nGet the brazilian version instead, apparently that one is the most complete version for genesis and the euro one was rushed out and buggy.","timestamp_created":1601161066,"timestamp_updated":1609980012,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51530611515045166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3qyS7fYCdtSmpAI="}
