My complaint is that the content is wrapped up in the \"Reference Material\" so that you can't reference the material or change it the way you can with other modules you can buy. It's hard to describe what I mean. There is no \"Story\" content so you can't make a copy and add your own notes or links . The \"story\" parts are locked up in the \"Reference\" material. So It's hard to add this content to the \"Runelords\"  adventure path or any other content set in this area. I hope this isn't a trend, the power of Fantasy Grounds (for me)  is being able to link content and modify it as I wish - like I would with the physical material with the bonus of being able to edit and manipulate everything with links. This content is not easily customizable you cannot easily reference the material from a different module. For example the Rusty Dragon floor plans and story elements are not linkable from Rise of the Runelords easily - the map is not in \"Images\" you have to find it in the reference material then add the link. The \"story\" part is in the \"Reference\" material not in the \"Story\" material and cannot be modified - it you don't like the dialog material too bad you're going to have to write out everything yourself.","timestamp_created":1608875951,"timestamp_updated":1608876753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4huChzPYCfOz7vAI="}
