    review: "This plays as if it's designed for pre-school kids both visually and\
      \ in playing style - slow with irritating boxes popping up all the time. Worst\
      \ aspect of all though is that the game will NOT play in full screen mode, only\
      \ in a small window making it difficult to impossible to find the items required.\
      \ \nHaving only managed to put up with this child's game for and increasingly\
      \ boring 10 minutes I can't comment on any hidden object games - if there are\
      \ any. So far the only searches have shown thumbnails of the items to find or\
      \ just a number for a specific object i.e. 5 brushes, 12 origami birds etc.\
      \ \nIt is so boringly simple with no requirement for any kind of skill just\
      \ amazing eyesight - although by going into the menu it is possible to look\
      \ at a larger screen then return it to it's windowed format to play. Nah, don't\
      \ think so. 0/5"
