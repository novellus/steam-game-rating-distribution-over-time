If you're interested in it, it's called \"Manhattan\".\n\nI'm not ashamed to say, this game is a lot better than the game we made.\n\nThis game is what I would call a hidden crowd game. Basically, there is a crowd of non-player characters that look identical to the player characters, and it is the player's task to conduct an objective without being noticed by other players. This is primarily accomplished through careful movement and crowd navigation, in order to decieve opponents into thinking that you are an NPC.\n\nIn this particular game, the objective is to kill your opponents. This is done through moving up to the suspected player and attacking (by pressing X). This instantly kills them and awards you with one point.\n\nThis dynamic is made complicated by the different player classes available. At the beginning of each round, players anonymously choose a class, which comes with 2 unique abilites. One ability can be used once, the other can be used three times, but both interact with the gameplay in interesting ways.\n\nWill you be a Warrior, who can cause a crowd of npcs to attack, or a Ranger, who can feign death by tricking an opponent into thinking they killed an NPC? A Rogue, who can clandestinely kill a player without making any noise or visual cue? Or a Wizard, who can teleport and polymorph foes. I feel these different classes are well-tested and had real thought put into them.\n\nI hope this game is successful enough to add additional classes, maps, and modes. Don't misunderstand me though, the game is well made as it is.\n\nHidden crowd games are an exciting genre that is just getting started, and I hope this game carves out a name for itself on the ground floor.","timestamp_created":1513561761,"timestamp_updated":1513561761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.657473444938659668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zvTTs+ACf7y5kgE="}
