    review: "Now I will admit to having been very critical of the first act and how\
      \ insufferable the main character is in it, but I did say I would give chapter\
      \ 2 another shot if he developed somewhat. I am extremely pleased to say that\
      \ he has, and more importantly the internal monologues have taken a back seat\
      \ and interactions have a much more conversational feel. This chapter blows\
      \ the first one out of the water, now that all the heavy handed political diatribes\
      \ are out of the way it feels like the story gets a real chance to breathe and\
      \ not a minute is wasted. \n\nThis chapter IMO makes the first one worth slogging\
      \ through. Siedh is bae. Also this guy is gonna be completely fucked up by the\
      \ last chapter."
