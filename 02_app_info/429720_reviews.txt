The game has many great ideas, and you really have to think outside the box to figure out what to do next. If you can't figure out what to do next in the game, check the files, or maybe restart it: you might be surprised what's there. This game takes many creative liberties, and I love it for that. While it doesn't have much playtime, check it out, it's well worth the time and price.","timestamp_created":1609918209,"timestamp_updated":1609918209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vsum6/YCeLH3wAI="}
