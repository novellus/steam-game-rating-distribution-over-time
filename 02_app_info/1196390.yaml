    review: "A reluctant thumbs up. It wasn't a bad game for this sort of game. \n\
      \nHowever, it was too serial for me. The game basically just led you through\
      \ everything. For some, this might be a pro because it makes feel like more\
      \ of a real story. (I personally don't care much about story. I just like finding\
      \ things.)\n\nIt was also fairly short for the price (9.99 US)."
