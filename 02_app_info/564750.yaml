    review: "Dimension jump has excellent level design; with abilities that are easy\
      \ to learn but challenging to master. This is a game that will test your planning\
      \ and ingenuity as well as your reflexes.\nThe vanilla game is divided into\
      \ multiple sets of 10 levels; with new puzzle mechanics being introduced each\
      \ time. Such include: swapping dimensions, lock switches, flipping Gravity,\
      \ different movable/breakable objects, warping lazers, timers etc. Stages are\
      \ unique, quick and fair; resulting in a nice \u201Cjust one more go\u201D type\
      \ feeling.\n\nThere\u2019s a fantastic sense of progression as well. You only\
      \ need to complete 7-8 levels of a set to unlock the next 10. Achievements are\
      \ plentiful and are spread out quite evenly.\n\nReplayability wise: there\u2019\
      s speed-run leaderboards and hard to reach bonus stars in each level which require\
      \ you to find more innovative ways to complete each level. \nThen there's the\
      \ level editor: making your own levels and sharing them is pretty intuitive\
      \ in this game :).\n"
