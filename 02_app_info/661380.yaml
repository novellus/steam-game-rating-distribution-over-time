      /><br><br>Currently the game has 4 different weapons you can buy and build a
      defense system with. These are the current weapons we have made, with <strong>WAY</strong>
      more coming in the future:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>The first one is a Rocket
      Launcher that deals a great amount of damage with low turret range for a low
      price.<br></li><li>The second one is a high range Laser Cannon that deals an
      okay amount of damage but has an medium price.<br></li><li>The third one is
      a Shield Cannon that deals a medium amount of damage but has a wide range to
      hit multiple asteroids coming in, The price of this cannon is quite high.<br></li><li>This
      fourth one is a Homing Launcher that has a high rate of fire and deals a great
      amount of damage, The Missile follow it's target to there is almost no chance
      of it missing aslong the asteroid has not had impact with the planet, The price
      however is very high.</li></ul><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rOMAmEW.png"
      /><br><br>Currently the game has 2 passives, which you can use to get a better
      income and make your defense system stronger with each click. These are the
      current passives we have, with <strong>WAY</strong> more coming in the future:<br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>The first passive is a Money Printer, It will generate $1
      a second and can be bought multiple times at a medium price, Using this passive
      is game changing if you use it correctly.<br></li><li>The second passive is
      Health Generation, It will generate 1 HP per second but comes at a higher price.
      This passive might save your planet.</li></ul>
