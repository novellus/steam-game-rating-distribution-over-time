There are tons of settings and the interface is simply to use and navigate thru. Your not going to get these crazy realistic backgrounds and themes to choose from..... and if your looking for a player with all kinds of useless options that you would never use in the first place...Then this isn't going to be your player.. But if that is your thing. you'll find tons of those out there ...I noticed that  the more they cost ....the worst the player itself seems to be ....  they usually compensate that issue with users freedom and control with all kinds of features and settings \n  ......I actually just read a review where this deuce bag was bashing a decent player...saying:  This player is garbage!!!!! DO NOT WASTE THE TIME......I just found a player that kills the competition with having the most user options that I have ever seen  .... I don't anything about most of these options or what they do yet....but I seen a setting that will allow you to actually let you fold your virtual display in half....That's crazy!!. You tell me a player out there right now that offers that feature .......ain't none that I know. \n   My Man was defenitly correct about one thing though....\"AIN'T NONE OUT THERE I KNOW AS WELL\" to even offer such a brilliant and genius feature as that must be. My mind can't even comprehend or understand how a feature like that can be used to make my  viewing experience that much better. I guess its my loss and  i miss out on things like this,...and I know I am and will never be a smart guy, and that is ok for me... but if your like me and your #1 feature is just to find one that has the best picture Quality and just works and plays any file. Then hands down...this is best in my opinion  and the one player I come back to anytime I want to watch  or check out a 3D movie, regular movie, whether it be in 4k, 8k or no K it plays them all and never has given me a single problem or even hiccup on me while watching anything thru my Headset. The sound itself is just as equally as impressive as this players image quality is as well. Def... my player of choice.\n\n[url=store.steampowered.com]https://steamcommunity.com/id/killurself2day/[/url","timestamp_created":1601536272,"timestamp_updated":1601537559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nfnE8fQCdpOUpQI="}
