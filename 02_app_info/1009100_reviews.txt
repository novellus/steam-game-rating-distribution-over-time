Im a programmer that spends most of their time on the computer, and i love challenging myself to a fun WPM challenge. this fun shoot-em-up zombie game is the perfect outlet you may seek to practice your keystrokes. ESPECIALLY NUMBERS. i need practice typing numbers without looking at the keyboard. i love the blood, the gore and the loud HEADSHOT noise i get. \n\nI do admit i have not gotten pass level 3, i almost got pass level 2 manor but im not sure if that matters. im not trying to win the game, im trying to shoot zombies and practice my keyboarding, for 5 dollars im happy.\n\nits also not even a necessarily scary game but sometimes i find myself screaming underpressure, with my fingers doing all the  work. would reccomend to any friend you have if you wanna test out their skill.","timestamp_created":1594267729,"timestamp_updated":1598123479,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/aHli/QCfOL6kwI="}
