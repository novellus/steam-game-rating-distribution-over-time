    review: "10/10. A hidden gem. \n\nI highly recommend this game. Well worth the\
      \ full price (although I think it goes on sale for 75% off if that matters to\
      \ you). I have paid far more for far less. This is currently my #1 game to play\
      \ in a library full of indie games, big titles, and old classics. The interface\
      \ style reminds me of MOO:2 which is also a favorite of mine in the space genre.\
      \ I really enjoy mining and space in games; so GEO really scratches that itch\
      \ for me.\n\nI was initially on the fence about this game. I remember thinking\
      \ it looked repetitive and lacking in challenge. I was pleasantly surprised\
      \ upon actually diving into the game itself. There is a lot of strategy and\
      \ planning to be had for those that are interested. Usually, this sort of game\
      \ snowballs out of control in your favor when you get too wealthy. So far the\
      \ game has increased in challenge for every increase in my own drill team's\
      \ strength. As your power increases you unlock tougher and more varied planetary\
      \ bodies with higher exploration costs. Planning your optimum route to planet\
      \ cores requires quick thinking, fast reflexes, and sharp math. Getting to the\
      \ bottom of a tough planet core is a thrilling triumph. Space monsters also\
      \ keep you on your toes: some reflexes required.\n\nEvery drill site is made\
      \ up of unique sets of tiles. Due to how the many subsystems of the game work,\
      \ some tiles will be more profitable to mine, some easier to mine, some required\
      \ for research, and some harmful to mine. As your drill speed increases you\
      \ will need faster reflexes to choose the optimal path to reach your current\
      \ goals. Having mined a core, your goals may switch mid mission from expediency\
      \ (due to limited drill health) to wealth (aiming for the more valuable blocks).\
      \ I won't get into all the details, but needless to say there is a lot to chew\
      \ on here for those interested.\n\nOther bonuses are the discovery of new planetary\
      \ objects and crew members on your journey through space. I love the hand drawn\
      \ artwork throughout. It is always a pleasure to discover a fantastic new world\
      \ or a crazy new character. Often the descriptions of planets and characters\
      \ are quite humorous.\n\nSpoiler Alert: The highlight of my game so far has\
      \ been discovering the planet Earth in the Phinexies 872 system. It seems humanity\
      \ has abandoned it due to the rise of the Dolphin Queen.\n\nThere is a lot of\
      \ grinding in this game, but I enjoy the grind. There is also no fail state\
      \ which I have so far discovered, but that is also a plus in my books. You could\
      \ play this game badly, and still be successful. For myself, the fun is in trying\
      \ to play as efficiently as possible. \n\nGraphics: 9/10. Reminds me of MOO:2.\
      \ Sometimes text is a little clipped out of the screen, but still readable.\
      \ The hand drawn artwork is a big plus for me. The 2D graphics suit this game.\n\
      \nSound: 5/10. Has it's own soundtrack, but I prefer to make my own custom music\
      \ playlist for this game which includes Queen's \"Under Pressure\". The game\
      \ itself gives solid indication of block breaking, chest smashing, and loot\
      \ jingling. Lots and lots of loot jingling.\n\nGameplay: 10/10. Relaxing, challenging,\
      \ and fun. Great after a long day of work especially if you love mining, space,\
      \ and art.\n\nDifficulty: 5/10. You can win this game no matter what you do.\
      \ Just remember: \"It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game\"\
      . Personally, being able to play without the threat of permadeath is a bonus\
      \ for me.\n\nIn closing, I'd just like to add that this game is clearly a labor\
      \ of love. There is fine attention to detail everywhere. For a one man indie\
      \ project this game is amazing. I've also had a ton of fun with it, and look\
      \ forward to more hours of enjoyment in the future. I am sure GEO 2 will be\
      \ a blast."
