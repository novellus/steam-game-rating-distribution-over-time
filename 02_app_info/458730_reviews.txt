The Vita version was later ported to Windows via Steam, and released on August 16, 2016. It is not connected to the previous game in the series beyond gameplay mechanics and can be jumped into without any prior knowledge.\n\n[h1]Livin' On A Prayer​[/h1]\nThe story of Conception II manages to be very concise during gameplay, whilst sounding incredibly convoluted outside of that context, so keep that in mind during this section. Human society is under constant duress as a result of monster attacks. These creatures emerge from areas of the world called Dusk Circles, mysterious dungeon formations that secrete dark energy. Prior to the start of the game's events, humans have been unable to venture into these areas, as they simply didn't have the ability to survive within them.\n\nHumanity is not without its defenses, however. You see, the world is protected by the blessing of the Star God, which imbues select members of the world's youth with star energy. Teenagers who possess the mark of the Star God on their hand, a side effect of the blessing, are forcibly gathered at academies located near the Dusk Circles in order to contain the problem. Here we venture firmly into the territory in which Conception comes into it's own. With this holy energy, a pair of male and female students are able to undergo a ritual which has a chance to produce Star Children, a chibi race of fighters capable of providing a great boost to mankind's defensive. That process is called Classmating.\n\nYes, the name of the core gameplay facilitating mechanic is a ridiculous pun, and the game continues to embody a similar level of silliness from here on out. Still, let's take a step back for a moment and take a look at the character who will make the largest impact in the game's story. Our hero is a young man named Wake Archus, who has only just arrived at such a school, just in time to thwart the attack of a creature which had escaped the defensive boundaries, rescuing two of his future friends in the process. Soon thereafter, by way of the routine testing, Wake is discovered to be God's Gift, a student with an immense amount Star Energy, making him capable of not only consistently producing offspring, but exploring what had been previously unknown territory, the innards of the Dusk Circles.\n\n​[h1]Born To Be My Baby​​[/h1]\nSeparate to dungeon exploration is the heart of the game, which resembles a visual novel in structure. Wake's movements take the form of a list where the player chooses a location or a character to visit, which allows the purchasing of items and the progression of relationships. The most important of these characters are the nine female students, which play into the Classmating mechanic. The heroines become available for Classmating relatively soon after their introduction into the story, leading to a rather uncomfortable exchanges and subsequent cutscenes. The strength of each's bond with Wake is indicative of the strength that the Star Child is capable of, raising it's potential skills and level caps. Some heroines are more capable of creating particular classes than others, of which there are as many as thirty-seven separate classes, leading to a large variance of potential party members.\n\nThese characters are really the soul of the game, as they each stand out in the limited context of the game. Each is uniquely designed, and well differentiated in terms of personality. It's genuinely entertaining to hear what each of them has to say as the relationships progress. Your interactions are only limited at certain points of the game, and these are lifted rather quickly as we continue to finish Dusk Circles, allowing him to become closer with his potential mates, each of which was given a character specific ending.\n\n​[h1]I'll Be There For You​​[/h1]\nSeparate to dungeon exploration is the heart of the game, which resembles a visual novel in structure. Wake's movements take the form of a list where the player chooses a location or character to visit, allowing him to interact with his fellow students and further his bond with them. Only those formed with the heroines can be truly increased, and they're used as indicators of the strength and level potential of which the mother's Star Children are capable of. As many as thirty-seven different classes are available, with some being more easily attained based on the chosen lady, leading to a staggering variety of possible party combinations.\n\nThese characters and your interactions with them are the most interesting part of Conception. An effort is made to see that all of them stand out in the admittedly limited context of the game. Each are uniquely designed, and well differentiated in terms of personality, and it's genuinely entertaining to hear what they have to say as their relationships progress. Your interactions with them are limited at certain points of the game, but these are gradually lifted as we continue to explore the Dusk Circles.\n\n​[h1]Bed Of Roses​​[/h1]\nIt's not always a great experience. One of the more annoying traits is the lack of any form of time constraint on interactions, and honestly, the developers really should've included some. Whilst it isn't advised, you could forego interacting with the female students until the game's conclusion and still manage to finish out every characters relationship arc without having to go so far as to step into a dungeon. This lessens potential attachment to characters that you might've chosen to spend time with of your own accord.\n\nI found the dungeoneering gameplay to be lacking, as it was simply not engaging enough to keep me invested. The game contains no additional difficulty settings, and as it sits, is on the easy side with minimal grinding necessary to see it to the finish. Beyond the initial play, I doubt the relationships would provide much in the way of value for subsequent plays, as they really don't contain any branching paths, meaning you'd be experiencing a very similar story, regardless of your dialogue choices. Perhaps the lack of a limiter is a blessing in disguise, as the game really doesn't have any replay value to speak of. It provides you with a save point after the final battle so that you can choose a different girl and experience their ending without forcing you to replay an entire section of the game to do so, an appreciated gesture for my money.\n\nConception II is far from perfect, and its thorns cut deep by the time the credits roll, but it does provide some charm in it's own ludicrosity. Aesthetically the game is very easy on the eyes, and it game has plenty of fun with the concept's inherent quirkiness. It comes mildly recommended for fans of visual novels and folks who enjoy relationship-values as a game mechanic, but the gameplay may not hold the interest of veteran role-playing fans for long. Have a nice day.\n\nTime Spent: 60 hours for one playthrough with all Heroine conversations & all endings.","timestamp_created":1485898797,"timestamp_updated":1609759724,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.64957427978515625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnoLK5vYCfLj8cA=="}
