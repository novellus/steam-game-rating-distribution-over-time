Go ahead if you want the achievements (which are easy to get).\n\nMinesweeper has 3 difficulties and each one has 3 parts and that's it. You can customize your puzzle too. The thing is, it's like there's no UI: no tracking mines or minutes in the game. Did you finish the puzzle? Too bad you won't know unless you're playing it for the first time, since the achievement will appear once you complete it.\n\nSudoku was hell for my eyes. No clear lines between the 3x3 boxes and once you finish it the \"solved\" line stays there until you quit the game.\n\nCatcher and Asteroids were a bit more fun.","timestamp_created":1577411558,"timestamp_updated":1577411558,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.573023855686187744","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp8fDou8Cet2o5wE="}
