    review: "I am rating this game neutral, even though it's  yes recommended.  I\
      \ am not putting negative yet because there are some planned updates  which\
      \ will address my current issues with the game.  In case you're wondering, this\
      \ is another wave shooter with flying drones and no locomotion.  It stands out\
      \ because of the amazing graphics.  Also, weirdly, the current environment is\
      \ very small.  Drones are sometimes just a foot or two away from your face.\
      \  Don't buy this game if you have claustrophobia, you do feel like you're in\
      \ a small room with bots flying almost 360 around you (more like 250).  Although,\
      \ drones can end up directly behind you.\nThere are currently only two types\
      \ of drones.  One that shoots at you and one that has a laser coming out of\
      \ its sides.  After each wave, their numbers increase.  After about wave 9 or\
      \ 10, they are just everywhere.  You can either dodge attacks or smash them\
      \ with a hammer if you have a hammer equipped.  You can choose your loadout\
      \ at the beginning which is just either dual-wielding guns or a gun and a hammer.\
      \  As you advance in the game, you can unlock 3 more weapons currently I believe.\
      \  However, unlocking those weapons is quite a grind.    (please note: unlike\
      \ the other reviewer, I had my hammer unlocked right from the start)\n\nI did\
      \ not see any difference in the waves, just more of the same.  Combat did feel\
      \ satisfying, mostly because of the graphics and animations, but once it got\
      \ too crowded, it seemed frame rates took some drops.  There were also slow\
      \ motions, explosions, and visual animations / sounds that were triggered for\
      \ reasons I wasn't sure about.  \n\nI don't think this game deserves a positive\
      \ recommendation yet.  It's currently on sale for $4.49 and I'm giving a neutral\
      \ recommendation.  I think the fun/content in this game barely meets a 5/10.\
      \  Just barely.  Mostly because of the good graphics.  But the gameplay is just\
      \ too simple.  The only difficulty is in the sheer number of things on screens.\
      \  There's so much that dodging bullets becomes more of guessing right on which\
      \ way to move to avoid them.  \n\nIf the game delivers on their promised updates,\
      \ then I'll happily recommend.  The promised updates includes more environments\
      \ and more enemies, etc.  This game badly needs those updates to give you a\
      \ reason to play more than 30 minutes.  \n\nIf the game does not deliver, then\
      \ I will gladly change my recommendation to NO.\n\nSale Price Rating 5/10"
