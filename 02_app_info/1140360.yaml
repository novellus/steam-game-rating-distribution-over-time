      Based easy texture generation and texture maps generation tool for preparing
      PBR materials for your 3D/2D Games!  </h2><br>It has everything you need to
      build a complete texture from small patches or samples of images of your desired
      size.<br><br>In addition with the capability of generating all sorts of texture
      maps, it has also the tool for increasing the resolution of the images with
      advance artificial intelligence based algorithms  to scale images to HD or 4K
      scale. <br><br>With Recent update. You can even author your PBR texture using
      nodes like that in substance designer.  <br><br>From the task of texture generation
      to texture completion, texture re-scaling and texture map generation; this software
      is a one stop shop to get all these solution in one package. <br><br>Not only
      that you will also have a plethora of sample texture libraries (of over 1,600
      textures of various types) for ready to be used in your 3D/2D Games at no additional
      cost.   <br>Texture Library Includes: Bark, Brickwalls,Concrete, Eatables, Extras,
      Fabric, Floor, Grassland, Ground, Hedge, Marble, Metal, Rusted Metal, Moss,
      Organic, Paintchips, ROad, Roof, Rust, Skin, Stones, Stonewalls, Walls2, Weathered
      Walls &amp; Wood.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features </h2><br>1. Texture Generation
      of desired size from sample input image with the feature of texture completion.
      <br>2. Texture re-scaling to high resolution. <br>3. Texture Maps Generation
      : Normal, Displacement, Ambient Occlusion, Specular.<br>4. Texture Visualizer
      in 3D Environment with direct feedback to changes made in the software. <br>5.
      A free Library of several essential textures of over 1600 files to jump start
      your 3D/2D game Development.<br>6. Seamless Tiled Texture Generation (recent
      update).<br>7. Image to Image color transfer without relying on external photo-editing
      tools. Useful for  changing color of textures as per its environmental lighting/season.<br>8.
      Node based PBR Texture Authoring. Also, you can contribute to its ever-growing

    review: 'As far as I can tell it does what it says.


      However the AI functions seemed to take forever and after waiting for several
      minutes of "processing" with no progress bar or anything I closed the program.
      Please note though I only have 2000 Cuda cores.


      At the time of writing the node editor is missing several quality of life features
      such as a search bar for the filters, copy/paste/duplicate shortcuts and box
      select. I would also love to see a gaussian, and kawahara blur nodes and sobel
      filters.


      The parameters for map generation are limited compared to free alternatives
      such as "Materialize" by bounding box software but get the job done, again though
      a sobel/edge map generator would be a welcome addition.


      Overall for the AI features you wont find any other implementation of them without
      paying out thousands of dollars since the tech is so new; so for the price it
      is great if you have a rig to run the processes.


      Why the developer decided to split all the program''s features up into individual
      executable files that launch their own windows is beyond me (although isn''t
      terrible). The dev should concider using Unity with the ML python integration
      to build the UI and integrate the libraries into a unified application.


      But hey beats cobbling together random free tools or paying for an Adobe monopoly
      subscription.
