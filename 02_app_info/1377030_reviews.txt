I know its early access and stuff, but uploading this alpha stage demo to steam? Really? Maps look the same. Effects looks like they were made in ms paint. Fov just resets with dashing. You cannot rebind melee. Dashing and jumping sounds like a revolver for some reason. The AI is supercrap. And my favourite: you you can see the radius for explosions, but if you are near the radius you still get damaged. WTF DUDE?\n\nThe only two good parts are the voiceover, and the weapon cooling mechanism. This game needs at least 4 more years.","timestamp_created":1609056830,"timestamp_updated":1609056830,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwo9jQ0fYCfqnWvQI="}
