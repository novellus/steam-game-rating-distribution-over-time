      \ mostly running passenger services but also turning its hand to freight operations.\
      \ A total of 98 examples were built, fitted with 1,550-horsepower Sulzer engines,\
      \ and they proved popular with crews. The \u2018Crompton\u2019 worked throughout\
      \ the BR Blue and Network Southeast eras, and 40 survived in service up to the\
      \ privatisation of the network and continued working for their new owners, EWS.\
      \ These have now been retired from service, though a number survive in preservation\
      \ today. With 7 authentic liveries and Sea Lion ballast hoppers, the Class 33\
