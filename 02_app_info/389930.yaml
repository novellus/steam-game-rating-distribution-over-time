    review: "For the most part i love the events in this mod, makes things interesting\
      \ :D\n\n some people complain that it makes things too hard but personally i\
      \ enjoy the challenge + you can mitigate the tougher events like the artifact\
      \ ai boost by bribing any ai that are currently stronger than the artifact civ\
      \ to war them (dont send weaker civs after them it will feed them)\n\nalso I\
      \ always enjoy anything that adds new ship parts and this adds dreadlord ship\
      \ parts.\n\nmy only issue with this mod is the events dont happen regularly\
      \ enough for my taste."
