On one hand, the game presented a unique mechanic that I haven't seen in any other game, but on the other hand the overall experience was kind of mediocre. This feels like a game that was more impressive when it came out on the less saturated indie scene, but now doesn't reach the standards that the market is at now. \n\nGravity Ghost is a 2D puzzle platformer all about using the gravity of planets to traverse and collect objects scattered across the level. The actual gravity mechanics feel solid (picture 2D Super Mario Galaxy for comparison), although when you have multiple planets gravity pulling against you, movement can be frustrating. The ability to terraform planets to create different gravity effects was a good puzzle element introduced that kept each level fresh and interesting. Another thing I quite liked was how all the permanent upgrades you got in the game were completely optional yet powerful additions to your toolset. However, the game is very easy, and eventually with all upgrades you can ignore any challenge a level presents and breeze through it in seconds. This leads to an overall very short playthrough, which while not always a bad thing, feels weird in the context of the game. The first couple areas took me 15-25 minutes a piece, while the later ones were done in less than 5 minutes. \n\nThe art and music is incredible in the game, and is probably the two standout features of the game beside it's gameplay. There is this neat, hand-drawn artistic style used for the backgrounds that gives the levels this dreamlike wonder, and Ben Prunty knocks it out of the park with the game's soundtrack. While the characters in the game have their own style as well that I have no problems with, the animations are not good, especially with the movement of the arms and legs. The voice acting is a mixed bag as well, with some voice actors sounding decent, while others sound like they were recorded on different equipment and are extremely muffled. The actual voice acting is decent, although a couple of the side characters sound really strange to the point that they are irritating to listen to. Not a great experience in general.\n\nFinally I had problems with the tone of the game, which tries to pair this incredible spiritual aesthetic with childish humor which don't mesh at all. I honestly think I would have had a better experience if the game was completely dialogue-less. The actual story of the game is presented in a fragmented sort of way that was more confusing than interesting. I will give the game that it had a satisfying conclusion, but the overall \"message\" of the game has been done in many other better indie games. There was also just a lot of story beats and details that were not needed to tell this kind of story yet I guess they were included for the sake of charm? Like I said, this is a weird one.\n\nUltimately I am going to recommend this game, as it is not completely terrible and the actual gameplay was really solid. But I would strongly advise getting it at some discounted price, as there is not enough content available at it's base price. At least buy the soundtrack, cause it is real good.","timestamp_created":1610015981,"timestamp_updated":1610015981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43Meb7vYCcvOewQI="}
