    review: 'This game is surprisingly fun considering it''s cheap graphical style.

      Combat is clunky but there is some nice upgrade mechanics.

      This game lacks a lot of polish and it''s overpriced for what it is, but if
      you really like side scroller shooters then its probably worth it.
