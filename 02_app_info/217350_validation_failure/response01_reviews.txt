You Don't need to know lots if you're making the basic stuff, And even then GML is one of the easiest languages I know, Next to Lua and HTML, I would recommend this to those who have an basic knowledge of game developement and no longer want to be limited with gamemaker studio lite, Besides this is one of the cheapest game developement software out there.","timestamp_created":1412672215,"timestamp_updated":1412672215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.646434903144836426","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/er09MgCdrmlLw=="}
