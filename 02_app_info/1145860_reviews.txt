There's no point hiding behind anything as he will get you.\n\nIf you watch my review below you will see this and I did state, it has only recently been released but I've seen more complex indie games working perfectly. I will play this game again within the next two weeks if I see they have fixed these issues but if not, I won't change my review.\n\nI don't want to see a good game being given a negative review all be wise of negligence.\n\nHere's my review: \nhttps://youtu.be/pEQr_JJ8N70\n\nHere's my second review that I did the next week: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/LmSYUYnd8b8","timestamp_created":1568119269,"timestamp_updated":1568655980,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542123079299926758","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw3tbLne0Cftr+0QE="}
