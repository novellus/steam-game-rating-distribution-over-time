The graphics are cool and colorist, but even though there isn't much diversity of elements to see, demand excesive hardware or the screen can freezes causing the deletion of the save file if program is closed by force. Also have another issue, the Keyboard only can be binded by editing a file (check Steam forums).\n\nVery simple mechanics: by getting experience and gold coins, player can unblocks skills, space for inventory and crew that works as powerups. Combat is easy but it getting hard by stages, is based on the fact that player havenÂ´t a ranged weapon to use at will and many foes has ranged attacks. \n\nGameplay strongly depends on speed that player can get by upgrading skills. It has randomized maps based on modular design, but there are few varieties and are quite similar. The luck maths and dificulty curvature are very well balanced, a very rare qualities in this genre. The foes are well depicted, but some haven't much relation with the plot. \n\nThe campagin has 6 stages wich at least 5 maps each, every map has from 8 to 12 random modules for explore; complete all stages with 85% of achievements takes about 36 hours of playing, majority to understood wich are the better skills and items, map system, how to beat foes and so. Wonderful for children and teenagers, or as casual game for adults. To buy with a high discount or in bundles.","timestamp_created":1550014828,"timestamp_updated":1550015190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558420360088348389","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv9qG8ugCccXhugE="}
