    about_the_game: '<strong>Kainga</strong> is ancient village builder set in a fantasy
      world full of surprises. Adaptation is key where weather events, massive beasts
      or other tribes can easily erase you from history. Every time you play, your
      village''s culture, technology, and look will be different depending on your
      surroundings, environment, climate, altitude and the resources available to
      you. Design a unique town with every play-through.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1269710/extras/TimelapseTiny.gif?t=1607535358"
      /><br><br>At the center of your town is your &quot;Thinker&quot;. This slow,
      weak, leader guides your clan, discovers new technology and must be protected
      at all costs! The Thinker uses energy to come up with technology that will help
      your town advance, and in return, the people must host festivals to recharge
      his energy.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1269710/extras/6CulturesTiny.gif?t=1607535358"
