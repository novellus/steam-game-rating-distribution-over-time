It's fast, has decent firepower and ammo, can actually climb reasonably well and is fairly stable in a high yo-yo maneuver. Just don't try out-turn a BF109 in it and like me you'll probably enjoy flying it far more than the Yak-1 or Lagg-3. \n\nThe I-16 is alright, again, its more enjoyable than the Yak/Lagg.  If you're curious about flying the P-40 though I'd say pick up that DLC and this because the P-40 career for BoM is pretty decent with few escort missions and the aircraft is pretty fun to learn. \n\nThere's also another big German bomber in this DLC.
