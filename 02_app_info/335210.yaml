    developer_response: 'Hi and thanks for your feedback.


      First of all,we''ve checked more time the scale trying to make the most perfect
      one,sometimes could seems wrong because we''ve tried to acheive an epic style
      for our game,and that''s why sometime some stuff could seems bigger than normal,but
      that''s a desired thing,we want the player being immersed in a never seen place
      before.


      However,one of the basic thing to know on Unity is definitely the clipping plane..
      however i don''t think it''s "right" to quit the game just because some issue
      with it.


      Actually it''s just a bug as could be some other,even if seems more simple or
      basic doesn''t mean we didn''t know how to fix it or what is the bug. Infact
      if there is some issue is just because we were trying to achieve the sweet spot
      between perfomance and no-glich visuals but of course eventually there could
      be still bugs in some positions of the map.. and that''s a possible reason why
      we''re on Early Access.. bugs.


      I can understand every points of your disappointment and we''re all sorry about
      it,it''s of course a reason to improve us and improve the game.


      Finally i do not feel it''s really right to say also "Your bar must be so low",there
      are different kind of games and different kind of people,what could be cool
      for you couldn''t be so for some other.


      Thanks for your time and your feedback,and sorry for any disappointment,we''re
      always try to improve.

    review: 'One of those uncompelling VR purchases.


      I''m all for tons of VR, more than I can even play. When a new title on Steam
      announces it has VR support, I normally investigate and see if it will work
      with the DK2 (Yes, beware as Valve is too incompetent to properly label VR titles;
      you must do your own verifications in order to make sure the game actually works
      with VR, even if Steam says it should... it may very well not - Steam just want
      to take your money)


      While this title worked virtually perfectly with the DK2, content-wise it fell
      short. Very short. Don''t get me wrong, it looks fairly good in there (fairly,
      not incredibly... I was more impressed with the visuals in Frontiers) but it
      just doesn''t seem right. The scales are off, the LOD lacks and as a showstopper,
      some basics like camera clipping values are wrong.


      I stopped my run when I recognized something I learned in Unity on day 1: I
      could see a big diamond-shaped hole in the skybox. So we didn''t change our
      default Oculus camera rig values. Hum. Quit.


      I regret this purchase. I find it alarming to read things like "must own for
      DK2 users". Your bar must be so low in the must have department.'
