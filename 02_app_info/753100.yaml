    review: "[h1]Unpossible[/h1]\n\nI have a game on my tablet that looks just like\
      \ this, but better in every way. It looks better, plays better, sounds better,\
      \ shows more polish, offers more challenge, and was overall much more satisfying.\n\
      \nThis game appears to be a broken copy of that exact game.\n\nRight away I\
      \ was blasted with very loud and really annoying music. I went for the settings\
      \ I n the corner of the screen and tried clicking it, but the settings button\
      \ didn't work.\n\nNot a good sign.\n\nOut of the box it supports 21:9 ultrawide,\
      \ which was great. The graphics were garish and bland. The background looked\
      \ pixelated and not terribly attractive. The game lacks a certain visual polish\
      \ overall that make it a bit hard on the eyes.\n\nI am not a fan of the music\
      \ either, most of which just sounds busy, loud, and overall feels like a bad\
      \ fit for this game.\n\nThe game is also quite short, which isn't a bad thing\
      \ for those of you that don't enjoy padding in games, but this just feels bare-bones\
      \ and could have made for some original ideas and challenges.\n\nThere is also\
      \ a cheat (or design flaw): [spoiler]When you hit the ESC key to pause, you\
      \ can still turn. This can be used when about to hit an obstacle, rendering\
      \ any challenge nonexistent.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Native\
      \ Ultrawide support\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Bugged options\
      \ menu\n    [*]No controller support\n    [*]Visually uninteresting\n    [*]Uninspired\
      \ audio\n    [*]Lacks challenge\n    [*]Copies a mobile game that's better\n\
      [/list]\n\n[b]Verdict: 3/10[/b]\n\nLacks polish, challenge, and fun. Definitely\
      \ not worth the asking price; probably not worth your time at all."
