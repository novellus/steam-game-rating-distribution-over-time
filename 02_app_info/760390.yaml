    review: "Heh, this is an interesting little reaction game. It's kind of like the\
      \ ultra-reduced version of Guitar Hero... Playing on more advanced modes REALLY\
      \ stretches your concentration. \n\nIt's 79p and if you like reaction games,\
      \ you'll probablty get your money's worth.  I usually go on about \xA31 per\
      \ hour to be worthwhile, and yeah, it's earned that.\n\npros\n* simple\n* challenging\n\
      * configurable\n* stable\n\ncons\n* it's a one-trick pony\n* graphics are are\
      \ basic as you can possibly imagine.\n\nI'll give it a thumbs-up because, although\
      \ it's extremely simple, it does exactly what it sets out to."
