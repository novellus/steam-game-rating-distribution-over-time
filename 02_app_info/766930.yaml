      /><br>Make use of a unique fighting mechanics that enables you to control the
      path of every projectile. Avoid obstacles, slip past the defenses of your rivals
      and corner them to inflict a swift and deciding blow. At your disposal you have
      a vast arsenal of magical weaponry - cast fearsome AoE spells, bring meteors
      down from the sky, summon ghastly creatures for help, put weakening curses on
      your enemies or finish them off with spectacular ultimate attacks. Now combine
      it with quick, real-time and skill-demanding duel system to experience virtual
      wizardry like never before!<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/766930/extras/Ignis_steam_chosedestiny.gif?t=1596205924"
      /><br>Take part in the Grand Tournament - unravel a mystery behind Ignis stones
      and determine who is the greatest wizards of all. Choose between powerful wizards
      - each a master of a different arcane style with a unique set of upgradable
      spells and passive skills. Chill the blood in your enemies veins, watch their
      bodies burn in hellish flames or suck the life out of them! Whether you hear
      the ancient shamanic rhythms or trust in academic knowledge and alchemy, remember
      that there will be only one winner of the Tournament. Better make sure to be
      the last one standing.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/766930/extras/ignis_steam3_ls.gif?t=1596205924"
      /><br>Test your reflex, tactical sense and high skills against other players
      in a variety of battle modes. Compete on diverse stages with adjustable properties
      like additional power-ups, barriers or ricocheting projectiles. Duel your friends
      on split-screen to see who have truly mastered the arcane arts or join forces
      to triumph over constantly learning AI. Then take up the challenge and battle
      against other wizards all over the world... if you feel brave enough.<br><br><a
