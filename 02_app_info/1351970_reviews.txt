I am speechless over the quality of this masterpiece. Words cannot express the enjoyment I had while playing this. So here are some words to describe it. When you open this, don't expect to alt + tab out üòç You are locked into this game like prison. Not only are you put in a choke hold and unable to escape when loading, you are also met with a blast of the catchy repeating soundtrack. You also have no choice to turn it down, so don't even bother looking for the volume button in game. And if you think you can open volume mixer to turn it down, don't even try. You can't alt + tab. So buckle in as Sex Apocalypse takes you in on this emotional roller coaster of a ride where you will be met with heart break, sex dolls, and gassy zombies. But don't ever forget to hold this support kit.","timestamp_created":1608775808,"timestamp_updated":1608775808,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515785038471221924","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwNagyfYCcOTSvAI="}
