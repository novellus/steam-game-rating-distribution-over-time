The world fell to pieces ages ago and all history was eroded in the desert.  Magic has brought you back from the dead, but it hasn't given you purpose or a mission. It's your decision how to live. Will you roam the ruins as a bandit, murdering others for their loot? Will you build your own town, away from it all, in the open desert? You are not fed hints or guided by quests. Instead the mysteries of the world are yours to discover at your own pace. All players build and fight in the same massive world, honing their skills in first-person magic combat.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnimyst is being actively developed by a team of two, and all player feedback is seriously considered. Many serious gameplay changes and updates have come directly from player suggestions.  Come join the discussion and influence Animyst as it evolves into a full PVP MMORPG unlike any other.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n-Gear up and get ready to fight quickly, without grinding for levels or skills<br \/>\r\n-Wander in a massive, perpetual, single-server open world, together with all other players.<br \/>\r\n-Craft dozens of powerful spells from gathered ingredients.<br \/>\r\n-Build a home of free-placing stone walls. Maintain and protect your property from others, or develop it into a paradise and entice others into township.<br \/>\r\n-Search for and battle brutal creatures that guard the rarest loot.<br \/>\r\n-No classes. No champions or heroes.  Freely customize your character's abilities by crafting spells and armor that compliment your play style.<br \/>\r\n-An easy teleportation system to get around fast and find friends... or enemies.<br \/>\r\n-No quests. Few hints.  Explore and discover in a world where knowledge is power.<br \/>\r\n-Full Steam integration, no account creation necessary.<br \/>\r\n-Exclusive cosmetic items and useful loot available on our Obol Store or through Patreon donation.<br \/>\r\n-We are free to play but we will never be pay to win.
