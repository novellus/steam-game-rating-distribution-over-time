      \ awesome! My name's Chris, and I'm so excited to tell you about my game! It\u2019\

      \ normal adventures I went on as a chubby kid back in 1995 - traveling the world,\
      \ learning useful abilities, and, naturally, getting kidnapped and turned into\
      \ a balloon by cartoon villains. Thankfully, I escaped and learned to use my\
      \ transformation as a kind of superpower. I got to learn all kinds of cool stuff\
      \ - how to throw <strong>fireballs </strong>and <strong>lightning</strong>,\
      \ how to <strong>bounce around like a basketball</strong> and rocket around\
      \ the earth. It's a neat story...I think. I really hope you'll enjoy it - I\

    review: "I can really feel the love the developer(s) put into this game. If you\
      \ love Megaman or Metroid, you'll love this game too. It feels like a 90's platformer\
      \ with a 90's-esque art style.  \n\nThough most people will probably play the\
      \ ~6-7 hour campaign and move on, there are a few difficulty modes and challenge\
      \ runs that can probably let you squeeze out another 15 hours if you want to\
      \ see more. The skill ceiling is high too: some moves cancel one-another, and\
      \ there are tons of fun movement abilities you gain throughout your playthrough.\
      \ The story is also surprisingly enjoyable, though I don't want to spoil anything.\
      \ \n \nThe inflation mechanic is fresh, though it sometimes feels awkward to\
      \ play around people, as they may get the wrong idea. \n\nOverall, this game\
      \ is worth your time."
