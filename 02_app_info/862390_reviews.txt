My dad, a 52 year old with no VR experience got to try this and he was impressed, he used to fly private back in the old days and he used to have Microsoft Flight sim 98 and 2000 and this gave him an opportunity to get back into the cockpit! This is the next gen of flight sims, no need to buy expensive setup parts for immersion, everything in the cockpit works and I love it! (maybe some rudder pedals are needed for better immersion!).\n\nI really hope this gets workshop support or new aircraft, I really need an F-86 or any classic Mig!","timestamp_created":1609310281,"timestamp_updated":1609310421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4gIiY2fYCdefYvgI="}
