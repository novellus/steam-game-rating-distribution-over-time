    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift[/h1]\n\nYou can view my review & gameplay\
      \ here: https://youtu.be/iXB4pOupQnY\n\nThis is really a space-themed walking\
      \ simulator, without the walking. You teleport in some parts of this game, but\
      \ mostly you're just watching the cinematic scenes play out. The controls are\
      \ awful and you can tell this is a PSVR port. There are also some light puzzle\
      \ elements. The game takes about 90 minutes to complete. \n\nThis could have\
      \ been a much better game, if they had hired better voice actors. One of the\
      \ main characters sounds almost as robotic as the actual voiced robot in the\
      \ game. Unfortunately, the writers of this story did not help her out. There\
      \ is not much depth to the characters or to the plot. In fact, the story starts\
      \ out very much by the numbers, then suddenly takes a turn into left field.\
      \ Just when the story starts getting weird and interesting, the game ends.\n\
      \nYou do have snap turning, but you have to press in your joysticks. You control\
      \ a Mars rover-type vehicle, but the controls are terrible. You have like an\
      \ overhead view of the vehicle while you're controlling it. Then the voiced\
      \ parts have you clicking one of 2-3 answers to respond. Overall, the controls\
      \ are pretty bad except for the puzzle portions. While some puzzles were too\
      \ easy, some of them were nice. Definitely casual type puzzles so don't worry\
      \ if you are bad at puzzles.\n\nOverall, I did enjoy this game, but I often\
      \ felt like I was fighting against the controls. There's also terrible wave\
      \ shooting sections in the game, but thankfully, they are not too long. The\
      \ game ran smoothly on my 1060 GTX and I was getting a steady 90 frames per\
      \ second. The visuals, while not great, still hold up in 2020.\n\n[b]Rate 6/10.\
      \ Buy on deep sale recommendation only. Definitely better than the average walking\
      \ simulator in VR.[/b]"
