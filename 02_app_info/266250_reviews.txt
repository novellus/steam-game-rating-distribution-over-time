For veteran Shoot 'Em Up players out there you might find Procyon less challenging than some of the brutal contenders currently on the market, but that's not to say that it is not an enjoyable experience.\n\nGraphically, it looks sharp with high def effects & backdrops (no 8-bit look here) with sound effects & soundtrack holding strong too. Comes together very well. Controls are intuitive, allowing you to switch between your standard wide bullets to your concentrated beam weapon in an instant. The weapon & shield system implementation was one of the strong points for me. The weapons are linked into your shields and when combined offers a power-up damage to clear your path ahead. Beam weapon also arcs & bends which is a nice effect and allows you to still move around somewhat without loosing out on damaging your target.\n\nFor those that don't skip through the mini-story cutscenes there is also some humour to be had (worth watching through at least once).\n\nOn the negative side, I did find the boss fights a bit average; not bad but not really exciting either. Also an online co-op mode would have been awesome so I could play with friends around the world. With the duality in the weapons I could see online co-op being a lot of fun! Also, as I said earlier the game is very short. The 5 levels took me about 30 mins to complete first time through (and that was watching the cut-scenes!). Thankfully there is replayablity with higher difficulty levels in Attrition (5 lives + 1 per level completed) & Survival (1 life only!) to conquer.\n\nFor the price, overall quality & fun factor of this little title, this still gets a 'Thumbs Up' from me.\n\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TrueBlueReviews#curation]If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow [u]True Blue Reviews[/u] for more recommendations![/url]","timestamp_created":1393721479,"timestamp_updated":1599123445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.702671647071838379","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40OrLqfQCf9rCIw=="}
