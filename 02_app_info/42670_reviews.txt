The story becomes surprisingly compelling and gives way to some glorious shooting galleries as well as impressive 2010 video gamey set pieces; pick it up on sale, it may surprise you, as it did me.","timestamp_created":1562970890,"timestamp_updated":1610199764,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwtHY8/YCecqdzgE="}
