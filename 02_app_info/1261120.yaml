    review: 'I mean iRacing is like $20 and a month.

      I just wanted to support the excellent devs who release every month.

      And even though some consider the game to be incomplete (personally) I enjoy
      buying into something and watching it grow.


      I really enjoy this in with my Rift S and T500RS. The new tracks are fantastic
      too!


      This is easily my favour driving game of the last 5 years.'
