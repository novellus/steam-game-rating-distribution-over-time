    review: 'like the previous review, i will leave the rout to folder here (i hope
      future reviewers do the same):

      SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Disgraced\Role Playing Game


      i left a good review for the JRPG, because it acted like an RPG and not a site
      seeing tour or an insecure power fantasy.


      i will label this a positive review, but my real opinion is kinda Meh...


      this is a shell more than anything else. it has basic character creation (NO
      char sheet), basic combat mechanics and a big note that says (paraphrasing)
      "here are some basic rules, but we kept it vague on purpose so you can make
      it into what you want."


      There is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY that anyone played this and thought it was akin to
      the video game. i literally had to use the original game as a reference manual
      to make something that felt, TO ME, like the real interpretation of the Disgraced
      game... and i will gladly show you my version with your proof of purchase of
      this DLC


      -> it''s CS''s property, SUPORT THEM!!!


      but more to the point, its a 2 page text document saying how to make a character,
      how to use a basic battle system (not even something like the video game its
      just *a* battle system), and a few scenario suggestions.


      in my backward @$$ attempt to say both yes and no at the same time, maybe tell
      the devs to contact me to get some details for my rough rule book, based on
      their rough rule book...


      or Better yet, pay a pro tabletop nerd to write something up...


      - and let them keep making computer games. Even if it''s just RPG Maker games
      about a hostile landscape, they still stand head and shoulders above ~90% of
      the JRPG people on steam.'
