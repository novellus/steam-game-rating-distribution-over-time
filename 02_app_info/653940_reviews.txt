Game rewards for those who play carefully\n\nONE IMPORTANT THING I would have to say is PLAN and put notes on the map for if you want to breach a place in the future or to avoid it AND PLAN THOSE BREACHES\n\nFun game overall, but some of the survivors demands to others are quite stupid like killing more zombies in a breach is just suicidal act to do and the thought of demanding it as a general task is just completely stupid. Especially when the survivor you just recruited, demands the other survivor to do what I said above like a complete bitch\nRant END","timestamp_created":1609057517,"timestamp_updated":1609057517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43KfT0fYCfs7WvQI="}
