My first experience of the game was actually nice, though after playing it for a bit I kept noticing what low amount of effort was put into actually fixing the Bugs. I was gifted this game, though honestly I would have fallen for it and bought it by the screenshots. The art style as I have said is amazing, though there's so many flaws behind it. Here's a few:\n- You keep getting stuck on edges\n- You die randomly out of nowhere\n- The game crsahes out of nowhere\n\nHere's a few more things about it:\n- The mouse/keyboard combination is terribly done. If you fail a level your cursor stays in the middle of the screen and annoys you\n- The game takes ages to load\n- Some bugs could have been fixed through a simple playtest, therefor I can't believe an appropriate amount of time was put into the game's testing whatsoever. Making a game is hard though some extents of playtesting are just needed.","timestamp_created":1609161579,"timestamp_updated":1609161579,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n6Pg1PYCdNKMvgI="}
