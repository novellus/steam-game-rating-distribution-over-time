The level design is very good, and the gameplay is engaging!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it took me roughly 8 hours of offline play to complete first half of the levels in the base game and it took me about 10 hours for the Enhanced Edition, but there will be more to come with time. \n\nif you have $3 extra that you can safely spend, give Enhanced Edition a try. \n\nHave fun!","timestamp_created":1593089646,"timestamp_updated":1593089646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw29vi9fICf5mIkAI="}
