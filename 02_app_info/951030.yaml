      \ space station is HUGE, capable of housing all sorts of labs and facilities\
      \ within it, the station\u2019s labs are divided in 4 sectors, and each sector\
      \ contains huge artificial landscapes on floating chunks of rock called \u201C\
      Nodes\u201D, these nodes are grouped together by the subjects' dangerous nature,\
      \ these groups are called \u201CClusters\u201D, there are 2 clusters in each\
      \ sector, and each sector containing 2 subjects, the two most dangerous ones\
      \ are safely located in the central Sector 5, buried within the station, safely\
      \ isolated from everything and everyone.<br><br>Some of the nodes are off limits\
      \ and are the containment location for a subject, a place that has been prepared\
      \ just for that subject in both environment and structures to resemble its former\
      \ habitat but being safely secured with all the necessary safety measures.<br><br>This\
      \ station is containing highly dangerous creatures from across the galaxy, this\
      \ is the reason why the government panicked when it went missing, so do not\
      \ expect a walk in the park when you\u2019re deployed, you may be a super solder\
      \ but you will definitely die if you\u2019re not careful enough, I trust you\
      \ will know when to shoot your way through or run and hide.<br><br><br><strong>The\
      \ Subjects</strong><br><br>There are many creatures locked down in there, 10\

      \ some of them are less dangerous than others but they are all deadly and, if\
      \ they were to escape, they might spread across the station.<br><br>If Subject\
      \ [REDACTED] and Subject [REDACTED] have escaped then I feel sorry for you already,\
      \ that\u2019s all I can say.<br><br><br><strong>ABOUT THE GAME</strong><br><br>This\
      \ game is a SciFi/Horror First Person Shooter with a rather retro feel to its\
      \ design and mechanics, heavily inspired by games from the late 90\u2019s and\
      \ early 2000\u2019s, the final version of the game will eventually contain 4\
