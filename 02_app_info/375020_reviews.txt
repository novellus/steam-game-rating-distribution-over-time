Al Emmo's Postcards from Anozira is a very barebones HOG. You can choose between 5 characters in the beginning to be your guide as you go around the town to the different HO scenes. There are 29 scenes in total, here’s how they breakdown. You are given items to find in a typical HO scene. Once completed, you get a puzzle to do as well which finishes out that town’s location. Rinse and repeat until you hit all 29 locations. \n\nThe HO scenes graphics are dated and low-res. So much so that it’s difficult to make out certain objects which can be frustrating. For a game that says it was released in 2010, I don’t know why they are this bad. Fortunately, you’re given a generous amount of hints you can use if you get stuck. \n\nThe puzzles that follow each HO scene are either jigsaw, tile slide, rotating disc or spot the difference. All of which are easy and shouldn’t trip you up too much. Except for the spot the differences. Each picture has 20 differences, but some of them are very subtle and you will have to look very closely. Again, the poor resolution doesn’t help this. \n\nYou can go through the game normally or in “relaxed” mode, which removes the timer for each scene & puzzle. I enabled relaxed mode right away as I like taking my time on these games. Doing so, you will miss out on extra points for completing a level quickly or finding items in rapid succession. However, points don’t have any meaning in the game. \n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n+Relaxed mode which removes the timer\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n+Crazy mouse acceleration in game\n+Low resolution graphics. Difficult to see items clearly\n+Runs at a strange 42FPS? \n+Score is meaningless\n\nIn the end, I can’t recommend this game unless you are a big fan of the genre.\n\n[b]4/10[/b] Below Average\n","timestamp_created":1577483050,"timestamp_updated":1577483050,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537815093994140625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwaPUpO8CcZ7I5wE="}
