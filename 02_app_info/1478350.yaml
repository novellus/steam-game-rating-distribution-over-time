      Generation</i></strong><br><br>Game Dev Masters uses a complex procedural generation
      on each new game to create topic matches with genres / target audiences, genre
      work weights / target matches, company Ai, and a ton of other factors.  Although
      this can create some UN-expected results, you are in an alternate reality where
      those results fit that specific world.  Even if Fantasy + RPG is a great combo
      in our world, that does not mean it will be in your game world.<br><br>Using
