I thought the story was interesting (for this type of game). The mini-puzzles weren't just the same ones they always use over and over in the newer games. There was some back and forth, but not too much. It was almost six hours (on Easy level with a couple of skips).\n\nKeep in mind it is quite old. It has a Hint button that is largely useless, but it does have a Strategy Guide. I found that to be sufficient at the couple of places where I got stuck.\n\nIt has oodles and oodles of hidden object scenes. These are the original kind with a list of items, usually with one or more interactive item, but well done I thought.","timestamp_created":1599188701,"timestamp_updated":1599188701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49OHEq/QCe8zSnwI="}
