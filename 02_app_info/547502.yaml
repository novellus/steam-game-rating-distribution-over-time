    review: 'The case may have been different at release, but I wouldn''t necessarily
      call this expansion a "must have". Mass Transit does add a lot of options, but
      the expansion is by this point has been rendered redundant in a number of ways.
      Let me explain.


      While on the surface Monorails look really useful due to being plopable directly
      on roads, the have largely been rendered obsolete by the revamped metro network,
      and they are almost crippled by being paradoxically loud and slow. This design
      decision on CO''s part continues to baffle me, as monorails are known in real
      life for being two things; quiet and fast.


      TPME is basically a requirement to fix the network''s slow speed limits, and
      either modded stations will be needed, or they must be kept as far from residential
      zones as possible or else they WILL make cims sick, or cause abandonment due
      to noise complaints. This leaves monorails as mainly something to connect commercial,
      office, and industrial zones with major intercity transit, which... metro did
      just as well even before the revamp. After the revamp? There''s no real reason
      to use monorail aside from personal preference.


      The monorail trains themselves also have the issue of using the ship shader,
      so their night lighting is bugged and textures suffer. This even effects some
      mods'' monorail trains. As it stands, I REALLY wanted to love the monorail network,
      but its implementation sadly leaves much to be desired. TPME can help make the
      viable and even robust by removing network speed limits, but this is most certainly
      not a point in Mass Transit''s favor.


      Blimps are a basically useless due to how slow and ponderous they are, with
      the same capacity as a bus. Even more than the monorail network, it has been
      rendered obsolete by Sunset Harbor''s helicopter network, which is faster and
      quieter.


      Ferries and cable cars stand out as the true useful options for this DLC, especially
      for crossing bodies of water, and both are actually well made and fun to use.
      There are also some new highway and road options, but nothing major.


      Finally there are some new hubs, mainly in the form of large, multi-platform
      train stations. These can work great for cities with extensive passenger train
      networks, and they can connect directly with the metro network to let cims get
      around your downtown area. There are also bus/ferry hubs that are quite useful,
      as well as a bus/monorail hub and a monorail/train/metro hub that serves well
      as the centerpiece of a large monorail network.


      While I do not regret purchasing Mass Transit, and I did have fun with it, I
      would personally recommend getting Sunset Harbor instead, unless you just really
      like monorails and blimps.


      Overall, my feelings on this expansion are mixed. I cautiously recommend, but
      I also strongly advise you to think before buying and consider the alternatives.'
