Has anything changed? Was any effort present?\n\nThe puzzle here is exactly the same as in the previous title. Swapping tiles to complete a picture. There is the same number of puzzles and the same variations (9, 12, 16). Absolutely nothing changed. Zero challenge. Copy-paste effort.\nStill no options other than music off/on.\n\nThe art quality feels even worse than in the previous game. Can't change to window mode so it looks pixelated and blurry. It's not very detailed but plenty with worse art than this. \n\nThe music is the same as in the previous title. Zero effort.\n\nOn top of all that, the game is bugged. All puzzles are already solved when you click on them and gallery is complete. Bravo.\n\nTo summarise, a cheap cop-paste puzzle with art that is worse than the previous game, copied music and zer0 improvements. Avoid: 2/10","timestamp_created":1609847685,"timestamp_updated":1609847844,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwypWa6fYCcdTWwAI="}
