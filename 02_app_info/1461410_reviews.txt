The physics are robust and the interface is intuitive. Driving around and digging through asteroids feels good, but at the moment this is mostly just a sandbox to play around in. I'm hoping more missions and things to DO will be added in the future, but even in its current form it's a good chill-out game for messing around in while listening to some music or a podcast.","timestamp_created":1610039115,"timestamp_updated":1610039115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4z+fz7vYCfvuowQI="}
