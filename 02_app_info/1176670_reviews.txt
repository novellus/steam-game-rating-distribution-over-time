It gives fancy graphics and music improvements and makes you feel like you already play a standalone expansion set. I hope this DLC gets done for the Android/iOS version of Townsmen too - it gives you really high quality content for your money. I can highly recommend it if you like the original game too!","timestamp_created":1603061394,"timestamp_updated":1603061394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551282048225402832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpfX5nvUCfMHdqAI="}
