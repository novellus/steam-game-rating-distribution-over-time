It's accompanied by a video review that can be found [b][url=https://youtu.be/tb8JkRIm-uk]here[/url][/b].[/i]\n\n[b]In summary, I can’t recommend this game to anybody[/b] as it’s completely unfinished and has absolutely no enjoyable features. There’s only two soundtracks in addition to large, empty and meaningless levels that are all poorly designed, enemies that don’t do damage (or have death animations), as well as having no discernible plot or character development. The balding child villain is a nice touch, though.\n[h2]Introduction[/h2]\nTime Ramesside (subtitle, A New Reckoning) is a basic undead-shooter. You play as this dude named Mark who wakes up in a prison with no memory. Soon, he encounters some dying dudes that are like “your balding child is a demon and is killing everyone, you terrible parent” so I guess the underlying plot is that you’re trying to put your daughter in time-out. This is no easy feat since your daughter spider-crawls on walls like the possessed love-child of Dr. Phil while summoning the undead. The game makes no effort to explain itself, so you’re left to your guesses as to what is actually going on.\n\nThis game features typical WASD shooter controls and only two weapons - a pistol and this exploding crossbow. Mark is also an amazing endurance runner since he has no stamina and outruns every enemy in this game. You ever heard the term ‘breaking ankles’? Mark invented that term back in Humboldt College back in ‘96. It might be worth noting that there isn’t any melee options available, but for some reason there’s a summonable textbox if you press “C”, so maybe you can try and guess your daughter’s full name to invoke fear into her.\n\nOnce you make it to the end of the level, you’ll be transported into the next until you get to the [i]”last”[/i] level where you’ll be brought back to the main screen, wondering why you spent any time at all trudging through empty sewers. If you want to experience the joys of a level twice -- don’t worry, the game has a level selector. There’s even more [b]”Level In Progress”[/b] lines than actual levels, although they’re more empty-promises than things to look forward to.\n\nFor some fun-facting, this game actually has over 300 reviews with only about 15-16% positivity. The reviews you see today are post-relaunch that happened back in 2015. This level of relaunching also is seen on another release of the developer’s, The Sacred Stone. For another fun fact, this game’s last update was in 2015! So, it’s safe to say this game is abandoned.\n\nThat’s about all I can explain since this game doesn’t have much going on, so let’s talk about something I did like about this game.\n[h2]The Good[/h2]\nThis game’s most redeeming factor is that it exposed me to a level [i](Called “The City” in the level selector)[/i] that has grass that’s too tall to see past unless you jump. I haven’t seen a game that featured that kind of design and I figure if there’s a fully-functional horror game that can actually carry atmosphere, I’d be interested in playing it.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s about it. Let’s move onto what I didn’t really enjoy.\n[h2]The Ungood[/h2]\nTo start with the lesser of the evils, there’s seemingly only two music tracks in this game. There’s this eerie-like song that [i]tries[/i] to set the atmosphere of a horror shooter, but the only other track is this high-energy orchestral song that you hear in the main menu. In Level 2, the eerie-song is overlaid with this endless dripping sound that doesn’t go away, which is what I’m now calling Ramesside Water Torture.\n\nNext up is the level design - there’s really only two somewhat interesting levels being The Maze and The City. Everything else is oversized and empty with enough space to just run around the enemies to pass them. The Maze breaks away from the poor design, and as I said earlier I thought the concept of The City level was cool, but is still oversized and empty. The Sewer seems to be the last level worked on, since it only has [i]”one enemy”[/i] in the entire level, and it looks like a scorpion… tail? Too many questions about [b]everything[/b].\n\nNext up is the lack of a story — I have no clue what the first iteration of this game was like, but based off of what I’ve seen from other screenshots or gameplay videos, the game made an attempt to explain what was happening. In this iteration, there’s like… 8 lines of dialogue? And only one or two of them actually contribute to the lore. The developer may as well just use X17’s store description and nuke any semblance of story so we don’t have our expectations set any higher than a children’s book. Personally, I like the idea of this villainous child being on their quest for Rogaine, but feel free to invent whatever plot you’d like to numb the pain.\n\nAs if this game couldn’t even [i]try[/i] to seem completed, we’ve got one hell of a performance by the game’s enemies. There are a couple of different models, but they all honestly perform the same. They hone in on the player character and follow him forever. If you ever stand around them, you’ll learn that [b]they don’t do damage[/b]. The only way you’ll die is by the splash damage of the exploding crossbow. So not only is the game unfinished, but you don’t even get the thrill of combat since this game is more of a janky shooting range game than a horror shooter. This is on top of the fact that you can just outrun every enemy, reserving your bullets for those blocking a path. The real icing on top of this undercooked cake is that there is [b]no death animation[/b]. Once you kill an enemy, they just disappear.\n\nIt’s honestly amazing how unfinished a non-Early Access, $8 USD game can be. This game even had the audacity to sink no lower than $2 USD on sale, although I’m certain no price tag is appropriate for what I’ve experienced.\n[h2]The End[/h2]\nWell, this is definitely the most unfinished game I’ve played to date. The developer has two other games that I don’t think I’ll be covering since these all seem to follow the same release, relaunch, and development cycle.\n\n\n[i]If you’re into curator groups, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38757311/]we have one of those[/url].
