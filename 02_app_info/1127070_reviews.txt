I love the idea of the school being made from old wizards, teaching people about magic. having multiple realms is a nice touch. the main character being from midguard, helps the player feel like a lack of belonging. the magitech thing is amazing! they just use magic to upgrade technology. given they have magic, so, of course the tech would be decades behind! \n\ncharacters.   ooooh yeah. the characters are so good! somehow, the game gives all of the main characters a lot of personality. they all have breathing room to show who they are, which makes the moments they talk with each other more believable.\n\nart.   the art is a strength of this game. the character designs are vibrant, well crafted cartoons. they look cute, and cool. it does make the people a bit predictable. for example... Nill, is a gentle giant. (a cute one.) that's good for a cartoon. \n\noverall, the game is great. even with some bugs, the story and characters make it a fun world to be in. with some polishing, the game can reach it's full potential!","timestamp_created":1609606485,"timestamp_updated":1609606485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wLqB4vYCfpTkvwI="}
