Rage quit it after that. It is just stupid you need randomly get three less than 3 active bit numbers in a row to even have a chance. Allow us to tab through them and speed up your UI response.","timestamp_created":1589264959,"timestamp_updated":1589264959,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539626002311706543","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44djkg/ICfuuYhwI="}
