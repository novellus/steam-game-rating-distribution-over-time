    review: 'This game is impressive. More polished than Beat Saber. base game better
      than Beat Saber. Better music and graphics. Way better than Dance Collider.


      The gameplay is sort of a mix between BoxVR and Beat Saber little bit less depth
      because your slashing direction doesn''t matter but it''s more polished than
      both of those. Plus there are some other mechanics like slow time and the obstacle
      dodging is more intricate.
