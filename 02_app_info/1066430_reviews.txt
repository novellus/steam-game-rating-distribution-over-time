Asides from the graphics the way how you control the character changes in both styles. I really like how the tank controls are implemented it creates a sense of fear, combat becomes rather methodical, where every enemy type has it s own unique way how to defeat them.\n\nThe game is quite short, shouldn't take longer than 2 hours, maybe a bit more if the puzzles don't click immediatley with you, by the way where I say \"click\", the game combines the survival horror action gameplay with elements of point 'n' click adventures, you can examine almost everything in the game, while there is not that much to investigate you can find a fair share of hidden items if you are wary of your surroundings.\n\nSaving only works with items you can find in the game, but I never had problems running out of saving item. I think they may could've placed more healing items than saving, since I ended up with 3 or 4 saving items but with nothing to heal, in these situations you have to bite in the sour apple and move on.\n\nI can recommend this to any videogame nostalgic who has no problem with inconvenience as an seling point itself, it pulls you more in into the experience if you ask me.","timestamp_created":1607215909,"timestamp_updated":1607215947,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z6PimvYCfb3RtwI="}
