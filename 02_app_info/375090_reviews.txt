I do like the fact that it's very story based even if the story is short and simple.. but also weird / alien in a good way.\n\nWorth a couple of dollars, easy to recommend for people who like something original.","timestamp_created":1543333042,"timestamp_updated":1593342634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507854282855987549","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgeWn/fICcbjoswE="}
