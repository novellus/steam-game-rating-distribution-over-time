    review: 'The Turd, not the Trud.

      You walk around Grullophobia''s school while picking up keys and witnessing
      a few jumpscares.


      At a certain point Er Boia will wi-fi kill you and then turn into a pool of
      sterco. After that you pick up a nail gun that you don''t even use, so the games
      gives you an EH VOLEEEEEVIH! It''s disgusting.'
