The art is nice, the music is relaxing and I really like the girls. Lucifer is adorable.\n\nThere are a few typos and grammar mistakes here and there but not enough to take away from my enjoyment of the game.\n\nI also liked that it is a short game with an engaging story.","timestamp_created":1608926464,"timestamp_updated":1608926464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgLHfzfYCedSTvQI="}
