    review: I don't recommend this game as it feels like the cheap version of "osu!"
      and "osu!" is superior to it in every way possible. For starters lets take a
      look at the description from store page "DotX is a 'mouse only' game, where
      you will challenge your ability to control the mouse, as well as verify your
      emotional resistance." sure I can agree with mouse control ability and emotional
      resistance if You're planing to 100% the game but whats the point of improving
      Your "mouse control ability" in this type of game especially when You can just
      play "osu!". It's a bit different than "osu!" because here You don't click the
      buttons to the rhythm but You can just play "osu!" with relax mod and it'd be
      much better. First of all improving Your aim in this type of game won't help
      You in FPS games that much. Second thing is that even if it improves Your aim
      for "osu!" types of games, most people play "osu!" with graphic tablets as it's
      much easier so there's no point of improving Your aim in this particular game.
      It doesn't support graphical tablets in any way. I've tried setting up my tablet
      as mouse cursor and it didn't work for me. There aren't many mods that modify
      the gameplay and they act like mods in "osu!". There aren't many settings changes
      that You can do and it feels like cursor change is the most limited one. First
      of all developer couldn't implement it so that after the cursor change it doesn't
      change its position which makes changing the cursor a little longer. Second
      of all only the first default cursor has no such thing called as "cursor tail"
      in "osu!". In "osu!" different skins have the cursor tail depending of the skin
      author preference which You can remove by simply removing file in skin folder.
      What's the point of having 10 different cursors if there's no option to turn
      off cursor tail. Sure its a personal preference but there could be at least
      option to switch it on and off. I don't understand adding 10 different cursors
      and the only 1st default one having no cursor tail. I know its just a cheap
      indie game but it doesn't feel like there was much effort put into it. I've
      seen many other games that were 2x cheaper and still were more polished than
      this. There are 100 levels and they aren't sorted by difficulty also most of
      the levels are mirrored. I'm not saying "all" but "most" of them. Completing
      some of the levels with all the mods to get achievements are nearly impossible.
      "Approach rate" and "circle size" with mods on in some levels just feel like
      they weren't tested. Overall I don't recommend this game because there's a much
      better and free alternative.
