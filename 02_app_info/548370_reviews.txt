Played for an hour or so and loving it.\n\nHowever, I must say that the difficulty appears a little unbalanced - at the start. It's difficult and requires a few same-level replays and this is made worse with each dungeon having few top-ups of food/HP or whatever. Sure, there are chests/etc but it's not enough. Resting doesn't appear to work unless I'm missing something?\n\nI've seen some people mention bugs with the gameplay or display. I've had none of those, so I guess these are reviews of older releases and they've now been fixed. Works fine for me in that respect.\n\nAlso, I'm using a Mac M1 (64 bit OS). And STEAM tells me this game won't run on Catalina and newer. But it does! The game works fine on Big Sur :)\n\nBasically, once you've got going and beaten that initial hurdle, this is a great game!!! Love it.","timestamp_created":1609159985,"timestamp_updated":1609236114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpc381vYCeOaLvgI="}
