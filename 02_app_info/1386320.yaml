      \nBefore you start a level, you must choose your difficulty:<br />\r\n - Easy\
      \ - 20 waves - Low Health Enemies<br />\r\n - Medium - 40 waves - Mid Health\
      \ Enemies<br />\r\n - Hard - 60 waves - High Health Enemies<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nOnce you have completed a level, the button for the difficulty you have completed\
      \ will turn green. If all three difficulties have been completed on a particular\
      \ level, the button for that level will also turn green.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      Place turrets by choosing one from the shop menu and clicking on your desired\
      \ position on the grid.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSelect turrets by clicking on an\
      \ already placed turret. After selection it will open the upgrade menu which\
      \ is full of information, e.g. Damage. It will also show you the range of the\
      \ turret on the course. You can now Upgrade, Sell or Deselect your selected\
      \ turret.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpgrade by clicking the &quot;Upgrade&quot; button.\
      \ It will cost 40% of the initial cost multiplied by the level you are currently\
      \ on.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSell by clicking the &quot;Sell&quot; button. You will\
      \ receive 50% of the money you spent buying and upgrading the turret.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nDeselect by either clicking any empty space on the grid or selecting\
      \ a different turret or building another turret.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are\
      \ currently 6 pieces of information on the Game Board:<br />\r\n - Your current\
      \ money (Green)<br />\r\n - The price of the turret you are hovering over in\
      \ the shop menu (Red)<br />\r\n - The current wave (Green)<br />\r\n - The wave\
      \ countdown timer (Red)<br />\r\n - Your current health (Green)<br />\r\n -\
      \ Your remaining shield (Red)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGreen information will be there\
      \ permanently. Red information will only show when necessary, e.g. when counting\
      \ down for the next wave.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can also zoom in and out with\
      \ the scroll wheel and move your camera around with WASD. If you zoom out, no\
      \ matter where your camera has moved to, it will go back to the centre so that\
      \ you can see the whole board again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuild, Upgrade, Protect!"

    review: 'It''s almost a good game!


      When you find-out how to turn off the terrible music, play on ''Hard'' level,
      and [spoiler] refrain from using any of the ''Beamers'' [/spoiler] , this game
      is....almost not boring!


      Oh! And you need to be a HUGE fan of TD games too!


      But outside of that: Go for it! You''ll have a formidable 20 minutes of enjoyment!!
      ;)'
