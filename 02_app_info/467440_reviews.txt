Big games, even if they're incredible and moving on their own, don't have that same personal connection given the scale of how many people are involved in them. Insignificant is very rewarding in that respect because it's so obviously a labor of love and so deeply personal to the developer. Despite being a very different game overall, it evoked the same feeling in me that Stardew Valley didâ€”this really adorable, challenging, neat experience that made me feel happier, a little calmer, and genuinely made me appreciate the (literally, in this case!) small things.","timestamp_created":1571109588,"timestamp_updated":1571109588,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586491942405700684","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwrnb5u0Cc72R1AE="}
