    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Twilight Phenomena: The Lodgers of House 13" Collector''s Edition is a Adventure
      game. The game was developed by ERS Game Studio and published by Big Fish Games
      Studio.


      "The Lodgers of House 13" is the first episode of "Twilight Phenomena."


      Since this is a collector''s edition, it comes with extra features that are
      not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals
      can be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are four different difficulty game modes to choose from: Casual; Advanced;
      Hard and Custom.


      The notebook keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events and
      clues.


      There is no map in this game. The player has to remember where to go in the
      game.


      There is a padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in
      place to make it stationary.


      There are interactive items in the game. Some of these interactive items may
      require extra components before they can be interacted with.


      The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of
      them.


      Since this is a collector''s edition, there is a bonus chapter, but it can be
      accessed only after the main story is completed.


      There are thirteen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing
      the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need
      to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game
      only.


      Miscellaneous


      There are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Soundtracks; Concept Art;
      Wallpapers; Screen Saver; Cinematic Scenes and Game''s Strategy Guide. Most
      of these extra features can be accessed only after the entire game is completed.


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
