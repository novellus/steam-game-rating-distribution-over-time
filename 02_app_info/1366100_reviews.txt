You take the role of a small child who needs to venture into a dangerous forest for medicine for their dying parents. There are some puzzles you will have to overcome Sokoban style, but they aren't anything too complicated. There are several enemies on your journey including bosses. For smaller enemies you don't really have any defenses aside from running or leading them to a light. You get two abilities to get you through puzzles and there are some chase scenes. The checkpoints are very forgiving and there are five different difficulties you can set the game to. The colors are vibrant and dark appropriately where they need to be. There are several different biomes to experience in your journey and the music is fitting. The sound design never gets annoying either. You can play with a controller or mouse and keyboard. The game is a short and simple experience. \n\n[h1]The Minor Gripes[/h1]\nThis game is a pretty well-rounded project. I don't have too many gripes about it. The movement can look a bit awkward at times, but I think that's just the engine. If you aren't into chase scenes you may not like having to solve puzzles during a chase scene. With the forgiving checkpoints, this isn't too bad though. There are some areas that look like you can explore them but you can't. The only other snag I ran into is some of the limited explanation of the powers. An indicator above where you use it the first time you use it could be beneficial.\n\n[code]\n[h1](っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ pros ♥[/h1]\n+Short & Simple\n+Enjoyable Music Design\n+Variable difficulties\n\n[h1](っ>▬<)っ x cons x[/h1]\n*Nothing major to note\n[/code]\n\nFor the very low price, this is an excellent little game. I would recommend it as a short little one session game. It took me around 40 minutes. If you like adventure games with simple puzzles then check it out.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcY6dCvXcTw\n\n𝕀𝕗 𝕐𝕠𝕦 𝔼𝕟𝕛𝕠𝕪 𝕋𝕙𝕚𝕤 𝕋𝕣𝕪\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1371940/Milos_Quest/\n\nThis review has been shortened for the curator reader base.
