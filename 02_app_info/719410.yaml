    review: Locked inside our homes for 8weeks in Melbourne 2020, this game has been
      'A LIFE SAVER' so good since we cant play real squash.  Its been challenging
      and immersive.  Closest thing to squash.    i have got 5600 and seemed to have
      reached the top.   i got a good sweat everytime and recommend it.   Thank you
      for making this game. A++
