    review: "Comprei este jogo j\xE1 a algum tempo e hoje domino bem todas as mecanicas\
      \ do mesmo.\nPara quem gosta desse tipo de jogo, LONGO, turnos, estrat\xE9gia\
      \ e principalmente muitissimo hist\xF3rico! O jogo \xE9 excelente, n\xE3o h\xE1\
      \ at\xE9 hoje um jogo com tanta profundidade em sua abordagem do conflito entre\
      \ Eixo e URSS como esse. At\xE9 mesmo contra a AI voce ir\xE1 se divertir bastante.\
      \ \xC9 claro que nenhuma AI conseguir\xE1 competir com a capacidade inovativa\
      \ e de planejamento de um ser humano. Mas boa parte do meu tempo neste jogo\
      \ foi contra AI e me diverti.\nSe est\xE1 procurando algo casual apenas e n\xE3\
      o tem muito tempo para os turnos, talvez este n\xE3o seja seu melhor candidato.\
      \ Entretanto n\xE3o tenha medo da quantidade de aprendizado necess\xE1rio para\
      \ ser \"otimo jogador\", existem cen\xE1rios pequenos que possibilitam uma \xF3\
      tima  aprendizagem e divers\xE3o, al\xE9m da possibilidade de jogar coop com\
      \ amigos atrav\xE9s de Save files, deixando a experi\xEAncia ainda melhor!\n\
      \nEnfim, SUPER recomendo, mas tenha certeza de que esse tipo de jogo \xE9 a\
      \ sua praia!"
