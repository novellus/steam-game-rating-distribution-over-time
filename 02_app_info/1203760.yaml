    review: This game could have potential however it is very glitchy. I also don't
      like that the pieces don't stay together. when building something complex (
      more than three + pieces) the pieces detach and fall to the ground. My 8 year
      old, who loves building things (self proclaimed minecraft master) lost interest
      in this game in about 30 minutes. his reason " the pieces don't do what i want
      them to do" When the logic of the game is to build something then the pieces
      should stay together. Should have a glue or lock function so they don't come
      apart. At this point I can't recommend this  game to anyone it needs some work.
