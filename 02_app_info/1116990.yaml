    review: 'This game is still full of glitches, and not easy whatsoever, if you
      like grindy RPGs then be my guest. But this game appears to be made with a bunch
      of cookie-cutter characters, and frankly nothing is stopping you from running
      away from combat just to progress the story, and then ending up severely under-leveled
      to take on the next boss and then realize it''s too late you cannot return to
      the previous area to train up. I thought this game was going to be more of an
      open-world where you would be free to explore the previous area after defeating
      a boss, but sadly that was not the case, and the quality of the game really
      isn''t worth the price.

      If the developers were to update the game and make some improvements i would
      be willing to try it out again.'
