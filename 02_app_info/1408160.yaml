    review: Sweet Pea provides a return to the traditional platforming experience
      with evolving level design, enemies, and obstacles. You get to play through
      exciting environments with varying difficulties accompanied by an albeit simple
      art style enhanced by clever foreground and background design. The soundtrack
      fits the games atmosphere well and will certainly drive you mad after your tenth
      restart.  The games difficulty is derived from skillful timing and applying
      provided game knowledge, with occasional AI trickery. In it's early access state
      there's still a good chunk of polishing to be done but from what I've seen there
      is consistent and productive updates being made by a responsive dev.
