    about_the_game: "It's a game about finding your way out of the miserable world\
      \ which we live in and understanding that none of it makes sense we are all\
      \ just meat bags walking around and destroying something that took millions\
      \ of years to create itself. Oh and this game has a killer soundtrack also.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat you will have to do is to help your golem buddy to find\
      \ a way out of the labyrinths with the spectacular landscape. It might seem\
      \ easy at the first look, but I can promise you that this will be one of the\
      \ longest and most interesting journeys of your life."
