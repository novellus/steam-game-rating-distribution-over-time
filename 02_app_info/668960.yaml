      routes nor different endings. Simply sit down, set up the auto mode to your

      in one playthrough.<h2 class="bb_tag">How long is the story?</h2>The story of
      <i>Esper - Make You Live Again</i> is about 90,000 words long. The rest depends
      on you, on how fast you can read, how long you will look at the characters and
      the places and listen to the music. <i>Esper - Make You Live Again</i> is not
      an experience designed to be either long, short or to last for a certain amount

    review: "The story is better than it seems.  I have played probably more than\
      \ a hundred visual novels so I play these games all the time.  It may seem generic\
      \ but it's really good with special effects too. \n\nThe middle is tedious but\
      \ the beginning and especially the end was amazing. \n\nIt's a unique story\
      \ with good art and music plus a lot of special effects. \n\nIt's really not\
      \ short especially for only $8 - great value for the money and a great way to\
      \ spend around 4 hours."
