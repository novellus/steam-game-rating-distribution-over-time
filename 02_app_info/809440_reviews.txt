The game is fast-paced and challenging at times. I frequently got stuck on certain levels, but it was fun to try different strategies and finally beat the level. It took me a little over 30 hours to beat the campaign. The game does seem light on content, but I feel the game is worth the price.","timestamp_created":1540040014,"timestamp_updated":1609653266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5fSz4/YCe9uCrQE="}
