No noticeable bugs or glitches, also a nice surprise. Very linear, repetitive gameplay, due in part because of the lack of variety in loadouts and skills: Each character (the same four throughout the game) has a variety of possible skills, but you get most of them, so there won't be much variety by the end game. For equipment, while there is some variety in what your characters can carry, they can ONLY carry one weapon, one weapon mod and one item. You don't  switch these up between missions (unless you fine something better), so you end up  playing with the same gear throughout the game. Played on normal difficulty, probably could have played on hard w/no problem.","timestamp_created":1609891503,"timestamp_updated":1609891503,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4udvA6vYCfe/twAI="}
