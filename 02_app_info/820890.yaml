    developer_response: 'Hello Daromath!


      Many thanks for playing our game and taking the time to review it. I am pleased
      to see that you have enjoyed the key things in the first two chapters - the
      setting and story.


      I am aware of remaining bugs in the game and with every monthly update I come
      closer to rendering the game bug free. As a solo developer with only a small
      team around me - this is an ongoing process.


      I was a little suprised to hear that you had issues with controls and flickering.
      That should not be the case, as the controls should be very smooth as they are
      in our marketing videos. If you have the time and inclination, do swing by the
      Steam community forums for our game and elaborate some more on that.


      best regards


      Kosala'

    review: 'Its a bit difficult to rate this game, because Steam has only two options.
      Good or bad.


      Made  a Gameplay Video , so you  can take a look for yourself:

      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2RnIFtF8E4


      Pros:

      - nice setting

      - interesting story (thus far)

      - smooth audio


      Cons:

      LOTS and i mean lots of bugs

      flickering

      weird animations (bug related i think)

      awkward controls


      I dont WANT to give it a thumbs down, but at this point, with so many bugs,
      i dont really have a choice.

      But please remember, bugs can be fixed, so maybe give it a try at a later time.


      Edit:

      The Developer said that he is working on fixing the bugs and it seems like he
      is really trying. So i changed my rating. Keep up the good work.'
