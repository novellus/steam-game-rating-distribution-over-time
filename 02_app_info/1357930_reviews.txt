A big thumbs up.","timestamp_created":1596897000,"timestamp_updated":1596897112,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542483627796173096","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/IWf5/MCde2ZmgI="}
