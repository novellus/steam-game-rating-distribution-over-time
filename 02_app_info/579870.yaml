    review: 'It is hard for me to really recommend this game, while I do not think
      it is bad, it does have quite a few problems. The artwork is beautiful and the
      design of the environments are really nice. The problem is that I got stuck
      in the environment a few times. The gameplay is very strange, it feels weird
      to play and it is hard to describe. You pick up powers from enemies and bosses
      as you go, and of all those powers you can pick 3 (switchable at any time) to
      use at once. I don''t think I managed to get all of them by the end of the game,
      but I noticed myself abusing a few of them by the end of the game. The music
      is nothing special either. All in all, you could beat this game in maybe an
      hour if you rush, my final gameplay time is pretty generous.


      I would say this game is a rather mixed bag rather than bad or negative. If
      you want to try it, it''s on sale for the launch so go ahead, otherwise I''d
      say it''s just alright.'
