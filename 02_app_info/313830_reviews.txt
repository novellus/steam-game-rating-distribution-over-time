It is one of the first games I had ever bought here on Steam, while this is a very good game, there are also some drawbacks.\n\nI really like the mechanics of the main character being blind and how you need to be very careful about the steps you take around the enemies or else you get caught.  I also really enjoy how each of the interactable characters, like the enemies and the people that stand on the buttons, all are blind and use their different senses to try and find the main character.  This is the first game I have played that has that.\n\nThe puzzles are also very interesting, and I enjoyed playing through them.  There were some puzzles that were very monotonous and were difficult to get through because of the miniscule details you had to input in order to solve a level.  However, I thought they were interesting.\n\nWhile the game itself was very good, and very puzzle oriented, I honestly had been struggling to finish this game because there really wasn't anything driving me forwards, no story I could really see.  The puzzles also started getting mildly frustrating as a result because they would get more difficult, but I never knew what I was doing, outside of escaping some sort of prison.  \n\nThat being said, the very last level before the credits was absolutely incredible.  While it was just a walking scene with the enemies chasing after you, the poetry being spoken in the background really changed my perspective on the game I was playing, and made me realize how I was viewing life.  I've even gone through and just held the right arrow key to move and closed my eyes so I could focus and listen to the words more (and I've done this several times as of now).  \n\nI do recommend playing this game, if you do enjoy puzzles, though especially for that final level.  I would give this a 7/10 for sure (that last level really bumped up the score because of how good and worth it the gameplay became).","timestamp_created":1609749299,"timestamp_updated":1609749299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ485+i5vYCcp6qwAI="}
