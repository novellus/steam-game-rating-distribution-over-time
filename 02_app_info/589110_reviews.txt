Just a waste of time. Not at all difficult and incredibly irritating. You spend 90% of the game picking shit back up. The mesh for your head (only there so you cast shadows) constantly hits anything you hold forcing the item to drop. \n\nOnly giving not recommended because there are way better free games out there that you can get a much nicer first time VR experience from. \n\nDon't bother with this meh demo.","timestamp_created":1608887899,"timestamp_updated":1608887899,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t6LMzPYCeYGAvQI="}
