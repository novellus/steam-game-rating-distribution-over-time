The game was developed and published by Alawar Entertainment.\n\nAt first glance, the game looks like it was developed for mobile devices. I guess it was originally developed for mobile devices before it was ported to PC.\n\nThere is a second installment for this game series but it is only for mobile devices.\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visuals in the game are well done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are two different difficulty game modes to choose from: Normal and Hard.\n\nThere are two campaign modes to choose from: Campaign and Survival. The campaign mode features five different areas with two levels each. The survival mode features endless waves of invaders.\n\nThe defense towers can be upgraded to the max but it would require an \"x\" amount of coin to do so. The highest upgrade level has to be purchased from the shop with gems.\n\nThere are several different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked. The achievements are in-game only.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThere are six different trading cards to collect. Only three of those trading cards are given out by the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Community Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and its' Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1455489297,"timestamp_updated":1601165456,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.658860743045806885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqL655vQCecX4UA=="}
