    review: 'Weyrwood does not waste time throwing you into the world. It shows the
      rarely explored but incredibly thrilling world of surviving a society where
      status is literally life and death, and currency isn''t just a matter of coin.
      It definitely avoided info dumps, but at times this could be more confusing
      than not.  However you can click the grey box options to review your stats,
      definitions, and generally get additional intell. I would highly recommend checking
      your stats often while still taking risky or even out of field choices. What
      the game does well is it doesn''t just reward you for choosing the "right" answer
      as a player, but the complex answer as your character. Just because you''re
      good at something doesn''t mean other characters immediately yield. If I was
      to compare this to a AAA game experience it would be Dragon Age: Inquisition''s
      The Winter Palace quest and the Dragon Age flash game "The Last Court". This
      game does an excellent job of showing that wars are fought and won in a conversation
      as often as a sword fight, while still indulging in compelling action.


      The weakest part of this game is the spina system. It doesn''t feel completely
      worked through. For the limited resources you have the cost of Spina exceeds
      your opportunities to get it if you play a character relying on cunning. This  doesn''t
      really sink in until the end game where I, one of the most respected and influential
      among the gentry was shunned at 0 spina. It''s not that it should have been
      easier to get spina, but that the definition of what earns spina is unclear
      or inconsistent. Bold actions can gain you spina, but subterfuge is not inherently
      in conflict with boldness. Several points in the game you can make potentially
      life ending choices and have to rely on either a particularly brilliant lie
      or speak out and risk everything. So with this in mind how far must one go to
      earn spina. It says willpower is a determinate hence boldness, but both are
      more than overtly risky actions like a duel or race. They are risky lies. They
      are pushing your influence to the extreme. It should be hard to earn spina but
      my first play through never gave me the opportunity not because the text didn''t
      support it, but because it seemed like the game had a very specific thing in
      mind.'
