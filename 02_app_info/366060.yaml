    review: This is ok BoI inspired game. I like trap mechanics and level design of
      some bosses. But for me the biggest problem is screen shaking. After final boss
      the screen shaked so hart that the whole menu glitchet out to the right side.
      Bugs aside, some bosses just unplayeble because of screen shaking. The number
      of characters you can open is pretty few and sound effects are weak. Graphics
      and art style is nice and thematically coherent. Play this game only if you
      run out of all good BoI clones.
