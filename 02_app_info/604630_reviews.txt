The game isn't the same anymore !\n\nWe got a police system (including a prison), a brand new building system, graphical improvements and optimizations. There are shops, interesting locations, voice-chat (yeah, you can talk!!) and many many more.\n\nBelieve it or not, there are tons of GREAT features coming soon. Build It going forward to be one of the best Life-MMORPG's out there. I am really impressed about the game, the support and the passion of the developer about this game. It's not a quick cash-grab or an asset-flip - it's really fun and amazing to see the development process.\n\nTo be honest, I love this game and it's one of my favorite games out there - and it's still in development with near unlimited great ideas coming up !\n\n====== OLD REVIEW =====\n\n[h1]FAIR WARNING\n\nThis is an EARLY ACCESS game, that means it's still in development. If you search for an highly optimized, full of content, near free of bugs game, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND to add this to your wishlist and WAIT until an further build of this game.\n\nONLY BUY THIS GAME if you want to SUPPORT the developer and the idea behind it and you're 100% sure that you can deal with bugs, crashes, errors, clunky/unfinished features and so on. Make sure you want to buy this game to help the developer to make a great game, post suggestions, report bugs... Don't expect (especially in an early development stage) the best gameplay experience ever! I promise you, you will get angry and that wouldn't really help to make a good game.\n\nSo please, ask yourself: Do I really want it ? If you're not sure, as I said, add it to your wishlist and wait!\n\nShort sidenote: I am sorry for my bad english, it's not my native language - but I am working on it to improve my skills ![/h1]\n\n\"Build it\" is an highly RP based, 3rd person MMO set's place in an open world scenario. There is no story and there is no \"path\" you have to follow. You'll be able to write your own story, alone, with friends or unknown people. It's up to you: Do you want to be an good guy, work hard to earn money, build your own house... or you want to be the bad one, that buy a gun and try to hunt other people down to get all their stuff ? \"Build it\" will allow you to do, what you want to do.\n\nThe game combines many many features from other genres e.g. Real-Life simulator, survival and building/crafting. There are tons of items available to build your unique house/car, so you'll be able to make what you want to create. But you need in-game money! You need to buy those items from NPC's and there are many ways to earn money. But how to earn money ? Do a in-game job !\n\nThere are several jobs available. Some of them are free (gather apples and sell them to an NPC), but others will cost some money ! For an example: Gather cannabis, drive to the cannabis processor and you'll be able to generate some joints and sell them to the drug dealer ! Or do some mining, gather some diamonds ore, drive to the diamond processor and hopefully you get some diamonds you can sell. But keep in mind: You need a little bit of luck. Sometimes it's happen that the processor craft \"nothing\" and you have to do it again. So much work, but don't forget your little health/thirst bars ! Yeah, you have to eat and drink - and if you don't take care about it, a Pain meter will show up until it's full - and you die ! And if you die, you lost everything you've in your inventory (including money and clothes you've bought). But don't worry, there are several ways to save some items/or your money. At an ATM you can send money to your bank account and if you die, it will not get lost. For other items, you can buy an container and place it into your house. This container saves all items that you put into it. So there are many things to to, and in the future, there will be much more !\n\nThe graphic in the game - I like it ! It's not Triple-A, but it's not bad, too ! It's good and I love to see the day/night/rain/snow cycles in the game. It looks amazing! Keep in mind it's an small developer, and for such an game, it's more as good ! The sound effects - okay, that's something the developer will work (later) on. As I said, it's a small developer and they focusing on more important things. But they will work on it. So, don't expect some 3D-high-quality sound at this stage. The gameplay itself... You have to learn how to play! Some features are easy, others needs some playtime to deal with it. But at the end, you'll get into this game really quickly and the developer want to add an tutorial to this game. And for sure, the community will help you, too ! If you have questions and don't know how some things works, take a visit at Discord and/or the Steam forum.\n\nThe Servers: Currently only one US based server with 50 slots - but it works for now (I am from europe!) and more servers (outside the us, too) are planed. Sure, it depends a little bit on how many people join the community. But we will see in the future what's happen. But also keep in mind: As an small developer you can't add tons of servers like a big company.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n\nSure, this game have bugs and sometimes we have to deal with problems - but why do we need EA when we don't expect such things ? But to be honest, the developer works really hard on it, take every single bugreport really seriously and give us customers a great support. Really, for such an small developer, it's absolutely great. I've seen bigger companys without such an great support.\n\nIf you're into the RP gameplay, it's a promising game and make a lot of fun. I agree that there is many work to do and much more features are needed AND announced for the future (check out the Roadmap). And with more people on it, it would be an amazing thing and a good game to play.\n\nIS it worth ?
