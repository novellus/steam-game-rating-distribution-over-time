I did so based on some on the positive reviews, graphs and description. I have a DC-3 already in my aircraft files and have actually flown the type, albeit for a too brief period.\nWhen I successfully downloaded and opened the game I started on Mission 1. The engines were running, all the required switches were on but none of the avionic/panel were showing; just blank screens. Playing around, going through the provided documentation, rechecking switches and settings, trying the other missions, all led to the same negative result.\n\nI exited the game and on the 26th and asked Steam for a refund so that I could purchase another item on my Wishlist. After a 2nd request at 00:32 local time on the 29th I received an email from Steam support regarding:\nTicket: HT-68Y7-4HN7-MCFX\n\"We are unable to refund this purchase to your Steam Wallet at this time. Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). FSX: Steam Edition - Cargo Crew - Playtime: 3 hours 29 minutes\".\nThis is not support.\nYes, it takes a while to download, open, check the game out, discover things aren't what they should be, review documentation, check panel / texture / cfg files. i.e., Do everything \"YOU\" can to make the application work. It can take more than two hours. Just as it takes a long time to read all the terms and conditions of every application one downloads from Steam.\nI'm not going to have a hissy-fit and say stuff like \"I'll never download stuff from Steam again\" or I'm going to another platform.\nI like Steam. I've downloaded amazing aircraft, scenery and effects from Steam without any or too much problem and all have lived up to what was advertised and delivered. Any substandard was/is due to my system capabilities.\nHowever, this application -- which works wonderfully for others if not for me -- aside, I do believe that 2 hours is too short a time frame to download and understand a new programme or add-on.\nCAVEAT: I have checked NO to the question, \"Do you recommend this game?\" based solely on personal experience. Obviously it has worked for and has been enjoyed by others. You should read ALL Positive and Negative reviews, especially those reviews that go into some manner of explanation as to why, and base your decision solely on YOUR informative analysis prior to downloading.","timestamp_created":1609241623,"timestamp_updated":1609241623,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nc+R1/YCcIO1vgI="}
