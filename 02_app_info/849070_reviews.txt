I gave it 4 hours, but after failing to find a walkthrough (I could not get past Level 3 of the prison to find the guaze), and dying constantly because of lack of healing items (including no antidotes when all enemies cast poison), healing spots, and ways to replenish MP, I'm finally giving up. There's plenty more games in my backlog to play that aren't broken like this. It's sad, because I was enjoying the story.","timestamp_created":1587954584,"timestamp_updated":1587954584,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnIHe3PECcY/hgwI="}
