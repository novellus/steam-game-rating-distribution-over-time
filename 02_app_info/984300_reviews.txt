Player control is extremely slippery and makes the game almost unplayable at the start of the game and after barely making it past the first boss the slippery controls finally kills the game completely with frantic enemies and bosses that instakills. Not enjoyable at all, just agonizing and annoying.\n\nFollowed the developer on twitch and was looking forward to this, hopefully it will get updates that makes it playable.","timestamp_created":1576792932,"timestamp_updated":1576792932,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6teLkO8CeMS05QE="}
