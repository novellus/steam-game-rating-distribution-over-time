    review: "This one plays pretty much like Knockout League. You figure out the enemies\
      \ movement pattern, and dodge and attack accordingly. But it's way cheaper,\
      \ and lets you jump right into the action with no need for tutorials. The production\
      \ value is inferior, of course, but it's pretty fun and quickly makes you work\
      \ up a sweat.\n\nYou're standing on a small island of non-lava. In real life,\
      \ it's a little over 3 meters wide. So this one really pushes your roomscale\
      \ to the limit. The good thing, though, is that you will jump to the left to\
      \ avoid a demon fist to your right. So even though you will then be standing\
      \ next to your left wall, you're going to hit the demon fist, which are to your\
      \ right. So you won't attack your wall.\n\nA doormat at the center of your playspace\
      \ will help a lot. You will need to reorient yourself at the center, so you\
      \ know where to jump to before the next attack. You won't have to move all that\
      \ much to the side to dodge if you just start out by standing on the mat.\n\n\
      At your feet, you'll have a HUD with the life points of yourself (green), the\
      \ life points of the demon (violet) and the current time. Sadly, the game doesn't\
      \ display your progress on game over. There is some kind of best time score,\
      \ but I don't really get how that one works. \n\nThe demon has very few moves,\
      \ which makes it a triffle tedious once you got them. Still, I had fun! Pretty\
      \ good cardio, if you got the roomscale for it.\n\nThe game only lists HTC Vive\
      \ as its supported headset, but it worked fine on my Oculus Rift CV1."
