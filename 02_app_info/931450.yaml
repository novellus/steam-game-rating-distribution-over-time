    review: 'This game is very limited in the Stuff & Things department-- There''s
      a very limited set of things to /do/.


      But it seems evident to me that the reason for that is because they have spent
      all of the time so far making sure that the shooting and hit detection work
      like they should.


      The result is a very smooth and satisfying twin-stick shooting experience...
      on either one of two tile sets-- jungle or tech-base-in-a-volcano!


      But again, the core game is very competent.   All they have to do at this point
      is build content around the very strong combat and they will have a real winner.


      Although even if they abandoned it right now, I''d probably still come back
      and visit the holo chamber now and then.


      Edit:  There is a recently-posted roadmap including some campaign missions coming
      this fall, and the current public beta includes a third cave tileset for the
      holo chamber.'
