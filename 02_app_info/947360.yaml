      \ of Venus and Rome, the Ludus Magnus, and the iconic Colossus of the Sun. Like\
      \ all of Rome Reborn\u2019s apps, this one offers expert commentary as well\

      \ allow you to toggle between the ancient and modern views of the monuments.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlong the way, you will learn about the leaders responsible\

      \ and you can get up close to the individual reliefs on the arches of Constantine\
      \ and Titus, whose colors have been lovingly restored. The content of each relief\
      \ is briefly explained on the virtual tablet that serves as the navigational\
      \ aid on the tour. You can also visit areas of the ruins not readily accessible\
      \ to visitors to Rome, including inside the Venus cella of the Temple of Venus\
      \ and Rome and down to the underground chambers of the Colosseum. <br />\r\n\

    reviews: "\u201CI am a professor of Archaeology at the University of Florence\
      \ specialised in Topography of Ancient Rome. I have followed the development\
      \ of Rome Reborn VR since its inception in the 1990s. Now that the first VR\
      \ applications of the project are starting to appear in online stores, I am\
      \ delighted to express my strong support for this unique initiative which combines\
      \ archaeological accuracy with state-of-the-art technology. The goal is to make\
      \ the core monuments of the Eternal City easily comprehensible even to non-experts,\
      \ and to bring ancient Rome into the homes and schools of people wherever they\
      \ may be. In my opinion, the Rome Reborn VR team has brilliantly achieved this\
      \ goal. --Prof. Paolo Liverani\u201D<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/romerebornvr/reviews/?ref=page_internal\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Dipartimento di Storia, Archeologia,\
      \ Geografia, Arte e Spettacolo, University of Florence (Italy)</a><br><br>\u201C\
      As Director of the Civic Museum of Rieti, about 80 km north of Rome, on Saturday,\
      \ May 26, 2018 I organized, at the museum, two public demonstrations of the\
      \ Rome Reborn VR application presenting the Roman Forum. Over 100 people of\
      \ all ages attended both demonstrations. I can report that the response was\
      \ enthusiastically positive. The event showed that Rome Reborn VR has the potential\
      \ to make the study of history come alive for students and the general public.\
      \ Rome Reborn VR is a great tool for the museum world and for anyone around\
      \ the world who wants to learn more about ancient Rome by going back in time\
      \ to visit the city as it appeared at the peak of its development in AD 320.\
      \ --Dr. Monica De Simone\u201D<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/romerebornvr/reviews/?ref=page_internal\"\

      This is an *amazing* pedagogical tool with lots of applications in secondary\
      \ and higher education. As a professor of Classics, I consider Roman Reborn\
      \ VR an indispensable tool for courses on Roman civilization, Roman history,\
      \ Roman archaeology, even Latin literature. While this app has a lot to offer\
      \ to faculty and students, it will also appeal to non-academics who are interested\
      \ in ancient Rome. --Prof. Zoe Stamatopoulou\u201D<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"\
