It’s certainly the best archery dynamics I’ve experienced, and I’ve played a few. The content includes a lobby where you can introduce yourself to the actual process of firing an arrow – which you obviously only need to do the once, then a shooting range where you can hone your skills to a fine art, then there’s the actual siege part of the game – the game proper. You are on the (beautifully rendered) battlements and you have to defeat the advancing enemy and their siege engines (catapults and battering rams) - with arrows.\n\nIt takes three or four minutes to do that, and that’s it! You can go for another siege, but they are identical. Obviously the hook is to better your score, or other users’ scores on the leader board, or if you choose to play multiplayer, play directly against a partner to outdo each other (I haven’t played a multiplayer game). \n\nIts good and great fun, and I can imagine it becoming addictive up to a point, but it’s the 3 or 4 minute thing over and over. More levels or greater variety would add much to the game, but as it is it is enormous fun and it’s hardly expensive.\n\nWorks perfectly with the Valve Index and controllers - although in the heat of battle one can occasionally grab the option scroll in mistake for an arrow, which is frustrating and time wasting as it lingers in your way for several seconds, but it’s a minor issue.\n\nRecommended, but be aware of the limited gameplay.\n","timestamp_created":1601053325,"timestamp_updated":1601053325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47N6N4/QCdY6ApAI="}
