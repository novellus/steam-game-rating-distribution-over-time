    about_the_game: "Ansible is an action focused survival horror game. it tries to\
      \ focus on action and positional play more than the hide and seek approach established\
      \ by recent games in the same genre. Hence, it tries to take inspiration from\
      \ games like Dead Space and Resident Evil 4 without the more clunkier aspects.\
      \ But without removing those loved aspects, it tries to make them dynamic and\
      \ modernizes them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlot : Taking a camping trip with girlfriend\
      \ Emily, Joe thought this would be just another ordinary camping trip. But what\
      \ he unearths there will change him and you forever. This 4th wall breaking\
      \ Sci-Fi story will make you question yourself and the memories that might lurk\
      \ beneath the shadows of your conscience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBegone Hide and\
      \ seek : Feel powerless in horror games? Feel that these encounters would be\
      \ better if your character would just raise his hands to block? Well, Because\
      \ Ansible takes inspiration from classic horror games, there is a variety of\
      \ guns that you can use. These guns are not only powerful, they are also hard\
      \ to use and can open you up to a quick painful death. Tread Carefully while\
      \ using the automatic shotgun, that thing will blow your ears away!<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nHours of enjoyment : The game features 5-6 hours of content if the\
      \ player has no issues with the difficulty. (Testing stated 5 hours when not\
      \ dying and knowing all enemy locations). If you're not a developer, which you\
      \ likely are, well, be prepared take part in an experience that will span tens\
      \ of hours.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSlow and Steady combat : The game features combat\
      \ mechanics made prominent by classic games. Slow and visceral combat ensures\
      \ that the players experience and focus on positional game play rather than\
      \ run and gun. Kiting and Patience are the requirements for succeeding in this\
      \ horror classic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nModernized Classic Mechanics : Clunkier\
      \ and loved aspects of classic games such as forcing players to stop and aim,\
      \ slow recovery times are modernized here to reduce rage. But the game still\
      \ retains the effect these mechanics had by making them dynamic. ex - Can walk\
      \ while aiming instead of forcing players to stop and aim.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nFirst Person Immersion : All these mechanics and atmosphere the game has is\
      \ increased by the selection of the first person view. Not only it puts you\
      \ in the feet of the character, but also increases immersion and takes those\
      \ terrifying encounters to 11.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo more looting and Item management\
      \ : Having a unique sci-fi aesthetic and lore enables us to create weapons and\
      \ mechanics that circumvent the chore that is item management and going out\
      \ of your way to scavenge for loot. Slow health regeneration and overheating\
      \ mechanics allow the game to be fast, linear and to the point when it comes\
      \ to narration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVisceral Audio : Not only the enemies, but\
      \ the weapons are going to scare you too. These high powered futurist weapons\
      \ sound as they should. From a laser beam to a wrecking ball hitting a building.\
      \ Just as guns should be.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLow end requirements : The development\
      \ computer being the minimum requirements stated in the store page, the game\
      \ promises high framerates on most computers available today."
