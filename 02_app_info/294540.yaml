    review: 'The last of the 5 games that I didn''t get to play as a kid, but glad
      to play as an adult.  This one definitely felt a lot more like the next two
      games did: there was a lot of content to go towards, and there definitely was
      a lot more suspense with what was happening as you go through the game.  The
      characters are lovable, and there are definitely returning characters from the
      previous two games that I absolutely adore.


      Definitely give this game a try, especially if you want that feeling of nostalgia.'
