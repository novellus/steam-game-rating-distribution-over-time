I don't care that graphic, that is old school one, sound also. Control? Is fine, just too much buttons, but why enter vehicle is \"E\", and exit that is \"X\" key? Never mind. But problem is game engine, lagging in the base, on battlefield is work fine. Use sniper rifle is fine, shoot some enemies with M16, and I got CRASH!!! What!!! I bought this mainly is feeling that childhood old school FPS gameplay, BUT this break it.
