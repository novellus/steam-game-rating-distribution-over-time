    review: 'Ratings by maps: 3/3.

      These are various skirmish scenario maps--and I actually like these maps the
      most. Some kind of overworld objective but the main focus seems to be on securing
      your base first.

      Worth it on discount. I changed my rating to a more positive rating because
      while one map is an escort mission, you can control the pace of when to move
      the escorted unit. Of the three maps I like the map where you have to sacrifice
      heroes the best. The Gehenna stone map was OK, it has a few "gotchas" which
      are fine. The scenario, not campaign maps are kind of like the My Pet Dungeon
      of Dungeon Keeper II and makes a nice addition.'
