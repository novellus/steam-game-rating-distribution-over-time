      \ at trust and deception in an action-filled, multiplayer shooter set in the\
      \ world corrupted with cannibalism. You wake up in unknown surroundings to the\
      \ sound of the stranger\u2019s unfamiliar voice. Surrounded by four others,\
      \ any one of them can be the cannibal by consuming human corpses that can be\
      \ found through out the world. It is possible to beat the game just by all 5\
      \ players not committing cannibalism and gain a trust point that is needed to\
      \ unlock upcoming characters and skins in production. But being the villain\
      \ has it's own prize! Trust or deception?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Modes</h2>Carnival\
      \ Hunt features a simple matchmaking system that allows you to play with your\
      \ friends without complications.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Single Player\
