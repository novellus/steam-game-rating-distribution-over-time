    review: 'Both of these tables are excellent, but I cannot stress how much I love
      "Champions".


      At first look, the table looks really complicated as there''s lots of overlapping
      lanes and a lot of things going on, but oh my god does this table have a good
      flow to it. Multiball locks happen naturally and with the flow of the table,
      as 3 lanes are lock lanes, one of which is a frequent lane for modes. Everything
      about this table incentivises you to play for lanes which only contributes to
      the flow. The multiball alone is simple, but sees you racking up BIG points
      as you can pull off double super jackpots at every opportunity. It requires
      you to "relock" the balls in short 5 second burst, if you manage to lock all
      3 in that allotted time you can get a double superjackpot, at which it dispenses
      all back 3 at you for you to try again. If you''re good at juggling you can
      see scores of 70million a pop. It''s insanely satisfying.


      I haven''t even talked about the sound either. The music is good, but the way
      this table speaks to you is fantastic. All the sound effects are cartoony but
      with an 80s arcade sound. Even the ramps have this wooshing synth sound that
      calls back to my times spend in arcades as a kid. Honestly I cannot express
      how great this table is!


      As for A force. It''s an awesome table, just somewhat overshadowed by champions.
      The ramps have good flow, the skillshot is fun, and the modes are a bit more
      complicated than that of champions. Wizard mode is a nice touch, as it disables
      the flippers and has you playing multiball through impact explosions which is
      fun.


      I gave these a bit of a miss after buying them, I''m not particularly big on
      Marvel (in fact, truth be told, I can''t stand marvel as I find it all incredibly
      cheesy) but after giving these tables some time it has taught me to not judge
      a pin by theme alone, obviously it can help you enjoy a game or hate it (some
      tables have the most jarring music and sounds) but I can say without any shadow
      of a doubt that both of these pins are creative and wonderful tables that deserve
      a look, even if like me you''re not a marvel fan.'
