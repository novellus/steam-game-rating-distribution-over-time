It's only borderline playable (buildings have no collision detection, so you walk through them, test is shown through everything, the \"heist\" doesn't work properly, as you can't really take out the jewlery out of the cases, game feels to stutter a little bit, but no actual framdrops occur), it takes not even an hour to beat everything that has been implemented for now it seems, the story is kind of flat at the moment, voice acting is done by text-to-speech programs, and overall it kind of feels more a chore than a game currently. I waited over a month from my initial purchase and subsequent last playthrough to check if the developer would come up with a new update anytime soon, but there has been radio silence so far. So I would advise everyone to wait and see how it is going to develop than to but it at the moment.","timestamp_created":1537637166,"timestamp_updated":1537637166,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwu6WUgeYCdquYqwE="}
