It's funny, it's sexy, it's interesting, and it's beautiful.  There are some frustrating bugs, including 1 game-breaking bug that occurred once during my 3 playthroughs (DISCLAIMER: this MAY have been patched since my last playthrough), but I wouldn't consider them enough to warrant passing on the game.  That said, there is at least 1 community guide to get you passed these bugs, so I may have just gotten lucky.\n\nThe story is unique enough that it made me want to get to the bottom of the mystery.  The relationship between the characters are funny to watch, particularly when funny situations are animated out (e.g., the men shuffling around the crack of the door after the \"nose\" incident).  I also like that the MC is not a simpering daisy, but a more realistic-feeling adult woman. \n\nSpeaking of adult, nudity and adult content are optional and can be toggled on/off directly from the in-game options/settings menu -- an improvement IMO from the usual \"download adult patch from a separate website and merge it into your game files\" method.\n\nAll in all, it definitely needs some polish, but I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a sexy, supernatural ADV-VN game.","timestamp_created":1609818153,"timestamp_updated":1609818153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gvSo6PYCf97LwAI="}
