    review: "JetFly is unbelievably terrible. I'm not kidding, you can't believe how\
      \ terrible this is until you try playing it.\n\nThe game is so poorly designed\
      \ it's shocking, even the main menu is beyond terrible. Massive empty space\
      \ everywhere with tiny clickable play or exit buttons in the lower left, just\
      \ looking at the main menu is a red flag that you're in for a bad time with\
      \ this game. \n\nAbsolutely no tutorial or instructions on how to play I had\
      \ to try and figure out the buttons myself. You use the arrow keys to \"fly\"\
      \ your plane and press spacebar to drop missiles as bombs on other planes. Not\
      \ only does this not make sense, it doesn't even work properly. Your plane is\
      \ all over the place because of the terrible controls and is so hard to control.\
      \ The game randomly ends for no reason when playing and You'll just blow up\
      \ and die after 10 seconds.\n\n[b][url=store.steampowered.com/curator/18710490/]\
      \ --> Follow My Steam Curator Here <--[/url][/b]\n\nNo reason for doing anything,\
      \ no explanation of anything. No reason to play, no reason to even launch this.\
      \ I actually wonder if the so-called \"developer\" of this has ever even played\
      \ video games before. If this is what they call a game then I would assume they\
      \ haven't."
