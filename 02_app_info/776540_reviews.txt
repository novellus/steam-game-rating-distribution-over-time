No matter how close you are to the end, the moment a wall is touched, you'll have to restart; no checkpoints, no fun, no kidding. Sure, the levels are colorful, uniquely shaped and decent background music but the frustration of finishing the game outweighs all of that.\n\nYou'd probably have to be a die-hard fan of the aMAZE series or feel too obligated to play this game. Either way, I won't stop you but I won't recommend it, either.\n\nThe developers could at least compensate players by making Steam Trading Cards...not that they ever WILL. ðŸ˜’","timestamp_created":1603053860,"timestamp_updated":1603130997,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kLeDofUCdKHbqAI="}
