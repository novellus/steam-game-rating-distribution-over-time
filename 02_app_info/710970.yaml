      /><br><br>Ever wanted to learn how to read Japanese? The first step is to learn
      &quot;Hiragana&quot; and &quot;Katakana&quot;, otherwise known collectively
      as &quot;Kana&quot;! &quot;Kana&quot; refers to the Japanese alphabet - a collection
      of symbols that each make a distinct sound. By stringing multiple Kana together,
      you can form whole words or even entire sentences!<br><br>Learning Kana is the
      first of 3 major steps toward mastering the Japanese language. After you''ve
      mastered Kana with the help of our game and want to continue learning Japanese,
      you should also consider learning Kanji (we recommend using WaniKani), along
      with Japanese grammar (we suggest &quot;A Guide to Japanese Grammar&quot; by
      Tae Kim).<br><br>Easy-to-learn rules, an addictive soundtrack, and fun visual
      effects ensure the game will hold your attention much longer than other products!<br><br><img

      /><br><br>If you''ve played Tetris or Puyo-Puyo, you''ll have no trouble at
      all learning the rules of <i>Learn Kana The Fun Way!</i><br><br>We''ll ease
      you into learning each Kana by slowly introducing new ones over the span of
      20 campaign levels. By the time you complete the final level, you''ll be able
      to convert every single Kana in the Japanese alphabet into their English counterparts!
      It''s both fun and easy.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/710970/extras/01.png?t=1511310733"
      /><br><br>Take your pick of three different game modes:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Campaign:
      This mode contains 20 levels which will teach you all the different Kana symbols.
      This is the first mode you should play if you''ve never seen Kana before.<br></li><li>Play
      Mode: This is the main gameplay mode which allows you to compete with your own
      high scores and unlock achievements. Be warned: the Kana blocks will start to
      fall more quickly over time!<br></li><li>Free Training: This mode is similar
      to Play Mode, except the blocks will always fall slowly and you can adjust the
      gameplay options to suit your needs.</li></ul><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/710970/extras/02.png?t=1511310733"

      mastered Kana! You can also sharpen your skills by trying to beat your own high
      scores. How high can you go?'
