No that's not an exaggeration, it shows daily online players and it has been just us two for the past month. Before me, it was just him by himself for what is probably a few more months. I'm not sure why the servers are still up, they aren't making any money off me or the other guy. That being said, it's a decent little game. It was a mistake for them to make it a paid game. On Steam it is 99 cents but through the main site it is $10. I got it for 99 cents so the cost was irrelevant but it is not by any stretch of the imagination a 10 dollar game. There isn't much to it, just a bunch of clicking. It mostly just consists of you checking back a few times a day to click a few buttons, then leave. The only time consuming thing is the combat system, but the price of gear scales extremely harshly, so you don't spend much time in the combat portion since you can't progress. The game can be described as kind of a really basic idle game. Money collects over time, use money to buy stuff that makes you a tiny bit more money, repeat.","timestamp_created":1537047909,"timestamp_updated":1537047909,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5066719651222229","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qLrM7+UCfO/cqgE="}
