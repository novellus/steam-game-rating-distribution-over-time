    about_the_game: Vivid! is a colorful 2D action-packed platformer where color dictates
      your actions. You'll guide our heroic young lady, Vivid, through the artistic
      world of Paper Craft and discover treasure, fight off amphibious wizards, and
      uncover the truth behind her lack of color. You'll even be able to play as her
      cute dog, Spirit!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1147870/extras/vivid-game-download.gif?t=1568157497"
      /><br><br><u>Attack In Color!</u><br>Red, Yellow, and Blue. These are the three
      colors Vivid and Spirit can shift between. They can only use certain weapons
      or powers while a specific color. It's integral that you find methods to swapping
      your color, such as Stomping Colored Blocks, to utilize different abilities
      for different situations. This is because different Color Attacks have different
      properties, such as the Golden Bow shooting far but only horizontally, while
      the Azure Axe can be tossed far up vertically. As you progress there will be
      more demanding situations where certain abilities are favored over others, and
      figuring how to Color Swap efficiently will be the key to success!<br><br><img

      /><br><br><u>Over 5 Different Stories!</u><br>There are multiple adventures
      to play from in Vivid! Some need to be unlocked by completing others, but all
      are important to the overarching plot. In one adventure, you'll play as Vivid
      alone whose trying to rescue Spirit. In another tale, you'll play as Spirit
      alone while trying to reclaim her lost toys. And not all stories play similarly;
      some are simple level to level stages, while others are open world! And expect
      to play as a tag team between Vivid and Spirit as you progress.<br><br>There
