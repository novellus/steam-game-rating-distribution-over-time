    about_the_game: James Reed is a detective called out one night to investigate
      the apparent suicide of a woman and the sudden disappearance of her husband,
      Thomas May. Play as both of these men in this short story-driven experience
      as you learn about how they lived, how they loved, how they lost, and how the
      decisions they made changed not only their lives, but of those around them.<br><br>Quiet
      Bay Studio's debut title, Gone Fireflies, is a brief, linear experience that
      lets you turn the story one page at a time by talking with the game's characters,
      finding and interacting with objects in the environment, and making choices
      in both action and conversation which determine the final pages of this interactive
      tale. This is a slower paced game that emphasizes dialogue and story over traditional
      RPG elements and adventure. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/784100/extras/Color_Firefly_Alone_-_no_background_Small.png?t=1606081610"

    review: 'Those 2 hours certainly didn''t go to waste, Gone Fireflies tells a story,
      plain and simple, there is no much ''gameplay'' involved.

      The soundtrack is amazing and greatly adds to the atmosphere, for a first shot
      at game developing using the RPGMaker i''ll say its a really good try,'
