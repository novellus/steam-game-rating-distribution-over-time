The levels are designed more like puzzles than other platformers of this type, but they are always the interesting type and there is still a strong focus on execution. If you enjoy hardcore platformers such as Super Meat Boy or Celeste then I would recommend this game.\n\nMy one criticism would be that the level select UI is a bit janky (which is separate from the story mode which uses a hub world), although I assume this is getting updated as the game is currently in Early Access.\n\nEdit: Game now has a level editor AND a level exchange to share the levels.","timestamp_created":1593295695,"timestamp_updated":1608939880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw5MeSzvYCdMnrkAI="}
