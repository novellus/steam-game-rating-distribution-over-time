    review: 'This review applies to the FG conversion, not the quality of the adventure
      itself.


      There are a significant number of problems with the conversion.

      To be fair, the original module tended to be pretty sparse with information,
      generally listing a type of opponent and its hp, leaving it up to the DM to
      look up all necessary information in the Monster Manual.


      However, when I pay for an FG conversion, I''m expecting a ready to run adventure.


      A short list of issues I found by the time I was partway through (Details are
      omitted to avoid spoilers if players read the review).

      For Room:

      002.003 Inhabitants of the room have no attacks listed.

      002.007 Treasure listed in the room has incorrect value in the parcel

      002.009 Treasure listed in the room is not included in the parcel

      002.011 One of the females in this room does not have any attacks listed.

      002.013 Treasure has the wrong quantities in the parcel.

      003.028 There is a hostile listed in the room description but no encounter provided.

      (This is not a complete list, as I haven''t been all the way through it yet)


      Note:  XP Values provided in encounters appear to be 2E values, not 1E.

      Not a problem; just a clarification.


      These conversions should really be playtested before publishing them.'
