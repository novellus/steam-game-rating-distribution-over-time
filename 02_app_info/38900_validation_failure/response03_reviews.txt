The game works exactly like that except with worse music. Unlike Beatmania however, you have the choice to choose from music in your own mp3 collection instead.\n\nI personally don't like such games, but i got it as part of an indie game pack which contained Zen Bound 2 which was the game i was really aiming for. The whole pack contained a couple of games of mixed quality. Chime was another surprising good game that came out of that pack, so its not a total loss.\n\nUnless you like such Rhythm music style games, steer cleer.\n\nOverall Rating: 3 / 10\nNot worth to buy even if its on sale. Give it a couple of points more if you like such music Beatmania styled games.","timestamp_created":1342713741,"timestamp_updated":1591406096,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6L3Mw/ICefr3Dg=="}
