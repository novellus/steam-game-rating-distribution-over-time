    short_description: '&quot;We''re going on the school camping trip today, huh?&quot;
      Yamada is less than thrilled, but gets his fill of all he wants to do after
      switching bodies with Urara and thinks, &quot;Looks like this''ll be sorta fun
      now!&quot; However, Urara has never really fit in with the other girls.'
