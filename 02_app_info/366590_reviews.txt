Completing the hardest levels/collectibles doesn't feel satisfying. The frustration from what seems to be several frame perfect inputs as the intended way to solve levels outshines the fun that the game does have in it.\n\nIt's not terrible, but not good enough to recommend it and it definitely needed some reworking to make it fully enjoyable.","timestamp_created":1603935562,"timestamp_updated":1603935562,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkc2AufUCcd/gqgI="}
