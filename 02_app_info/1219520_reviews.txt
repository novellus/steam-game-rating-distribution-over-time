I enjoyed the artwork of the game play; however, just like one of the other reviews the frame rate is horrific. I have a medium to high end rig and it was just too much for my eyes. I wish I could play more, but the FR is just way too low even on high/medium/low \"graphic\" settings.\nI was able to meet enemies, but they would not register that I was near them. The enemies would just stand there when I shot. If i did shoot an enemy their health would MAYBE drop a little. It did not always drop, but sometimes it did.\nI think if this game got updated then it will be crazy fun!","timestamp_created":1588227099,"timestamp_updated":1588227099,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l8nt5PECcPa8hAI="}
