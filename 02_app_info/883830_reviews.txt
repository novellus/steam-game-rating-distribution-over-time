What urged me to buy it were the visuals. And I'm glad I did.\n\nThis game ultimately boils down to a bunch of events. You might call them micro-games, but they don't feel like that in my experience. They feel more like events happening very quickly, and I tend to think that micro-games are much more unrelated to each other (eg. the WarioWare series).  I could be wrong, but alas. The main objective [b]does[/b] have a striking resemblance to WarioWare, that being to get the highest score you possibly could with events eventually coming more rapidly after each other. One nice touch the developer gave is the 4 second brake you get around every 20 events that happened. While summing this up, it really made me wish there was some kind of online scoreboard added to the game. That would've been so engaging and I'd definitely say it could've boosted sales.\n\nSo, let's talk about the things (read: events) that are happening in the game. If you haven't seen the screenshots already, well... the name of the game [i]is[/i] NSFWare for a reason. It's totally not safe for work. But totally safe for a good group of comrades! I can see this being played with the right group of friends, all huddling around the couch trying to get the high score and perhaps giving the wrong instructions to the new guy, haha. It is getting used to it though, since some instructions are very subtle, downright confusing or just non-existent. I do think that adds to the challenge of the game. I still don't master every event that's happening on-screen, despite having a respectable (I think??) personal high-score of 45 points. But that being said, it's solid fun after knowing it somewhat better.\n\n\n[h3]Conclusion: this game deserves way more people at least trying it out (with friends). It's something unique, wild and fun to spend a few rounds to from time to time. This is the type of indie games I like, cheap and creative while being genuinely good fun. I think it's also a very cool game to give to a good friend on Steam, so future potential gift idea for ya right there. ;)[/h3]","timestamp_created":1608951094,"timestamp_updated":1608951094,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr6u9zvYCcvifvQI="}
