It looks rough in places, feels clunky at times, has some lapses in content balance and can become frustrating in the long run. All these are mostly deeper design decisions that could be made different - elevating a rough gem into something greater. So a game like this is not a lost cause by any means. That said, its not likely to happen with this title in particular due to how deep some of the changes would have to go to overhaul many of the core components of this game. Creating new games inspired by this one would be the better option.\n\nHowever.\n\nDespite it being an amateur production and the above disclaimer, this game has some of the most satisfying array of features and content that you will not find anywhere else on the market. There's destructible terrain, open area 2D spaceflight with hyperdrives and long range scanners, a relatively complex modular system for your and enemy spaceships, allowing upgrades to individual components, swapping out a wide variety of exotic weapons, reactors, engines, etc, managing an inventory with bizarre cargo items that offer seemingly endless opportunities, benefits and functions to your ship or your pilot. This is a big game with lots of good stuff in it.\n\nThere's top-down spaceflight. There's a lunar-lander esque planetary re-entry sections that seamlessly transition into a jetpack equipped powersuit ground battles, both in planets with gravity and in space within derelict wrecks featuring weightless environments.\n\nYour mission is to brave 20 open areas in space, building yourself up to face a powerful final boss at the end, where you go to deliver the final blow to the core of the enemy personally, on foot in power armor. Its epic, its satisfying and unpredictable. You'll never know what you'll be facing in the next sector and you'll never know what you'll find next to upgrade yourself.\n\nWith a few exceptions, despite the game being ruthlessly hard - requiring you to use all the tools at your disposal and think ahead as you fight sector to sector - it is still very fair and it is possible to win every playthrough once you get the hang of it. This game is possible to beat and each victory feels incredibly satisfying as the final boss goes out with a bang. There's even an escape sequence when you deal the final blow to the mainframe, where the entire level is collapsing all around you - physically via an actual destructible environment - the very terrain falling on top of you as you race back to the dropship you came in. That is incredibly unique and not seen in most games.\n\nThe game now has an ingame tutorial that'll teach you the basics and get you started, walking you through the seemingly complex controls and systems that may seem overwhelming at first. Thankfully, the learning curve is tame for this game, so you'll get the hang of it quite quickly enough.\n\nThe game is punishingly hard at first, but it gets easier as you learn it, so don't be discouraged by your first death. Deaths may come swiftly out of nowhere at first, but once you've identified the causes, you'll be only blaming yourself for doing a poor choice. My only hard recommendation is to go to the options menu and TURN OFF asteroid storms. If you try them, you'll see why. This can only be done via main menu.\n\nDespite the flaws and the rough edges, this game is a gem that I hope could be an example to others for what meaningful and satisfying gameplay systems found in this game could be added elsewhere too. This game is a sincere passion project of a unique creative mind and it can be felt on all levels throughout the visuals, gameplay and music.\n\nThis game, its structure and its features are rare. I think its made by a single person and it manages to deliver an experience that most high budget studios usually with more people that I have fingers could only dream off.\n\nI recommend this game to everyone that loves space/scifi games, even if it ends up being too hard or rough for you, at least just to see the features and the content it offers and be inspired by it. I personally want to see the creativity of this game's author be a more common thing in the industry, to be brave and believe in creating games that follow the true passions of your heart.","timestamp_created":1600468425,"timestamp_updated":1609692065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zvXH5PYCfe7TogI="}
