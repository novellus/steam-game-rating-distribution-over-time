    about_the_game: <i>Nano Driller</i> is a brisk, meditative action-puzzler that
      can be completed in 25-45 minutes. It's built primarily to be replayed, or to
      simply be enjoyed at any time of the day. It places the focus on unique, momentum-based
      controls to offer a puzzle game which remains fun to play well after the first
      playthrough. These puzzles and action sequences take place in a series of rooms
      and doors which ask the player not only to use their reflexes and puzzle-solving
      abilities, but also to stretch their navigational muscles here and there. Once
      you've completed the main game, you can continue to hunt down increasingly more
      difficult time attack achievements, or try an alternative ship type for a new
      challenge.

    review: 'A pretty fun, quick, and simple action game all about getting a feel
      for momentum. Simple to play with a one-button control scheme, but challenging
      to master.


      I cleared the game my first time in about 23 minutes, and with Gravity Ship
      in 12. The game clearly wants me to optmize and refine my play to become a true
      speedrunner, but as fun as it is I found it surprisingly stressful!


      There aren''t many music tracks in this game, but the ones that are there fit
      the mood wonderfully and is exciting in the right places. I had a good time!
      And I kinda wish this game had been in arcades back when I was little. It would
      make a lovely quarter-muncher!


      This game is suitable for all ages and all skill levels and for the price tag
      is a nice way to spend a weekend.'
