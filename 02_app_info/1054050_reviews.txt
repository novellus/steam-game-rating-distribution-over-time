While I have yet to reach the true ending, I wanted to express my thoughts with the hours I had so far.\n\nAs the game says, you’re Hero, the main dude who killed the demon lord and saved the world. Sadly, you also died doing so, and God has given you 5 days to spend your life however you like. You have the freedom to go anywhere and do what you like; explore, battle, and relearn about the world Hero had forgotten whilst finding your one true love.\n\nYou start overpowered, max gold, full equipment and skills- a pretty much end game level character. And, as the days go by, you’re weakened and stripped of your skills and weapons, your stats decreasing to a point you can literally have 1hp and 0mp. Thankfully, you can hire party members to join you in your final moments, practically carry your sorry butt through the end. (Thomas will always be there to help serve you at the start of every new game, but many will have to have a quest completed to join.)\n\nLike every JRPG, it’s your regular turn-based system- attack, spells, defend, and so on. It’s simple to the core, and more of authentic pleaser as you’ll usually want to end battles in 1-3 turns. Its big focus is on magic elements, as enemies will be Fire, Water, Wind, or Normal type in varying ways. (Basically Rock-Paper-Scissors.) Nothing spectacular, but this game is meant to be faster pace than thought provoking because time is constantly moving, even during the battle!\n\nMost of the game will revolve doing small quests and searching through dungeons, memorizing the layouts, what items lay within and how to obtain them. Events change every playthrough, so it’s best to keep an eye out for things you didn’t see before.\nHero will die, a lot. So don’t feel stress if you can’t complete a certain quest in time or struggle within dungeons (due to a bad party set up or lacking damage.) Explore and experiment, and see what kind of endings you can get doing certain things, because there’s a lot of them!\n\nOh, the game also has a neat little save replay, so you can look back on all the things you accomplished in your five days and how many people mourned for your lost (Like a point system). It can be a good motivator to see how many points you can obtain in the end.\n\nOff the subject of the gameplay, the visuals are quite pretty and the battle animations are nice to watch when selecting spells or attacking. It’s that usual JRPG look you get from many other games- Elf Forest, Mountain Volcano, Dark Lord castle, and so on. And the map is pretty small, so you won’t have too many areas to visit either. It does its job, but it’s nothing to write home about.\n\nCharacters are hit or miss, many not really given much in background to stand out from the usual stereotypical JRPG trope (Haughty Elf Girl, Loli Merchant, Brawny Muscle girl, etc.) You can marry any of your female party members though, which is pretty neat. Sadly, Thomas and Zoro are only for an achievement.\n\nThere are some pleasant musical beats and sounds, but nothing that really stood out to me besides the battle music- which is a given for most RPGS. Again, it does the job well enough.\n\nWhile the core concept is pretty cool on its own, it may not be for everyone, maybe even frustrating if you don’t know how to handle it. Same with the time limit- but I feel the game gives you plenty of time to do everything, especially if you abuse magic and items to move around.  \n\nI’d probably wait for an even bigger sale off, as even 20$ seems a bit high for a quite repetitive game. But, if you like the concept, and if you don’t mind repeating certain things to the point of perfection, I’d give the game a chance. You can easily get through your first playthrough in less than two hours, so if it doesn’t come to your liking then, you can refund it.\n\nSlightly Recommended\n","timestamp_created":1606441519,"timestamp_updated":1606441519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+YjYg/YCcM2MswI="}
