I actually enjoyed this better than the full game (no offense intended) simply because it left a lot more open to your own imagination. Which I think helped the story a bit more.\n\nNext to the (brief!) story you'll also get to see several pictures which have been used in the game. Which is where a fair warning is in order: I strongly suggest you only read this [u]after[/u] you've finished the game, otherwise you'll have a few spoilers to deal with which can ruin some of the surprises.\n\nBut yeah, I think this is a good addition to the game and it can help relive some of the moments from within the game.","timestamp_created":1593911588,"timestamp_updated":1593970193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.585596382617950439","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pt6BkPMCfcDwkgI="}
