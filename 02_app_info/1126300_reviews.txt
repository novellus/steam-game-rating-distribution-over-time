I had never played the game before this version, but after losing several fights and winning one, I can say that this will scratch that itch you might have to play a deep \"RPG lite\" style card game of one on one tactical combat. It will be even better for you if you like the theme of dragons, but anyone who likes fantasy themed card games should at least check out the demo to see if they can get into it.\n\nThe rules of the game were fairly easy to learn for me, but I have some experience with these kind of games. But at least for me, the combination of the tutorial tips, in game manual, and a few playthroughs making all kinds of mistakes was enough to teach me the game. Then I was able to put it all together in my third game and beat my opponent, although that was not without using all my cards to my advantage and a little luck.\n\nAnd that is something I really like about this game. Even once you understand it and can make good use of all your cards, there is still a chance you can lose. You keep spending resources to attack whether you hit or miss with that attack, but you can increase your chances by using attacks your dragon is better at versus a defense the opponent is weaker at, but that is easier said then done, as you also have to make due with your cards in hand at the time, because if you wait for a certain card to come out, you may just end up discarding it to pay for an attack or as damage from being hit by an attack.\n\nAll that is to say that this is a very interesting game once you learn it, and each game is a fun exercise in balancing building your dragon, adding to the attacks it can perform, and pulling off those attacks enough times to get the opponent's deck and hand down to zero cards, at which time they are defeated. This game also creates some tense moments where even if you have a great set of attacks and your opponent is on the ropes, they could still win if you get very unlucky, but each turn you are trying to get them down to zero cards is a nailbiter that can go either way. Even with that, you never feel cheated when you lost, because you did your best, even though victory was just not in the cards for that game. But there is always next game, where you start all over with a new baby dragon.","timestamp_created":1586662482,"timestamp_updated":1586662482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.601872384548187256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1586702215,"developer_response":"Thanks for taking the time to write and share your thoughts of the game!
