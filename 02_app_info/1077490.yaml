    developer_response: 'We released a second-day patch to fix the display issues
      this reviewer initially complained about, and we were perfectly polite in thanking
      them for bringing this to our attention.


      In the initial review the reviewer also made an incorrect complaint about controls
      which they misread in the options menu, and the reviewer admits to never having
      gone past the main menu to actually play the game.  When we first reached out
      to them, communications were cordial and they expressed a desire to edit or
      remove the review, but could not at that time.  We reached out again recently
      to see if they would like to try once more, and did so politely at first.  Instead
      of trying to edit the review this user responded with insults and dismissiveness,
      also claiming they were still unable to.   It is also clear from this edit above
      that they are able to edit it, and so all of this clearly could have been avoided
      if the reviewer had checked to see if they could edit the review before starting
      an argument, or even politely declined to edit it - as they''re certainly under
      no obligation to extend us that courtesy... regardless of whether leaving abusive
      reviews with false information is in bad taste.


      We have no problem with legitimate criticism, but when criticism is given on
      false pretenses and is made with vitriol we do like to reach out and find a
      resolution.  Obviously that was not possible in this case for a number of reasons. '

    review: "review - this dev has some issues with tact and professionalism, and\
      \ hunted me out on my own personal discord channel to complain that my review\
      \ was not only bad, but I shouldn't have left it because I never played his\
      \ game. I'll e posting a video to go along with this to showcase just how much\
      \ of an ordeal this became over 2 days. \n\nI don't care if the game works anymore,\
      \ And I'm amazed I cn edit this review ( which was certainly marked and locked\
      \ as spam by a dev or moderator, I'm recording this whole thing and showing\
      \ how this review didn't even appear in my profile list at all, and how I cant\
      \ delete it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct8L4jQP1b4\n\ncheers."
