Despite what a lot of reviewers are saying on here, the gun play is actually ridiculously easy once you realize how broken it is. I posted a video of me going through a level of the game to exemplify this in the discussion section for this game, but essentially you can beat the whole thing without dying by just walking forward and shooting and occasionally grabbing a gun from an enemy behind you. This is because there's a bug where enemies behind you can only hit you with their bullets if they are super close to you. Outside of this, the story is pretty bland and not very involved. You can participate in a few activities around the city of Paris when youre not going through mission levels, but none of them are really interactive in any way - even going to the movies is just you watching your character sit in a chair.  I understand that there is supposed to be an underlying theme of ennui and nihilism running through everything, but without compelling gameplay to back the theme, it ends up just feeling like a bit of a slog. I still plan on finishing the game since I purchased it and want to get my money's worth, but, as of now, I honestly don't know if I can recommend this to anyone.","timestamp_created":1609889779,"timestamp_updated":1609891184,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2L+/6vYCfZHtwAI="}
