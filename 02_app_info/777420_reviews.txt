That's fine with me, since I run the game while I'm doing other things around the house and check in from time to time.  It looks like the game hasn't been updated in some time, which is sad, but for the price, I feel good about my purchase.  I wish there were more games like this for those of us that can't spend time playing games because of a busy lifestyle, and like me, who has DJD in my thumbs and am physically unable to use a mouse or gamepad for any length of time.  The game is not for everyone, but I love it and looking forward to today's update!!!  There's so much potential for people like me!!","timestamp_created":1549055127,"timestamp_updated":1549744805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51800847053527832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4yKL/6egCcKLiuQE="}
