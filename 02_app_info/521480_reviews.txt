This tale although told thousands of times before is more about how the Monkey King came to be.\n\nThe first half of this movie showed promise and had me chuckling at the bad cgi and the fact that I could not tell what was going on in the action scenes because they were such a mess and mainly consisted of people floating around waving weapons in front of faces, it even has Chow Yun Fat turn into a dragon. The second half began to drag on and the antics of Sun Wukong began to get irritating a long with the fact that they did not seem to know what direction they wanted to take the character often had me shaking my head and the laughter wore off pretty fast. Bare in mind this movie is 2 hours long and they some how managed to make the final 45 minutes or so feel extremely rushed. One thing I did really like about this movie was the scenery because although the cgi 'horses' and Dragons had me chuckling to myself the scenery was truly beautiful and set the scenes well when accompanied by the costumes which were also very good. Acting was fine and although I mentioned Chow Yun Fat being in this movie he roughly had around 10 minutes of screen time if even that.\n\nIn conclusion I cannot recommend this movie based on the second half of it, the fact the action scenes were a mess and the characters seemed to be written sloppily and had no real purpose excluding Sun Wukong and the Demon King who were the only two to be established.","timestamp_created":1475402014,"timestamp_updated":1501918540,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.600185632705688477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjsbU2N0Cco++Yg=="}
