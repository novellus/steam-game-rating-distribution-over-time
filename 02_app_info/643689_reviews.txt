I love the plane, and in no way do I regret purchasing it.  I took off from KSFO after sitting in cockpit for <10 min doing cockpit familiarization.  I flew around verifying things worked.  I created a small FP, selected approach procedures in the GPS, Activated, and performed something close to an ILS approach.  I managed altitude using the papi when close enough.  I buttered the bread on the first attempt.  I'm really pleased  with this DC.","timestamp_created":1582305377,"timestamp_updated":1582305377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rv+vtPACcM7a8wE="}
