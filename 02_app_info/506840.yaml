      Description</h2>To create a brand new experience in the RPG genre, The Dungeons
      of Castle Madness is a unique combination of old school first person dungeon
      crawling with new school fast paced combats. In this game you will go up against
      an unstoppable Baron and storm Castle Madness to save a village in dire need.
      As you progress, the levels grow to become labyrinthian, battles get bigger
      and even more exciting. The tension builds for what might be around the next
      corner...<br><br><br>Featuring grid-based movement for exploration and old school
      level design which rewards those who want to find every secret hidden within
      the game, the Dungeons of Castle Madness provides a challenge for everyone.
      On ''hardcore'' difficulty the automap is disabled altogether, forcing you to
      map out the levels on graph paper like in the old days - and the monsters are
      tougher. A unique system powers the game with a more realistic inventory than
      typically found in most RPG''s (you won''t be carrying everything and the kitchen
      sink around with you). Armour can be damaged and even destroyed in battle, but
      not to worry though, it can be repaired, upgraded, crafted from scratch and
      even conjured from thin air. With 19 levels to fight your way through - 2 of
      which are different on every play through - you''ll be tested to the limit.<br><br><br>You
      are not without your own considerbale powers in this quest against tyranny.
      You can tear foes limb from limb as a shapeshifting werewolf... Blast enemies
      with infernal magics as a powerful wizard... Craft magical items as a highly
      skilled blacksmith... Charge headlong into the fray as a warrior of the blade...
      Fry those foolish enough to oppose you with terrible lightning as a storm priest!
      Or why not mix these abilities up, and more, to play the character you want
      to play... your way. <br><br><br>Gather treasures to you, gain long lost magics
      and become strong enough to face the Baron! Assemble the unique artifacts of
      legend from seperate pieces that lie scattered and hidden in dank and dusty
      chambers and unlock your destiny. Secrets abound for the curious hero - but
      be wary - for there are traps too... as the Baron of Castle Madness is a cruel
      and vicious man.'

    review: 'Ideas

      - original combination of grid-based RPG and top-down Gauntlet-like combat

      - not enough points to invest in all skills, every walkthrough can be radically
      different


      Tech

      - graphic is really ugly (both artistically and technologically)

      - despite above fact game suffers massive slowdowns, especially at the beginning
      of combat

      - crashes due to Adobe projector technology

      - bugged skills (some of them aren''t levelled up despite point investment,
      for instance mana regeneration)


      Gameplay

      - playing with weapons and armor means constant micromanagement of resources,
      especially when not using exploits like taking the same document over and over
      again from the same NPC and converting it into gem

      - not being able to save anywhere is especially nice when killed due to slowdown
      or crash

      - you get totally random stuff when buying or forging

      - game almost constantly closes path to previous levels (for instance to be
      able to return to the village you have to play several hours, mostly without
      being able to buy anything)

      - game is not balanced playing wizard. Random scrolls in pots (you get powerful
      spell on Level 4, after loading useless text scroll you have found several times
      already), not being able to buy spells at all, not being able to predict the
      behaviour of spells when levelling them (for instance trajectory), some spells
      auto aim nearest enemy which is a pain when trying to kill some other more powerful
      etc.
