    about_the_game: 12 great tunes out of this world. They're from Mars. We like the
      fifth track very much, but our favorite is the first one. However, we are aware
      that some people might like the second and the third one more. The ninth will
      also find its audience. Really, what more can we say? This soundtrack is just
      a soundtrack. A soundtrack is a music, tracks, pieces of melody, a symphony.<br><br>.xrm
      did an amazing job of creating the music for the game. SPATE is also doing an
      amazing job of making the music for the trailers and the other announcements.
      Thanks to both of them. Most of the income made on this DLC will be handled
      on their behalf.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1260270/extras/steamXrmSpateLogos.png?t=1586534425"
