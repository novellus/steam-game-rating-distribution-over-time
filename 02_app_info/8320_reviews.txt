But this game is so exceedingly bad, even for a company that just is starting out, and I'm gonna say why, especially since this game isn't available anymore.\n\nFirst, there's the graphics. This game is garbage looking, and there's no doubt, I mean this game came out the same year as Resident Evil 4, which is amazing for its time, sure, but if you compare the graphics that was what was capable in 2005, in fact resident evil CAME FIRST, and I know its a cartoon style, but its just bad, and it hurts my eyes. The color palette is toilet, its just a lot of brown and red and white and grey, that's not even a joke, that's the best way I can describe it, it's really that bad. The animations are just as bad, the mouths move like the worst lipsync in the world, I honestly got a good laugh out of that. Overall though it's really just ugly, and is an aspect that makes this game awful.\n\nThe gameplay is just so bad. It's a story-based game right, so it's not supposed to be super duper fun, but most RPG story games have the minigames or QTE's or something, but oh boy bone is something else. The games have strange mechanic where you have to figure out some bull method of winning like a puzzle, but it's a minigame? I actually don't get it, like in the first game you had to figure out this hide and seek game that took about an hour for me to realize that saying warmer and colder moves them in the direction (spoiler alert lol). Another amazing thing, although I enjoy Fone crip walking everywhere, it's so damn slow, and it takes ages to go everywhere, and I'm not joking about the crip walk, buying the game just for that is reasonable.\n\nFinally, I will talk about the best part of the game, the dialogue. Now it's a story-based RPG, so the dialogue should be pretty good, and it's fine for the most part since it's ripped from the book, but first the voice acting is wooden most of the time and is god awful in general. The thing about the dialogue is that some of it is written by the game writers or whatever, and you can tell which are ripped from the book because the lines written by the programmers or whatever is so bad, you can tell it apart easily. It's not completely bad, but wow is it far off from the normal game writing.\n\nNow this is written with a ton of hyperbole, and I actually enjoyed playing this game with friends since it's so funny and we just laughed for hours about some of the dumb things in this game, but that doesn't change that I still did technically enjoy it. And like I said, this game came out when Telltale was still a fresh company, so you can't judge this too harshly or use this to define the company.\n\nIn conclusion, play these games, you will hate them and yourself, but you will laugh your ass off.\nBut actually don't get these, these are better lost to time.","timestamp_created":1596176029,"timestamp_updated":1596176029,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41Krg0fMCe4jImAI="}
