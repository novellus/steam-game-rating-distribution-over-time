So here we go.\n\nPros. \nSo this game has been allot of fun for both FPS and RTS. For RTS, you start off feeling like a god controlling what your opponents do because they have little to nothing. Then as the game counts down, it gets a little harder. Mind you, this is as we start learning how to play. \nIn RTS, getting to control where your units go and who to attack is amazing.\nIn FPS, Gun play feels good. Building buildings and upgrading them is an awesome addition to protecting your objective.\nYou can go down fast if you dont know what your doing so be careful.\n\nCons.\nManual relaoding on guns. Sucks. But can be dealt with without issues. Going down is wonky but can be over looked. Aiming is weird but I can get used to it. \nRTS wise, controlling units is weird. It feels good in terms of starcraft or warcraft feel but needs a bit of polishing. Trees tend to get in the way from point of view and i get why you see them, but i feel like the trees should be more transparent for the RTS person. Sometimes you'll be clicked on all your units when you dont want to be and they all go where you tried clicking on a small group to attack. The video shows you being able to tilt the camera while in RTS, but i have yet to find it. would make playing RTS a bit better.\n\nGame-wise cons. Ping and lag are an issue if you have too many bots in the game. This is a 4v1 game, so try not to have more then that even if your just going against bots. Bots are stupid so i suggest with friends or other people to play with.\nGame needs some polishing game play wise. Im hoping the developers focus more on game play, rather then graphics soon, because graphics are not bad by any means. Balance is a little weird. Being able to make bug tanks that are hard to kill int eh beginning of the game feels wrong. \n\nOverall Thoughts. This game is amazing despite bugs in it. Me and my friends have only played a very short time but are already looking forward to see what else comes up with this game. FPS feels good, RTS is fun, and over game is amazing in it own right. If your planning to get this game, have friends to start off with, but if your feeling like you cant wait for that, there is a discord where you can find people. The game is worth it in my opinion as long as the developers keep up witht he game and make it better because it holds allot of potential already from what we have played. We are looking forward to more int he future.","timestamp_created":1609623596,"timestamp_updated":1609623596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwvt3C4vYCcb7uvwI="}
