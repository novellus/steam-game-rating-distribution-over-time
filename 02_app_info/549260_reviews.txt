[i]Alwa[/i] keeps it simple.  See those three life marks?  That's all you get for the whole game (though you can get a flask that automatically refills them on death), and you only get three spells, too.  I like that!  Too many widgets, gadgets, and collectables get on my friggin' nerves these days.  If you're up for a slow-mo, exploration-based adventure in a land of 8-bit purity, this is your ticket.","timestamp_created":1610033029,"timestamp_updated":1610033029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571020007133483887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+Mvc7vYCdoKmwQI="}
