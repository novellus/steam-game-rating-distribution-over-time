    review: 'Hey, dont know about the game yet, just started it. But had to write
      about the dlc. It doesn''t work at the time I write this, but there is an alternate
      file to get from the discussions part of the game. I guess it is from a friend
      of the developer, it works just fine. So the dlc works is what I am saying.
      Nice game so far!
