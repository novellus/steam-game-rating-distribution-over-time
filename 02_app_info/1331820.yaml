    about_the_game: "The Yak-9 was the first model in the most mass-produced family\
      \ of the WWII Soviet fighters - with its many modifications the total amount\
      \ of units produced reached 16,769. The work on the new long-range recon and\
      \ fighter plane began in the Yakovlev design bureau during Spring 1942 and it\
      \ resulted in the creation of Yak-7DI, which was adopted by the VVS as early\
      \ as August 6th of that same year under the designation Yak-9. The new model\
      \ had a boosted M-105PF engine, a lighter wing of composite structure, and the\
      \ lower spine with a bubble canopy that significantly improved the rearward\
      \ visibility. In comparison to the earlier Yak-7b, the armament was reduced\
      \ to one nose-mounted 12.7mm UBS MG and one 20mm SHVAK engine-mounted cannon\
      \ firing through the propeller hub.<br><br>The mass production of the new fighter\

      \ has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with a shared control lever. This\
      \ means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel\
      \ brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the\
      \ other.<br></li><li>Fuel gauges are installed on the left and right wing fuel\
      \ tanks, outside of the cockpit. Less than 25l of fuel remaining in the wing\
      \ tanks or the central feeder tank (10 liters capacity) are not measured.<br></li><li>The\

    short_description: Yak-9 proved itself as very maneuverable and easy to control
      fighter, earning the love and respect of many Soviet pilots along with volunteer
      French from the Normandie Niemen fighter regiment.

    review: "I own every Yak in the game currently (as of January 2021), barring the\
      \ Yak-1B. \n\nThe Yak-9 Series 1 is the best handling of all the Yaks; and while\
      \ I can't say it's even better than the 1B with personal experience, I can say\
      \ it's better on paper (turn speed, climb rate). \n\nIt is a rather viceless\
      \ aircraft. You have to try to stall it, by clumsy stick inputs. It turns very\
      \ easily and will out-turn every plane in the game aside from Spitfires and\
      \ Hurricanes; and against these, it can't be defeated in a turn, but rather\
      \ forces a stalemate. \n\nAs a virtual pilot who enjoys dogfighting and light\
      \ planes with crisp handling, the Yak-9 has just barely replaced the Bf 109-F4\
      \ as my favorite pure dogfighter in the game. \n\nThe only drawback is the low\
      \ ammunition count; which is a problem in all Russian planes. I'd suggest using\
      \ the alternate gun sight available: the iron ring one. This was used in real\
      \ life, if I'm not mistaken, because Russian reflector sights of the period\
      \ were of spotty quality. Indeed, I don't care much for the Russian reflectors\
      \ in the game either. I find the iron sights easier to aim with at close range\
      \ and deflection shooting, in the latter case because of the clearer sight picture.\
      \ \n\nFor people who can't decide between this Yak-9 and the 9T (the one with\
      \ the 37mm cannon), I can say the Series 1 is the better flyer, while the 9T\
      \ is the better killer; the 9T's handling is degraded by the weight of the cannon,\
      \ so that it's similar in performance to older Yak variants."
