So this DLC is very short but on some points a bit harder than the base game and uses puzzles that are a bit off , they tried a few new things there. Keep in mind that I run into multiple smaller bugs but nothing to big. If you like Oddworld and want a little bonus content, then I see no reason why to not buy it. It is very cheap.\n3 â‚¬ = 1 Hour of Playtime","timestamp_created":1601341955,"timestamp_updated":1601341955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u+Pa6/QCcevepAI="}
