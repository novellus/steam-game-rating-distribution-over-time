    review: 'The Office is an ok Time Management game. It somehow lacks personality.
      I also really hated the big heads. They should''ve used cartoony sprites instead
      of this semi-realistic look. It would''ve looked better in every single way.
      But I do like the genre though, so I can''t say it''s a bad game. They''re great
      games for small periods of time.
