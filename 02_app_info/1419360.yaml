    about_the_game: You uncover an ancient artifact that grants you telekinetic powers,
      and in doing so awaken its guardians to prove your worth as its wielder. <br><br>Hyper
      Psychic Gauntlets is an unorthodox VR bullet hell where you have nothing but
      two telekinetic gauntlets to defend yourself against the guardians of the temple.
      Dodge lasers, deflect bullets and throw around enemies as you prove you're worthy
      as the wielder of the gauntlets. Between split second thinking  deciding whether
      to dodge or deflect and the constant movement needed to weave yourself around
      lasers and bullets, you'll be drowning in sweat by the time you take off your
      headset.<br><br> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1419360/extras/HPGTitle1_6.png?t=1607014411"
      /><br>There's no limit on how many objects you can hold at once, as long as
      it's within your ray, you can grab it.<br><br> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1419360/extras/Test14.gif?t=1607014411"

      /><br>Rise the rankings as you play through 4 stages, 2 boss fights and 2 endless
      mode stages. Normal mode is where you'll really be flailing your arms around
      feeling the adrenaline but if you don't like dying constantly each stage has
      it's own Casual mode with a different spawnset. And I should probably mention
      this now, but both the guardians and you die in one hit, so be prepared to die
      a lot.<br><br><br><br><br> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1419360/extras/LIVBorder3.png?t=1607014411"

    review: 'Such a fun take on the typical stationary bullet hell VR game.


      Duck, dive, and dodge hundreds of volleys of bullets and laser beams as you
      grab and smash whatever you can.


      Will make your knees hurt as well as make you feel like a bad ass.'
