Fair enough, but I wish EULA were required to be directly available on dlc steam pages for transparency.\n\nSo for those that do not know:\n\nSome artists will allow you to use the steam dlc resources for other game engines or have a different EULA depending on the storefront. For that reason, I do not recommend this product FROM STEAM. This product is available through other stores where the artist provides more flexibly for devs within the shrink-wrapped EULA agreement.\n\nPurchasing from another store may allow you to use it in rpg makers AND more. If I ever notice the time fantasy steam EULA change I would revise the review as I would recommend Time fantasy, just not from steam. \n\nMany devs like to use different game engines just as an artist might like to use various graphic design software.","timestamp_created":1601229848,"timestamp_updated":1601229848,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3I+v6PQCe5G9pAI="}
