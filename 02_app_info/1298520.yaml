    review: 'First of all .. this game is EARLY ACCESS.


      After playing through the first boss and the little of the story that followed
      after, then I got a screen of text in Spanish (even tho I had selected English)
      mentioning "beta" ..


      That alone is a refund reason enough as it isn''t mentioned in the description
      that this is a WIP.


      - "Despite being an adventure game it is not linear"

      But there is just one path to take, even responding to the dialoges differently
      or even skipping dialoges forced me to take the same path.


      - Control scheme is unpolished, switching between keyboard and mouse only controlls


      - Time continues when you talk, so you can face starvation or get attacked while
      in dialoge, and if you get pushed away from what triggered the dialoge then
      you are stuck until death/reset.


      - There is a save file selection, but never came across a option to save the
      game. The esc menu had one, but using any option there would just flash a box
      briefly, and the checkpoints just let you continue from them, they don''t save
      the game.


      - The hitbox for the rock you get to throw to remove obstracles, in most cases
      it completely ignores the collision


      That is the main problems I have with the game.. the rest of my list will be
      sent to the creator.


      My total playtime was 1.3 hours, because I stopped to write down all the flaws
      I came over, if you just play the game then it might be shorter then that ..


      Will rewrite this when the game have been polished a bit more,'
