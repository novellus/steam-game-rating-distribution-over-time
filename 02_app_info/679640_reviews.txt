These games just somehow move slower, offer less response, and are less impressive than the old games that inspired this collection.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTiDwfKC4iM\n\nI can't help but feel like this developer made this collection only in hopes of a quick and easy cash grab and I'd love to ask he himself if he enjoys playing these games over the original classics.\n\nIt breaks my heart to score this collection so low as I am an old avid Commodore 64 fan from the 80s myself.  I Scored this game at a sad 41% and trust me that was a generous score.\n\nMy Recommendation Instead:  Avoid this first collection and buy this 2nd collection:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/751680/C64__AMIGA_Classix_Remakes_Sixpack_2/\nThis developers 2nd collection of C64 & Amiga games is a night and day difference from this 1st collection and made my Zaxtors Indie Gold series with a staggering 93% score!","timestamp_created":1599184149,"timestamp_updated":1599189206,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513183414936065674","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv9jGq/QCdq/RnwI="}
