The endless mode is a good challenge and perfect for a side window type of game to have open. Love the new perspectives from these smart well designed twists on games you know. The design is just right presentation-wise as well, with the addition of the arcade elements and the pixel-graphics look.","timestamp_created":1608951404,"timestamp_updated":1608951404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501753389835357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3sK+zvYCcoqgvQI="}
