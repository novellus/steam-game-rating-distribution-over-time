I'm sure the change in gameplay is not to a lot of people's taste, and it is not as great as the first one. Yes, it's very slow-paced. Yes, the ending is a bit odd and not at all what I was expecting (though I would argue that it does connect to the first game and line up with the hints in this one just fine). But I had a lot of fun with it.\n\nI think if you go into it expecting a mirror of the first game, you'll be disappointed. On the other hand, if you think you'd enjoy a walking simulator with a creepy horror atmosphere, no jump scares, and a mission to tease out every clue you can about the spirits, their lives and their deaths, then it's well worth a playthrough.","timestamp_created":1609753639,"timestamp_updated":1609753639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4heey5vYCd+qrwAI="}
