The gameplay was very clunky and unsatisfying. The graphics are good and it looks promising, but still needs a lot of work. A pre-alpha demo you can buy on Steam, seemingly abandoned by the developers (released in 2018). \n\nThere are much better Streets of Rage inspired beat Â´em ups worth playing in my opinion. \nDisappointed, I can only recommend against buying Streets Ablaze in its current state. \n\nIf however they were to significantly improve it in future, I do see potential for a good game. At the time of this writing the gameplay is unfortunately just too awkward and unpolished to call it that.","timestamp_created":1594508247,"timestamp_updated":1594508979,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.634316742420196533","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4s4WJoPMCcfzVlAI="}
