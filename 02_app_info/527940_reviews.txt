The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu. Please do note that this is an old game, it might not play well on wide screen monitors in full screen mode; due to the game's format.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are no game difficulty modes to choose from.\n\nThe notebook keeps tracks of the progression in the game. Such as story events and clues.\n\nThere is no interactive map in the game. The player has to remember where to go in the game.\n\nThere is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place. The inventory panel is stationary.\n\nThe hidden object scenes consist of the following: Traditional word lists; Find \"x\" amount items. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interaction.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.\n\nThere are twelve different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. All the achievements do come with some requirements that need to be completed in order for them to be unlocked. These are in-game achievements only.\n\nSince this is a collector's edition game, there is a bonus chapter, but it can be accessed only after the main story is completed.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThere are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Game Strategy Guide; Screen Saver; Soundtracks; Concept Art and Wallpapers. Most of these extra features can be accessed only after the entire game is completed.\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1547325854,"timestamp_updated":1599943545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.602213203907012939","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iqKEwvQCdJeauAE="}
