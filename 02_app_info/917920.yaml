      \ without simply frustrating or misleading them, let alone being smug or hostile\
      \ is a hell of a tall order, and most games would either fail or not even try.\
      \ The Other Half bites off exactly as much as it can chew, and thoughtfully\
      \ sprays crumbs across the, er, the table.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/12/07/unknown-pleasures-business-time\"\

      I was overhearing a man\u2019s descent into madness, and how one woman\u2019\
