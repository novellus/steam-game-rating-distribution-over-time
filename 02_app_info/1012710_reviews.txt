It really has a dead feel, not much excitement for capturing objectives, the best part of the game for me was throwing my weapon lol. To the developers if this game, I would go for a man vs machine approach. Maybe make the robots smart and work together using vehicles and stuff, and having us players team up to fight the robots capture bases and that kind of stuff. Keep at it I'll check out your updates as they come out, also the looting system could use some tweaking in my opinion. But for now my review is save your money buyers.","timestamp_created":1554337445,"timestamp_updated":1554337445,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.590316534042358398","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1554386663,"developer_response":"Hello, thanks for the feedback!
