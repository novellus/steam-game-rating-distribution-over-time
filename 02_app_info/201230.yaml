    review: "Everquest 2 is the biggest mmo ever made to date. The amount of content\
      \ in this game is overwhelming. You can play for many, many hundreds of hours\
      \ and barely scratch the surface of all the different things that you can do,\
      \ see and achieve.\n\nOf course there is the straght-line play, go from lvl\
      \ 1 to 100 as fast as possible then do raids for great gear and accumulate riches\
      \ that will allow you to play as a subscriber without paying real money, thats\
      \ a perfectly viable playstyle, but there is an ocean of content that you will\
      \ miss. In this game, it is worthwhile to visit all zones, levels and content\
      \ during any time and level of your character. The whole world is being put\
      \ to use, not just a small percentage as you level or when you reach max level.\n\
      \nThere is a lot of easily available filler content, mostly aimed for fast leveling\
      \ or casual fast play, but there are also tons of hidden stuff and elaborate\
      \ quests for the players that are more curious .. for players that can stop\
      \ dead in their tracks, and just take one moment to look around them. Players\
      \ who like exploring and investing more effort into straying off quest lines\
      \ or not simply just power level.\nMore often than not, the rewards for pursuing\
      \ some of the strange questlines found in remote areas are quite surprising\
      \ and with such an immense, ambient sprawl of activities to do from the moment\
      \ you start and all the way up to max level - is to me what an \"MMO\" or \"\
      Open World\" should be.\n\nIndeed, not only is the game very lengthy but also,\
      \ broad. Playing Everquest 2 is like getting lost in a jungle. No matter where\
      \ you decide to go and what you decide to do, you will find adventure....or\
      \ adventure will find you as the case may be.\n\nThis game offers lots of content\
      \ for every taste.\nYou want to solo from start to finish and still get great\
      \ gear and do dungeons? No problem, game offers plenty of ways to do just that.\n\
      You like direction and hand-holding, gps quests and casual stuff? Lots of that\
      \ in the game.\nYou like to break your head with difficult quests that require\
      \ some inquisitive thinking, time and dedication? Unforgiving challenges that\
      \ makes the rewards all the more worthwhile? Hundreds of hours worth of this\
      \ kind of content.\nYou like crafting? You'll be overwhelmed, crafting is insane\
      \ in this game, its more content in the EQ2 crafting sphere alone than in the\
      \ whole worlds of other mmos and depending on your attentiveness while crafting\
      \ - the quality of the product and outcome will reflect in your performances.\
      \ For instance, if you fail to flatten a bubble in the iron of a blade or miss\
      \ out on cooling it in time, the blade may turn out Crude in quality.\n\nThe\
      \ character progression and roleplaying features has no equal. Just the alternate\
      \ achievement skill-trees alone are way and beyond the whole progression system\
      \ of other games. You decide how you divide the experience gained between the\
      \ character leveling and the AA (alternate advancement) level, which works like\
      \ talent points. There are over 400 talents and lots of trees to work out as\
      \ you go. Personally i like to channel all the exp into AA, that way i get quite\
      \ overpowered at low levels, which for me is quite satisfying. \nFor instance\
      \ you can be a very powerful level 20 with lots of talents, who can tackle higher\
      \ levels simply because your character is much more trained than a higher level\
      \ might be. There are many parameters to your characters. Skills has to be trained\
      \ to perfect techniques ect. \nSpeaking of talents though, there are different\
      \ talent trees in every class too and you can earn talents from all kinds of\
      \ directions, from solving puzzles to simply exploring.\n\nThis game was never\
      \ very appealing to the younger players, nor to the ones that only come to talk\
      \ random stuff in world chat or expect the game to be like most other mmo out\
      \ there, as is the case in other mmo that are different from the typical themepark\
      \ mmo.\nAs a result the game seems quiet and tranquil, which for me is a good\
      \ thing. I dont need a lot of players jumping around aimlessly in the start\
      \ areas and talking smack ( i call them cheerleaders because thats what they\
      \ really do in these games). Sadly there are a lot of players who need these\
      \ cheerleaders to consider the game as being \"alive\" and not \"dead\", or\
      \ every mmo game in existence to run the exact same way Wildstar or World of\
      \ Warcraft does - many whom i assume has rated this video game as Negative on\
      \ Steam.\n\nThere is a lot of poison thrown around on the internet regarding\
      \ this game, many of whom I have opened conversation with only to discover they\
      \ know not what they talk about or have even played the game to any extent at\
      \ all.\n\nThere are a lot of big and hyped features being released in the more\
      \ popular mmo titles today, that have existed in this game since the very beginning\
      \ .. it is a shame because many players will miss out on one of the most underrated,\
      \ best mmos ever made, way ahead of it's time and definitely the biggest one\
      \ yet.\n\n\n- Scrawny old veteran since 2005."
