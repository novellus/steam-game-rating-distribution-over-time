    review: It's a lot of fun, if you've ever played this kind of game. The interface
      is OK though it has some quirks. Best part about it is the words selections
      are actually fun - it's hard to describe how that is so. Let me try ... sometime
      some of the words on a particular puzzle are related, and sometimes if you're
      really lucky you can figure out the common theme from that particular puzzles
      title.  I bought this game for 49 cents on sale and have spent many hours on
      it. It must be one of the best gaming values I've bought on Steam. It's a great
      game to fire up if you just want to kill a few minutes.  I've completed most
      of the puzzles in under 5 minutes each. Occasionally I come across a puzzle
      that takes up to 20 minutes because it's hard to start it when the board is
      mostly blanks.
