The soundtrack and visuals were excellent for its time, and they make playing the game feel very relaxing... However, there were several points in the game that legitimately spooked me, made me breathe very heavily, and feel fear as if my life was in danger... This is a good thing though, and part of the appeal of the game! It's not a horror game, but the emotions this game will make you feel is worth the experience!\n\nThe puzzles in this game are definitely a challenge and can be difficult to figure out, but its extremely rewarding when you do solve them. The type of person who will enjoy this game is someone who likes thinking and who is also very patient. (Tip: If you get stuck, try reading the journal for clues) This game is a hidden gem that shouldn't be overlooked!","timestamp_created":1598272277,"timestamp_updated":1598272277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oPGckPQCc8+7nQI="}
