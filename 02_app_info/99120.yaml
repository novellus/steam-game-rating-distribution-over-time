      great atmosphere

      great PanzerDragoonesque Moebius graphic style

      winks for all who know the 1981 original (shield, "Yar screen" boss)


      -

      no full screen option available

      only a small window on a 1080p screen

      1981 comic on 1080p monitor unreadable

      no key-rebind possible (I have no original 360 controller here)

      repetetive enemies


      thoughts:

      hopefully the devs will adjust the minor flaws (key-rebind, full-screen), this
      is a great rail-shooter!'
