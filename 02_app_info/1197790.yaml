    about_the_game: <strong>Highscore Hunter Hodgepodge</strong> is a 4-in-1 game
      collection featuring 4 highscore hunting games (just in case the name didn't
      make it obvious enough). You compete with everyone around the globe to put your
      name on top - I don't think I need to describe online highscores to you, tho,
      you know what this is. This compilation of games collects three previously released
      games, two of which were exclusive to console!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1197790/extras/logo.png?t=1586612828"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>About the games:</strong></h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>A.C.E.
      - Alien Cleanup Elite</strong><br>Randomly generated content lies at the base
      of this run and gun shooter. Think 90s arcade action with guns, aliens, grenades
      and bosses. Yeah, just like that. This game was previously released on the Nintendo
      Wii U.<br><br></li><li><strong>Gravity+</strong><br>By pressing a button you
      can rotate gravity into one of four directions. Find the key and head to the
      exit in this exciting puzzle game. Your robot cannot fight so don't touch the
      hazards! This game was previously released on the Nintendo Wii U and is available
      for the first time on PC in this compilation!<br><br></li><li><strong>Pincube</strong><br>What
      do you get when you cross Breakout with Pinball but use cubes instead of balls?
      You get Pincube. Because the name says it all. This is a new game, previously
      unreleased!<br><br></li><li><strong>Rorrim</strong><br>This two-screened adventure
      tests your dexterity. You have to guide both princesses in both the real world
      and the mirror world to the exit at the same time. Sounds easier than it is.
      This game was previously released on the Nintendo Wii U and is available for
      the first time on PC in this compilation!</li></ul><br>Highscore Hunter Hodgepodge
      has something for everyone who likes old-school highscore hunting. Can you make
      it to the top?<br><br>-------------------------------<br>Controller Information:<br>Due
      to limitations with the engine, some controllers, for example 8bitdo gamepads,
      may not work properly. There is, unfortunately, nothing I can do about that.
      Should you have any trouble with your gamepad, maybe try another gamepad or
      use the keyboard. I apologize for the inconvenience.
