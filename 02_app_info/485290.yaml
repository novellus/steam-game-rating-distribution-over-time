    review: "[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]\n\n\"Vermillion Watch: Moorgate Accord\"\
      \ Collector\u2019s Edition is a Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure game. The game\
      \ was developed by Eipix Entertainment and published by Big Fish Games Studio.\n\
      \n\"Moorgate Accord\" is the first episode of \"Vermillion Watch.\"\n\nSince\
      \ this is a collector's edition, it comes with extra features that are not available\
      \ in its counterpart; the standard edition.\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\
      \nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely\
      \ done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\
      \nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio\
      \ is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's\
      \ option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are four different difficulty game\
      \ modes to choose from: Trainee; Inspector; Chief and Custom.\n\nThere is an\
      \ interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel between each\
      \ location quickly. It also indicates that there are tasks that can be completed\
      \ at certain locations. The interactive map is automatically given at the start\
      \ of the game.\n\nThere is a padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory\
      \ panel in place to make it stationary.\n\nThere are interactive items in the\
      \ game. Some of these interactive items may require extra components before\
      \ they can be interacted with. All interactive items are marked with a symbol\
      \ in one of the corners.\n\nThe hidden object scenes consist of the following:\
      \ Picture items; Find 'x' amount items; Fragmented items; Traditional word list.\
      \ Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interactions.\
      \ Most of the hidden object scenes can be replayed in the game's extra feature\
      \ section.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to\
      \ skip any of them. Most of the puzzles can be replayed in the game's extra\
      \ feature section.\n\nThere is a collectible in the game: Signs. They are scattered\
      \ throughout the game for the player to find.\n\nThere are morphing objects\
      \ (beyond objects.) They can be found in the hidden object scenes only.\n\n\
      Since this is a collector's edition, there is a bonus chapter, but it can be\
      \ accessed only after the main story is completed.\n\nThere are fourteen different\
      \ achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements\
      \ does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can\
      \ be unlocked. These achievements are in-game only.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThere\
      \ are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Bonus Hidden Objects; Bonus\
      \ Puzzles; Soundtracks; Wallpapers; Concept Art; Souvenir Room and Game's Strategy\
      \ Guide. Most of these extra features can be accessed only after the entire\
      \ game is completed.\n\nThere are nine different trading cards to collect. Only\
      \ four of those trading cards are given out by the game. There are several ways\
      \ to get the rest of the trading cards: Purchased from the Steam's Community\
      \ Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and its Booster Pack Creator.\n\n\
      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay\
      \ value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's\
      \ full price value."
