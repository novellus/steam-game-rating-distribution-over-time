Depending on which people survived or you rescued or you killed, you have completely different events. Those who write that Part 2 is too short didn't understand that there can be many different subplots depending on who survives and who doesn't. Not surprisingly, there is only one main plot strand. Different main plot strands can only appear in the last part at the earliest, otherwise the story would be too branched. \nI would buy this game also for 15 Euro, since it offers much more freedom of action and depth than for example \"The walking Dead\". \nMaybe it's also due to my perfectionism, but to play through part 1 and 2 once(!) (with several attempts) I needed 50 hours and I enjoyed each of them. \nI am curious about part 3.","timestamp_created":1579194034,"timestamp_updated":1579194034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525090813636779785","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9ZTT1+8CfrGk7AE="}
