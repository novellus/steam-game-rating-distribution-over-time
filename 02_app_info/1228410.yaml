    about_the_game: "<strong>This is a platform puzzle game related to our &quot;Perspective&quot;\
      \ vision.</strong><br><br>There are a lot of games about<strong> &quot;Vision&quot;</strong>,\
      \ such as &quot;Monument Valley&quot;, &quot;Fez&quot;, or &quot;Superliminal&quot;.\
      \ But I believe that even compared with these famous games, this game <strong>&quot;Watch&quot;</strong>\
      \ is still &quot;different&quot;.<br><br>You might say, it looks like &quot;Fez&quot;.\
      \ Yes, &quot;Fez&quot; is an important source of inspiration for this game,\
      \ which uses the same &quot;camera rotation mechanism&quot;.<br><br>But what's\
      \ significantly different from &quot;Fez&quot; is that it adds <strong>&quot;Perspective&quot;</strong>.<br><br>&quot;Perspective&quot;\
      \ is the soul of this game, and it is also the soul of our eyes. With it, our\
      \ eyes have the feeling of <strong>&quot;Depth&quot;</strong>. For example,\
      \ the building in the distance is as high as the tea cup nearby, one hand nearby\
      \ looks large enough to hold a Boeing 747, and with one jump, we can cross the\
      \ mountain top in the distance, and so on.<br><br><strong>&quot;Perspective&quot;</strong>\
      \ is usual but magical. It makes our life more colorful.<br><br>In this game,\
      \ you will use &quot;Perspective&quot; to overcome various difficulties, such\
      \ as, jump over a huge pit, or jump up to the top of a building.<br><img src=\"\

      \ /><br><br>You also need to avoid seemingly inescapable obstacles, or avoid\
      \ lasers that can really kill you at the touch, or step on massive and dangerous\
      \ robots, and let light travel from here to there ( sometimes you are the light\
      \ yourself ).<br><br>In this game, you will use various tools, which can better\
      \ assist you to use the<strong> &quot; Perspective&quot;</strong> to overcome\
      \ difficulties, such as,<strong> &quot;X&quot;</strong> that can move the camera\
      \ horizontally.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1228410/extras/\u8BA9\
      \u955C\u5934\u6C34\u5E73\u79FB\u52A8\u7684X.gif?t=1607324819\" /><br><br>There\
      \ are two other tools I didn't say, and how to use them depends on your intelligence.<br><br>In\
      \ addition to the these tools, you will also need to use some props, such as\
      \ a wooden box or something like it, you have to push them or take them to the\
      \ right place.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1228410/extras/\u5F88\
      \u666E\u901A\u7684\u6728\u7BB1\u5B50.gif?t=1607324819\" /><br><br>You will encounter\
      \ more strange boxes, green buckets that can be picked up and hold water, and\
      \ fans that can let you fly into the sky. Remember the robot mentioned earlier?\
      \ It's also a good combination to have it with the box. And, maybe you want\
      \ try this strange &quot;Hotair-Balloon&quot;. <br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1228410/extras/\u518D\

      .gif?t=1607324819\" /><br><br>Do you want to fill a bucket with just one drop\
      \ of water? Or let the sun light a cigarette? All these requires you to find\
      \ out in the game.<br><br>What if perspective and mirror are combined? Say,\
      \ A mirror from the &quot;Atlantis&quot;.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1228410/extras/\u6253\
      \u5F00\u4E00\u9762\u6765\u81EA\u4E9A\u7279\u5170\u8482\u65AF\u7684\u795E\u79D8\
      \u955C\u5B50.gif?t=1607324819\" /><br><br>Of course, mirrors don't have to be\
      \ flat, they can bring more interesting things, such as, conical mirror.<br><img\
      \ src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1228410/extras/\u5706\u9525\
      \u5F62\u72B6\u7684\u955C\u5B50.gif?t=1607324819\" /><br><br>and cylindrical\
      \ or pyramidal mirrors, which we call <strong>&quot;Anamorphsis-Art&quot;</strong>.<br><br>When\
      \ you solve all these puzzles, you will find that <strong>&quot;Perspective&quot;\
      \ </strong>is not only in our real life, but also in our fantastic ideas.<br><br>Some\
      \ puzzles are so hard that you may not be able to solve them at first. But please\
      \ don't underestimate yourself. You can pass all of the tests and finally come\
      \ to the house at the beginning of the game to understand the whole story.<br><br>The\
      \ story of the game itself is also a &quot;puzzle&quot;, at first it will be\
      \ confusing, but if you are not in such a hurry, please don't skip it easily.\
      \ <br><br>I wanted to put more GIF animations, but if I put too many, maybe\
      \ the store page can't be opened, and you can't see this description. So, if\
      \ you want to know more, please take a look at the 6 videos above. <br><br>I\
      \ hope you enjoy the game. Thank you.<br><br>(PS: Please don't ignore the dialogues\
      \ in the game. Sometimes, it may be the key to solve the puzzle.)"
