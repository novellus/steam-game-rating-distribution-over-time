My Curator name is \"Party Game Reviews,\" check it out for more of my reviews of similar party games. \n\nI was happy to try this game, because an 8 player split screen game sounds hectic and fun.  It was not.  Besides not all controllers working and some controllers that controlled two tanks simultaneously, it was no fun.  I did not enjoy the mechanics of the game, felt very sluggish and I kept getting stuck upside down.  Game needs a lot of work to be a decent playable game.  Cannot recommend this game, but if updates are released, I will check it out in the future again.","timestamp_created":1598553772,"timestamp_updated":1598554624,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgPrRmPQCeNSVngI="}
