It takes less than a minute into the game after leaving the first room before you meet your first branching path, and it is never televised ahead of time that one of these branches will leave you to the next chapter of the game.\n\nBut that's not it, in the first level alone there are at least half a dozen branches and by the half hour mark your main concern is not to follow the story along, but to roll the dice and pray to God that you've uncovered all \"side-branches\" before heading off to the next chapter, or else you're easily missing out a good third of the entire game.\n\nI also managed to get stuck on staircases more than once and also managed to go OOB in chapter 4. Not great experiences.\n\nLiterally the only two redeeming qualities about this game are the visuals and the soundtrack (the latter of which I actually sometimes I use as background music for reading horror/mystery books and I highly recommend picking up the OST).","timestamp_created":1608685297,"timestamp_updated":1608685297,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41rPHxvYCebmovAI="}
