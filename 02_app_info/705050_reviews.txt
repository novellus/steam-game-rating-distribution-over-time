It's a slow-mo, fps, zombie shooter that's just awful. From sound design, to gun play, etc. It's a game the should be free to play but even if it was you can't refund your time.","timestamp_created":1590048252,"timestamp_updated":1590048252,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhtyQm/ICcOWdiQI="}
