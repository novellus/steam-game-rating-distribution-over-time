    review: 'This a fairly simple time management game. Hire workers for resources,
      use resources for buildings, etc. The ninja aspect is just a theme, you are
      very much a manager and don''t have any direct control.


      If you want depth and complexity, this isn''t the game for you. But if you just
      want something to fiddle with for a few hours, you could do worse. It''s just
      a very basic tycoon game with a ninja theme.


      Full price ($5) is somewhat pushing the limit of what it''s worth, I''d suggest
      waiting for a sale or a coupon.
