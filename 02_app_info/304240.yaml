    review: "100% recommended!\n\nThis is an HD remaster of the fantastic 2002 Gamecube\
      \ REmake. \nIt's without a doubt the quintessential classic Resident Evil experience\
      \ and the benchmark for gaming remakes in general. \n\n\"REmake\" takes everything\
      \ there is to love about RE1 and the fixed camera era and improves it in every\
      \ way. \nCompared to original 1996 Resident Evil, you'll find that each main\
      \ area has been updated with new layouts, different puzzles and more detailed\
      \ environments. The script drops most of the campy dialog and takes on more\
      \ of a grounded approach. There's a new sub-plot that also introduces new locations\
      \ while providing lore. New gameplay mechanics have been added such as the \"\
      Crimson Heads\" and \"Defense Items\" which will change how you approach different\
      \ situations. The soundtrack is pretty damn good! Especially the more ambient\
      \ pieces that settle into the background and enhance the atmosphere. For replayability\
      \ you have a choice between Jill and Chris as always but there's also modes\
      \ such as Real Survival and Invisible Enemies to try out!\n\nIf you like slower\
      \ paced, atmospheric horror games with plenty of opportunities to explore and\
      \ item management then this game is 100% for you!\n\nI will warn you that this\
      \ game uses \"tank\" controls and fixed camera angles which can be difficult\
      \ for some players to get used to(especially if you're used to modern over the\
      \ shoulder games.) But, I assure you that they really are an integral part of\
      \ this game's feel and with a little but of time, you'll settle right in!\n\n\
