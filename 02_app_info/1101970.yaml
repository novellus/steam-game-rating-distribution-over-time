    review: '[b][u]TL;DR:[/u][/b] Supposedly "Released", but really still abandoned
      in an Early-Access state. Okay, I guess, but there are better choices out there.



      [b][u]Full review[/u][/b]


      The Focke-Wulf FW 190 A-8 is a late-war version of the classic FW 190 "short-nose"
      series. As modelled in DCS, the A-8 version can carry either 4x50kg bombs, a
      250kg bomb, a 500kg bomb or a droptank on the centre pylon. On each wing it
      can optionally carry a BR21 Werfegranate heavy rocket tube. For guns, it has
      2x machineguns and 4x 20mm cannons. The weapon variety makes it suitable for
      a numerous roles: interceptor, fighter, ground-attack and close air support.
      It is claimed to come with cluster munitions, but these don''t work (see below).
      There are different gun-ammunition loadouts but these make no difference. Tracers
      are not-synchronised across multi-player clients either - others will always
      see tracers when you fire... whether you have tracer ammunition or not. There
      are different types of the standard "SC" bombs, but they are just naming (internally,
      there is no difference).


      There are quite a few paintschemes, but the developers have stupidly put some
      of the non-historical ones available to all factions, which means that multiplayer
      servers can''t let you choose them (without someone picking one of the non-historical
      ones). Rather frustrating.


      The radial engine is rugged, but the performance is not stellar compared to
      the other WW2 aircraft. It can engage the Mk.IX, but will struggle against a
      P-47 or P-51. The other two available German aircraft are both better. The engine
      management is non-existent. Start it, go full throttle and just keep an eye
      on your fuel. What I find [i]really[/i] disappointing are the engine sounds.
      They don''t have that deep, rough, radial thud to them.


      Ground handling is good, although the wheel-lock takes some getting used to.
      When on the ground the aircraft rests back on its tail wheel. This puts the
      nose up into the air, making visibility poor (a common feature of many WW2 fighters).
      The wider wheel base and rugged landing gear make it more sturdy on landings
      than the Bf 109. Flight is nice and it has good roll rate. It is less prone
      to stalling than the D-9 variant. But it does has a heavy sink rate, so it can
      thump down a bit on landing.


      [b][u]Not complete[/u][/b]


      The big problem is that the module is not yet complete. The rockets are bugged.
      There is no engine damage. The advertised cluster weapons don''t work. There
      are problems with circuit-breakers not being correct or functioning. It is possible
      to move your head through the cockpit glass. There are graphics bugs in the
      3-D model.


      There was supposed to be the F-8 sub-variant too. But that is not yet available.
      At one point, they announced the G-8 as well as the F-8. But neither have materialised
      and the module was pushed out of "Early-Access" to a "Released" state without
      even fixing the bugs, let alone rolling out any variant.


      It comes with a 153-page PDF manual but it is weak in some sections (especially
      weapons). There are some really basic training missions. The instant-action
      missions pit you against jets, so they don''t count. There are no single-player
      campaigns for it at the time of writing, but the DCS mission editor is easy
      to use and I have made countless scenarios for myself and for co-op missions
      for my online squad. It''s not too heard to learn, but you are sort of on your
      own. YouTube and community manuals are not so good for this module, with cursory
      treatment only. Ask on the forums/discord/chats for help.


      [b][u]The WW2 context[/u][/b] : The FW 190 A-8 module is only the aircraft itself.
      You can fly it using the free Caucasus map. However, if you are looking to fly
      WW2 missions, you would need to get the WW2 Normandy Map and the WW2 Assets
      Pack. The map and assets can be purchased separately or, more cheaply, as a
      map+assets bundle. All the same, getting into DCS WW2 is quite expensive, so
      do some research first (see the next point!).


      [b][u]New to DCS?[/u][/b] : If you are reading this and have never flown in
      DCS before, be warned that this is a study-level simulator, not a game. (See
      my DCS review for details.) I''d recommend you try out the free TF-51D aircraft
      module before purchasing this module, so you know what level of detail to expect
      and the sort of handling you can expect with a WW2 tail-dragger.


      [b][u]Comparison with the FW 190 D-9[/u][/b] : Understandably, people wish to
      compare the A-9 to the D-9. Personally, I find the D-9 nicer. The sounds, graphics
      and feel are all better in the D-9. There are less bugs in the D-9 too. The
      A-8 is slightly easier to handle, but the performance is (as per history) not
      as good as in the D-9. The A-8 has a fixed gun-sight (the D-9''s is gyroscopic).
      The A-8 has slightly more weapon options, but many are not implemented. The
      main reason for the A-8 is just that it is a better historical match to the
      Normandy WW2 Map (which is really the only feasible WW2 map at the moment).


      [b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]


      The FW 190 A-8 is a rugged workhorse and okay to fly. But too many features
      are missing and the module seems to be abandoned now. If you are just looking
      for a nice WW2 aircraft to fly, the P-51D or FW 190 D-9 are better, more complete,
      choices. Curiously, when I reviewed the D-9, I wrote "if they implemented a
      short-nose variant, it would score 11/10". What I didn''t realise back then
      was how incomplete and lacklustre it would be. ED''s standards are not what
      they used to be.'
