    review: 'The game is almost good.  Hit boxes need improved.  I often have a round
      where I loose 4 or 5 shots because I shoot the ball through the same can over
      and over again, without it registering as a hit.  My score is also stuck, so
      I can not purchase any more types of balls to shoot.   Fix these two things
      and I will recommend this game and change my review.
