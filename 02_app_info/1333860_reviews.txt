No-one had the issues that you mentioned in the latest version. The menus have close buttons as well. Would you mind submitting them to our discord server with details, please? I will take a deeper look. Beside that, I haven't deleted any reviews. Reviews are very important to me as the game progress. You can check all the reviews. I responded to them all. If you haven't noticed, the first review of this game is a negative review which is in different language. So that proves that I don't delete reviews. Also you can come back after a few weeks to see if your review got deleted or not. If you still see your negative review then, please undo your false accusation. Thanks."}],"cursor":"AoJwhMLgyfUCcryfrAI="}
