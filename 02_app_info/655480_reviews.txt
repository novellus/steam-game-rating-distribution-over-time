The core mechanics are somewhat simple, but the variety that the game creates allows for fun and reward decision making. I also appreciate the way difficulty scales with success and losses, so I will always be playing at a difficulty which is correct for me. I have not yet gotten to very high difficulties, so I cannot say the game performs at that level.\n\nThis is a great value for a puzzle game.","timestamp_created":1609782439,"timestamp_updated":1609782439,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xdWg5/YCfbq6wAI="}
