My friends and I wanted to play some poker with each other online since we can't go out. But the majority of poker games on Steam are microtransaction trash, so this was ok. We were able to get a game setup and running. A little documentation would go a long way. Just know that you need to set your table up for the exact number of players you expect, and if someone wants to join later, or back out, you need to restart the server. \n\nThe biggest issue we found, is that it does not account for High card. If two players have a pair and one has a 5 high and the other has an ace high, it splits the pot. Also it won't count the ace as low card in a straight. These are some basic issues that I think could be fixed. For the price we got an evening of playing and having fun together, poker was really just something for us to do in the background while hanging out and for that it served its job. Just don't expect a super serious poker game, and know how to setup port forwarding going in.","timestamp_created":1586013468,"timestamp_updated":1586013468,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581749081611633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1p7xovECc+eG/gE="}
