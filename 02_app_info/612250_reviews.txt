You only move in the hub though so it doesn't really matter. [/i]\n\nThe good news is that the game does indeed work on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers. The bad news is that it works on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers. Yeah .... this is a bad game. It is not worth $4. I got it on sale for .99 cents and it's not even worth that. This should be free to play. Even then, I would give it a nuetral recommendation. There's just so many things wrong with this game. The idea is simple. Drawing guns and battle against AI or onine against other players. Okay, good luck finding anyone to gun duel with. \n\nSo you're stuck with the AI which isn't bad. Except everything else about the game. The simple act of grabbing your gun is quite the ordeal. You basically have to be looking at it to guarantee you can grab it. I just learned to blind shoot my opponent and anticipate the countdown to zero & draw. \n\nHow about it's an arm swinger where you can walk through any object? How about there's no interactions other than grabbing a few things. Well grabbing the beer is nice but guess what, the liquid stays inside the glass. You can grab some NPCs but not others. \n\nThere's a zombie horde mini-game after killing one of the wanted bandits in a duel. It's horrible. It seemed like an endless wave where you eventually run out of bullets. I was actually happy when it happened because I wanted to quit playing, uninstall the game, and never play it again. The duels are quickies. That leaves the rest of the mess to deal with and it's just not worth it. If this were free to play, I would give it a 5/10. \n\nRate 4/10. And my steam cards didn't drop either.","timestamp_created":1536274793,"timestamp_updated":1536275006,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwo4jI2OUCfMWUqgE="}
