Its pretty unbalanced compared to the base game which I absolutely loved. Your units are very weak, low HP low damage. The resurrection progress is very very long. Its better to just dismiss the unit and summon another one. Enemies come from everywhere, destroy your whole dungeon every 5 mins. Your horde just dies in the first 10 seconds of a fight. Its just stupid, dont bother to play or buy this DLC.","timestamp_created":1605857752,"timestamp_updated":1605857752,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvJal8vUCfI63rwI="}
