    review: "This is an \"on-rails wave shooter\" set in a flying pirate steampunk\
      \ ship.  Enemies fly around 180 degrees in front of you and the VR environment\
      \ is partially destructible.  You collect coins from defeated enemies, chests,\
      \ and destroyed environments/creatures.  You spend those coins to upgrade your\
      \ weapons or defenses or to heal.  You start with only one weapon and one shield\
      \ in each hand and you can also jump.  The only powerup is a health kit you\
      \ need to shoot first and also touch to get the healing effect.  \n\nThe graphics\
      \ are great, if cartoonish.  But they really fit well with the steampunk motif\
      \ this game was going for. Enemies looked nice as well.  The destructible enviroments\
      \ were also well done.  There's about 25 waves.  And I believe there's three\
      \ boss fights.  The first boss is terribly easy.  However, without upgrades,\
      \ I doubt the average gamer can finish the game.  But with just a few upgrades,\
      \ the game becomes boringly easy.  Game ran smoothly. Aiming seemed true (although\
      \ there's a laser upgrade that'll make that even easier).\n\nMy problem with\
      \ the game is that the whole coin mechanism seemed like an artificial way to\
      \ prolong the game.  You will probably need these upgrades to finish the game,\
      \ yet it takes quite a while before you get enough to get to the end unless\
      \ you're very skilled.  If you die, you will have to restart the level.  Worst\
      \ of all, once you get more than a few upgrades, it's just too easy.  \n\nThere's\
      \ also just not a lot of content.  I finished the game and even though there's\
      \ more upgrades, including a rocket launcher I can unlock, I just don't want\
      \ to play this game anymore.  Why would I want to do the levels over again,\
      \ being even more over-powered?  This game has a price tag of $14.99 and that's\
      \ just too much for this little content.  Even on sale for $7.49 I would have\
      \ a hard time justifying the price given how quickly you can beat the game.\
      \  \n\nThis is at most a $4.99 game.  It's a close call, but I just can't recommend\
      \ this game unless there's more updates.  I would love to see co-op (would be\
      \ fun for somebody to steer while somebody shoots.  Or to have one peason on\
      \ each side defending each side with maybe a stationary cannon needed for shooting\
      \ down big enemies.  Something to set this apart from much better wave shooters\
      \ out there.\n\nRate 4.5/10 close, but can't recommend at this price point"
