    review: "[h1]Absolutely phenomenal[/h1] Some of the best atmospheric tracks I've\
      \ ever heard ([i]PLEASE give a couple of the songs a listen, if you haven't\
      \ already[/i]).\n\nContains all 30 listed tracks in both the [.mp3] and [.wav]\
      \ versions. (in the [u].../Program Files(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Sanctum2/mp3[/u]\
      \ and [u].../common/Sanctum2/wav[/u] folders respectively).\n\nFor anyone confused\
      \ about with mismatched track numbers: \"[b]27. The End[/b]\" and \"[b]27. The\
      \ End [u](Extended)[/u][/b]\" are separate tracks. So \"[b]29. The Core Guardians[/b]\"\
      \ is the 30th track\n\n[b]Now with steam music player integration[/b] :D\n[quote=iCameHereForTheMusic]\n\
      11th Feb 2019\n[i][strike]Un[/strike]fortunately the soundtrack DOES [strike]NOT[/strike]\
      \ appear in the steam music player.[/i] [b]The files are fully functional by\
      \ themselves [/b] but [i] can[strike]not[/strike] [/i] be selected using the\
      \ steam music player. \n[strike][i]Please fix this.[/i] :C [/strike] \n[/quote]\n\
      It makes a new copy of them into .../Steam/steamapps/[u]music[/u]/Sanctum_2_Original_Soundtrack/mp3.\n\
      \nThe mp3s in the .../[u]common[/u]/sanctum2/mp3 folder will still be there\
      \ though, so you may want to delete them.\n\nIt is an astounding OST. With excellent\
      \ audio quality. I definitely recommend giving it a listen on youtube or something\
      \ even if you aren't planning on buying it."
