    review: It doesn't even work for my computer. I bought this game back in 2017,
      and I had an old one and thought it was just that. Skip ahead 3 years later,
      I happened to get a new Gaming Computer. So I thought, hey, maybe it'll work
      now that I have this computer. I downloaded it, and it just brought up pop ups
      about how my so called Display wasn't compatible. It booted up the game anyway,
      I went to start Story Mode and it just crashed. Can't even play the game. I
      thought it was a waste of money years ago, but now I clearly know even with
      this new computer that until they update this, which will probably never happen,
      this game was a waste of money. In the event they do fix this, maybe I might
      like it. I know I played Diner Dash games in the past on my Mom's Computer years
      ago back when I was a kid and enjoyed the hell out of them. They were fun. So
      I know I'd enjoy this game if it actually worked. Too bad it doesn't.
