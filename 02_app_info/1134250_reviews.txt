At first it is a clicking slog with minor challenge, in the middle it becomes a grind devoid of any challenge, towards the end it is unbearable, to be finished only if you've somehow become addicted. But why would you? Clickety-click without reason or rhyme gets you through easy peasy, no planning or skill needed at all - (provided you heed certain basic advice. If you don't heed that advice, on the other hand, you'll never make it out of the initial slog phase. The sad thing about this unbalanced mess is that with some thought or effort in level design it could have become a much, much better game. \n\nIf you do want to give it a try because the premise sounds intriguing - and it does - heed a third beginner's advice next to the progression of upgrades (more credits, still more credits, more fuel) and what to look for (fuel, then credits, ignore the rest) that is strangely rarely given, even though it is just as important - and breaks the game: never ever continue a level, always return to the base after reaching an exit. There is no reason at all not to.","timestamp_created":1601185289,"timestamp_updated":1601185289,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4spKF5/QCeLWtpAI="}
