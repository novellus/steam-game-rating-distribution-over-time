    review: I wanted to like this game because it appeared to be like an episode of
      Lost on a very low budget.  They also included permadeath to your crew so not
      everyone will come out alive as you escape the island.  Unfortunately, there's
      not a lot of meat to it.  Finding food at the beginning nearly killed the enjoyment
      for me.  I spent an extremely long amount of time trying to find food and I
      didn't want to sleep too much and let days pass so plants could grow again because
      I thought I may run out of time and get a bad ending.  Gathering food is just
      a time sink (like other things in the game) to pad your gameplay.  Once I got
      past that it became enjoyable again.  After this though I ran into a bad bug
      as when you arrive at the bunker and appear to walk back to camp you fall in
      a landslide which caused my game to crash.  I ended up under the water of a
      pool of blood or something with a lot of plants floating around me.  It was
      pretty wild looking floating around and I had to unclip from 3 different areas
      before I got back to normal ground.  When I was finally safe to go back to camp
      the baddie got me and permadeath for my character.  Since I encountered this
      bug and I didn't want to lose anyone I went and watched a video of the rest
      of the gameplay.  The bunker was just a large maze with no answers to the storyline
      as to what is going on.  You will find about 9 or so notes around the island
      that give you the gist of what happened in the past but you'd think the bunker
      would have gave us much more.  It is just a long maze to arrive at the end to
      just leave the bunker making it just another time padded event to further the
      gameplay.  After this you are just tasked with gathering a few other items before
      you can get off the island. No other storyline is revealed.  From here on it
      is just time padded events to complete while avoiding the baddie on the island
      and once you have gotten the items you get off the island with a small progress
      page to let you know how many days you survived and who survived with you.  No
      additional story is added to the end.  Overall it just makes the game feel empty
      and boring because it was mostly just a time sink to pad your gameplay before
      you head off the island.
