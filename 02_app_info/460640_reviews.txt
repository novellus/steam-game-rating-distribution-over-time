The former requires you to find the necessary parts and resources for repairs. The latter requires you to collect minerals and figure out the correct ratios to synthesize fuel.\n\nThe gathering is the meat of the game, and will have you piloting a rover/craft/thingy around three wastelands (plus a small tutorial map) on the surface of a planet [spoiler](post-apocalyptic Earth, obviously), using your nervous system, which is somehow fused to the craft from a distance[/spoiler].\n\nBesides resource hunting and trial-and-erring your way to a fuel recipe, Breached features a journal system to convey lore. At the start of each day, you trigger a journal entry, which frequently includes a hashtag that allows you to search for additional entries that share the tag. Those entries can also include another tag, leading to a whole web of entries, which the game then sorts by date.\nSome people may enjoy this kind of exposition puzzle -- I do not! Rather, I find it confusing and tedious -- if you have some good background lore, then feed it to me at the ideal pace rather than forcing me to try and make sense of it all, because I won't, I'll just give up on the story element.\n\nAs mentioned above, you have to fix the oxygenator and discover the recipe for fuel within eight days, and you can only do so much during a day. After beating the game once, you unlock a \"story mode\" that does not have this time constraint, but since there isn't really much of any replayability, I'm not sure what its point was.\nVisiting the surface to gather resources costs 40 fatigue points, analyzing parts for the oxygenator costs 30, attempting to synthesize fuel from minerals costs 10. However, not every day will give you the same amount of fatigue points to start with (I found there could be anywhere between 60 and 100), which undermines the management aspect of the game.\n\nIf you collide with an enemy [spoiler](an electromagnetic anomaly)[/spoiler], your trip to the surface is cut short and you lose all the resources gathered that trip [spoiler](you suffer a severe shock which severs your nervous system's bond with the surface craft)[/spoiler]. If this happens, don't even think about saving the wasted fatigue points via alt+f4 -- the devs ensured the game saves immediately when you do that.\n\nThe control scheme is very minimalistic (accelerate, decelerate, rotate), which is defeated by input delay and responsiveness. Because of your enormous inertia, it is very difficult not to overshoot your target and go careening off of cliffs or into enemies. On its own, this challenge could be seen as a feature; however the sensitivity to your commands also varies constantly, coinciding with stuttering and frame drops.\nThe result is a constant struggle to balance overcorrection and undercorrection, all the while becoming increasingly nauseated by the ever changing frame rate and blurring (with motion blur turned off).\n\nOnce in a while, you will not be able to accelerate at all, and will need to stand still for a minute, change some resolution settings, or sometimes even relaunch the game. There also exists a very real chance that you will randomly fall through the map, crashing your game, or -- if you're lucky -- your Steam client.\n\nFinally, don't even bother about the achievements, because they are bugged and don't drop.","timestamp_created":1605969108,"timestamp_updated":1605975909,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.610996425151824951","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qPTn9fUCdYzXrwI="}
