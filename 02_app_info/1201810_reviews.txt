Now, I didn't cross-reference the original game, but the first few - those for learning the basic mechanic if one hasn't played the original - are likely the same, or as close as not to matter. Indeed, the first 20-odd puzzles are all so simplistic as to not be worth counting for those who have played the original. There are a further dozen mid-game puzzles where new mechanics are introduced which are likewise filler - one click to solve, no opportunity to get it wrong - puzzles.\n\nBut there is further disappointment. A lot of the puzzles simply have their boards extruded, but they remain 2D. Yes, the piece is on a different level, but rotate the board to look down on it from above and it's no different than the original. (Side note disappointment, the rotation mechanism is limited by the Z axis and a hard floor; there isn't full freedom to look at the puzzle from every direction.)\n\nOf the 70 levels, 7 are flat-portal puzzles, introducing the portal mechanism; one is an absurdly simplistic portal onto another surface. In effect, of 70 , only 17 are real 3D unlock-the-king puzzles. Less than half of those are in any way challenging. A few are nicely tricky. But there is so much fluff in this game that it's hard to justify the price, even with it being so low.","timestamp_created":1608982160,"timestamp_updated":1608982160,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqOyzz/YCdrCtvQI="}
