The graphics are decent and the environment is immersive to the point of saturating glare, just like Caribbean beaches. The character direction seems to be story driven, so there is no character creation. The main character seems to be some sort of tribal dude and the opening screen describes the basic plot with terrible voice narration (serously guys, get a sound booth or just make it text).\n\nThe controls are the standard WASD and the devs are working on the controls. At one point,  I hit a key that threw a grenade at my feet and I died. At another point, I hit a bug and it froze my character's pose. Restarting the game fixed it.\n\nSaving seems to be done automatically at checkpoints, like discovering settlements/towns/camps. I haven't crashed to desktop yet, but I haven't played that long either. \n\nI hope the developers add in icons for wind direction and speed because some of these ships are practically flying by, only to suddenly stop, dead in the water.\n\nThe game world is open for exploration and there doesn't appear to be any linear restrictions on where the player can go. An intresting function the player can do while jumping is holding Space to deploy this glider thing. I thought it was cheesy at first, untill I realized I could jump off some steep cliffs and parachute to safety. There are no survival functions, such as eating or sleeping. NPCs do not have much life yet as all of them are standing around waiting for the player to talk to them. \n\nI'm giving this a thumbs-up for now because my initial impression is positive. I'll return to edit my review later. If I have to change it to thumbs-down and loose my helpful votes, then so be it. I just hope Sail and Sacrifice doesn't turn out like Blue Horizon.\n\nUPDATE: 8/30/2020\nThe developer abandoned the game.","timestamp_created":1533412567,"timestamp_updated":1598817988,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553072631359100342","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2s2+oPQCepTMpwE="}
