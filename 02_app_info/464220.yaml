    review: 'Wow. The description about greatly improved mobility is very accurate.
      This thing can MOVE. It''s highly useful for running around missions that can
      beat themselves and just grabbing weapon and armor drops.


      Not that great for actual combad though, due to it''s short weapon range. Unless
      you like to kite around large groups of ground bugs, spraying them in the face
      the whole time.'
