    review: 'A hazy, empty, open world with almost nothing to do.

      There is a boss to fight about every five minutes or so with nothing but interminable
      walking in between.

      Combat is a slog with bullet sponge bosses and no complexity.

      The only thing I like here is that the enemies get dismembered but even that
      gets old after you do it three or four times.

      Avoid.
