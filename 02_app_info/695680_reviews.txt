I picked out this one expecting to have some fun in a winter themed setting and play through maybe a quarter of it before getting bored. I’m not bored yet.\n\nThe mapmaking is absolutely phenomenal. Even working within the constrained theme of a forest in winter, almost every location feels unique. There are endless expanses of ice shelf, a dramatic kilometer wide crater containing its own environment, kettle ponds and frozen swamps that are all distinct from each other, and forgotten settlements half reclaimed by nature. The changing light over the course of the in-game day adds even more visual variety to the map than the other DLCs. This place is a pleasure just to walk through.\n\nThe storytelling is unusually good. The actress playing the DLC’s expedition leader is wonderful. Her mixture of friendly and sardonic commentary makes for a fun voice in your ear throughout the main quests. The in-game lore flavor texts, side missions, and occasional bits of human activity on the map are all written/designed in a way that really do make the player feel like they’re in a place at a forgotten corner of the world with stories and culture all its own. You’re one dot in a continuum across thousands of years. Not many games pull such a feeling of place off.\n\nOn the negative side of things, it’s a shame that the DLC doesn’t include any new guns. The Mosin-Nagant from one of the weapons pack is fun to bring to its native habitat. Including an SKS would have been useful on the new smaller game animals and matched the theme nicely. There are also some difficult photographic missions that may make you want to throw your keyboard or controller against the wall.\n\nMedved-Taiga is definitely worth picking up. I’ll be sorry when I run out of side missions, but expect I’ll keep walking through its hills and tundra for a while. Play on a winter’s day after you’ve walked along a real trail – and don’t forget to open a window to let the cold in!\n","timestamp_created":1609869981,"timestamp_updated":1609869981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549779355525970459","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41M7u6fYCevTiwAI="}
