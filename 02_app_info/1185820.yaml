      expand your property, explore the island, fight monsters, dig for riches underground,
      build camps and hoard your treasures!<br><br>Features:<br>- An open world, allowing
      a variety of playstyles. <br>- Farming, mining, building, fishing, brewing and
      crafting mechanics. <br>- Action RPG-elements allowing different fighting styles.<br>-
      Random generated dungeons.<br>- A unique, more than an hour long, sound track
      by Vindsvept. <br>- Over 60 unique enemies and bosses.<br>- 36 Steam achievements.<br>-
      Over 500 items.<br>- Starting and managing a settlement, with settlers and farm
      animals.<br>- 23 different regions to explore, all with their own dungeons and
      mines and challenges. <br><br>This game focuses a lot on the joy of discovery
      and exploration. There will be very little hand-holding -  you will instead
      have to learn through trial and error.<br>Also, here is a link to the wonderful

    review: "The main focus of the game is to make the players enjoy themselves, the\
      \ beautiful graphics go hand in hand with the soothing music, creating a relaxing\
      \ and wonderful atmosphere. Even though the character that you play as is an\
      \ adventurer, you have the freedom to do anything that you want since the game's\
      \ main dynamic factor is focused on gathering resources and putting them to\
      \ good use in an efficient manner. There are plenty of activities available\
      \ yet in the game such as fishing, mining, chopping wood, expanding the land\
      \ that you own, decorating and so on.\n\nOn top of that the developer is very\
      \ active, hardworking and receptive, constantly creating more and more content\
      \ for the game while also listening to the comunnity's preferences on the game's\
      \ forum. \n\nPersonally, i would rate this game 9/10 while i strongly believe\
      \ it has the potential to become a perfect game in the future after a few more\
      \ solid updates.\nIn conclusion, this game is a must buy if you are into relaxing\
      \ and passive games, especially given the very low price!"
