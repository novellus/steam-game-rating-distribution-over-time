    review: 'While fun and certainly a great experience like the previous three campaigns.
      Taco bros differs in the way of that damnable bell. It summons like 7000 customers
      all at the same time meaning if you don''t actively pace yourselves on getting
      food out you fall apart almost immediately.


      The previous campaigns all had challenges but nowhere near as unforgivably hard
      as Taco Bros. While I recommend it to those that want new content, I warn that
      it''s overwhelmingly stressful at times.'
