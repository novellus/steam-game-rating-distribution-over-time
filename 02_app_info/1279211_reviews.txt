In my previous review of Frontiers I complained that it didn't bring much to the table in terms of new gameplay... well, the 17 cards added here certainly make up for that. \n\nIn addition to padding out the 'Double Ally' ability some more, we get the new additions of both 'Docking' and 'Ally Scrapping'. The former allows a ship to actually be put back into your hand at turn's end IF you have an allied base in play; the latter allows you to scrap only as an ally ability, but these can be pretty impressive.\n\nMy favorite additions are:\n(9) Colossus - colorless mercs get a massive 9-cost ship does 10 damage, choose a color, and draw another card for each ally in play (!!!) Allows for some impressive steamroller turns.\n\nSE - (1) Blockade Runner - Discard up to 2, draw 1 for each card discarded. Ally-scrap to draw 1 + force 1 discard. It's like a low cost Recycling center with clutch scrap ability.\n\nSE - (3) Imperial Defender - 1 combat, draw 1 + Imperial Docking. Have had a couple games with 2 of these in deck, the docking/drawing can get quite out of hand early on.\n\nTF - (3) Trade Raft - 2 trade, 4 authority, Trade Fed docking. It is a Cutter that you can keep recycling into your hand. AI steamrolled me with having two of them, got himself up to 130 health. Not one of my better games...\n\nMC - (7) Assimilator - pictured in the screenshots at top. Literally allows you to steal opponent's card, which I think is basically a unique attribute at this point. Used it twice to steal away Command Ships from the opponent","timestamp_created":1602886099,"timestamp_updated":1602886099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g5zdmfUCf6ulqAI="}
