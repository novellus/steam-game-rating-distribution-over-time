I quickly found myself attempting desperate, futile saves with my feet when I couldn't stretch my paddle arm in time.  The challenge tapers a bit as you collect ammo and damage upgrades, but you can step up the difficulty (and fun!) at your own discretion by fielding several balls at once.\n\nGreat game overall, and I'd especially recommend it as an accessible, affordable introduction to casual arcade/sports games in VR.","timestamp_created":1555694278,"timestamp_updated":1555694278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472440958023071289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw19qmm+oCf+fIvwE="}
