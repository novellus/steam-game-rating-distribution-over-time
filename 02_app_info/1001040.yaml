    review: The game is a diamond in the rough, I have owned it from the initial rollout.
      The Devs have made vast improvements and with better guidelines as to what each
      character class is hopefully by clicking on it, or how to use the training schools
      in town , or even how to use a band-aid would greatly reduce frustration that
      the Guides are not in play yet? Still the game can suck you in and consume many-
      many hours because the concept IS solid! I am really looking forward to its
      refinement to completion!
