Links are provided above.\n\nMGR Gaming’s Conclusions:\n\nWhen you look closer into what the contents of the Season Pass offers, there isn’t much reasoning, it is beyond worth it.  Surviving Mars: Green Planet allows you to fully Terraform Mars with brand new buildings and research. There are new special projects for your rockets to undertake, helping with the Terraforming, you witness little by little how Mars turns green, and when the atmosphere is finally habitable, your colonists can shut down the domes and breath free air again. \n\nSurviving Mars: Project Laika adds new breeding buildings for us, inside the dome and outside, with numerous animal species that can be bred for these ranches. Along with the ranches come domesticated animals that wander within your domes, there are a great number of species that can be seen and when the domes open up, they will explore the green planet you have created. \n\nSurviving Mars: Colony Design Set adds some customizable flair to the game, making it more visually appealing and unique in nature. The bigger our colony gets the more of everything we have and making everything look unique adds a whole new level of creativity to the game.\n\nSurviving Mars: Space Race is what it is, it brings a sense of seriousness and competitiveness to the game. It gives you that little bit of trying harder and doing better, nobody wants to be in second place and with that comes a whole bag of other goodies to further your game experience.\n\nSo, when you take all of this into consideration the Season pass is a great piece of work.\n\nScore 8\nBy: MGRza \nDate: 20 March 2019\n\nAdditional info:\n\nPlatforms: PC: Mac: Linux: PlayStation 4: Xbox One\nGenre: City Builder: Strategy: Survival: Simulation\nCensor Rating: n/a\nAge Rating: n/a\nDeveloper: Haemimont Games\nPublisher: Paradox Interactive\nRelease Date: 15 March 2018\n\nMGR Gaming Steam Curator:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/32364038/\nMGR Gaming:\nhttps://www.mgrgaming.co.za","timestamp_created":1565359880,"timestamp_updated":1590310431,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.667365729808807373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ke34ovICeZmE0AE="}
