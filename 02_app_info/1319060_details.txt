Have friends to play with you and enjoy yourself.. no battle pass or anything crazy.. just enjoy yourselves and have fun!!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhat this game expresses:<br \/>\r\nI want Deadly Maze to help build friendships and make new ones with Co-op. Take your friends and put them in a 1v1 situation. Have a grudge with someone take them to in there and see how many times you can beat them. All in all... I hope everyone enjoys my game!!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nContent:<br \/>\r\nWe got all kinds of modes: 1v1, 1v3, 2v2, cooperative and last team standing. For those who just want to play and have nobody to play with there is a singleplayer mode so you can train and learn the maps if you need to. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOverview of the game:<br \/>\r\nIts a really simple arcade shooter. When I say simple.. I really mean simple... I wanted to focus on the gameplay over graphics. I am still new with this engine so I had to go back to old school gameplay so there is very little animation. I just want players to have fun playing this game and to meet new people.","about_the_game":"** Multiplayer gameplay trailer will be up when I get gameplay**<br \/>\r\nWhy I made this game:<br \/>\r\nI made this game for the players to enjoy some old school arcade shooter.
