Composed by Chris Remo, the soundtrack present throughout [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/383870/Firewatch/] Firewatch [/url] adds a lot to the game and its overall atmosphere. Not only do tracks like Prologue add emotional depth, but tracks like Camp Approach and Stay in Your Tower and Watch make exploration and gameplay feel more lively. Furthermore, the original song Ol' Shoshone, written by Sean Vanaman, is a nice addition as well. Overall, the soundtrack for [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/383870/Firewatch/] Firewatch [/url] is just excellent, and although it's available on streaming services, you can purchase it here if you'd like to support the composers and the developers.","timestamp_created":1599798147,"timestamp_updated":1599798147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528985500335693359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+87ZvfQCf7+JoQI="}
