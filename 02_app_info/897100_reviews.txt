I had to reduce the SS to 60% (which is around 3000 squared pixels). But given that this is the first game that my 3090 has struggled with, there is some problem in there somewhere.","timestamp_created":1607689631,"timestamp_updated":1607689631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40Z7xqPYCcqOJuQI="}
