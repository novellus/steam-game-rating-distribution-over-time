    about_the_game: "Night. An abandoned dilapidated cabin in the woods. Cobwebs in\
      \ the corners, dust on the floor, dilapidated furniture and... not a single\
      \ living soul. From the looks of it the house has long since been abandoned,\
      \ but is that really the case? You try to understand what\u2019s going on here\
      \ but you understand only one thing \u2014 this house isn\u2019t going to let\
      \ you get away so easily. Looking around, you see that the doors and windows\
      \ are shut, there\u2019s no electricity, and the dying flicker of the candle\
      \ is barely enough to light the murky room. To your horror, you realize that\
      \ you are caught in a trap. Someone\u2019s silhouette flashes in the dim light\
      \ of the candle... Or was it a trick of the light? Are you ready to conquer\
      \ your fears and delve into the secrets of this murky place?<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nAdditional information.<br />\r\nHouse of Fear is a mix of genres &quot;Escape\
      \ room&quot; and &quot;Horror&quot;. Player should solve puzzles to escape the\
      \ house. Gloomy atmosphere and several scary moments will keep the player stressed\
      \ till the end of the story."
