      \ platform genre. Pip -- the ultimate digital underdog \u2013 is a lowly single\
      \ pixel in a 32-bit world who proves that you can\u2019t judge a hero by the\
      \ fidelity of his shaders. During the game, Pip gains the ability to evolve\
      \ and grow by absorbing pixels from his fallen foes. Those same pixels can then\
      \ be used to blast through environment puzzles and enemies, devolving Pip back\
      \ to a single pixel. Players will explore five stylized worlds and experience\
      \ up to 10 hours of epic adventure saving Pip\u2019s village from the evil Queen\
      \ DeRezzia.<br> <br>Inspired by classic platformers, Adventures of Pip basks\
      \ in a world where players can defeat a huge 32-bit boss as a single pixel or\

    short_description: Play as the ultimate digital underdog in the Adventures of
      Pip,an action-platformer with a fresh gameplay twist inside a retro 32-bit world.
      Alas, Pip is an unlikely 1-pixel hero yet has the unique ability to absorb the
      pixels of his defeated enemies to evolve into three different forms.

    review: This game has a steady learning curve that never leaves the player confused
      or without an interesting challenge. While it is moderately easy all the way
      through, you still feel good about yourself for solving the puzzles or doing
      some clean platforming. It just feels good to play this game, and its concept
      is incredibly unique.
