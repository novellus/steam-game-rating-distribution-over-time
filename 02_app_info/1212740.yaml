    review: 'This is a budget release of a great, but unfortunately overlooked puzzle
      game. I highly recommend this game if you like simple to understand but deep
      and rewarding puzzle mechanics! Unfotunately it lacks online, addition of which
      would make it my multiplayer game of choice.

      P.S. If you launch the game in Japanese language, you can play Story mode which
      was cut from the English version, also the characters will have voices and additional
      descriptions (all in Japanese of course)!!!'
