    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">What is the game?</h2><br><strong>DCR: Drive.Crash.Repeat</strong>
      is a retro style, ludicrous auto-forward driving game with an amazing twist,
      and absolutely no brakes! Drive your way through tens of handcrafted levels
      (to the extent that each level has its own name), across different atmospheric
      worlds!<h2 class="bb_tag">What genre is it?</h2><br>This game is a fusion of
      classical puzzle and platformer elements with drifting/driving mechanics, an
      original concept not done before! Game is crazy addictive and fun!<h2 class="bb_tag">Why
      is it fun?</h2><br>Because it looks easy, but it is so hard! Trying to beat
      a level over and over again will eventually get you there however! The game
      has an &quot;Oh, I''ve figured it out!&quot; moment almost at every curve in
      every level! Then what seemed so hard before becomes easy! And that''s where
      the fun is!<br><br>Each level has a twist; your ultimate objective is to reach
      the end zone, before your time ends, and without crashing while the car is involuntarily
      driving forward, by strategizing your every turn! Also to find the crafty hidden
      objects. Explore multiple alternative paths and different solutions for each
      level! Collect enough stars and objects to unlock bonus levels in this addictive
      and challenging game.<br><br>D.C.R is a thrilling experience for casual, but
      even more so, for hardcore gamers! Beat the learning curve and become a master!
      Play against your ghost or our 3 star ghosts to enhance your time! Beat through
      the levels in sequence or skip ahead.<br><br>Driving and crashing has never
      been this fun! An experience that will grow on you as you get to explore vivid
      retro style environments and mouthwatering mechanics that span over 45 levels
      in 3 different worlds!<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul">    <li>The
      hardest-car-game-in-the-world!<br>    </li><li>3 atmospheric worlds, 45 hand-crafted
      levels and 3 impossible bonus levels<br>    </li><li>135 optional secretly hidden
      objects!<br>    </li><li>Crazy fun! Multiple solutions per level!<br>    </li><li>Simple

      class="bb_tag">So, how many car crashes did it take to compile the promo video?</h2><br>Luckily,
      there is an in-game counter to tell us exactly that! And the number is <strong>3,722</strong>
      times! Yeah, we drive.crash.repeated 3,722 times just to capture this video!
      So, if you think the game is easy, think again!<br><br>Note: Second trailer

      driving game with an amazing twist, and absolutely no brakes! Drive your way
      through tens of handcrafted levels (to the extent that each level has its own
      name), across different atmospheric worlds!'

    review: "Really sad that only a few people played this game in the years it's\
      \ been on Steam. It's actually surprisingly good and a lot of fun. Nice level\
      \ design with hidden items and shortcuts. You have to replay each level many\
      \ times to find the right paths and gather the items and I've had fun in each\
      \ of my attempts so far. \nDefinitely worth the low price. \nThe last two levels\
      \ of world 1 have only ever been finished by me and another person which was\
      \ quite shocking to see. \nSo please, if you read this, give the game a try\
      \ and beat my scores. This game deserves to be played a lot more.\nI still am\
      \ far from completing. There are 3 worlds with 15 levels and one bonus level\
      \ each. \nA total of 48 levels to Drive, Crash and Repeat.\nDifficulty varies\
      \ from tolerable to pure insanity.\nNot suggested for completionists since this\
      \ will become a frustrating task."
