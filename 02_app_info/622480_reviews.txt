By the looks of it children are the target group. Judging by the difficulty level they are not. \nLots of cheap one-hit-kill traps that lead to a lot of trial and error. \nRight now there is about one hour of content at most. Five levels, one of it being a boss. Oh and one survival type map - without textures, of course. \n\nGame seems abandoned and there are way better games to spend your money and time on.","timestamp_created":1560332078,"timestamp_updated":1560332078,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu8HCpesCfrqhwwE="}
