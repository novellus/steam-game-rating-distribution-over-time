    review: 'Nice visual novel for the price when on sale, elemental routes are very
      similar after the first go around. The artwork for CGs and character sprites
      was really nice, and most of the sweeping camera movements can be at least partially
      skipped if you mash the enter key. Unlocking all the CGs is a bit tedious for
      the outfit system where you chose one of three options closer to the start,
      and the corresponding image is unlocked at the very end depending on what elemental
      you chose...and are identical minus the akin colour/dress choice.

      If you buy this full-price I would say it''s a bit much for the amount of unique
      content.


      Overall pretty and decent game, with full voice acting which is well done.'
