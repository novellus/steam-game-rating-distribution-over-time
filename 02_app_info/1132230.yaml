    review: 'Cool game, GBA classic shmup.

      3 save states and a specialized emulation menu. It''s pretty cool how well the
      music holds up. Asking price is stupid high, though; you can get comparable
      Sega Genesis classic games for <$2 normally.

      Get it if you''re a fan and just want to throw money at Shin''En, or if it''s
      very deep discount and you want to see what GBA could do with it''s 17mhz processor
      and 400k of RAM.'
