    review: like someone said, its too "rough" Some upgrades looks like they dont
      work, there is no point in building the town except to get lvls. There's no
      difficulty to choose... BUT it LOOKS like it has potential, i'll refund for
      now but i'll keep a look to see if they will finish the game
