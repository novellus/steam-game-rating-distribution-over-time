      \ Overfall</h2><br><strong>Tell us about your background in music.</strong><br><br>I\u2019\
      ve loved music since I was a kid. I started out playing guitar, and my interest\
      \ in traditional Turkish music eventually got me into playing fretless guitar.\
      \ In those days, I did a lot of live stage performances, playing with a bunch\
      \ of different bands and artists. After a certain point, though, I realized\
      \ I was more excited by the prospect of composing music. For years now I\u2019\
      ve been writing scores to various films, TV shows, and plays. This is the first\
      \ time I\u2019m composing for a video game, and it\u2019s very exciting.<br><br><strong>How\
      \ does compose for videogames differ from other mediums?</strong><br><br>To\
      \ begin with, I love playing video games, so composing for one was a pleasure\
      \ over and above the satisfaction I normally get from my work. In practice,\
      \ it feels a lot like film scoring: you have to incorporate the dynamism, rhythm,\
      \ and spontaneity of a visual medium. It\u2019s not so much about evoking images\
      \ as it is about reflecting or counterpointing them. Overfall was especially\
      \ fun to do because <strong>its world required a diverse approach</strong>,\
      \ with music reflecting individual races and locations. It\u2019s hard to describe\
      \ how fun it is to compose for something like that.<br><br>In a sense, it\u2019\
      s a less personal experience than making music for the stage, because in the\
      \ theater you\u2019re connecting with a person who\u2019s directly in front\
      \ of you. There\u2019s a sort of shared energy that you don\u2019t get when\
      \ the music isn\u2019t being performed live. But there\u2019s a different kind\
      \ of excitement to composing for someone you don\u2019t know or don\u2019t see.\
      \ You have to imagine their reaction as you compose, and I find that to be a\
      \ more engaging challenge.<br><br><strong>How did you get involved with Overfall?\
      \ What attracted you to the project?</strong><br><br>Well, I was a gamer before\
      \ I became a musician. It\u2019s a part of my life I would never consider giving\
      \ up. What struck me about Overfall was the art style, especially the painted\
      \ backgrounds - the textures, the color palettes, and the general feel. The\
      \ game\u2019s settings usually take place in natural environments like caves,\
      \ hills, and shorelines, and I tried to reflect that in my choice of acoustic\
      \ instruments.<br><br><strong>What will the music in Overfall be like?</strong><br><br>Overfall\
      \ has a lot of different scenes and narrative beats. Sometimes it\u2019s a pulse-pounding\
      \ action scene, sometimes it\u2019s more of a gradual journey. I worked to reflect\
      \ that in the music I wrote. Something you\u2019ll also notice is that <strong>every\
      \ type of island has its own melody and instrumentation.</strong> I simply loved\
      \ the idea of that. But my favorite bit of work has to be the main theme. I\u2019\
      m curious to see what people think of it. Again, I made use of acoustic instruments,\
      \ and I tried to get across the atmosphere of the world of Dys, where the game\
      \ is set. If I had to describe it in three words, they would be melancholy,\
      \ mystery, and excitement."
