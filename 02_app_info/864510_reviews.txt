I tried contacting the dev ..and he did eventually respond. (See end of review)\n\nGame starts out too hard. SCUD looks like a fun little casual game, but quickly turns into a chore of repeating the same level over and over until you can beat some ridiculous highscore chosen out of thin air. I'm stuck on the 3rd level. I can't figure out how to get my score high enough. until then I can't see ANY other content this game has. (there is no sandbox 'play around' or any other mode)\n\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]can earn credits to buy items from a store: from new jetpacks to new helmets(?)\n[*]can buy Perks, which make certain aspects of the game easier[/list]\n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]difficulty ramps up way too soon & no difficulty selection\n[*]only one game mode\n[*]full controller support is currently broken. everything works on my controller except for my d-pad, which is how you move in this game[/list]\n\n****** ******\nUPDATE:\ndev replied to me and said he didn't change anything on his end. that I should check my drivers on my controller.
