      the puzzles that separates a room from the other one, where the objective can
      be achieved.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/675140/extras/laika_icon_small.png?t=1604071304"

    review: Very nice retro platformer, but very frustrating in the end because of
      broken controls. Character is sliding all over the place, there is no sensivity
      setting or deadzone for joypad. Sometimes you will catch wall, sometimes not.
      Another stupid thing is that you cant push buttons when moving or jumping. I
      really dont mind dying literally hundreds times because of this, but level on
      the airplane requires insane amount of precision. Levels 1-8 are OK, last two
      are really hardcore, I've spent two hours of playing each one of them. And of
      course there is no save option in level itself. A shame, because art and music
      are very good for an oldschool platformer. I bet that this whole joypad problem
      is caused by used game engine, but broken controls take out most of the fun
      in such a game.
