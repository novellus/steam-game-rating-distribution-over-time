I need a sandstorm, waterfall, and can maybe use a couple others for storytelling in RPG Maker.  This is fantastic Software.  It's like an underrated poor programmer's After Effects.  It's not nearly as big, it's retro, but it gets the job done for my oldschool game & looks quite stylish indeed.\n\nThese can be used to create several cool things in RPG maker.  Parallax are easy, cool title effects, no problem.  But there's more. \n Spells / abilities by exporting the 3D Particle Effect into a shot sequence and using any photo editing suite to set them up as a sprite sheet animation.  By changing parameters different levels of spells / abilities could be easily generated without animating them by hand.  This software may be a bit difficult to learn, but that is a HUGE time saver in the long run.","timestamp_created":1561803989,"timestamp_updated":1561803989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gLSx0esCdqHgxQE="}
