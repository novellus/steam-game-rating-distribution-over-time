    about_the_game: <strong>Sphoxie</strong> is a physics based rolling ball adventure
      game, in it you must help the little spiky dude get back home after being sucked
      into a portal that has taken him into a strange unfamiliar boxy world full of
      many perils and strange boxy creatures. You must take control of the little
      dude, his spikes are not just for decoration, they help him climb up certain
      walls and steep slopes so you can collect the four red cubes in each of 24 levels
      to open the exits to be able to access all 3 different worlds.<br><br>Time is
      life and in Sphoxie this is very literal, the enemies will steal your time and
      falling of the level will really make you lose time, don't fret because time
      flows both ways, you can get more time by collecting the yellow and red cubes
      or knocking the bad guys into the ether. The little dude is not totally defenseless
      because he has a special blast power and by slamming into anything hard enough
      unleashes a powerful shock-wave that will knock anything away. This power will
      be very useful in the boss battles where you must knock all the bosses of the
      platform to unlock the next world.<br><br>If you are a speed demon there is
      a race mode where you must beat each level (without the bad guys or yellow cubes)
      as fast as possible for the top time. There are various unlockables for achieving
      certain things in the game like different tails, sun glasses and more!<br><br>Many
      dangers and obstacles await, can you handle it?<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><br>-
      24 fun and diverse levels<br>- 3 Challenging boss fights<br>- 3 Unique worlds<br>-
      Simple yet deep gameplay<br>- Climb on walls<br>- Beautiful visuals powered
      by the Unreal Engine 4<br>- Made by just one person<br>- Achievements and Leaderboards<br>-
      Unlockable Customization options for your character<br>- Race mode<br>- Music
      by Anitek<br>- Made in the Unreal Engine<br>- And lots more!<br><br>Control
      with the keyboard W,A,S,D for movement and Q,E or the mouse for camera control
      and space for action.<br>With the controller left stick/dpad to control and
      right stick for the camera<br><br>If there is enough interest I can try and
      make a Linux &amp; OSX build
