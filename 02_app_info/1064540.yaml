    short_description: Puzzle Pelago turns the classic ware-chain based economy sim
      into a challenging puzzle! Help rebuild the network of goods production via
      deceptively simple drag &amp; drop mechanics. Produce various goods exactly
      where the islanders need them - from wooden planks and wheat to barrels, beer
      and bread.
