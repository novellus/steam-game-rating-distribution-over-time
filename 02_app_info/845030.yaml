    reviews: "\u201CEvergate surprised me. It looked at first to be slightly derivative\
      \ of Ori and the Blind Forest, and I became interested in it because of those\
      \ similarities, not in spite of them. In actuality, its common traits with Ori\
      \ are superficial, and its strong focus on the puzzle part of the puzzle-platformer\
      \ genre makes for a rich and wholly distinct experience.\u201D<br>8/10 \u2013\
