Campaign, Campaign Plus, Daily Hotspots and Skirmish (choose your own suits and powers) are take-at-your-own-pace experiences that fit into your schedule.

We know we made a card game, and we know that there’s a risk you might think this game will charge you for unlocks, speed bonuses or aesthetics. We won’t. We may come up with a cool DLC at some point, and if so, will probably charge in the traditional way, but we won’t be charging you for double XP or a particularly shiny new colour theme.<\/i><br><br><strong>Is this Bithell Short an entry in the “Circular” series?<\/strong><br><br><i>No. While our previous Bithell Shorts (<i>Subsurface Circular<\/i> and <i>Quarantine Circular<\/i>) have been twists on the text adventure, <i>The Solitaire Conspiracy<\/i> is a new take on solitaire. We love storytelling and world-building, so it absolutely contains a full narrative experience, which we’re telling via full-motion video (FMV) and in-game lore. We decided to use the Bithell Short name to signal something digestible and original.
