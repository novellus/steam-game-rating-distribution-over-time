    reviews: "\u201CA Land Fit For Heroes can get quite racy in sections. We\u2019\
      re talking sweaty, nasty sex, brutal slayings and even the occasional Fifty\
      \ Shades-style masochism. If you\u2019re a bit squeamish then you might want\
      \ to pass, but Game Of Thrones fans will probably enjoy this gritty, adult take\
      \ on fantasy.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://recombu.com/mobile/article/a-land-fit-for-heroes-review-ios-game\"\

    short_description: "A Land Fit for Heroes is a profound story of three distinct\
      \ characters falling into a sequence of bloodthirsty events full of gore and\
      \ mystery. It is not your average story-based RPG; A Land Fit for Heroes is\
      \ darker, deeper and very explicit, primarily it\u2019s narrative is targeted\
      \ towards a mature audience."

    review: Favorable impression after my first play - great story/writing, this is
      a choose-your-own-adventure that is story-heavy, light on gameplay.  I'm still
      very early in the game, looking forward to experiencing more.
