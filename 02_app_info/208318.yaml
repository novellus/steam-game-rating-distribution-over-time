    about_the_game: "The Baldwin Centipede was one of the more unusual and heavy diesel\
      \ locomotives in US railroading history, and now you can drive this heavyweight\
      \ around the Horseshoe Curve in Train Simulator. <br><br>Arguably ahead of its\
      \ time in terms of design, the Baldwin DR-12-8-1500/2 gained the \u2018Centipede\u2019\
      \ name from its odd wheel arrangement, so called as it was to have resembled\
      \ the legs of a centipede. Given its heavy weight and numerous wheel sets, the\
      \ Centipede offered the highest tractive power of any diesel locomotive in history.<br><br>In\
      \ total, 54 units were produced and used in service by the Pennsylvania Railroad,\
      \ Seaboard Air Line Railroad and National Railway of Mexico between 1945 and\
      \ 1948. The Centipede was capable of operating independently or coupled in pairs,\
      \ something the PRR successfully exploited to haul long passenger and freight\
      \ trains across its network, including around the famous Horseshoe Curve.<br><br>However,\
      \ the Centipede was beset with problems and by the 1950s most railroads had\
