    review: "I really enjoyed the last two games in this series so decided that I\
      \ would also get this one. It's a fun game with an interesting story line but\
      \ there is some glitches that need to be fixed. \nOne is within the main game\
      \ where you have to put a plan back together within a HOP and then the game\
      \ crashes and then closes itself down, I did however find away around this by\
      \ playing the match 3 mini-game. The other glitch that I have found is within\
      \ the bonus chapter and this now means I can not finish the game, this glitch\
      \ isn't a puzzle or HOP it is something simple, by trying to put the fuse into\
      \ the fuse box so that the electricity works, I have tried to do the bonus chapter\
      \ a couple of times and tried to do it differently but still no luck.\nOverall\
      \ I still really enjoyed the game. I just hope that the developers fix the glitch\
      \ so that I can fully finish the game."
