      \ items have a shining effect placed on them, the only objects that don't have\
      \ a shining effect are doors. I'll look into the hotel stage and the map errors\
      \ you've raised though."

    review: '[b] Edit: 11/9/2020 the developer was kind enough to reach out to me.  Take
      this whole review with a grain of salt, as we''re still talking to each other
      and while my understanding of the game evolves.  [/b]

      I couldn''t complete this one.  I had four big complaints.  The first is that
      I had no idea where to go.  I mean that in several senses.  For instance, I
      often had no idea that I could interact with an object until I tried.  This
      means that I would frequently be rubbing against walls trying to figure out
      what I was supposed to interact with.  This ties into my second complaint, which
      is that there are multiple areas where you can go out side the map or get stuck
      on things.  Even if I could figure out what to interact with, I got to the hotel,
      and I had several interactable items that required some prerequisite.  I could
      not figure out where they were.  I would have searched more, but then I ran
      into my third complaint, which is the combat.  Despite using WASD controls,
      in order to aim, you hold shift and aim 360 degrees with the mouse.  You still
      need to have the same horizontal or vertical coordinate as the enemy, and I
      cannot tell you how janky that feels.  It was unbearable.  Final complaint:
      unless I''m missing something, there''s no way to hit escape and bring up a
      "load" screen to load a prior save.  This means you basically are forced to
      close the game if you want to try and return to an earlier save to conserve
      ammo or something.  I noticed pressing F1 brought up a key rebinding menu, but
      I couldn''t tell what it was trying to tell me.  That definitely needs work.  I
      got so impatient I loaded the wrong save, and then I had to close the game and
      reopen it.  When you''re streaming over discord, that''s a real annoyance.  The
      thing that sucks is that the story was really good.  I''m <120 minutes, so I''m
      refunding.'
