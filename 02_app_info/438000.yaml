      \ /><br><strong>PIXELMAN</strong> is a retro styled action-filled, high-score\
      \ chaser, where you control the title character in his mission to rescue the\
      \ citizens of Pixville from the evil Baron Von Pixel and his contraptions.<br>In\
      \ <strong>PIXELMAN</strong> you need to keep your combos going to be able to\
      \ make it into the online leaderboards!<br><br>PIXELMAN's gameplay harkens back\
      \ to a time where every token counted, as was the case with games such as Donkey\
      \ Kong, Galaga, Moon Patrol and others from the golden era of arcades. You have\
      \ simple controls and goals, and the difference between being a regular Joe\
      \ or the king of the arcade is your ability to completely master them.<br><br>The\
      \ citizens of Pixville are counting on you!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How to Play</h2>Controlling\
      \ <strong>PIXELMAN</strong> is very simple: you press and hold to go up, release\
      \ to go down, and you can also use the pad to move faster (but with less accuracy!)\
      \ Your goal is to rescue the citizens (humans and their pets!) to keep your\
      \ heroic energy up, and also avoid crashing into buildings, traffic, and Von\
      \ Pixel\u2019s weapons and traps. <br>If you don\u2019t rescue anyone for a\
      \ while, your heroic energy will go down; and if it reaches zero, you\xB4ll\
      \ lose your powers and fall! <br><br>XBox 360 Controllers, Mouse and Keyboards\
      \ supported (We truly recommend playing with a controller).<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/438000/extras/PIXELMAN_How_to.png?t=1589499276\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combos</h2>Every time you rescue a Pixelian, your combo\
      \ meter will go up. Once you\u2019ve rescued 5 in a row, your score will start\
      \ to multiply! BUT, if you fail to rescue a single soul, you meter will deplete,\
      \ and you\u2019ll have to start all over again. Keep the combos going for maximum\
      \ high-scorage!<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/438000/extras/PIXELMAN_Combo.png?t=1589499276\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Power Ups</h2>From time to time, you\u2019ll come across\
      \ a shield. If you grab it, you\u2019ll activate the power up mode! In this\
      \ mode, your score and combo meter multiply, your speed goes up, and you can\u2019\
      t get hurt! The bad thing is, it only lasts for one hit, so you better watch\
      \ out!<br><br>Grab an atom and get the power to shoot fireballs! You can accumulate\
      \ up to 4, if you do, you'll get a super shot! That super shot can destroy everything\
      \ in its path and do extra damage to the bosses!<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/438000/extras/PIXELMAN_PU.png?t=1589499276\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PIXELMAN</h2>He\u2019s Pixville\u2019s senior superhero,\
      \ his superpowers are flying and untying knots really fast. He also loves podiums!\
      \ His main weaknesses are buildings, bombs, lasers and missiles\u2026 nothing\

      \ She\u2019s pretty much like <strong>PIXELMAN</strong>, but faster and cooler!\
      \ Once you learn her quirks, she\u2019ll start racking up points like nothing!\

      \ anything about him.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Baron Von Pixel</h2>PIXELMAN\u2019\
      s main antagonist is a mustache-twirling villain who hates everyone in Pixville.\
      \ He managed to buy a few rusty WWI weapons on Craigslist, and he\u2019s not\
      \ afraid to use them! His main hobby is to tie people up and leave them on top\
      \ of buildings, trees and cars. Only <strong>PIXELMAN</strong> can stop his\
      \ devious schemes! <br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/438000/extras/PIXELMAN_BvP.png?t=1589499276\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Podiums</h2>What\u2019s a superhero without a podium\
      \ to stand on? In <strong>PIXELMAN</strong> you start on top of a sad soapbox,\
      \ but to show their gratitude after being rescued, the Pixelians will start\
      \ building new podiums for you! Can you unlock them all? Are you the hero Pixville\
      \ needs? Or the hero Pixville deserves? How much wood would a woodchuck chuck\
      \ if a woodchuck could chuck wood? <br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/438000/extras/PIXELMAN_Podiums.png?t=1589499276\"\

      \ an ending. You can play until your eyes bleed or the speed goes so far up\
      \ that you can\u2019t control your hero anymore! The goal of the game is to\
      \ make it to the online leaderboards. And in order to achieve that, you need\
      \ to maintain your combos going. If you have a high combo and you manage to\
      \ get a power up, you can make over 1000 points for just one rescue! <br><img\
