    review: 'For anyone who''s enjoyed Shadowgate or games like that, this is a blast!


      It''s not as cryptic as Shadowgate and provides quite a bit of hints in form
      of the written Journal by the player''s companion Brimley, and you can also
      talk to Brimley in each room and he might give you helpful hints - sometimes
      even maybe too helpful or obvious.


      I managed to get stumped for quite a bit of time in two occasions, so my playtime
      got quite high, but it was just me being an idiot and not realizing obvious
      things. So I would think the playthrough for the average player will be a lot
      less than the 7 hours it took me.


      It has the same kind of a torch system as Shadowgate, although if I recall correctly
      in Shadowgate the burning of the torches was based on moves taken whereas here
      it''s purely time based. According to the developer it takes about 12 seconds
      for 1% of a torch to burn. This brings kind of a sense of urgency at first but
      it''s not really that bad. I had several torches left when I finished the game,
      but then again I often reloaded the game after I had found new places or items
      after walking around burning the torch, so then I could redo what I did and
      have plenty of more torch time left. An interesting feature is that the screen
      becomes darker the less you have fire in the torch. Anyway, I recommend the
      players to take their time investigating stuff and if they are sure about what
      to do next, reload the game and proceed, and save the game after you are done.


      Great game! Recommended for any Shadowgate fan out there.'
