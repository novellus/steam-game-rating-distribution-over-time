Really challenging addition to the game as the Pests can do alot of destruction to property early game when Dogs and Cats have not been bought yet.\n\nThere is no guarantee that all Pests will be scared away by the Pets immediately. Expect some level of damage in keeping with the number of Pets you have, and when the Pets find the Pests.\n\nSome Pets are better at scaring away Pests and some Pets are better at attracting certain classes of Guests. Be sure to use the accessory items that go with each Pet or they can become unhappy and leave. Same with making sure the box for attention is checked too. Each Pet attaches to 3 Staff so be careful to have enough Staff for all your Pets.\n\nAnd don't forget to hang the Bug Repellent bags (and have lots of Herbs), or the Lice, Wood Worms and the like can do alot of damage and keep Guests away.","timestamp_created":1599616572,"timestamp_updated":1599616693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sLaluPQCe8XXoAI="}
