    review: "This game is shaping up to be a joy to play, a rare treat in the midst\
      \ of Battle-Royale and FPS games of our time. The simplicity mixed with other\
      \ elements makes for a fun and in-depth journey for a text based game. \n\n\
      On another note, as a personal childhood friend of the developer, I can safely\
      \ say that they are passionate about this game and will not leave it unfinished\
      \ - Their drive to complete said game, and also revamp other, already completed\
      \ areas is unparalleled. I wholeheartedly recommend trying out this game."
