    about_the_game: 'A dystopian ''find the hidden pictures'' game with full-motion
      video of puppets, and you are right in the mix of it all! You play Chandler,
      the showrunner for the state''s most popular propaganda TV show: Laughsail!
      You and your puppet co-stars have been called in on a Saturday because the show
      has killed off another cabin boy, and you need to make sure the training program
      for the new actor is up to scratch. You''ll deal with egos, confusion, and some
      tired friends, but you''re used to it. And besides...anything for the state.'
