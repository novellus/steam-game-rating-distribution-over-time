    about_the_game: "Frank West, a freelance photojournalist on the hunt for the scoop\
      \ of a lifetime, pursues a juicy lead to a small suburban town only to find\
      \ that it is being overrun by zombies! He escapes to the local shopping mall\
      \ thinking it will be a bastion of safety, but it turns out to be anything but.\
      \ It's a true struggle to survive the endless stream of enemies, but with full\
      \ reign over an entire shopping center, Frank can utilize anything to fight\
      \ off the flesh-hungry mob and search for the truth behind the horrendous epidemic.<br><br>This\
      \ action horror game brings new meaning to the phrase &quot;retail hell.&quot;\
      \ Dead Rising uses a dynamic real-time system in which time continues to pass\
      \ whether Frank is actively engaged or remains stationary. For example, though\
      \ they move slowly during the day, zombies become stronger and faster when the\
      \ sun sets and make it even more difficult to survive at night. The unprecedented\
      \ swarms come in never-ending waves and consist of a diverse population. These\
      \ former humans retain some memory of their previous lives and it is reflected\
      \ in their behavior and appearance. The variety of different stores in the mall\
      \ offers an endless supply of resources including vehicles, makeshift weapons\
      \ and more. Other survivors are encountered along the way and helping them can\

    review: Going into this game, I was expecting survival horror like Resident Evil
      or Silent Hill, but I am beyond glad I was wrong about that assumption. Easily
      one of my favorite games in the last few years and the soundtrack is top notch.
