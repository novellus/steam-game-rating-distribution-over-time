It's that short and simple.  What you don't see in the trailer is the specific order you click things to reveal seeing the hidden numbers. After you get them it unlocks the capsule releasing the zombie inside which shows a little \"dance\" scene and concludes the game.\n\nAs Dohi64 said in his review, go for one of the free flash versions out there. \n","timestamp_created":1586518602,"timestamp_updated":1586518602,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.719438552856445313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkZb4sfECdfjT/wE="}
