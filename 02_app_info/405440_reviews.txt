Not a gem, not by a long shot, but there are some good things here.\n\nThe sparse tags may be a little misleading, but this is actually a rogue-lite game. Death is basically your save mechanism. You're expected to die and you'll do it a lot, and that's okay. When you die you keep your money and experience gained, so even repeated garbage runs in the first floor aren't really a waste; you can take the time you need to get the hang of it (Not that there's much of a learning curve, more like picking up on the game's little idiosyncracies over a few play sessions)\n\n The game employs a perk-tree system spread across three distinct playstyles, namely an assault marine with big guns, a nimbler \"assassin\" with higher mobility and lighter weapons, and a specialist that uses the game's more unusual weapons more effectively. In terms of the gameplay mechanics, it's not that adventurous but that's probably a good thing. There's at least some fundamental design principles at work here.\n\nOnce you're in the main part of the game, that's where the issues start to arise. You move at a pace that's slow enough that I'm pretty sure the character's feet are sliding on the floor, which also highlights some less-than-perfect animations. Frankly, not a dealbreaker for what's obviously an indie title who's development staff can likely be counted on one hand. My biggest gripe has to be the frankly broken reload, which is far too slow and seems unresponsive at times, with those times often while you're being sprayed in the face with flames or pelted with enough plasma balls to put this game into bullet-hell territory.\n\nInterestingly the slow movement speed and the erratic weapon spread are somewhat intentional, as the perk system does allow you to mitigate the damage and move more quickly with appropriate perk choices. Nothing fixes the reloading mechanic though.\n\nThe second thing is the weapon system, which divides the game's 50 or so guns across several categories. Weapons in the same category share a common ammo pool, so bringing two pistols or two assault rifles is a mistake; you'll want to diversify. (Amusingly, most of the guns are simply renamed real-world weapons. The starting assault rifle is an AK, for example. The game's more unique weapons are in the special category, including a rather satisfying laser rifle)\n\nWhere the game shines is once you start getting into it a little, and you start enjoying the destruction on screen. Explosions occur with EVERYTHING, which is itself a hazard and a tactical boon to you if used right. There are few things more satisfying that clearing a room with one well-placed grenade, with said room exploding in a cascade so furious your computer seems to fail to translate that into audio. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't having a little fun playing this game.\n\nOverall, none of the problems it has really compromise its core design, so I'd say give it a try if you've got a dollar to spend. If you're into other twin-stick-schmup games like Alien Shooter you'll feel right at home.","timestamp_created":1535869533,"timestamp_updated":1535869533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tKe9zOUCeoXsqQE="}
