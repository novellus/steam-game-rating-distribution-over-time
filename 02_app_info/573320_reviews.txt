However once you fought an enemy once or twice the fights become trivial, yet the game makes you fight some enemies 10+ times.  The boss fights are all fun and well designed.\n\nThe level design starts out fine but then they decided they want to make labyrinths for levels 2,3 and 4. There are a lot of interesting design concepts to choose from, you don’t have to make the majority of your game a labyrinth. \n\nThe story is a mixed bag, the general story is rather generic but there are some funny and interesting moments in there. The ending feels very similar to another game to the point that you could almost call it ripped off or at least heavily inspired.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is the waiting, during combat you wait for your stamina to come back, while platforming your wait for platforms, during boss fights you wait until you are allowed to attack again. I don’t wanna wait, I wanna play the game instead.\n\nDespite my rather negative sounding review, I mostly had a good time playing the game. While I wouldn’t recommend this game to everyone if you like RPGs it is worth playing in my opinion.","timestamp_created":1609767823,"timestamp_updated":1609767823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46fTo5vYCeJeywAI="}
