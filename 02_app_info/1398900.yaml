    review: "This game is a skill based platformer. As you play the game, you can\
      \ see there is a lot of love put in this game. Levels are really well made.\
      \  I dont think this game is about story. The story here is just a thing to\
      \ make the game meaningfull. Only one thing I dont like about this game is price\
      \ tag. This game is worth maybe about 3-4\u20AC and not 6,60\u20AC."
