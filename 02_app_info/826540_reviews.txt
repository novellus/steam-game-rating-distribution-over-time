Audio Trip on expert has enough movement to really get you sweating and the choreography generally feels nice.  The other games seem to have decent choreography - but it almost feels auto-generated and isn't the challenge that I get from AT.\n \nI actually put away my Valve Index for over a year, and now I play 3+ times a week.\n \nI will say, the content is drastically lacking (there really aren't enough songs) but the content that is there is solid.\n \nI held off on putting in this review until I tried using my own music.  While the journey was a little intimidating at first, after less than an hour I had made my first primitive ATS file and was able to fine tune it to my tastes.  That, to me, does solve a bit of the content issue - as now my entire music library can be used as long as I'm willing to build the levels.  Since you can basically allow it to record while dancing - this isn't as hard as you'd think.","timestamp_created":1607678318,"timestamp_updated":1609746002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwhdaV5vYCcMyDuQI="}
