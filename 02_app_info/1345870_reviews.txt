The addition of Awards, HOF, Draft Lottery UI is very cool.  \nHowever, one thing I've noticed so far is, since the Draft is after the year end of June 31, the final year end team positions get reset, so I'm noticing that playoff teams are in the draft lottery (in the first year, a playoff team won the lottery and it only had it's own 1st round pick).  It's seems like the draft lottery is reading off the \"cleared\" standings instead of the previous year end standings.  Bug?  Otherwise, pretty solid so far.","timestamp_created":1609913934,"timestamp_updated":1609913934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi6SW6/YCe4f2wAI="}
