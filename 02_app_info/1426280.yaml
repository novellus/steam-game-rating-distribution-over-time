      notes: Your sidekick character swears occasionally (shit, fuck, crap). There
        is also one hanged body, blood stains, a trash can of cartoony (non-realistic),
        and a severed corpse (also non-realistic). No gore happens in real-time but
        cartoony horror props (bloodstains, body bags (no blood), and frankenstein
        puppets) can be found in the environments.

    review: 'The Story and Art Style is amazing, had great jumps and atmosphere

      My Only gripe with the game is the bugs that can sometimes render it unplayable

      You''ve got the [spoiler]Sockees being alerted to you immediately before you
      even have a chance to shut off Scout''s light[/spoiler]

      Doing some events out of order, causing them to bug out, or unable to repeat.


      I''m sure if these were patched, it would be an amazing game.'
