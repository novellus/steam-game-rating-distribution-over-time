    review: 'This is almost funny! A company which doesn''t pay its taxes and gets
      a refund anyway tries to posture as a patriot by donating some money from a
      lousy microtransaction to vets all while collecting BILLIONS of dollars of refunds
      from the nation they won''t pay taxes to. Disgusting, manipulative garbage!
