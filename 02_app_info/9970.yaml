    review: "I enjoyed playing Star Raiders on my Atari 400 system when I was younger\
      \ and seeing a remake of the game made me a bit excited. The graphics are good\
      \ for a game that is 8 years old. Unfortunately the controls were a mess. Mouse\
      \ control was almost non existant, trying to turn my ship had me rolling the\
      \ mouse across the desk multiple times, keyboard binding is very unintuitive\
      \ and difficult to really understand. I tried using my Logitech Dual Action\
      \ controller but the game did not recognize that there are two joysticks. \n\
      \nI would not recomend this game to anyone."
