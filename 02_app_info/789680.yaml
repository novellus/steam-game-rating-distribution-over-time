    review: "Love the cartoonish graphics and controls are really fast and smooth.\
      \ Love the animation and the way my mech looks. For 1.99, this game is a fun\
      \ retro-ish shooter arcade game. Would love to see the developer expand on this\
      \ more. Keep the graphics and controls the same but add more features. Add more\
      \ weapons that can be switched too. Missiles, machine guns, Bombs and mines.\
      \ Create an open world and missions to go on. \n\nThe game is very linear and\
      \ the weapons feel pretty much the same."
