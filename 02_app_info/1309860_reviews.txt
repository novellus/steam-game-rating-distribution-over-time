The third instalment of the \"Family Mysteries\" has nothing to do with the great detective story of part one or with the sci-fi abomination that was part two. It's a mediocre game but OK. I was not bored.\n\nPositive\n+ The story is fine\n+ The graphics are really nice (as usual)\n+ Cutscenes \n+ The sound and music are good\n+ Map \n+ Collectables\n+ There is an extra chapter, which is OK\n\nNegative\n- a handful of potholes\n- no Journal, just objectives\n- The narration is just OK\n- The Character portraits are not that good\n- the minigame were not very good\n\nIf you're interested, buy it on sale.\n","timestamp_created":1610050082,"timestamp_updated":1610050082,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzdKd7/YCeMKuwQI="}
