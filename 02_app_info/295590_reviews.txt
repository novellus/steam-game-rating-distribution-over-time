Which is essentially the same game with some minor graphical and quality of life improvements. In the original you have to play it in windows mode, there is no choice. There is no graphics option, there is, no real options to speak of. While I can somewhat understand why people are upset the developer released a \"new\" game, I don't think its entirely fair.[/i] \n\nThere is enough improvement in the new game over the old game that I can understand the developer wanting paid for that work and not offering it as patches to the original game. The developer even offered anyone that had copy of the original game a discount on Regen. I didn't get to take advantage of that discount (they basically sent out steam coupons that did expire, but at the time I wasn't really picking up games or getting on steam much at all, so missed out on them. However, they did send me several over the course of like a year or two) I will say that Regen does open with a very similar launcher I've seen in some independent demos and betas. That's kind of jank, but it's whatever, at the end of the day it doesn't really matter or change anything. \n\nWhen I got the original game it was regular retail of $14.99, instead of the regular retail of $5.99 it has today (and I paid full price). I was not upset back then, and felt like original version of the game was worth what I paid. So obviously I think it's worth the current $5.99, and if you can get it on discount then even better. I would still recommend this game, in either it's original form, or the newer Regen version. It's easy to pick up and play, but  deceptively challenging  and deep, for such a simple presentation and package. It's certainly not a game for everyone, so I'd recommend watching some game play videos to see if it's the kind of game you might enjoy. \n\n[u]So let's say you've decided you do like this game and you want to know what version you should get. Well here are some things to consider:[/u] \n\n[list]\n[*]Are you ok with playing in a medium sized window you can't resize? \n[*]Do you want the soundtrack but don't care about the art book? \n[*]Do you care about the art book, but not the soundtrack? \n[*]Do you think slightly better graphics, full screen mode, save slots, and upgraded options are worth $10?\n[/list]\n[i]And, here is why those questions matter when making this decision[/i]\n\nThe only way to get the soundtrack (here on Steam)  is to buy the original version of the game with the collector's edition. There is no offering for the soundtrack on it's own or with the Regen version of the game. If you get the collector's edition of the original game (that must be played in windowed and lacks several quality of life upgrades) you will get the art book and the soundtrack. \n\nIf you get the Regen version of the game, then you automatically get the art book (the exact same art book as is offered with the collector's edition of the original version of the game) you will have a game that has slightly better polished graphics, with lots of quality of life upgrades to the options, but you will not be able to get the soundtrack, and you will pay $14.99 (assuming you pay full retail price) as opposed to $5.99.","timestamp_created":1593420966,"timestamp_updated":1593422099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462437629699707031","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o/bW//ICc5KjkQI="}
