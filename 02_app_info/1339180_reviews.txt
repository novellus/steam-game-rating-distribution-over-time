It's mostly just walking around an island to do some very basic fetch quests and puzzle solving to read humorous texts. Think a pokemon game without battling. I'd say it's worth the price if you need a good game that can run on anything. I play it in 10 minute bursts and I think it's better that way since you don't overdue it.
