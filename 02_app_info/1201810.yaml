    review: 'This title tells us that it takes the puzzle logic of Unlock the King
      into three dimensions with 70 original  puzzles. Now, I didn''t cross-reference
      the original game, but the first few - those for learning the basic mechanic
      if one hasn''t played the original - are likely the same, or as close as not
      to matter. Indeed, the first 20-odd puzzles are all so simplistic as to not
      be worth counting for those who have played the original. There are a further
      dozen mid-game puzzles where new mechanics are introduced which are likewise
      filler - one click to solve, no opportunity to get it wrong - puzzles.


      But there is further disappointment. A lot of the puzzles simply have their
      boards extruded, but they remain 2D. Yes, the piece is on a different level,
      but rotate the board to look down on it from above and it''s no different than
      the original. (Side note disappointment, the rotation mechanism is limited by
      the Z axis and a hard floor; there isn''t full freedom to look at the puzzle
      from every direction.)


      Of the 70 levels, 7 are flat-portal puzzles, introducing the portal mechanism;
      one is an absurdly simplistic portal onto another surface. In effect, of 70
      , only 17 are real 3D unlock-the-king puzzles. Less than half of those are in
      any way challenging. A few are nicely tricky. But there is so much fluff in
      this game that it''s hard to justify the price, even with it being so low.'
