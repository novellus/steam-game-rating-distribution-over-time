    review: "On balance, I don't think I'm going to recommend this. \n\nThe puzzles\
      \ are sometimes quite obscure and there are not enough clues in your environment.\
      \ \n\nCoupled with this, on two play-throughs when I was given a particular\
      \ safe code, the code didn't work, whereas after consulting a walkthrough I\
      \ found that this was a bug. There is too many things that betray the mechanism\
      \ of solving puzzles  here (like this). I ended up not trusting the game to\
      \ be fair with its solutions.\n\nAlso, it's really difficult to grab things.\
      \ Without a walkthrough you'll miss loads of items because you'll assume you\
      \ can't pick them up after trying 2 or 3 times."
