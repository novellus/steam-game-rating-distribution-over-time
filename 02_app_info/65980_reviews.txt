Compatibility issues with Windows 10 (game usually not working after install and require some skills to try to make it running), \n2. Incompatibility with a new hardware, \n3. Game's out of support state. \nSo basically, that means you are buying it on your own risk without any warranty.\n\nUpdate: I appreciate your comments. Just have to say what I do not have a huge problems with mentioned game on my desktop PC (compatibility mode fix only), but I have problems with this game on my laptop which has an integrated and discrete graphic. Problems was unsolvable  by using compatibility mode. This is a workstation grade laptop which I can not reinstall or play with drivers so easy. So yes, I still think it is unacceptable to ask 40 euro (+30 euro for Rising Tide DLC) for a game which is not supported anymore and which you are buying by relying only on steam community support. \nI would strongly recommend to avoid this overpriced junk or at least to try it by using Demo before making purchase.","timestamp_created":1600987670,"timestamp_updated":1609899932,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":107,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.791736960411071777","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlu/g6vYCc//rowI="}
