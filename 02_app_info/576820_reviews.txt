I bought tons of games in SS17, but this was the first game out of the bunch I immediately went back to, to complete, just couldn't stop thinking about it :)\n\nThe levels are very well made, they teach you the mechanics without you (probably) noticing, they vary in difficulty and design, and a few surprises sure had me chuckle :P Even if it's all just shapes and lines, they do communicate.\n\nWhile the graphics look simple in screenshots, I have nothing to complain about, mainly because the lighting is quite sublime. The orbs actually light up the environment and when they change color, so does the light that spills out over the surfaces. Lighting is so very important in VR, and I think here they did a good job with it.\n\nI bought this at -20% at a whim, and I'm happy I did, would buy it again at full price without hesitation :D","timestamp_created":1498513755,"timestamp_updated":1498513755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t6mY89wCdaWffQ=="}
