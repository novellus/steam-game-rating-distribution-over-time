    detailed_description: "<h1>Before you start</h1><p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></h2><br>Before\
      \ using PSMoveService for the first time, you will need to follow the instructions\
      \ in the &quot;Initial Setup Documentation&quot; section of the PSMoveService\
      \ Wiki (View the manual). <br><br>It is recommended to use the &quot;IPISoft\
      \ PS3EYEDriver&quot; driver for the Sony Playstation Eye camera (link given\
      \ in &quot;PSEye Software Setup&quot; section of the PSMoveService Wiki).<br><br>You\
      \ can launch the &quot;PSMoveConfigTool&quot; described in the Wiki by selecting\
      \ the &quot;Configure PSMoveService&quot; option from the iVRy &quot;Launch&quot;\
      \ button. PSMoveService will be started automatically.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>NOTE:</strong></h2><br>PSMoveService\
      \ is experimental &quot;alpha&quot; quality software. It is provided in DLC\
      \ form as a convenience for those users who wish to experiment with it. It is\
      \ complicated to set up, not suitable for all purposes, with no guarantee of\
      \ success. If you are not comfortable with experimental software, that requires\
      \ a lot of tweaking, and may not be suitable for your purposes, then please\
      \ do not use it. It is not, under any circumstances, to be considered as &quot;production\
      \ level quality&quot; software. It is open-source software, made by volunteers,\
      \ in their free time.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What\
