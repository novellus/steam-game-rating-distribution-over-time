    review: 'Not gonna lie, I really had high hopes for this. I was hoping the game
      would be so bad it''s good, but it was actually just boring. I think it was
      supposed to be a stealth game, but usually you only get around 1-2 axe kills
      before you get caught and then it''s just a subpar action shooter with mostly
      boring cutscenes, terrible stock music and sound effects. The gunplay itself
      is alright, but most weapons are useless, because the moment you peek out you
      get shot by every enemy in the area and so you will use the machinegun pretty
      much through the entire playthrough since it kills enemies the fastest and it''s
      grenade barrel for ranged enemies. The story was also just boring and bad, but
      not in a comedic way.


      The game is also difficult af, but it comes from all the enemies knowing where
      you are, firing non stop at you and they do insane damage.


      Time to finish the game: 7,4 hours'
