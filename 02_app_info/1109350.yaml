    review: "The Governor is a gem even in its Alpha-stage. \n\nREMEMBER this is an\
      \ ALPHA game!!!\n\nThere's only a single developer working on this project,\
      \ and so far, he has done an exceptional job creating a western frontier with\
      \ lots of detail. Sadly there is limited gameplay, and battle mechanics are\
      \ not great. You can easily beat bots without a real strategy. \n\nA few things\
      \ to mention about the game is that you start off controlling the capital city\
      \ surrounded by different tribes, settlements, and villages. Your goal is to\
      \ unite these places under your state to win.  As mentioned before, there is\
      \ a lot of beautiful detail for a game in this price range. A significant part\
      \ of this game is building structures in which you can hire employees and earn\
      \ revenue to build more buildings to attract skilled workers so you can buy\
      \ more buildings or invest in settlements to gain favor. \n\nYour citizens will\
      \ protect your settlements that are under your protection from bandits. You\
      \ don't necessarily have to protect every tribe or village, but it's a good\
      \ idea if you don't want to lose any reputation points.\n\nAre you interested\
      \ yet? If not, that is understandable. Alpha games don't get much love, and\
      \ usually, I wouldn't spend money on getting one. Still, this game shows a lot\
      \ of promise, and the sole developer in this project has shown a lot of compassion\
      \ and dedication that I feel confident supporting the game because I know it\
      \ will be worth it. \n\nIf you're not interested in buying the game in its current\
      \ state, then I would recommend keeping up with it. So far, I'm enjoying it\
      \ and am supporting the project.\n\n**Things I wish to see in this game would\
      \ include better battle mechanics, in which case weapons can do a lot more damage,\
      \ so it would be a better idea to invest in dodging or taking cover instead\
      \ of ganging up on a bandit one at a time. \n\nWhen I think of the wild west,\
      \ I think of wagon convoys that can trade goods and have to need protection\
      \ from bandits and hostile tribes."
