But no, it looks like this time we will have to deal with a more dangerous enemy - BOOTS !!! Jokes aside, we have a brand new platformer made in black and white style. It may seem that you have already seen such games a bunch of times, and this one will not surprise you with anything. Well, you are partly right, of course, but I still decided to devote a couple of hours to this game and discovered a couple of funny things there. Firstly, the game really tells about the fight between boots and plants, but at the same time the protogonist here is a boot, and what is more, in HUMAN form, armed with a pistol with endless cartridges. It sounds absurd, but it is. In general, if you are looking for innovative gameplay, then this game is clearly not for you, but if you just want to pass a couple of hours cheerfully, you can safely take it for a rather modest price of $ 0.89.","timestamp_created":1609835603,"timestamp_updated":1609835603,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4w7zr6PYCc+fRwAI="}
