    about_the_game: "One of the crucial elements of Kingdom Come: Deliverance is medieval\
      \ combat, which we at Warhorse Studios developed similarly to the other aspects\
      \ of the game, i.e. as faithfully as possible, in order to show how medieval\
      \ warriors really fought. The documentary Fechtbuch is a record of what we learned\
      \ in pursuit of that goal, and a guide to some of the secrets of historical\
      \ martial arts. <br><br>In the course of shooting this film, we asked the leading\
      \ Czech and Slovak fencers and martial artists who assisted in bringing combat\
      \ to life in our game to explain and demonstrate the basic principles and techniques\
      \ of medieval combat. We will show you arms and armour, present various schools\
      \ of swordfighting and, together with the combat masters, contemplate the significance\
      \ of knightly learning in the past and today, six hundred years later. <br><br>See\
      \ what it looks like when a true master takes a sword into his hand!<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Featuring:</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Peter Koza, Tostabur &amp; Magisterium</h2><br>Peter\
      \ Koza is regarded as essentially the founder of historical martial arts in\
      \ former Czechoslovakia. The first generation of modern historical fencers emerged\
      \ under his guidance and practically every serious HEMA school in Czechia and\
      \ Slovakia, whether concerned with stage performance or authentic re-enactment,\
      \ somehow owes a debt to his heritage. In Fechtbuch, he speaks of the spiritual\
      \ aspects of martial arts and their history, as well as demonstrating with relish\
      \ the intricacies of the varied approaches of the main historical fencing schools.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Petr N\u016Fsek, ARGO</h2><br>Petr N\u016Fsek is primarily\
      \ a martial artist, but is also the leading Czech combat choreographer. He has\
      \ lent his expertise to numerous European and Hollywood movies, worked as a\
      \ stuntman and stunt coach and is an occasional actor and stunt double. He acted\
      \ as an advisor for Kingdom Come: Deliverance and choreographed combat and battle\
      \ scenes. In the documentary Fechtbuch he tells us something about combat choreography\
      \ as well as about martial arts as a particular pathway through life, irrespective\
      \ of the century in which it is enacted.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Petr Vytopil, Paridon</h2><br>Petr\
      \ Vytopil, the leading Czech fencing tutor, presents in the documentary Fechtbuch\
      \ the principles of swordfighting, in particular the offensive German school\
      \ and its emphasis on the \u201CVor\u201D method \u2013 i.e. the importance\
      \ of maintaining pressure on the opponent and foreseeing his every move before\
      \ he has a chance to execute it. Petr is an expert on the German school of fencing\
      \ and fighting in armour and also tells us something about how medieval swordfighting\
      \ is re-enacted today.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Robert Waschka, House of Knightly\
      \ Virtues in Brno</h2><br>Robert Waschka of the House of Knightly Virtues in\
      \ Brno was the lead combat advisor for Kingdom Come: Deliverance and all the\
      \ fencing techniques you see in the game are derived from his movements. Robert\
      \ teaches fencing and conducts workshops in the use of different weapons in\
      \ various styles and schools of combat. In the documentary Fechtbuch, he explains\
      \ how he became involved in fencing and what it means for him, shows us how\
      \ to hold a longsword and where to strike an opponent... and when it\u2019s\
      \ not a good idea to talk to your adversary.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat scenes\
