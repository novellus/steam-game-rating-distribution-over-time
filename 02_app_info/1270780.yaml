    review: 'Strangely compelling and different type of Tower Defense game. I find
      the game reasonably relaxing and challenging at the same time (really enjoying
      the 8 different "soundscapes" for each level).


      Struggled through my first few attempts, notwithstanding the onboard help tells
      you most of what you need to know.


      Looking forward to progressing through the levels.'
