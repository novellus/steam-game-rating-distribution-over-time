    review: 'This game is fantastic, there is a great sense of rivalry between teams
      and players.  I love the ability to expand the league as time goes on (started
      with a small 8 team league and have expanded to 12 teams).


      I hate that I can''t accept or decline penalties, sacked a QB for a 13 yard
      loss but they were holding so it was down over with only a 10 yard loss.  But
      that''s the only problem I have with this game.


      Overall, spectacular game and a blast to play.'
