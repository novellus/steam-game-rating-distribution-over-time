A very off-beat experience that is somewhat light on gameplay.\nHaving done a single playthrough, I don't necessarily feel much sense of accomplishment, but there are parts of the game that I would replay and share with friends, which I believe is what the author set out to do.","timestamp_created":1477087934,"timestamp_updated":1542666102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539551079273223877","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz5SEl+cCd4XiYw=="}
