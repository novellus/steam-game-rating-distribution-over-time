The game starts off with a small story about the situation.  They show you the zombies you will encounter.  You must click certain buttons to kill that zombie.  For example, one can only be killed by clicking the space bar and jump,jump,jump to kill him.  I'm not joking here.  The others are shake the mouse, click the mouse.  There is only one bad guy who cannot be killed so you just run away from him.  He was clipped in a chair so it was easy to avoid that one.  To make matters worse in the bug department the only gameplay is running around to find ten paintings which will lead you to a key and I guess to the very end of the game which would make the gameplay 10 to 15 minutes total.  I \"guess\" because upon trying to play the game twice one of the paintings (randomly placed every playthrough) was placed between 2 immovable chairs so there was no way to pick up the painting.  Refund requested. \n The game has been out for almost 2 years and we still have some glaring issues here.
