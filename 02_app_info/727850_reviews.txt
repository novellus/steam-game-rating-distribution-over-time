The melee combat is pretty good, the soundtrack does its job, and it is as straightforward as you can get if you want a fast Dark Souls style melee combat game like Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. It is a smart dumb game for people who just want to see what happens when a blade or a club hits the side of a monster's head over and over again, and it satisfies that itch. I really love charging up to a monster on the side of a cliff, slamming my foot into its chest, and seeing it tumble before I whip around and parry a swordman's attack for another kill! The kick functionality is as good and possibly better than Dark Messiah's, and there are plenty of opportunities to embarrass enemies with it, and I love a good kick. \n\nHowever! It has a strong beginning, but I feel like the game starts to fall apart during the second and completely disappoints during the third. I don't feel like the mastery system and the challenges add much of anything to character development, which basically asks \"do you want attacks to do more damage, be faster, or do you want more HP?\" with some useful perks inbetween. The first chapter is excellent, the second is open world but less good, and the third was disappointing because all it turned out to be was 15 minutes of rehashed fights instead of [spoiler]exploring the weird fucking alien UFO I just found myself on, I mean, how do you get transported onto a UFO from a Conan the Barbarian style environment and not allow the player to explore that? The game probably took long enough to develop but this is a disappointing note to end on.[/spoiler] The breaking point for me was when the game crashed just as I was about to complete it. My victory over the hordes, ruined by Unity pitching a fit and crashing as I pulled my weapon out of the last barbarian's guts. I know about this because I then went to Youtube and looked up if there was anything else that happened in that chapter. That sucks, man.\n\nSo I recommend it, but I'd wait for another patch or content update if it's coming.","timestamp_created":1610082307,"timestamp_updated":1610082472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhJqZ8PYCfOK6wQI="}
