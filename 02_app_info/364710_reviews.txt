Sadly, they seem to have abandoned it. \n\nThis game concept has so much potential I am disappointed that the developers didn't fix all the issues and expand the game.\n\nI would have loved to see lots of stuff added, like level editors, modding kit, and more game modes.  It is a real shame that the developers decided to leave the game how it is.  \n\nDue to the fact the developers seem unwilling to update the game or improve it, I'd only recommend it if you can grab it for next to nothing on sale like I did. Honestly, if you're paying next to nothing for it, the game is good for a few laughs and an little bit of entertainment, even if it's not perfect, and certainly not a finished product.\n\nWho would like this game:\nPeople who love quirky silly games (Goat simulator fans, and I am Bread fans, you'll like this one.)\nThose who can get it on sale for next to nothing. \n\nWho would not like this game:\nPeople who are infuriated by bugs.\nPeople who can't handle oversensitive controls.\nPeople who can't enjoy a game that is clearly not finished.\nPeople who lack a sense of humor or don't like silly little toy games.","timestamp_created":1451615264,"timestamp_updated":1569484549,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.419649958610534668","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uLWktu0CdYn3TA=="}
