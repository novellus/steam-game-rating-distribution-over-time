I really wanted this game to succeed. I know my time with this game is short but you don't need long to find out you just bought a game that has a lot to fix. First match in the game, I played just a random match and I got hit into the stage and was stuck with no way out. Then, I played another and actually got to move around a little and it was really slow. It's kind of hard to figure out the hit boxes and motion of the characters. It's really odd. I didn't understand what was going on. I figured, Why not let the computers fight it out and see what this game can do? I set a match with the computer fighting each other and set the levels to the max. Wow, was I amazed on how funny that match was. One of the character just stood there didn't move at all just swinging away. There was some points in the match where two characters would team up on one character just simply ignoring each other. I thought that was pretty clever or just bad coding. Then one character got knocked on the ground and just laid there the rest of the match and didn't get up at all. When the match was left with just two, the one on the ground just laid there and the other character didn't know how to attack him. The match would have gone on forever. It was funny to watch but I was mostly upset. This game can be a seriously great competitive fighting game. Not at this state though. \n\nAnyway, This game needs help. The DEVS just need to hit the reset button and listen to the people. In my opinion, I think they should either put this in some type of early access if they can or do a MASSIVE update patch that completely changes the gameplay. The changes I would focus on first is the speed of the game. I think it needs to be quiet a bit faster. Everything seems really \"Floaty\". We got to have much tighter attacks, moves, and combos. The moves and attacks are super choppy. Some of the characters attacks are almost pointless. Last but not least, the hit boxes.  I shouldn't have to kiss someone if I want to punch them.\n\nI'm not a pro and by no means do I know what it takes to makes these changes. I'm sure these changes I suggest will take A LOT of coding and man hours but I would argue to sell this game at its current state was a bad decision. There are so many ways to put your product out and listen to what the community has to say. I'm not giving up on this game. I just cant give a thumbs up right now. I will change my recommendation if they decide to change almost everything about this game as far as gameplay. The art style isn't bad. I kind of wish they kept the original art of every character. That would have been pretty bad a$$. Well hope this helps everyone's decision when purchasing. I also hope the devs read this willing to make some changes. Best of wishes to the team. Great idea that needs a lot of help.","timestamp_created":1609896138,"timestamp_updated":1609896138,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0bLS6vYCd+HvwAI="}
