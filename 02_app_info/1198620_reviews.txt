While I have no issue implementing it myself, I don't think it is something I /should/ have to do if I am paying for the module. Otherwise, The reference material is great, and hope that the fantasy grounds conversion gets the love it deserves.","timestamp_created":1594777904,"timestamp_updated":1594778184,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlP2LqPMCd9GtlQI="}
