Players being tackled when the closet opposing team member was about 3 inches on the screen, which is about 5 yards in the game, away.\n2. Field goal success rate not always reliable. I know that when it says there is a 97% chance of making it the field goal might not make it, however when only about 60% of my field goals went in, not counting extra points, and the majority of the attempts said there was over a 80% chance of making it there is a problem.\n3. Why is it that the receiver my qb was throwing to gets hit before the ball even gets there?\n4. Receivers will be wide open and qb won't see them or the pass is incomplete, however there will be completed passes in heavy traffic. QB was 8/8/6 and some of the wide open misses were about 15 yards away and the qb not seeing open receivers were anywhere from 5-25 yards away.","timestamp_created":1566432942,"timestamp_updated":1566432942,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481181502342224121","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+7qr2+wCe4vp0AE="}
