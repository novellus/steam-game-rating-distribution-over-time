(Also I failed to mention this and the Story/Campaign/Arcade modes in my full review.)\n\nI really am having a great time with this mode so far.  You have the double flippers like Time Machine (SS) and hitting the sets of drop targets is very important (like Time Machine) and you might even say the long shots for missile fire is also like Time Machine's past mode.  All these comparisons are certainly not a riff on the table because I quite love Time Machine.  There's also a lot of ways to freeze/burn/gas/tornado the Zombies.  The fun thing about this mode that no real table can offer (probably any time soon if ever) is the Zombies that will spawn and walk down the table and, yes, the ball bounces off them and can damage them.  This makes for some panicked gameplay of trying to dodge zombies to get to the targets you want or panic smacking them a bunch of times with the ball because the gunners helping you ran out of ammo (the drop targets).  \n\nI think it's a nice break from normal pinball and worth the money.  The only people that should probably avoid this are ones who want a serious table and don't want to have silly fun and get mad at those stupid Zombies always getting in the way of the ball.  I personally got it as part of the Platinum bundle but I also didn't really wait long to decide to buy that.  I wouldn't have been mad if I bought this full price before the bundle.","timestamp_created":1608323686,"timestamp_updated":1608323686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5/vju/YCf/aiuwI="}
