      mod, which detonates the shield when it goes down, blasting all nearby enemies.
      <strong>Flash Shielding</strong> gets it running again quickly while <strong>Emergency
      Systems</strong> grant a moment of damage immunity, making charge attacks safer.

    short_description: Nova Drift distills the mechanical depth and strategy of an
      ARPG into classic arcade space combat. Control an endlessly evolving bio-mechanical
      ship, face legions of strange and deadly foes, and ride the wake of a dying
      star across the void.
