    review: "It's Peggle, but worse.\n\nThe gameplay is alright. You shoot apples,\
      \ and if your orange lands in the basket, you get it back. I've had several\
      \ experiences where an orange got stuck on the side because an apple blocked\
      \ the way down, softlocking the level.\n\nFor the current price of 3,99\u20AC\
      , it's not worth it."
