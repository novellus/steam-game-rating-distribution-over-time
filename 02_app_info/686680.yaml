    reviews: "\u201CDidn\u2019t expect Computer Tycoon to go so further into details,\
      \ yet it was a pleasant surprise nonetheless. As the Steam debut of a single\
      \ talented individual called Andris, Computer Tycoon aimed high and didn\u2019\
      t miss its target.\u201D<br>8/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.ticgn.com/news/preview-computer-tycoon-steam-early-access/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >TICGN</a><br><br>\u201CYou get a lot\
      \ of value for your game and you get a developer who listens to the community\
      \ and tries to improve the game so that as many people as possible can enjoy\
      \ this game. He doesn\u2019t need to do a lot to make me enjoy this game since\
      \ I\u2019m already doing that!\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://arpegi.wordpress.com/2017/11/02/first-impression-computer-tycoon-pc-steam-computers-everywhere/\"\

      \ game is still in its alpha stages, and so continues to be improved upon as\
      \ time goes on, in its current form Computer Tycoon presents a solid, fun experience\
      \ and I\u2019m greatly enjoying my time with it. It hearkens back to the old\
      \ Tycoon games with its simple concept while also presenting a fascinating and\
      \ somewhat difficult business challenge to survive for over half a century in\
      \ a technology field.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://ambigamingcorner.com/2017/11/09/computer-tycoon/\"\

    review: I won't pretend this is a masterful example of a strategy game, or that
      it is well-polished or well-written. BUT it very much feels like it was made
      by someone with a love for computers and their history, and I find that very
      charming and lovable.
