It's a choose your own adventure, point and click with suprise twists. Very well thought out and written. Especially if you are a Nancy Drew fan although you definitely don't have to be a fan to enjoy it. Arlgefumph knows Nancy drew very well. He illustrated and wrote the dialogue, which in life he is very sarcastic. XD It's a great game, I highly recommend it!! My husband and I loved it. You can play it for days, takes bit to beat 100% but not impossible if you're up for the challenge ;) Can't wait for the next game!","timestamp_created":1517791786,"timestamp_updated":1517791786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534741640090942383","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwZbcseECeZuFmAE="}
