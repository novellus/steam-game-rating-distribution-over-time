    about_the_game: In this expansion, you can choose the languid Sphinx, Grozdana
      Kakra for your new First Mate. Doing so will lead the two of you into a romance
      of (incompetent) royal proportions, and as you learn more about her she'll surprise
      you with secrets, and impress you with her hidden depths (in more ways than
      one, of course). A new piece of the Mutiny!! story, new CGs and choices and
      visual novel excitement!

    short_description: Grozdana is an adorable Sphinx-girl, and the dethroned Princess
      of an mysterious land... she also happens to be an immodest Tsundere, and terrifically
      lazy. What she wants out of life are as much a mystery to her as they are to
      the Captain.

    review: I really like this route, but it feels like it doesn't feel like Dana
      didn't have a large amount of character development (as in growing as a person).  It
      feels like she's starting to, but is not quite there.  I'm excited for future
      expansions.
