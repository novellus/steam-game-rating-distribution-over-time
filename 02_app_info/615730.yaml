    reviews: "\u201CThe graphics are crisp and detailed; character management is clear;\
      \ hints are available at the junior level; voice acting and sound are nicely\

      Her Interactive, the makers of the game, describe their corporate mission as\
      \ \u201CTo lead the industry towards a new standard of intelligent interactive\
      \ entertainment for girls\u201D. I don\u2019t know about the industry, but there\
