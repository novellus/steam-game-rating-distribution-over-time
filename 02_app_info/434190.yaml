    review: "This is the softest recommend I'm ever going to give.  As soft as that\
      \ therapy pillow your chiropractor told you to buy for night-time neck pain...fluffier\
      \ than that favorite, 10 year old heavy blanket you sleep under every winter\
      \ season...about on par with that baby duck Aunt Gertrude bought you when you\
      \ were 3.  Yeah, you get the picture.  Though Follia - Dear Father has gotten\
      \ a lot of knocks for being an Outlast clone, I'm going to say that other than\
      \ the first act I really didn't get that vibe much at all.  No sir, instead\
      \ this at times oddly fun, cliche-ridden attempted scarefest is more just generally\
      \ a pastiche of every horror game ever made rather than content to mime one\
      \ particular title.  \n\nYou star as near silent hero Marcus Pitt and one day\
      \ while sleeping in front of your computer after a big boy Miller Lite bender,\
      \ you wake up conveniently to find an email alerting of trouble afoot at the\
      \ Frederick Fidelity University.  With a flick of your trusty bong-lighting\
      \ torch you get a call from your useless friend Ryan and instead of suggesting\
      \ to call the authorities, he gives Marcus the brilliant idea that they should\
      \ investigate the problem on their own.  Your able and trusty sidekick Ryan\
      \ parks the car and leaves you to your own devices to investigate a literal\
      \ campus of terror.  \n\nLet's face it, not all video game plots are stellar\
      \ but if you get my gist, Follia has one of the most disposable tales told of\
      \ all time on display.  It's rendered even more archaic by a small list of notes\
      \ and documents that neither have the content let alone the writing to make\
      \ them even worth collecting.  Twisted labs and mad experiments are the order\
      \ of the day in the university's science wing and that's about all you need\
      \ to know without me ruining the \"finer\" elements.  \n\nOriginality is not\
      \ a strong suit in the RE lifted door/gate opening animations, the aforementioned\
      \ story, the Outlast heavy quiet \"sneak into the building\" intro, etc.  You're\
      \ going to be hitting switches, running from monsters, recharging a flashlight\
      \ with batteries, finding keys, the works...  There should be nothing to enjoy\
      \ at all in Follia but on some odd level the core parts of the gameplay and\
      \ the clashes with a variety of different monster types pushed me to get to\
      \ the next area and see what troubles there were to solve.  In terms of putting\
      \ up with the small but consistently varied roster of threats, that's where\
      \ Follia got enough juice to sustain one playthrough.  I wish I would have started\
      \ the game on hardcore as it's not overly challenging (some of the one kill\
      \ deaths are absolutely cheap yet don't impede progress enough to be frustrating)\
      \ though that's not a bottle of spilled milk I'm about to cry over.   \n\nMarcus\
      \ can run, push objects, crouch, crawl and hide.  There's also a very tiny amount\
      \ of weapons to find that you can slash and defend with that does make tangling\
      \ with the hideous college dropouts a bit more exciting than \"find the next\
      \ locker and wait for the school bully to pass.\"  Follia actually allows for\
      \ touches of aggressive gameplay that allow you to lure monsters close, slash/block\
      \ them to stun their ugly mugs and then try to get to your next mundane objective.\
      \  It's loose at best but there is a more rhythmic flow to the experience than\
      \ a lot of indie horror titles can muster up, so props need to be given there.\
      \  \n\nEven the flashlight battery system puts the pressure on you to actually\
      \ search your surroundings if you want a better light source; I personally actually\
      \ enjoyed the limited ambiance of the lighter as it added a darker atmosphere\
      \ to exploration and what seemed like a better chance at keeping the monsters\
      \ from noticing Marcus' lumbering behind.  A fleet-footed fellow he's not and\
      \ although movement controls work well-enough as expected for a horror game,\
      \ prepare for a couple of harried E/use object clicks when you're in a hurry.\
      \  Heck, even if you're not pressed for time the hitboxes for using are terribly...uh...hit\
      \ or miss.  \n\nAs far as presentation goes I enjoyed the monsters (I think\
      \ a few are Unity assets albeit they are well-implemented for each respective\
      \ location) and the lighting FX.  The environments are fairly run of the mill\
      \ and are unfortunately prone to screen tearing on certain settings.  I also\
      \ fell out of the map twice in the one late game boss fight which didn't do\
      \ much to improve my opinion of Follia's negative points.  On the soundscale,\
      \ the game fares much better with creepy wails for the monsters, adequate voice\
      \ acting for what little there is and solid environmental twinges that keep\
      \ you tense even when you are dredging the downtime between threats.  \n\nMy\
      \ caveat for this game is that there is no question whatsoever that I'm recommending\
      \ it for SALE PRICE, only.  It could use a ton of polish, the developers have\
      \ flown the chicken coop and cliches abound in every corner.  The weird thing\
      \ is that Follia is a game that actually finds a way to turn those cliches into\
      \ a constantly invigorating rhythm that gave me a kick in the pants to want\
      \ to find the next area...and never once did I have to hide in a locker or even\
      \ hide that much in the grand scheme of things.  \n\nTake all of this for what\
      \ you will.  If I was getting near the bottom of my exhaustible horror titles\
      \ and needed a new one for a sale price, there's certainly quite a few indies\
      \ that I would pick Follia over.  There are also even more games that I would\
      \ pick over Follia.  It's a better than it should be 6/10 in my book."
