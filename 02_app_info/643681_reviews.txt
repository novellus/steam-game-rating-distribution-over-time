While it is the case that FSX provides a manually navigable map that is perfectly usable, the Moving Map add-on provides a whole new level of detail, providing a larger size map, but also more readily navigable and with key data regarding airports and navigation components much more accessible.  I particularly like the interface, which is no-nonsense and arguably beautiful due to its simplicity.  Also, the maps themselves, particularly when displaying regional or national views are beautiful in themselves and a joy to view.\n\nFrom my experience, it is the case that FSX needs to be running in windowed mode, rather than full-screen, for the Moving Map to be fully accessible.  However, with a relatively modern PC on a dual screen arrangement, this is absolutely possible with, in my view, no significant cost to the overall FSX flying experience.  The Moving Map appears to be part of a larger suite of cross-platform flight simulator products available on a stand-alone basis from the website of the add-on developer.  While that suite is actually very good value, the Moving Map component available on a stand-alone format on Steam is even better value, particularly for someone like me who is more of an amateur simulation pilot, currently confining myself to pan-European cross country flights in light aircraft using Victor Airways and VOR navigation.  However, even as I make the step in due course to jets, Moving Map will likely remain fit for purpose.","timestamp_created":1609510186,"timestamp_updated":1609510186,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwY2S3/YCc5W0vwI="}
