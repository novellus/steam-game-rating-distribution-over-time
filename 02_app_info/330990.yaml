    review: It's hard to rate this game. On one hand, I got it at 90% off. On the
      other, the game itself was quite tedious and didn't live up to Artifex Mundi's
      standard. This game is older and it really shows. I found myself getting bored
      playing it. However, although the main story wasn't as fun, the bonus story
      was a little better, certainly prettier than the main game at least. I'd say
      to only get this one if it's on sale or perhaps if you intend on playing the
      whole Demon Hunter Series. Or if you really like hidden object puzzles, since
      there were so many of them in it.
