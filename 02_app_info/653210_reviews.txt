I see a lot of reviews here who have given it a thumbs down after less than hour. I should mention, that even after playing this game for, at time of writing, 11 hours, I am still pretty sure I haven't beaten the game. Yes, you can die very quickly, but you can also restart very quickly.\n\nThis isn't the sort of game where you can just play and beat it like Mario. This is game is a bit more like Dark Souls, where you bash your head against a wall until the wall breaks. This is the sort of game you need to play over and over in a vain attempt to get a little further each time.\n\nI recommend watching \"Cubed\" before you play the game. It adds to the experience.\n\nCan it be frustrating? Yes.\n\n Do I still enjoy it? Definitely!","timestamp_created":1574481151,"timestamp_updated":1574481151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wfiYy+4CeOaA3AE="}
