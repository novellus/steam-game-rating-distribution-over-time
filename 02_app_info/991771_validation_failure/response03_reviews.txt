The setup of her weaponry, generous pool of shielding and a suite of regenerative modules can excuse a few mistakes. If set up correctly, refitting from her stock configuration, she is quite capable of soaking up an insane amount of damage without the need to rely on the generosity of a friendly engineering frigate. \n  She is not without her faults though. The placement of her active modules is objectively flawed, and it can require a lot of practice and awareness to make sure the correct module is pointing at the right place at the right time. The stock configuration have powerful assets that allow you to regenerate a ridiculous amount of shielding, but those require you to push quite a bit closer than you would have liked. But still, I would say she’s worth every penny for those that have the determination to get used to her, and if she ever goes on sale, you shouldn’t hesitate to add this beautiful beast into your collection.","timestamp_created":1557217596,"timestamp_updated":1557217596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580838322639465332","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwptrZyOoCfe/dwAE="}
