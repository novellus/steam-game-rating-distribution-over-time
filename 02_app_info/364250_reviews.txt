The enemy bullets are similar to the bullets in Raiden, they're really fast.\n\nWhen I first opened the game and looked at the UI, I was like, \"Are you kidding me?\" but it's understandable considering the company financial situation. All the basic functionalities are there, like screen scaling and rotation.\n\nThe default arcade mode gives 3 credits. After you beat one stage, the score attack mode for that stage will be unlocked. So, it can be considered as stage selection for practice. After playing for a while, the game somehow gives an additional credit so the next run and onward you will start with 4 credits. I still don't know what triggered that.\n\nThe original arcade name is called XII Stag in case if you want to emulate this game.","timestamp_created":1601538188,"timestamp_updated":1601568552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxJa78vQCe8+UpQI="}
