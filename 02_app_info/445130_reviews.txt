The only reason for this is because we aren't given enough time to get to know the main character. \n\nMy point is, everyone experiences anxiety in their life and whether it's crippling or just something that you get from time to time is the important part. Here it's impossible to tell if this is just a socially challenged adolescent too baby to get out of their comfort zone or a person actually too worried about the worst case scenario to function. Anxiety is too easily described by other developmental challanges everyone goes through. This is why I am so hung up on this very important distinction and I don't believe the game does a good enough job of showing that difference.\n\nAs for the game itself. Based on the theme and it's length there are few things to say. Not being able to skip the timer sections was annoying. Because having to reset when you fail and go through it all again was annoying. The way it plays out is pretty much worst case scenario in every possible way except the decided right way. It would have been nice to explore the anxiety and watch it play out in more ways than just total meltdown or hurray I made oatmeal. Aside from that because you already know your character is going to completely break down if you don't choose the correct option it's not even fun to explore the other options at all. In fact it kind of took any sympathy I might have had for the character away. The game reinforces the idea that if a perfect scenario doesn't play out for these types of people or if they ever feel uncomfortable then they won't be able to function or have a mental break. This is just not true and again for a heavy topic just exploring the way it makes you feel and not how you live through it or deal with the difficulties when life doesn't go your way again takes away any sympathy I was feeling because it's not a good representation if you leave out those aspects.\n\nI enjoyed the first 3 minutes. It had less substance than I thought it would and I just can't recommend it for the reasons above.\n\n3/10","timestamp_created":1486805422,"timestamp_updated":1513720380,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpv+wuOACeOjrcQ=="}
