    review: "This is a game about the FBI Hostage Rescue Team being coopted as a CIA\
      \ death squad. You go from rescuing hostages and fellow FBI agents from Waco-style\
      \ separatists to breaking and entering a neutral port to murder its night staff\
      \ and steal its records, carrying out the international assassinations of businessmen\
      \ in their homes and offices, to breaking into a man's home to plant a car bomb\
      \ in his personal vehicle before detonating it without warning in the streets\
      \ of Vienna. \n\nThis game is a lot of fun despite the incongruous use of the\
      \ HRT, but the US security services did grease a lot of people in the wake of\
      \ 9/11 so maybe this is what would happen if terrorists nuked Baltimore? Who\
      \ knows! This game is basically Rainbow Six for the first mission and then goes\
      \ right past Ghost Recon into Delta Force series territory, which I love but\
      \ this game is totally gonzo and Hollywood by comparison to contemporaneous\
      \ Tom Clancy shooters. If this seems like an appealing use of the Ghost Recon/Rainbow\
      \ Six engines to you, I recommend it. You can complete it in an afternoon but\
      \ it's like a dollar a mission and that's not bad.\n\nOne thing this game does\
      \ really well is the coordinated multi-unit SWAT team room/building-takedown\
      \ thing. It does this by having your squad (optionally) follow a series of waypoints\
      \ that, if completed, will theoretically complete the mission when working in\
      \ tandem with the NPC teams (unless they get whacked, which happens, but not\
      \ often enough to be frustrating). They'll make their entries when you hit certain\
      \ waypoints, so you get a lot of dramatic but only lightly-scripted scenes where\
      \ your team enters through one door and another team exits from another and\
      \ there's a three-second firefight with whoever's in the room. You see them\
      \ streaming into doors and buildings a lot, and you encounter them around corners\
      \ a lot, but you can see them on the minimap.\n\nA lot of the time in Rainbow\
      \ Six/Ghost Recon the enemy is pretty thinly spread over the map; not here,\
      \ maps aren't that big but after the first few missions they're absolutely crawling\
      \ with bad guys to be stamped out like ants (with the same throaty, dick-hard\
      \ crowing over kills as Ghost Recon, which you'd think an FBI agent might try\
      \ to suppress, not that I'm complaining). One contribution to the Ghost Recon\
      \ engine from Rainbow Six is the lock-on-head gunsights of Rainbow Six operators;\
      \ this means that your HRT operator is more precise than the last game's Green\
      \ Berets, but given the numbers you're facing it would sometimes be better to\
      \ be able to just hose down a room with automatic gunfire instead of killing\
      \ one guy then waiting for your targeting sensors to realign on the next guy\
      \ before he turns you into hamburger because you've gotta stack corpses like\
      \ Achilles. You go from West Virginia to Lebanon to Austria; not exactly communities\
      \ hostile to the United States, but I guess in this game they contain competing\
      \ right wing death squads who must be extirpated by the CIA's right wing death\
      \ squad; not that I'm complaining, because this is fun game"
