    review: Great early-access game! The developer is really active on their discord
      about updates. This starts out as a noir detective, but then goes thriller and
      horror real fast. So much attention to detail, atmosphere, story, music.. you
      can tell this game is a labour of love. You really have to hunt around for items
      too which is cool. A few decent jump scares as well! If you buy it early access,
      you'll get the additional acts for free as part of the one time payment.
