      \ to explore, community in-game events, Star Trek ships coming Aug 29th.</i><br></li><li><i>0.6\

      \ iteration of crafting items. Users will utilize refined components to build\
      \ ships, modules, and other equipment. When crafting users will be able to discover\
      \ HIGHER tech levels of items creating more powerful equipment.</i><br></li><li><i>0.9\
      \ - Guild Management, Ships Insurance / Persistence, Crafting Update: UI to\
      \ support station and guild management will be implemented. Friends list, friendly\
      \ fire avoidance, fleet grouping, and other social features will be implemented.\

      \ - Workers / Colonist Game Mechanic, Fleet Control: Limit fleet command will\
      \ be introduced via modules &amp; workers. Advanced missions requiring work-over-time\
      \ utilizing Workers and Colonist will be implemented. Advanced research and\
      \ mining systems will be deployed to use workers and colonists. </i></li></ul><h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Universe of Opportunities</h2>As a Commander in the Galactic\
      \ Federation Fleet, you will undertake missions, discover resources, and acquire\
      \ skills in your quest to dominate the galactic frontier. Explore the vast expanse\
      \ but be warned, the further you travel from home the greater the danger.<br><br>Your\
      \ journey begins as an adventurous miner hunting rare resources in the depths\
      \ of Fringe Space. Become a master crafter of high-tech modules, equipment,\
      \ starships, or even a fully player-owned station. Perhaps you'll focus your\
      \ attention on supporting the growth of the Galactic Federation by transporting\
      \ consumer goods, resources, colonists, and workers to new outposts, earning\
      \ valuable credit. Or you could armor and equip your starship to hunt for pirates\
      \ and other treasures in dangerous and unsettled space. Keen on building a business\
      \ empire? Then dominate the markets by buying, selling, and trading valuable\
      \ goods from around the cosmos. The choice is yours... What destiny will you\
      \ choose? <br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/895040/extras/AvengerShip.jpg?t=1607392568\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Starships</h2>In CSC you, our Commander, can own and\
      \ operate your very own starships. Starships come in all shapes and sizes and\
      \ are specialized in either mining, combat, trade, or exploration. Starships\
      \ in CSC can be endlessly customized with modules. Modules can add or upgrade\
      \ existing ship functionality from shields and weapons to FTL drives. <br><img\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Economy</h2>Almost everything in the CSC universe can\
      \ be crafted from resources openly available in the universe. The smallest shield\
      \ module up to a universe-wide jump gate network can all be made with the right\
      \ materials. Create new technology and share it freely for the good of the federation\
      \ or sell it for the right price.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/895040/extras/CSC-Alpha-6_21_2019-2_23_50-PM_2_v2.gif?t=1607392568\"\
      \ /><br><br>The crafting system is uncapped, allowing players to continually\
      \ improve on the quality of their crafted items. Specialization is encouraged\
      \ by the CSC crafting mechanic, rewarding players for focusing on specific items\
      \ &amp; allowing them to create truly unique and valuable starship weapons or\
      \ other components. <br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/895040/extras/CSC-Alpha-7_1_2019-4_44_21-PM.gif?t=1607392568\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Exploration</h2>Rules are merely suggestions in some\
      \ parts of space. Areas under GFI protection do exist, and are open to explore\
      \ and mine to your heart\u2019s content, but the best loot is out there in Fringes\
      \ of Space. Beware, dangers of all kinds are in the fringe: creatures, pirates,\
      \ rogue Commanders, and faction governments. Those brave enough to venture deep\
      \ into Fringe Space however will find an abundance of rare resources, larger\
      \ bounties, and more lucrative quests.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/895040/extras/CSC-Alpha-7_1_2019-4_25_27-PM.gif?t=1607392568\"\

    review: Devs only work on useless events to grab your money and get some temporary
      new players instead of working at bugs.... most players leave after a while
      cause the game looks like dead,  you cant sell your stuff cause there is no
      playerbase!!!
