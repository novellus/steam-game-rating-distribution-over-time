      Edition of Devil May Cry 4, the ultimate version of the smash-hit stylish action
      game!<br><br>Devil May Cry 4 immerses gamers in a gothic supernatural world,
      where a new protagonist clashes with a familiar hero. As the new leading man,
      Nero, players will unleash incredible attacks and non-stop combos using a unique
      new gameplay mechanic, his powerful &quot;Devil Bringer&quot; arm. <br><br>On
      the coast of a distant land lies the castle town of Fortuna. It is here that
      the group known as the Order of the Sword practices a mysterious religion. They
      revere the demon warrior Sparda, who as their god fought to protect humans,
      and are committed to the extermination of all demons. Nero, a young knight from
      the Order, is tasked with finding Dante, the mysterious assassin who murdered
      the head of the Order of the Sword. At the same time, more demons begin to appear
      throughout the city. Nero will soon come to discover the motives behind Dante's
      appearance and the truth behind the intentions of the Order of the Sword.<br><strong><h2

    review: Its a half finished game Enemies levels and bosses get reused clearly
      this game is design with only Nero in mind everything else is an afterthought
      and special edition highlights the problems even more by adding more playable
      characters that goes thru the same thing BUT despite that the gameplay is great
      and fun which is the only reason why I find myself keep playing and since DMC
      5 is out I recommend playing that instead since it's a more better, realised
      and a finished game
