    review: '[url=http://www.the-backlog.net/initial-thoughts-tribequest-red-killer/]My
      full thoughts can be found on The Backlog. I will do a full review if/when this
      ever leaves Early Access.[/url]


      TribeQuest: Red Killer is yet another mobile port to hit the Steam storefront.
      After the game had no reviews for nearly a week I decided to just drop the .99
      and give it a try. The first major thing to note is that the game in the trailer
      is a much older version of the game (3 years old), and the game in the screenshots
      (that work) is a more accurate representation.


      Red Killer is, unfortunately, currently just another poor mobile port. The physics
      in the levels are somewhat broken and things will be left in positions that
      should be impossible. The English is also lackluster, with the game featuring
      a lot of missing punctuation and some misspelled words. There''s also poor hints
      as to what you''re actually supposed to do when you start the game outside of
      the game being called "Red Killer". There''s no in-game options, the "pause"
      button doesn''t actually pause the game, and the quit button doesn''t actually
      work. The game is also not properly widescreen, and if you play at any sort
      of widescreen resolution you will be stuck with bars on the side.


      Until the physics can get massively cleaned up I suggest avoiding this. To the
      developer, I suggest trying to actually make this game look like it belongs
      on Steam/PC and not make it be just another bad mobile port. I also suggest
      cleaning up the presentation of the game on the store page - get an updated
      trailer that isn''t just failing at levels over and over. Make all of the screenshots
      actually work and have them be something that would work to sell the game.'
