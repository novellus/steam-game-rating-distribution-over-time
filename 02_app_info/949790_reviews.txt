I appreciated how it diverts from the typical coding game where you solve puzzles by directly writing code - instead, Rogue Bit has you reverse engineering a simple 8-bit computer, manipulating memory in both data and code segments to hack past various \"barriers\". As someone who enjoys debugging machine code, reverse engineering, and writing cracks (for learning purposes, not for the public), I had a lot of fun with this.  It starts out simple, but I had to eventually jot a few notes down and do some math to progress (eg the calculator problem). It was a nice touch to illustrate the game as the ASCII representation of memory, it adds a lot of retro atmosphere to it while simultaneously providing a play field.  Really cool idea - kudos to the devs on this one!","timestamp_created":1609484545,"timestamp_updated":1609484545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.754413068294525146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vqWw3vYCdLmpvwI="}
