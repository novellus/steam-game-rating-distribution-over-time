A really good game with cute moments, lovable characters, great music and a lighter story~\nHelping Edward paying off his debts and watching him grow as a character was so rewarding! Plus, both romance give more details about the character, be it through his personality or past (especially with Francis' route). And if you prefer to see Alex with someone else from Beyond Eden, you can always play cupid. A feature that I've never seen in any of VN I have played! The game doesn't feel repetitive as you have lots of things to do during this journey (uncovering mysteries, solving cases, gambling...)\nAgain, the VA did a wonderful job bringing the characters to life, especially for the three main characters! It was awesome! (The bloopers and special episode got me laughing hard). The CGs are all magnificent with great alts for the steamy ones!\nA great experience for me whose a big fan of Beyond Eden (and of Edward)! I totally recommend it!","timestamp_created":1609973159,"timestamp_updated":1609973159,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xZr47PYCd+WQwQI="}
