    review: Sonic 3 & Knuckles was not my first Sonic game. That honor belongs to
      Sonic 2, another amazing game. But it is my favorite. On a technical level,
      the game pushes the Genesis to its absolute limit, and the gameplay is a fun
      mix of speed and platforming action. Sonic 3 & Knuckles is the single greatest
      Sonic game. But its legacy is slowly being forgotten, as legal issues have made
      this Sonic 3 & Knuckles' last release. So I urge you to purchase this masterpiece
      of a game as soon as you can, because it might not be here forever.
