    review: 'Tideville has the look and feel of an older HOPA game, but is still enjoyable
      thanks to  plenty of HO scenes and puzzles. The story is okay, though not compelling,
      the voice acting is consistent, and the atmosphere and setting are very well
      done.


      [b]Pros:[/b]

      -  standard, but well-executed, word-based HO scenes with some objects requiring
      an extra step or two

      - interesting and occasionally challenging puzzles

      - pleasant, intelligent protagonist who feels more real than many

      - easy to follow integrated Guide


      [b]Cons:[/b]

      - the lack of a map is frustrating; there are areas with a fair bit of back
      and forth

      - no collectables, no achievements (not even in-game achievements)

      - little re-use of what should be reusable items; the bonus chapter allows more
      re-use of items


      [b]Note:[/b]  I didn''t try the Hint system, since I avoid using Hints out of
      habit; there is a good chance that the Hint system makes up for not having an
      interactive map to show you action points; I did refer to the Guide twice, but
      that was partly because I left the game and came back to it a couple of times,
      which is never optimal


      The game is worth getting if you don''t mind a game with an older look and feel,
      including no map and less than perfect graphics.  The HO scenes and puzzles
      are a bit more challenging than more recent games, and the variety of puzzles
      is nice.'
