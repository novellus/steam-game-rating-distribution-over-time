    review: 'In this episode, you are on a new island and you don''t have your progress
      from your main save.


      You have your whole party to choose from and they all start with a pretty weak
      set of equipment and items.


      The island has a lot of available materials to gather but not all of them. You
      also have access to many recipes but not all of them.


      You basically have to beat a boss monster and you''re barely strong enough.
      The monsters don''t give much experience so you don''t really level up.


      So to complete this side story, you need to gather materials, figure out which
      recipes you can do, gear up your team and kill the boss. At the end you get
      a nice scene and the island becomes accessible in your main save.


      It is short, takes about an hour, but it is a fun dlc.'
