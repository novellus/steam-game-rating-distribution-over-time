    review: 'Datswer is a  pleasant slow moving platformer, with puzzle elements,
      that should keep   the average platformer enthusiast  happily  entertained for
      a while.  It''s not frenetic like Super Meat Boy, but  slow and  almost  hypnotic
      in its movement. The  graphics are not brilliant, but   the art style, which
      is a pastiche of muted  colors and styles reminicient of several other  platformers
      i''ve played over the years (notably Gish)  is   somehow  pleasing and  really  drew  me
      into the game.   The next thing I knew three hours had passed.


      There are numerous enemies,  traps,  paths, chasms, pits and obstacles to avoid   while
      exploring the cave system that  you find yourself in.   You also have  to interact
      with many of the objects you find within the cave as they may be required to
      solve one of the many puzzles you will  be faced with while exploring the cave
      system.  If you get stuck,  you can find  useful hints and tips  via the developers
      face book page, which you can find [url=https://www.facebook.com/datswer][b]HERE[/b][/url];
      also you can see a You Tube video of  game play [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YDBiAZgasc][b]HERE[/b][/url].
      I''m sure if you look you''ll also find  video walkthroughs which can always
      be helpful if you get totally lost.  :)


      For the price  (i.e. not much more than a large latte from one of the  big coffee
      houses) it''s well worth buying,'
