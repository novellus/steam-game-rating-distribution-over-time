      &quot;Wash me.&quot;</i><br><br>It is said that long ago in Japan, there was
      a certain house. Every so often, a strange thing happened in this place: a yokai
      in the shape of a giant dirty foot appeared and demanded to be cleaned! If the
      resident cleaned the foot, the foot left peacefully. However, if the foot was
      not cleaned, then the foot stomped throughout the house and destroyed everything.<br><br>Ashi
      Wash is our take on this Japanese folktale.<br><br>Ashi Wash is like a haiku.
      A goofy one to be sure, but a haiku all the same. A single reading of a haiku
      is short, but it invites the reader to reread it and ponder the layers of meaning
      densely packed into its few words. Likewise, a single playthrough of Ashi Wash
      is short, but this surreal game has layers of secrets and meanings that will
      give you foot for thought. You''ll find something new every time you revisit
      it.<br><br>Want to show your friends your VR setup? Ashi Wash comes with a toe-tally
      neato VR mode that''s great for parties. Everyone will be laughing all night

      too.<br><br>Don''t have VR? No worries! Ashi Wash also plays in standard, non-VR
      mode. In this mode, there are more rooms in the house to be explored (and also
      some new secrets to find).<br><br>You have three minutes to clean The Foot.
