A few things I noticed:\n\n-No sounds when attacking.\n-Most of the spells just say 'Deals fire damage', even shock spells.\n-No animations (by design, perhaps, but pretty bland).\n-Bows are the same as melee. Your first attack might occur at a longer range, but then your character gets within melee range.\n-Very hard scroll through the skill list.\n-You can clip through the outer walls of the bee hive room.\n-During gameplay my target reticule disappeared somehow.\n\nNo hate for the developer(s?) here, but if you're charging for a game like this then you're open to critique.","timestamp_created":1572319601,"timestamp_updated":1572319657,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wr/jiu4CetCQ1QE="}
