    review: 'For me it was definitely worth it getting this DLC. The main issue I
      had with "Tally Ho" was that which stats were being checked by each choice was
      often very ambiguous to the point where it was basically blind guessing which
      choice was right, and strategizing was practically impossible


      This cheat enabled an optional feature where basically I didn''t have to worry
      anymore about getting really far into the story and making one "wrong" choice
      because it wasn''t discernible which stat was being checked. So if you want
      a more relaxing playthrough, of you''re playing more for the story than the
      challenge, or if the skill check system at all frustrated you in "Tally Ho",
      I would definitely recommend this DLC'
