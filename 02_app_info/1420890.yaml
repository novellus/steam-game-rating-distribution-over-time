    about_the_game: VA Framework is an innovative platform to build your personal
      Digital Assistant. Your Digital Assistant is powered by latest cutting-edge
      Deep-Learning technology and enable your Assistant to understand what you've
      queried instead of matching text strings.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Natural
      Language Processing</strong></h2><br>The state-of-the-art NLP (Natural Language
      Processing) is directly integrated into the Digital Assistant that enables the
      AI Assistant to understand you better. You can train the Assistant to understand
      your sentences by adding more example sentences when working with the Visual
      Editor.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Visual editor - Flow Based Programming</strong></h2><br>VA
      Framework enables you to develop an Assistant and it's commands using a Visual
      Editor (Flow-based Programming enabled) so you don't have to get your hands
      dirty with any programming language or hard coding. You can create custom commands
      and rich responses by just dragging and dropping relevant nodes in the editor.<h2
      class="bb_tag"><strong>Loads Of In-built Plugin</strong></h2><br>Dozens of in-built
      plugins like Weather, Speech, Avatar selection, Discord and Telegram integration
      to name a few for you to play around and start building immediately. Each plugin
      offers its own sets of Nodes that can be interacted with in the Visual Editor
      (workspace) to create custom behaviour.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>3D Avatars</strong></h2><br>The
      3D Avatar Engine lip syncs itself when a message is being spoken and you can
      add your custom Voice Commands for better speech recognition. Currently, there
      are 2 in-built 3D Avatars available (Aryan and Maya). We plan to add more realistic
      avatars down the line as new updates are released.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Speech
      Recognition &amp; Synthesis</strong></h2><br>Currently, it supports speech synthesis
      and voice command recognition for English US/UK Language. Your Assistant automatically
      speaks the text part specified in rich responses and you can manually add unlimited
      number of voice commands using the speech plugin.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Discord
      and Telegram Integration</strong></h2><br>You and your friends (when enabled)
      can now control or talk to your AI Assistant remotely using your favourite apps
      like Discord and Telegram. The queries are directly processed by the Assistant
      and a response is sent back to the right user when the Assistant is active in
      your machine.

      this is the first report of some external registration, and we are unsure as
      to what caused it.


      If you could provide us some details as to what sort of external registration
      was required on your machine, we could look into it and provide an update that
      might be helpful to other users as well.


      We regret the inconvenience.'
