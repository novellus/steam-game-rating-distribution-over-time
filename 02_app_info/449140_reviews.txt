I was immediately hooked. The campaign has the right amount of challenge and levels. forcing the player to think outside the box and change up their ships or optimize micro managing. \n\nhaven't tried the multiplayer yet. I'm kinda late to the party here. but seeing how you can use AI is really cool. program a ship to prioritize certain tactics in a battle. \n\n1 minor complaint is that you can't add any of the dlc items to your ships in the campaign mode. I can understand some of the shaded stuff, but the insignia's and stripes to make your ships more unique? That should be changed.  Also its kinda hard to keep ships symmetrical.","timestamp_created":1606013483,"timestamp_updated":1606013483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511627912521362305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/5739vUCet3lrwI="}
