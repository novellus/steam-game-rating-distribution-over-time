      a dozen odd-jobs, from electrical engineering to the occasional crocodile wrestle.

      enemies, and use those colours to jump, dash, and figure her way through Chromaland.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Collect Power-Ups!</h2>When Mira defeats an enemy, she can also
      steal it's &quot;shape&quot; in the form of magic stencils. These stencils transform
      Mira's brush into a wide-range of unique powerups, from shooting stars to balloons,

      /><br>Mira is up against a little evil, of course. Colonel Blump and his cohort
      of artistic villains have stolen the colour from RainbowCastle, and Empress
      Kitty needs your help. Well, I mean, if she could speak, she'd totally ask for
      your help. Frankly, she kinda sits there.<br><br>Mira has been tasked with restoring
      colour to Chromaland across all 8 art-style based worlds, returning the 8 colour
      crystals, and squaring off against the villainous Blump. I mean, what does he
      want a bunch of rainbows for anyway? He's such a sour sea-lion.<h2 class="bb_tag">But
      wait, theres more colors!?</h2>Mira's Brush is packed with alternate routes,
      filled with colourful secrets and extra challenges. Beginners will be able to
      collect just enough rainbow-power to skirt the most deadly stages, while completionists
      will have to delve into each labyrinthine level, solving puzzles and beating
      bosses along the way. There's even a few settings aimed at speedrunners, rewarding
      many kinds of play.
