      \ and Tactics officer with the Katajion Directorship, has spent her career watching\
      \ over a listening post in the middle of deep space. After the orders that she\
      \ has always dreamed of finally arrive, she finds herself in charge of a small\
      \ destroyer and tasked with discovering the fate of a missing research team\
      \ investigating an ancient civilization. Mystery swirls all around her as she\
      \ reunites with old friends, meets emotional trials head-on, and faces the danger\
      \ with new allies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the universe she knows falls apart\
      \ around her, it is up to Natalie\u2019s brilliance and the dedication of the\
      \ crew of the KSS Nimross to avert a galaxy-shattering event that could spell\
      \ the end of all space travel. With determination in her heart, Natalie rises\
      \ to the chance to beat back the danger and perhaps find love in the twinkling\
      \ lights of the distant stars."
