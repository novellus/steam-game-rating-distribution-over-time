    review: "\tIf you like the idea of being a space pirate and you enjoy visual novels\
      \ then games like Treasure Seekers of Lady Luck are like candy. I enjoyed much\
      \ of the game but I couldn\u2019t help but notice some things don\u2019t add\
      \ up. You can effect various stats with your choices throughout the game such\
      \ as kindness; bravery; loyalty; etc but and they will in turn mean you won\u2019\
      t be able to complete certain tasks in certain manners. I like that idea but\
      \ in practice sometimes the game picks weird things to not allow me to do. For\
      \ instance I had a very high kindness rating so at one point when I want to\
      \ burn down a shed to cause a distraction the game said I failed because I was\
      \ too nice. Another time I wanted to lie to a person and had the same issue,\
      \ I was too kind to pull it off. Later on though I could literally murder a\
      \ character in cold blood and the game was cool with it. I loved the story;\
      \ I loved the interaction between different characters and I enjoyed the game\
      \ overall but it\u2019s cause and effect from the stats often felt broken. There\
      \ is still enjoyment to be had though. The game has no graphics or audio so\
      \ it has to get you to imagine the characters and locations and it does a great\
      \ job describing them. I also felt that despite the system being broken that\
      \ I could make the character my own for the most part. My only other issue was\
      \ that your health could drop if you got injured from fights but at no point\
      \ could I find a way to heal myself, not even back on the ship.\n\n\tI played\
      \ Treasure Seekers of Lady Luck on Linux. The game didn\u2019t crash on me once.\
      \ I didn\u2019t notice any spelling errors. There is no manual save system,\
      \ the auto saves every page and upon exit. The game isn\u2019t long enough to\
      \ make this an issue and does make the choices you make feel more important\
      \ as you must restart the game to change them. My system RAM usage during play\
      \ was 2.4GB; my CPU usage was at 2%;  and my VRAM usage was at 506MB.\n\n\t\
      Overall this is a solid visual novel. It\u2019s positives outweigh the negatives.\
      \ If you enjoy other games from Choice of Games then you will probably enjoy\
      \ this. I finished the game in just under 2 hours. I paid $3.39 CAD for it and\
      \ can say it is easily worth $5.\n\nMy Score: 7/10\n\nMy System:\n\nAMD Ryzen\
      \ 5 2600X | 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 | MSI RX 580 8GB Gaming X | Mesa 19.2.2 |  Manjaro\
      \ 18.1.2 | Mate 1.22.2 | Kernel 5.3.7-2-MANJARO"
