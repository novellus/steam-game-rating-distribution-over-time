Likewise the first half is very slow, in the kind of way only an indie film can seem to pull off, but that being said, I am glad that I watched it.","timestamp_created":1476075220,"timestamp_updated":1476075220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525982022285461426","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwo281tcCcJWEYw=="}
