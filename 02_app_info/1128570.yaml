    review: "Weeping Willow is a mystery visual novel.  Beat it in a little under\
      \ 2 hours using the spacebar and the mouse.  No difficulty, it's a game where\
      \ you read.  There aren't any choices to be made outside of the main charrie's\
      \ name.  It says it's mature, and for one scene I could maybe see that, but\
      \ there's nothing showing and there's 0 hentai.  \n\nMost of the game is straight\
      \ up average.   It broke me that Melanie's (The Nun's) character art had this\
      \ far-gazing stare and faced away from the characters when they could've just\
      \ flipped her around.  There were also typos throughout, some funnier than others\
      \ but it didn't get in the way of reading too badly.  Music was alright and\
      \ fit the mood. \n\nYou're ultimately in this for the story.   And yes, the\
      \ story is worth it.  It's completely worth the 2 dollars.  It goes from interesting\
      \ plot to \"WTF?!\" midway through. Like the story writers hit a 'Screw it'\
      \ moment, got drunk, binge watched a few K-drama sitcoms, and let it fly.\n\n\
      ... It Was Popo All Along!  [i](J/king.  Not a spoiler.  Don't kill me.)[/i]\
      \  \n\nBut no, if you're looking to be entertained and want a short, harmless\
      \ VN, Weeping Willow exists.  There's no wolfgirl-pronz, the translations could\
      \ be better, but the ridiculous plot is different from the other VNs out there\
      \ and will entertain you for a little while."
