This is because of a difficulty spike at the start of the game I believe by level 4 map 1. As of this moment I'm 3% of the 6% achievements achieved in this game. \n\nGame Play: Select unique tower spells prior to enter the level. Build generators and towers while in the said level. Meet the minimum challenge requirements, EX: \"Only use 3 generators, 2 fire towers, and 2 lightning towers\". The towers attack via you clicking on the enemy in an area that's within range of your towers. You have to change which element you have selected, in otherwords if you keep the key binding the same you'll be pressing the 1,2,3 buttons alot. You have unique greater spells, that allow for such things as Morphing the enemy, reset cooldowns, slow down the enemy. \n\nGraphics: They take a while to get used to and at times it can be difficult to get a good idea of the terrain. \n\nOverall this is a solid TD for the price (I got it on a super sale), but it is in no way a friendly TD game for new individuals to the genre. \n","timestamp_created":1608954094,"timestamp_updated":1608954094,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm+TIzvYCcauhvQI="}
