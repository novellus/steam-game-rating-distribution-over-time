    review: I recommend this game i just find it annoying when it SOMETIMES only sometimes
      glitches out and becomes all pixelated it gets annoying but i do recommend this
      because there are millions upon millions of things you can explore and mess
      around with you can go on earths atmosphere and watch the sun set like its normal
      also i would like more detail on the ground and terrain its all just flat and
      not so pretty it would be cool if they added mountains and textures! but overall
      its fun and educational
