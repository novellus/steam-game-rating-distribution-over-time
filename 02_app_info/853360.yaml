      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Overview</strong></h2><br><br>The Yellow Turbans\
      \ were a rebel movement of the common people, founded on spiritual beliefs.\
      \ Tired of oppression, starvation and injustice at the hands of the Han Dynasty,\
      \ they rose up against the corrupt nobility. Prior to the start of this campaign,\
      \ a massive Yellow Turban rebellion had swept through China led by the Zhang\
      \ brothers, who used Taoist divination to predict the fall of the Han dynasty.\
      \ However, this initial rebellion was ruthlessly crushed and millions of civilians\
      \ suspected of being sympathisers were slaughtered without mercy. As the campaign\
      \ begins, the Zhang brothers are already dead, and only three significant enclaves\
      \ of Yellow Turbans remain. Playing as one of these factions, you can change\
      \ history, rekindling the movement and uniting China under a rightful, virtuous\
      \ and just Emperor.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Yellow Turban Factions</strong></h2><br><br>The\
      \ Yellow Turbans\u2019 beliefs blend Taoism and shamanistic principles, and\
      \ these spiritual aspects are a recurring theme throughout their faction gameplay.\
      \ Many of their features relate to the three Taoist domains of Land, People\
      \ and Heaven, or the Three Treasures (or virtues) of Taoism: Frugality, Compassion,\
      \ and Humility. <br><br>Reflecting these concepts, the playable Yellow Turban\
      \ factions are led by the characters He Yi (People), Gong Du (Land) and Huang\
      \ Shao (Heaven). Each has their own playstyle and unique bonuses.<br><br>Yellow\
      \ Turban factions construct a mix of adapted Han buildings and their own unique\
      \ structures. Their technology tree is divided into three scrolls from the Book\
      \ of Great Peace, each of which references the three Taoist domains and contains\
      \ verses of Taoist scripture. It is structurally and mechanically very different\
      \ from the default tech trees used by other factions.<br><br>Playable Yellow\
      \ Turban factions improve their Faction Rank as their campaigns progress. These\
      \ represent the journey to enlightenment, the achievement of The Great Peace,\
      \ regaining the Mandate of Heaven, and appointing a just Emperor. Progression\
      \ requires the player to study the verses in the Book of Great Peace, construct\
      \ religious building in their settlements and improve the virtuous characteristics\
      \ of the characters under their control.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/853360/extras/3a.jpg?t=1571750931\"\

      \ own playstyle, unique building chain and faction bonuses:<br><br><ul class=\"\
      bb_ul\"><li>He Yi is a Yellow Turban commander from Yu province. Like the original\
      \ founders of the Yellow Turban movement, he is a Healer, and empathises with\
      \ the suffering of the common people. He is able to rally vast masses to the\
      \ cause of the rebellion.  </li></ul><br>Representing the domain of People,\
      \ He Yi espouses Compassion. He fields veteran Yellow Turban warriors and strong\
      \ berserkers in battle, and has access to the Healer\u2019s Lodge unique building\
      \ chain, a multifunctional building boosting population growth and replenishment\
      \ and generating a small income from the sale of medicine.<br><br><br><ul class=\"\

      \ the troops. He is dedicated to claiming the spoils from the tyrants he overthrows.\
      \ </li></ul><br>Representing the domain of Land, Gong Du espouses frugality.\
      \ He fields former soldiers, guardsmen and converted nobles in battle and can\
      \ build the unique Hidden Fort building chain that helps supply the Yellow Turban\
      \ armies and increases the amount of spoils they can carry off after a battle.<br><br><br><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Huang Shao is a Scholar, and a Yellow Turban commander\
      \ from Yu Province. He is the only leader to have met the original founders\
      \ of the Yellow Turban rebellion. As such, he best understands their spiritual\
      \ teachings, and aims to ensure the rebellion doesn\u2019t lose its way on the\
      \ road to realising The Great Peace.</li></ul><br>Representing the domain of\

      \ Huang Shao\u2019s control happy."
