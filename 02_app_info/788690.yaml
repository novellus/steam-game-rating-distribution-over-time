    review: 'Such a joy to see Raz and the gang in VR. All the crazy proportions from
      the characters look great. I love the way this plays with scale. Telekinesis
      is pretty awkward, but the game has no fail states so just take your time and
      enjoy.


      Honestly feel so spoiled to get to play this. I have no idea how they justified
      making it but I''m glad they did.'
