    review: '"Soundtrack" is to be taken literally - it''s just the one single track
      playing in the game repeatedly. Format is 320 kBit CBR MP3, running for 3:34
      minutes. No cover art included, but you can find one in the Community Hub.


      As it is for free, I give it a "Recommended", but it wouldn''t be worth to be
      paid an extra fee.'
