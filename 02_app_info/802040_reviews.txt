It's even worse when some options kill you (with no save feature to boot), so normally I'd just write a game with features like that off as bad and move on. But, if nothing else, this game has a fair bit of effort put into it, it's not too long, and there are multiple solutions. This makes that parts I'm not into less unpleasant, though I still need to make note of them.\n\nThe plot isn't anything special, when you're told that you have amnesia and are in a dangerous location, most players will know the twist already. But, since the dialog is sparse, it doesn't get on my nerves too much, sometimes cliches are fun.\n\nSpeaking of the writing, it's nothing special, and not capitalizing \"I\" really bugs me, but that's just a nitpick.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 6/10, give it a look if you're into escape room-esque puzzle games.","timestamp_created":1607469370,"timestamp_updated":1607469370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqYGpovYCebOkuAI="}
