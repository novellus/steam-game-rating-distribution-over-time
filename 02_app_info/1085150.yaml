    about_the_game: "Golf Defied is a new trend in the sphere already established\
      \ for many ideas, both about Golf and video games. We have tried to realize\
      \ as much possibilities as possible on the base of Golf concept. We hope that\

      \nPHYSICS &amp; MECHANICS<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhysics in this game runs on an\
      \ advanced engine and is computed with the highest frequency possible. Realistic\
      \ physics, in its turn, provides the ground for experiments with new mechanics\
      \ that are based on the interaction of two or more moving bodies with different\
      \ physical materials. We have chosen for your evaluation several experimental,\

      \ have unique mechanics that are combined with an exclusive audio and visual\
      \ style that creates a special mood. For example, in the location &quot;Pyramids&quot;\
      \ there is a nice connections of game mechanics and audio/visual presentation,\
      \ which provides a sense of &quot;physical collision with music.&quot; We also\

      \ interface for single-player mode and a complex system for creating and managing\
