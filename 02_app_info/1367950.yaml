    review: 'This game is the very definition of why you shouldn''t take reviews too
      seriously.

      I read the reviews and thought of not getting this. Boy, were they wrong. One
      of the reviews complains about grammar. I don''t see it. In fact, that guy''s
      grammar is atrocious. Secondly, the developer states that the font makes the
      capital "H" look lower case. So, that explains a bit. Also the other reviews
      about the game being too hard? You have multiple characters that have one hit
      kill items across the map at the start of the game.  Also the side missions
      were very easy and my people are very strong. It just sounds like people are
      not actually playing the game and are quick to leave negative feedback. So,
      I just have to say... play the game. You won''t be upset.'
