To shoot you have to push joystick forward and keep trigger pressed to keep shooting [/i]\n\nThis game would make a great eye test of the future. Is that a soldier in the distance or a shrub? The pixels look the same! I think I saw it move, it's a soldier after all. Shoot! Ha! That's about as interesting as this game gets. It's pretty bad. Even at .59 cents, I can't recommend this. Maybe at free it'd be nice for a laugh. \n\nIt's basically a stand still wave shooter (or a stay crouched wave shooter?). Soldier after soldier keeps spawning, almost magically, anywhere in front of you and then moves side to side while moving forward and shooting at you. The closer they get, the deadlier they are. Luckily, you just have to stay crouched while still being able to shoot over the barricade and just keep the trigger button pressed down. Your gun will keep shooting. No dumb reloads to worry about. You don't have to worry about different enemy types or different tactics. Just more soldiers come for you wave after wave after wave.\n\nThere is some strategy. Shoot the health pickups. There's other guns to try! But they all involve the same wave after wave shooting. Honestly, I got to wave 9-10 in less than 20 minutes and my arm started to hurt from keeping it up all the time to shoot soldier after soldier. I found it easier to shoot by looking at where the bullets travelled over aiming down sights. Although, I have to give this game credit, ADS does seem to work! Amazing! You get money for each soldier you kill to buy more guns. Sounds like an NRA member's wet dream.\n\nAnyways, that's all there is to the game. I wasted .59 cents for you guys. You're welcome!\n\nRate 3/10. \n\n","timestamp_created":1529975820,"timestamp_updated":1529975820,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543927013874053955","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7snqnOQCdKOepAE="}
