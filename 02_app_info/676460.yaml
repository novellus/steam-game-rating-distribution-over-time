      class="bb_tag">Story</h2>For several generations, the King''s Guard has kept
      vigilant watch over the kingdom, resulting in the longest period of peace ever
      known.  The people no longer worry about security or threats from monsters or
      man, free to pursue their passions rather than learn swordplay and magic.  All
      was peaceful - but peace rarely lasts forever.  Monsters are sighted on the
      edge of town.  Fields of grain go barren with no explanation.  Traders leave
      town to procure supplies, never to be heard from again.  <br><br>The King''s
      Guard is nowhere to be found.  Have they forsaken the people?  Why do they let
      these fearsome threats roam unchecked?<br><br>The people, desperate for aid,
      have nowhere to turn.  Few remember a time before the King''s Guard.  Rumors
      tell of a Mercenary''s Guild that was once home to powerful mages, fearsome
      warriors, clever rogues - all champions of battle who could be relied upon to
      accomplish any task - for a fee, of course.  Long abandoned in an era of peace,
      the guild''s fabled home now serves as a tavern for weary travelers.  The old
      barkeep, always keen to share old stories and legends, recants tales of adventure
      and glorious battle to anyone willing to listen.  Most think his stories are
      fables; yet another clever ruse to keep mead and coin flowing in the old place.<br><br>One
      morning, there was an unusual bustle of activity in the town square.  A cryptic
      message, on what looked to be ancient parchment, had been posted prominently
      in the town square.  The guild had returned, and was actively recruiting.<h2
