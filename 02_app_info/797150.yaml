    review: I cannot recommend this ship unless you are starting out, and plan to
      only play the game with this ship. Overall this ship has some serious flaws,
      but also some serious firepower when its fully upgraded. Although right now
      with certain changes to how players can get credits (like the massive stealth
      nerf to open world play) this ship will take you a significant amount of time
      to upgrade. So I would personally go with a custodian (which is by far one of
      the best frigates in the game, but still takes a significant amount of time
      to upgrade) or I would go with one of the other frigates on sale. This ship
      seems more like a nostalgia thing, but it wont be getting you any clout on the
      battlefield unless you are really good at ducking and dodging incoming fire
      in a ship that has the design of a plate (think cross section and think about
      how someone easily can hit you, but you cannot easily hit them, and that will
      give you an idea of how the ship is.) Also with alien ships you must upgrade
      them fully to get full use out of them. Also getting the components are parts
      for this ship is going to take a significant amount of time. So do not think
      that when you get this out of the box it will be combat ready. Since its not.
