      \ giant warships, as opposed to smaller craft. When you fly &quot;big iron&quot;,\
      \ combat is about planning and tactics instead of reflexes. Careful positioning,\
      \ good situational awareness, intimate knowledge of your ship's handling, strengths\
      \ and weaknesses, as well a willingness to take calculated risks are the hallmarks\
      \ of a great captain.<br><br>\tThe game consists of a single player campaign\

      \ have to pick your fights carefully, balancing the risk against the benefits\
