Character movement and gravity feels like I'm playing at 2x speed, projectiles move so fast you have literally no time to react most of the time, all while trying to jump from tiny platform to tiny platform \"jump king\" style.\n\nEven \"rage games\" like boshy have at least some kind of difficulty ramp up and learning phase. If this games first level is as easy as it gets then no thank you lol sorry.\n\nThe UI is a bit odd, but otherwise visually the game looks cool. If you like INSANELY difficult games, feel free to give it a shot, but just be warned that prior to this I also thought I liked very difficult games. The trailer looks cool, and the bosses look pretty cool, but i can NOT force myself through this first level. I've never got so mad at a game so fast.","timestamp_created":1594080466,"timestamp_updated":1594080733,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49LSnk/MCcvyzkwI="}
