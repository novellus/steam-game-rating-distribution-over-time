The Blocky Ages will be a high risk-reward driven game, where the player has a lot to lose, but also, much to win.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">World<\/h2>You live in a world called Irumesa. The Player will be taken through a Main story, that tells the story about Irumesa and its existence. The story will not be linear, and will force you to make decisions and find your own way. After the quick tutorial in the beginning, only you can decide your path.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Risk \/ Reward<\/h2>One very important thing to us with this game, is to develop a game that has a high risk to reward ratio. The game will be difficult, and the risk is high in general.<br>We are trying to implement content for all types of players, both casual and hardcore RPG gamers, but the main focus will be towards the more hardcore.<br>With high risk, comes great rewards!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Death<\/h2>Dying in The Blocky Ages will be harsh and punishing. We can guarantee that you will get frustrated at times. But we believe that this is also one of the things that makes a game fun to play. Knowing that death is so nasty, and the stakes so high will increase the rewarding feeling when accomplishing something difficult.<br>Death will result in irreversible Experience loss, and items will be dropped at random. Items may be picked up again, if someone else doesn't get there first!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Teamwork<\/h2>Teamwork will be an important aspect of The Blocky Ages, and leaving teammates to die will not really be an option.<br>We want to enforce teams to really work together during instances and boss fights, so we will implement a “Party Loss System”. <br>If a teammate dies, the ENTIRE party will share that players experience loss. If the rest of the team survives, and they manage to revive their teammate some of the lost experience will be given back to the team.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PVE<\/h2>PVE will of course be a big part of The Blocky Ages gameplay. You will encounter many boss-fights and will be able to party up with your friends to clear the harder bosses. Instances (Dungeons) will come in plenty, and with different difficulty.<br>We will also introduce a Colosseum-style arena, where players either Solo or in a Party has to fight their way through different bosses in an arena.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PVP<\/h2>You can't have a great MMORPG without a good pvp-system, where people can put their skills to the ultimate test against other players.<br>We have plans to implement a number of different PVP-arenas.<br>The first Alpha-release will offer a mode we call King of the Arena.<br><br>King of the Arena Will be an open arena where players simply enters the Arena with their character, and tries to get as many kills as possible before dying. When you die, you are kicked out of the Arena and your total kill-count will be entered into a scoreboard.<br>At the end of the day, the players with the highest kill-count will get points based on their standings.<br>We plan on many more PvP modes, and will implement them one by one.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bounty-System<\/h2>We will have a bounty-system in the world, to increase the risk with killing other players.<br>Player Killing will be totally unrestricted, but risky in the way that a bounty will be placed upon you. This will make you a target to other players looking to make some money.<br>Bountied players will also be restricted access to some areas, as a high bounty will make guards and other dangerous NPC Units very interested in you. <br>But, maybe you’ll find friends in darker places eh? In The Blocky Ages, nothing is written in stone, and you decide who you want to become.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Player Housing \/ Open Building System<\/h2>In The Blocky Ages, you will be able to build your own Houses, Castles or whatever you want. We will not feature an instanced housing system, as you will be able to buy a plot of land almost anywhere in our Open World.<br>You may team up with your clan, to build a massive Clan Mansion, or just gather enough money and resources to build yourself a small cabin in the woods.<br>What you do is up to you. Although, these benefits won't come cheap.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Crafting<\/h2>As many other MMORPGs, we want to provide a solid Crafting system. The crafting system will also have a higher risk\/reward than what most players are used to. <br>Crafting something, may not be as easy as one might think.<br><i>(More info about this later)<\/i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Spell Crafting<\/h2>Our game will feature a lot of different spells, but we are also creating a Spell-crafting system, where players can specialize their character further by creating spells fit for their game style. A crafted spell starts out blank, and gets more powerful as you add abilities and powers to them.<br>But be careful, as tinkering with some of these ancient powers may cause it all to go away.
