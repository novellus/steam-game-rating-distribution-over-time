    review: "The old pros and cons list \U0001F60A\n\nPros\n-Monsters: This game has\
      \ some of the most unique monsters I've seen in a horror game period. Adds uniqueness\
      \ and distinction from other games on the market.\n-Sounds: From the ambient\
      \ music to sound effects, the devs nailed it. The sounds monsters and zombies\
      \ make is so creepy. Being able to hear accurately where monsters are relative\
      \ to my position easily could have killed immersion but it did anything but\
      \ that.\n-Graphics: Really good for a vr game in early access. Texture quality\
      \ is awesome. I only expect it to get better as updates progress.\n-Enviroment:\
      \ Dead bodies, TVs that give hints, high texture quality in miscellaneous items.\
      \ I just wish I could interact with more things. Something about VR turns us\
      \ into kids again and we just have to pick up stuff.\n-Objectives: I like how\
      \ this game isn't just a repetitive hack and slash through hordes of zombies.\
      \ There's objectives and purpose. You need collect certain items to get a result.\
      \ Having to go room to room and experience what the devs put so much hard work\
      \ into. Even something as simple as that adds to the experience.\n-Scary: This\
      \ game is actually scary. From the tensness you feel not knowing when danger\
      \ will strike and it is inevitable. Jump scares are there but not so much which\
      \ is good. The environment and sounds paint a perfect horror picture.\nGameplay:\
      \ The perfect mixture between horror and action. It's not a stressful psychological\
      \ horror where the game is just mental torture to see how many jump scares and\
      \ helpless encounters you can stomach. It's also not constant violence that\
      \ eventually feels like cutting grass. Perfectly balanced, as all things should\
      \ be.\nExperience: This is the most element that will make or break a vr game,\
      \ period. I felt like I was in a horror world. I was scared out of my mind being\
      \ snuck up on in vr but also having the power to defend myself unlike most horror\
      \ games that coin themselves psychological horror games.\n\nMiddle (or unsure\
      \ how to feel)\nGunplay- Pretty Arizona Sunshine-esque except you manually reload\
      \ your weapon. Reloading can be a little bit more realistic but at least you\
      \ get to go about the motions unlike games with auto reload (hate those). I\
      \ would like an option added to turn off the laser. I enjoy having to aim down\
      \ sights for an accurate shot.\nWeapons- The current weapons seem polished and\
      \ accurate to how they function in real life. I just wish there were more. (Yes\
      \ I'm American) I need all the wampons and ammos.\nStory or backstory?- I am\
      \ getting a vibe of a plot, story, or backstory here. I'm not sure though as\
      \ I haven't spent much time in game. This review will be updated as I experience\
      \ more.\n\nCons\n-Lighting: I get that dark equals creepy but in VR dark just\
      \ looks like walking around with a black t-shirt over your eyes. I also record\
      \ gaming videos and dark colors or the absence therein give me nothing to work\
      \ with in editing.\n-Voice Over: Can honestly do without the voice over in a\
      \ game that seems to be more horror and slow paced. There are some intense moments\
      \ and battles but during the build up to them when things are slow it doesn't\
      \ make any sense that the character being played as has something super loud\
      \ to say. (IMO)\n-Hands: At this point with VR in 2020 I would really like it\
      \ if instead of seeing only my hands I could see my entire body in game. It\
      \ adds to immersion in my opinion.\n-Interaction (with self and environment):\
      \ I talked about wanting to pick up more things and interact with them although\
      \ most games abuse this into almost being completely gimmicky it still adds\
      \ to immersion. I have trouble locating my ammunition to either pull some out\
      \ to reload or to simply stock up. Items on my person seem to get in the wah\
      \ when i try to grab something on the ground which can be annoying.\n-Sprinting:\
      \ I'd like an option to not have to swing my controller around to sprint.\n\
      -Lack of Multiplayer: I feel like I must play this with someone. I just get\
      \ a Call of Duty Zombies vibe from this game and I'd love multiplayer capability.\
      \ Even if it's with random people.\n\nVerdict\nThis game is Early Access and\
      \ I treat it as such. I see so much potential in this game. However, I had to\
      \ double check if this game was in Early Access because it seems more polished\
      \ than a lot of those kinds of games. Seeing it's still in development is actually\
      \ exciting to me. I like this game a lot and hope it gets better. I would mostly\
      \ like to see multiplayer support above all other things. There's nothing I\
      \ found in this game that ruins it for me or renders in unplayable. I reccomend\
      \ this game on the notion that it is decent and can only get better. Good purchase\
      \ for the asking price. Well done. \U0001F44F\U0001F44F"
