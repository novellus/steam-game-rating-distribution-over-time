    review: "If I had the option of giving this a mixed review instead of a thumbs\
      \ up or thumbs down, I would. But, overall, I think the good slightly outweighs\
      \ the bad here.\n\nMyst III: Exile is the first in the series to be made by\
      \ a third-party, and while they did a good job making the beautiful, immersive\
      \ environments and challenging puzzles that you'd expect, there are some design\
      \ flaws that sometimes make the game more frustrating than it's supposed to\
      \ be.\n\nInstead of the static images of Myst and Riven, Exile lets you look\
      \ around in 360\xB0 panoramas. This adds immersion but can make it harder to\
      \ know where to click, and you might miss things if you don't look around. I\
      \ had to look up a walkthrough in one area where the walkways blend into the\
      \ natural environment, all because of a hard-to-see path that I had missed.\n\
      \nThere are places that don't give enough of a visual indication of what to\
      \ do, such as a lever that you're supposed to click and drag, even though just\
      \ about every other lever in the game only needs to be clicked.\n\nThere were\
      \ some puzzles I got stuck on because I didn't realize that the clues for them\
      \ were back on the starting island. It seems like poor design to put clues for\
      \ a puzzle in a different area from where the puzzle actually is.\n\nThe game\
      \ introduces a character portrayed by [spoiler]Brad Dourif[/spoiler], whom some\
      \ might remember for his portrayal of [spoiler]Grima Wormtongue in Peter Jackson's\
      \ Lord of the Rings movies[/spoiler], among other roles. I felt like he was\
      \ a bit too over-the-top, and we saw too much of him. Some of his sequences\
      \ don't really teach us anything new, and drag on a bit too long.\n\nSpeaking\
      \ of over-the-top, the soundtrack. This game definitely goes in a more cinematic\
      \ direction than the previous games. This will appeal to some, but it wasn't\
      \ my thing. Luckily there is an option in the settings to make the background\
      \ music repeat less often. The music isn't bad; just obtrusive sometimes.\n\n\
      I still give it a thumbs up, because, for the most part, the puzzles present\
      \ a satisfying challenge, enough to just outweigh the above issues. [spoiler]Amateria[/spoiler]\
      \ is where the game really shines, especially when you solve the final puzzle\
      \ there."
