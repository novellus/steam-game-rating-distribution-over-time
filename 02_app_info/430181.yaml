    about_the_game: By the 1950's,  passenger revenues on America's railroads had
      long since passed their heyday.  Automobiles were fast becoming an affordable
      option for the modern traveller, and flight was also steadily gaining in popularity.  If
      railroad passenger services were to survive, operators realised they would need
      to change their thinking and somehow take a more cost effective approach.<br><br>A
      locomotive design based on the existing SW1200 switcher was encased in a futuristic
      streamlined shroud. An usual Bo-1 wheel arrangement was employed and the drivetrain
      geared for passenger operation. The turret cabbed locomotive would be known
      as the LWT12. A finned tail car with a small observation gallery completed the
      stylised trainset exterior, and in 1955 the GM Aerotrain was born.<br><br>Gone
      but certainly not forgotten. The GM Aerotrain addon pack takes you back to the
      streamline era when this stylish train toured the railroads of the USA as a
      proposed means to the future of passenger haulage.    <br><br>Aerotrain Vehicles
