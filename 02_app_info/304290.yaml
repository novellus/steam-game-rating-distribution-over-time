    review: "Its alright, the kind of game i used to play on my phone until i fell\
      \ asleep. I picked up the hero series after choice of robots buts its appeal\
      \ can be repetitive after the third or so playthrough. \n\nThe branching in\
      \ this series is okay, some things feel shoe-horned, especially if you had a\
      \ good run from the game directly before this one. But most events you navigate\
      \ through will have thresholds of effort you build upon, the game does not take\
      \ kindly to the situational thinker who presents many behaviours, its bad for\
      \ the press. Stick to lone wolf or team player, kind hero or ruthless hero and\
      \ your fame/legend score will rise quickly."
