Now he works and lives in New York. He uses video and video interactive devices as the main medium to expand various interactive boundaries of video art. <br>Sicheng Wang: Sicheng Wang was born in 1992 in Wuhan, China.

Viewers pass through virtual spaces in the installation, exploring shapes and sounds from afar and within. This movement triggers subtle shifts that offer the viewer new relationships to the virtual space they are in and the world they return to. Within the installation, there are five different virtual spaces with unique environments consisting of shapes, sounds, and light. To travel between the virtual spaces, you must navigate to the center of the space you are in. Once you reach the center of the symmetrical space, you will automatically pass through to the next room.<br><strong><i><br>Warehouse<\/i><\/strong><br><br>Warehouse is a collaborative project between emerging artists and Chameleon Gallery. By working with artists who use different media in their practices, Warehouse experiments with virtual reality in various formats. The first volume will feature Sunset in Baltimore by Sicheng Wang, President Xi reads Chinese dictionary by Chuxi Guo, Dreamland by Wenkai Li and Road Towards BanZhangShan Tunnel by Nandan He. <br>Sunset in Baltimore: <br>When the sun strikes the cloud with its rays, mist trembles and hovers in the light. I am walking beside a river, named fate; I try to understand a single word. I restore myself in the fate, like a shore rebuilds itself in its waves. When the shore repairs itself, I walk.<br>President Xi reads Chinese dictionary:<br>There are fewer than 1,500 pronunciations for more than 10,000 characters in the Chinese dictionary which means many characters share the same pronunciation. This speech by President Xi Jinping at the opening of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China uses all the pronunciations in the dictionary. In the video, president Xi has read all the characters in the dictionary. <br>Dreamland:<br>Dreamland is about the artist who wants to go back to her simple and peaceful childhood. It is not only about the past, but also about her current confusion. <br>Road Towards BanZhangShan Tunnel:<br>Road Towards Ban zhang Shan Tunnel is one of my recovering voyages towards my odd phantasm and nihilistic belongingness. My generation grew up in a perception that reality is the most surreal thing. I inhabit my subconscious in my works—a place beneath the past, beyond dimension, echoing by its own present. I am creating an intimacy space that explore the rawness of a contemporary self and reveals an irrational order of a hyper normalized wonderland.  <br><br><strong><i><br>Medusa<\/i><\/strong><br><br>Medusa is a 360-degree video work that is experienced with a virtual-reality headset. It describes a Europe in crisis, and the events in the film mix fact with fiction. Sara Tirelli has used current news, social media, EU documents and interviews to portray the identity of the EU and the prevailing situation for people seeking asylum. The title of the work refers to the Greek myth about the gorgon Medusa, whose gaze turned people into stone. It also suggests the historic painting by Théodore Géricault, The Raft of the Medusa (1818-1819), which is a depiction of the survivors of a shipwreck and how people are the victims of poor decisions made by the rulers. The Raft of the Medusa, in turn, has similarities with contemporary images of refugees who risk their lives on the way to Europe, while people in Europe are paralysed watching the events unfold on their TV screens. There is an obvious link between the painting and today’s media images of the refugee situation.","about_the_game":"Chameleon Gallery VR is an online virtual reality platform presenting contemporary art exhibition.
