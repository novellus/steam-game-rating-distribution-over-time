    about_the_game: "The 7th Deep Beckons...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe mysterious Kaia\
      \ has found seven powerful individuals, one of whom is capable of reaching the\
      \ bottom of the 7th Deep, an ancient dungeon filled with countless treasure\
      \ and hordes of monsters, to claim the powerful God-Asper. This Relic is said\
      \ to give the wielder the power to make dreams come true and you can bet that\
      \ everyone wants a piece of the action!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMake your choices:\
      \ Will you be an evil alien who uses hi-tech weapons to obliterate his foes,\
      \ a vampire that uses the lifeblood of others to revitalise herself, or maybe\
      \ a powerful acolyte with potent, innate healing abilities?<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nYour character choice will decide which options you have when you must make\
      \ difficult decisions while exploring the Deep. A man is hanging on for his\
      \ life. What will you do? As a Good character you may get help or put yourself\
      \ at risk to save him. As an Evil character you might taunt him, rob him, or\
      \ hasten his demise. The choice is yours.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou must use all\
      \ of your cunning and resourcefulness if you wish to reach the bottom of the\
      \ 7th Deep where an incredible object of power and an even greater, ancient\
      \ evil awaits. The God-Asper silently awaits its new owner. Anticipation races\
      \ through your soul; what would you do with such power?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*No Random Encounters<br />\r\n*Optional\
      \ Puzzles<br />\r\n*Three Game Modes: Normal, Survival and New Game+<br />\r\
      \n*Seven characters to choose from, each with their own specialties in and out\
