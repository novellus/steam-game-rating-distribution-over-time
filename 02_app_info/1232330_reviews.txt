I feel as though I should dislike it because the game can get frustrating at times to me at least but the core game play kept drawing me back, not to mention that the game has an interesting art style, though this compliment is kinda balanced by the fact that a majority of the game takes place in white corridors and areas. What i'm trying to say here is that while it has flaws, I enjoyed Theyest thou.","timestamp_created":1608610231,"timestamp_updated":1608610231,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rYapxPYCdvSLvAI="}
