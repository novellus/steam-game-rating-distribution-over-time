This game only allows you to undo one move per turn, so you can imagine how frustrating it can be when the undo button is as wonky as it is. This isn't a problem for most levels, as this is a relatively easy puzzle game, but there is one particular level near the end that is significantly more complicated than the rest which I've been trying hard to solve, but the wonkiness of the undo button keeps forcing me to restart the whole level, which eventually led to me giving up on it.\n\nEDIT: Just want to add that I gave that level another go, and managed to beat it and the rest of the game afterwards! However, I stand by my negative review of the game as I didn't enjoy this game as much as I did the other chess puzzles by the same developer, not just because of the bugs, but also because I feel the rules for this game aren't as well-defined. I had to trial-and-error my way to see how things and work, and the buggy undo button just added unnecessary frustration.","timestamp_created":1608999627,"timestamp_updated":1609003917,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47OuG0PYCc7a3vQI="}
