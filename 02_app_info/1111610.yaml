      /><br><br><strong>You are on the path of your own childhood that you have not
      experienced before. You find Diary entries from your own diary that you have
      not yet written.</strong><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1111610/extras/Story.png?t=1564677019"
      /><br><br>You play a 10-year-old girl who writes the first entry in her diary
      one evening until her mother calls her to go to bed. She lies down and falls
      asleep. She awakens on an island full of meadows and trees.  It is there night
      and clear sky, so you can see the starry sky and the full moon illuminates the
      entire landscape.<br>You wonder where and how you got there, and then the girl
      calls out to her mother, but of course she can not hear. Now she's getting on
      the Way to explore the island. She finds a number of pages that tell her different
      parts of childhood, apparently of her own childhood. The more sites she finds,
      the more she gets an idea of who she is and how her life will change over the
      next 8 years.<br><br>She goes through funny and beautiful moments but also bad
      and sad. The pages look like fragments of her own diary, which she will write
      in the next 8 years, with the peculiarity of reading it now, before she has
      finished writing it.<br>At some point, she found all the pages and the story
      is complete. She now know her future and know what will happen.<br>A bed appears
      in front of her and she will lie down. A small dialogue is formed between her
      and her mother that you can now understand why some things are the way they
      are.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1111610/extras/Character.png?t=1564677019"

      /><br>The game is intended to remind adults of their own childhood and to show
      how life is from the perspective of children. There was a lot of emphasis on
      a multi-layered story to suit as many people as possible. The story is realistic
      and should not be ridiculous.<br>On the other hand, the game should show children
      how their view on the coming years will/can change.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1111610/extras/Graphic-Settings.png?t=1564677019"
