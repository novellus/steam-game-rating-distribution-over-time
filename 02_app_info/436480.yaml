      \ strategic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have endeavoured to combine two well-known\
      \ game mechanics: the strategic building and commanding of units coupled with\
      \ good old competitive battling! Player control input is purposefully limited\
      \ but extremely tactical. You will need to keep a close eye on the evolving\

    review: "Soup is a simple game, but it has fun gameplay. The aim of the game is\
      \ to win from the Virus, this as Bacteria or Nanobots.\n\nGameplay\nYou have\
      \ your collectors, mines and fighters (and you can shoot these torpedoes). These\
      \ all you can spawn with one single button Z, while holding down the Z button\
      \ you can see the different units and select them like this. So your collectors\
      \ collect and grow bigger and on some point you might want to recall them using\
      \ the X button before they get wiped out by the enemy fighters. You also have\
      \ mines that circle around your \"base\" for defensive purposes mostly.  Then\
      \ you have fighters, these attack enemies anywhere in the playing field by bumping\
      \ in them (this eventually kills them as well). As the last unit you can use\
      \ there is the torpedo, well looks like a kamikazerun.. but anyway you can use\
      \ this to directly attack the virus. Depending on the size of you main body\
      \ the units you have can be smaller or larger too. \n\nUpdates\nNone for a while\
      \ I see, that's why I'm changing my review.\n\nNew verdict\nOk, checked it out\
      \ today 26-03-2019, things changed is sound options and difficulty. It looks\
      \ abandoned by now.. no new messages ? ? ? I mean it is ok like what it is now\
      \ but I'd understand if you're looking for some depth then I'd not recommend\
      \ this right now."
