    review: 'Controls: 3/10.

      It''s mouse+kb but doesn''t use the kb to move. Instead it requires to keep
      the right mouse button pressed. Just no.

      Also, it uses random keys like E or S for actions, instead of sensible ones
      like ctrl or space.


      Visibility: 2/10

      The illuminated areas are so dark that I can''t even see enemies while they
      are on me. The mage''s light is a joke.


      Legibility: 1/10

      Tutorial texts cause strain because they are too small.

      NPCs texts are even smaller and disappear after half a second. That''s utterly
      ridiculous.


      Gameplay: 3/10

      While there''s nothing wrong with old school hack n'' slash, having to walk
      through every corridor/room at least twice, i.e., at least once with each character,
      is a big freakin'' NO.

      It''s a single player game. The other brother should follow, or teleport, or
      whatever.


      GUI: 2/10

      No save/load. No controls mapping. No font size options. No text speed options.
      No useful option whatsoever. ESC doesn''t work in menus...


      I''ll stop here. There is a lot to fix before that thing becomes remotely enjoyable.

      By the way, the unskippable intro is so long and boring that I almost went for
      an instant refund, before reaching the actual game.'
