    review: I've been playing this game since it came out in 2002 and I was in the
      10th grade at the time.  Some 18 years later and the game is still as fun as
      it was then!  To me this is the best RCT in the series as it fell off severely
      after RCT 3.  Well worth the money and time invested!
