    review: "Hello Steam user who is wondering if this visual novel is worth their\
      \ time. I'm going to tell you right now that the short answer is... Oh boy this\
      \ one was [i]tough[/i]. To be honest, I have no idea if I'm recommending this\
      \ or not as I type these words. This is definitely one of those times I wish\
      \ Steam allowed neutral reviews.\n\nPros\n\u2013 the characters. Thankfully\
      \ one of the most important elements of any visual novel (or really, any story\
      \ driven narrative) is done decently well here. Our heroine, Juliet, is a riot.\
      \ Both her dialogue and internal monologues made me laugh out loud more than\
      \ one and she has a distinct, memorable personality which many player characters\
      \ in this particular genre of games generally lack. She also grows as a character\
      \ no matter which route you're playing[spoiler](although it is especially evident\
      \ in Kadin's route where she decides to give up pranking on her own accord instead\
      \ of getting in trouble and being forced to quit like in the other routes).[/spoiler]The\
      \ love interests are great too with each having their own motivations and feelings.\
      \ Romeo our animal loving honor student with a hidden troublemaking side, Richard\
      \ the sweethearted bad boy wannabe who's lost in more ways than one and Kadin\
      \ the lovable loyal bubbly friend with a few hidden secrets. Each guy was great\
      \ in their own way and I couldn't help but love them when I was on their routes.\
      \ No matter how sloppily told those routes were (but we'll get to that) I also\
      \ even like the side characters who had their own personalities and feelings\
      \ too. \n\u2013 The humor. This game is really good at pulling the unexpected\
      \ laughs. Especially with how creative some of the pranks ended up getting and\
      \ just general the romcom tone of the whole thing. Even when you [i]KNEW[/i]\
      \ what was going to happen, someone or something unexpected would come around\
      \ and make the moment feel fresh and original.\n\u2013 The art. It's not groundbreaking\
      \ or anything but it is pleasant to look at and even with several characters\
      \ being related to each other and looking similar. Everyone had a distinct look\
      \ even though two characters looked almost identical (again will get to that).\
      \ The chibi art was the best.\n\u2013 The menu. Very user-friendly so even if\
      \ you're not visual novel savvy it's no trouble to get used to it.\n\nCons\n\
      \u2013 the story. The story in this game is [i]absolute[/i] cluttered mess!\
      \ Basically the premise is Juliet is constantly moving around with her parents\
      \ who are big Shakespeare fans and writers and they just moved into a town that\
      \ they use to live in an Juliet ends up running into three boys who all knew\
      \ her at one point in her life and she also has amnesia and can't remember anything\
      \ before the age of seven. Yeah, see how I tagged amnesia as kind of a side\
      \ note; that's what the game [i]does[/i] even though that's supposed to be the\
      \ main underlying plot of the whole thing. The worst thing is only[spoiler]Romeo's[/spoiler]route\
      \ [i]actually[/i] addresses the cause of the amnesia and the big reveal of the\
      \ plot (which makes me think that it's the true route of the game) while the\
      \ other routes barely even touch upon it.[spoiler]Now this somewhat justified\
      \ in Kadin's route because he met her after she got the amnesia and already\
      \ knew about it beforehand but this doesn't make [i]any[/i] sense in Richard's\
      \ route because he was THERE when this happened! He knew her too so the fact\
      \ that they don't really mention it at all in his route makes zero sense from\
      \ a narrative or logical perspective.[/spoiler]Then there's also another girl\
      \ that looks almost identical to Juliet also named Juliette. When you play[spoiler]Romeo's\
      \ route to find out that she's actually named Rosa and that you knew her after\
      \ you got sent to the hospital but it's never explained why she looks like you\
      \ or why she has the same name just spelled differently and it's also not explained\
      \ why Richard knew the name Rosa even though she never shows up in his route\
      \ which is just beyond confusing.[/spoiler]Also they never explain if[spoiler]Kat\
      \ is really psychic or not or if she has multiple personalities and her other\
      \ personality never shows up in her brother's route which I thought was really\
      \ strange because you think that the other personality will show up the most\
      \ in that route but nope.[/spoiler]\n\u2013 The presentation. Okay this is where\
      \ the game really tanks. The way the game tells the story is in a series of\
      \ vignettes which is not a bad way to do it. However, many times the scenes\
      \ seem like they're caught off or just jump to the next thing without having\
      \ a proper conclusion many times. Sometimes it seems very deliberate. Like they're\
      \ trying to do a cliffhanger but other times just seem completely random and\
      \ it's jarring as hell. There's also different variations that can happen in\
      \ routes depending on what you choose so sometimes characters will mention things\
      \ that you would've never [i]seen[/i] happen because you chose the wrong choice.\n\
      \u2013 The endings. Again not in themselves are they bad but the normal endings\
      \ almost felt better than the so-called good endings. I think that they should\
      \ of done two good endings and two bad endings.\n\nNeutral\n\u2013 the music.\
      \ It sets the tone and has a distinct charm but not much else. It's also pretty\
      \ catchy.\n\nAlright after all of that... I think I will recommend the game\
      \ but only for the characters and definitely on a discount of at least 50%.\
      \ The only reason I do this is because I thought the game has good characters\
      \ and good humor even if it's story is all over the place and its editing is\
      \ terrible. If you do want to try it they have a demo so if it's really not\
      \ your thing then you should be fine."
