I honestly thought it would cost a bit more too. The original trailer was vague, but now that I've played, the trailer explained everything in serious depth and detail. Fun game, can't wait to see what else comes out of it. Workshop would be cool to see too.\n\nControls feel a bit wonky at first, but they end up making sense. I hell of a lot of fun, especially for the price. I think there is a ton of potential here and excited to see it.\n\n'SHOUT' is a bit of an ear rape, sooo now I know not to play this at work with speakers up. Otherwise I love the game.","timestamp_created":1568308093,"timestamp_updated":1568308093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486486464738845825","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hMyck+0CcPiN0gE="}
