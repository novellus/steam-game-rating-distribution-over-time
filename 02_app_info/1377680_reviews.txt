It is not always easy to master each level but this makes it all the more exciting to play. I was also convinced by the atmospheric background music that invites to leave everyday life and enter an entirely different world. I enjoyed it more than I expected so far. Looking forward to continue playing. So far definitely a recommendation from my side!","timestamp_created":1598689497,"timestamp_updated":1598689497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60000002384185791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+rnUnPQCcK69ngI="}
