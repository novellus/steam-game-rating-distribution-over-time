    about_the_game: "The War of the Pacific resulted from a dispute between Chile\
      \ and his British ally versus Peru and his American ally over control of the\
      \ nitrate-rich coastal area of the Atacama Desert. The Atacama was a rough terrain\
      \ to conquer and occupy for long. It was nearly waterless and had few roads\
      \ and railroads. From the beginning of the war it became clear that, to seize\
      \ or defend the local nitrate resources in a difficult desert terrain, control\
      \ of the sea would be the deciding factor. In the campaign of November 1879\
      \ the Peruvian Navy had lost their two most important warships. Peruvians collected\
      \ money to buy new warships, guns, torpedo boats and other weapons. To maintain\
      \ its naval superiority, Chileans were forced to rearm their warships with new\
      \ long-barreled breech-loading rifle guns. The war goes on\u2026<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nCreate your fleet and army, hunt the enemy's fleet, hide your weak squadrons\
      \ in protected ports until reinforcements arrive, blockade enemy trade routes,\
      \ amphibious assaults and harbour sieges, struggle for dominance over the seas\
      \ in turned-based strategic mode - All of these actions are possible in Ironclad\
      \ 2 War of the Pacific. The real time tactical battle mode allows you to set\
      \ up battles and squadron groups with their formations and management using\
      \ realistic ship models and characteristics as well as advanced ballistics and\
      \ weapon models. Choose your ships, increase the experience of your crews and\
      \ send your squadron into the high seas. Command a battle formation and experience\
      \ the power of iron and steam in a turned-based maritime strategy mode while\
      \ fighting battles with a tactical real time naval simulation game."

    review: "Ironclads 2: War of the Pacific is a naval scenario set in the War of\
      \ the Pacific (1879 - 1883) between Chile and Peru and Bolivia. \n\nIt comes\
      \ with two campaigns: Chile and Peru. I completed the two campaigns with Chile\
      \ and Peru, playing Chile as more offensive and Peru as more defensive. I found\
      \ Peru more challenging and having a though time against some chilean ships,\
      \ specially casemate ships such as Blanco but with a good strategy it can be\
      \ successfully completed easily. \n\nIn the good side I would mention: (1) the\
      \ variety of ships and beautiful ship models, (2) good AI, (3) a variety of\
      \ options in the strategy map and ship command individually and in formations,\
      \ (4) interesting history period, not previously covered in other games.\n\n\
      In the bad side I would say: (1) the lack of custom battles, which would be\
      \ a great feature to play battles with a variety of ship formations and to get\
      \ familiar with each ship type as well as an interesting gameplay, (2) the lack\
      \ of historical battles, which would also be a nice addition to have the opportunity\
      \ to play the interesting historical scenarios the Battle of Angamos (1879)\
      \ and Iquique (1879). I would really encourage developers to include custom\
      \ battles and historical battles in new releases.\n\nOverall I liked the game\
      \ and there are not other options out there besides Totem Games releases to\
      \ play naval games with Ironclads, a fascinating naval period because of ship\
      \ design evolution and technological improvements over 19th century. I recommend\
      \ this game to anyone interested in this period and War of the Pacific."
