When I saw that \"Good Mourning\" was available, I bought it and played it immediately. \n\n\"Good Mourning\" hit closer to home for me, but I don’t think I enjoyed it quite as much as \"Lydia\"; however, they are completely different. The story is really interesting, accompanied by an amazing atmosphere, art style and soundtrack. The game as a whole, especially the ending, really affected me, and \"Good Mourning\" has a lot to say about life as a whole, the decisions we make along the way, and the regrets we have afterwards.  I saw a lot of myself in the main character, and unfortunately, that’s not entirely a good thing. I will definitely be replaying this soon, because I didn’t experience everything. \n-- 9.5/10 --\nThe reason I give it a 9.5 instead of a 10 is because the game is repetitive, however, the repetition is purposeful & part of the narrative’s point. I still felt that it could have used a little bit of trimming.","timestamp_created":1609882014,"timestamp_updated":1609882014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwk8Kc6vYCc8DpwAI="}
