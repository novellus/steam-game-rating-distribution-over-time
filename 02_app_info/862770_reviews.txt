It's incredibly satisfying to beat the snot out of everything in sight, and in as flashy a manner as possible. The game has a real charm about it, the plot reminds me a lot of Need For Speed: Most Wanted in that it's very straightforward. You're gonna become the best robot mech boxer, and that's all you really need to go on story-wise. \n\nMy sole warning is that if you have a cheap mouse, it may not survive some of these levels, since you have to click rapid-fire to punch out all the enemies and their projectiles and it can get really intense in certain areas","timestamp_created":1596929719,"timestamp_updated":1596929719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rbeb6PMCf8ikmgI="}
