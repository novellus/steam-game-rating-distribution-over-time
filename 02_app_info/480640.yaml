    review: "This is one of those spots where steam needs a neutral recommendation.\
      \  There's a lot to unpack with this game. \n\nFirst off this is a video game\
      \ based off of a board game.  That board game is a great game that I am very\
      \ fond of and this video game is a faithful port of that game.  Over time the\
      \ board game has been expanded upon greatly and those expansions have added\
      \ a lot of really solid features and improvements.  This video game ONLY covers\
      \ the initial offerings of the board game, not the numerous expansions that\
      \ came later.  The result of this is that there are a lot of cards that would\
      \ be great to see that simply don't exist in the video game.  For this port\
      \ they also changed a few minor things (a couple of the characters have slightly\
      \ different abilities on their cards).\n\nNone of this makes the game not enjoyable,\
      \ it's just mildly disappointing.\n\nThe reason I wouldn't recommend this game\
      \ though is how incredibly buggy it can be.  Nothing that makes the game unplayable.\
      \  Just lots and lots of little dumb bugs.  Cast scry during the final encounter?\
      \  You'll need to restart the client so you can cancel casting scry because\
      \ you can't actually successfully use that spell there, it will trigger the\
      \ same bug every single time.  Change your party around too many times in one\
      \ sitting (to shuffle cards around between characters), that leads to the deck\
      \ management interface crashing.  You'll need to restart the client.  I've had\
      \ a few different games where I had to forfeit because the game bugged out and\
      \ even after restarting the client I couldn't end the turn.  Just frustrating.\n\
      \nSo in the end this is a good board game ported to pc mostly successfully,\
      \ that crashes with uncomfortable frequency.  If you can deal with that, its\
      \ a fun game."
