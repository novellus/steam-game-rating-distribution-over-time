The main game is fun, but I enjoy the dungeon master mode the most. The campaign is challenging, and you absolutely NEED to go through the tutorial to understand the controls. The computer will auto battle for you, or you can take control of your armies fighters in both modes. I got it on sale, and would be satisfied with the game at full price. I haven't beaten level 40 om dungeon master mode. It's my favorite way to play because you get to combine a lot of different characters from different factions to make exceptionally powerful teams. This is somewhat limited in the free play mode based on needing to recruit roaming heroes. The display is a little small and the battles are fast paced due to time limits in free mode. It's not a graphically stunning masterpiece, but if you enjoy challenging strategy games with role playing and character development, you'll enjoy this game once you get past the tutorial. I tried to play before going through it, and almost requested a refund. I'm glad I didn't.","timestamp_created":1609823986,"timestamp_updated":1609823986,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlZS/6PYCe/HNwAI="}
