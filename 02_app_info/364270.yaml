    review: 'It''s trying to feel retro and instead feels chintzy. The music doesn''t
      sound good, just crappy and lazily written, The whole tone of the story is so
      painfully tongue-in-cheek that it loses any comedic effect. It''s ugly to look
      at. Idk I got it for $0.08 and I still don''t see it as worth the money.


      It''s turn-based, idk if it said that in the description of the game. So, ultra
      boring with cheesy battle music on top of everything else.'
