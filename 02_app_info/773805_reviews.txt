Overture]\n[Instrumental]\n\n[II. About to Crash]\n[Lyrics: John Petrucci]\n\n[Verse]\nShe can't stop pacing\nShe never felt so alive\nHer thoughts are racing\nSet on overdrive\nIt takes a village\nThis she knows is true\nThey're expecting her\nAnd she's got work to do\nHe helplessly stands by\nIt's meaningless to try\nAs he rubs his red-rimmed eyes\nHe says \"I've never seen her get this bad\nEven though she seems so high\"\nHe knows that she can't fly\nAnd when she falls out of the sky\nHe'll be standing by\nShe was raised in a small midwestern town\nBy a charming and eccentric loving father\nShe was praised as the perfect teenage girl\nAnd everyone thought highly of her\nAnd she tried everyday\nWith endless drive\nTo make the grade\nThen one day\nShe woke up to find\nThe perfect girl\nHad lost her mind\nOnce barely taking a break\nNow she sleeps the days away\nShe helplessly stands by\nIt's meaningless to try\nAll she wants to do is cry\nNo one ever knew she was so sad\nCause even though she gets so high\nAnd thinks that she can fly\nShe will fall out of the sky\nBut in the face of misery\nShe found hopefulness\nFeeling better\nShe had weathered\nThis depression\nMuch to her advantage\nShe resumed her frantic pace\nBoundless power\nMidnight hour\nShe enjoyed the race\n\n[III. War Inside my Head]\n[Lyrics: Mike Portnoy]\n\n[Verse 1]\nNapalm showers\nShowed the cowards\nWe weren't there to mess around\nThrough heat exhaustion\nAnd mind distortion\nA military victory mounted on innocent ground\n\n[Chorus 1]\nHearing voices from miles away\nSaying things never said\nSeeing shadows in the light of the day\nWaging a war inside my head\n\n[Verse 2]\nYears and years of\nBloodshed and warfare\nOur mission was only to get in and kill\nA free vacation\nOf palmtrees and shrapnel\nTrading innocence for permanent psychotic hell\n\n[Chorus 1]\n\n[Chorus 2]\nFeeling strangers staring my way\nReading minds never read\nTasting danger with each word I say\nWaging a war inside my...\n\n[IV. The Test That Stumped Them All]\n[Lyrics: Mike Portnoy]\n\n[Verse]\nStanding in the darkness\nWaiting for the light\nThe smell of pure adrenaline\nBurning in the night\nRandom blinding flashes\nAiming at the stage\nIntro tape begins to roll\nIgniting sonic rage\nStill they keep me between these hollow walls\nHoping to find in me\nThe answers to the test that stumped them all\n\"The boy is simply crazy\nSuffering from delusions\nWe honestly think that maybe\nHe might need an institution\nHe lives in a world of fiction\nAnd really could use some help\nWe have just the place to fix him\nTo save him from himself\"\nCurled up in the darkness\nSearching for the light\nThe smell of stale sweat and shit\nStreaming through the night\nRandom urine testing\nPills red, pink and blue\nCounseling and therapy\nProviding not a clue\nStill they keep me between these hollow walls\nHoping to find in me\nThe answers to the test that stumped them all\n\"We can't seem to find the answers\nHe seemed such a clear cut case\nWe cannot just let him leave here\nAnd put all this work to waste\nWhy don't we try shock treatment\nIt really might do some help\nWe have just the tools to fix him\nTo save him from himself\"\n\n[V. Goodnight Kiss]\n[Lyrics: Mike Portnoy]\n\n[Verse]\nGoodnight kiss in your nightgown\nLavender in your bed\nSo innocent as you lie down\nSweet dreams that run through your head\nAre you lonely without mommy's love?\nI want you to know I'd die for that moment\nYou're just a poor girl\nAfraid of this cruel world\nTaken away from it all\nIt's been 5 years to the day and\nMy tainted blood's still the same\nI can't help acting this way and\nThose bastard doctors are gonna pay\nI'm so lonely without baby's love\nI want you to know I'd die for one more moment\nI'm just a poor girl\nAfraid of this cruel world\nTaken away from it all\n\n[VI. Solitary Shell]\n[Lyrics: John Petrucci]\n\n[Verse]\nHe seemed no different from the rest\nJust a healthy normal boy\nHis mama always did her best\nAnd he was daddy's pride and joy\nHe learned to walk and talk on time\nBut never cared much to be held\nAnd steadily he would decline\nInto his solitary shell\nAs a boy he was considered somewhat odd\nKept to himself most of the time\nHe would daydream in and out of his own world\nBut in every other way he was fine\nHe's a monday morning lunatic\nDisturbed from time to time\nLost within himself\nIn his solitary shell\nA temporary catatonic\nMadman on occasion\nWhen will he break out\nOf his solitary shell\nHe struggled to get through his day\nHe was helplessly behind\nHe poured himself onto the page\nWriting for hours at a time\nAs a man he was a danger to himself\nFearful and sad most of the time\nHe was drifting in and out of sanity\nBut in every other way he was fine\nHe's a monday morning lunatic\nDisturbed from time to time\nLost within himself\nIn his solitary shell\nA momentary maniac\nWith casual delusions\nWhen will he be let out\nOf his solitary shell\n\n[VII. About to Crash (reprise)]\n[Lyrics: John Petrucci]\n\n[Verse]\nI'm alive again\nThe darkness far behind me\nI'm invincible\nDespair will never find me\nI feel strong\nI've got a new sense of elation\nBoundless energy\nEuphoria fixation\nStill it's hard to just get by\nIt seems so meaningless to try\nWhen all i want to do is cry\nWho would ever know i felt so sad\nEven though i get so high\nI know that i will never fly\nAnd when i fall out of the sky\nWho'll be standing by\nWill you be standing by\n\n[VIII. Losing Time/Grand Finale]\n[Lyrics: John Petrucci]\n\n[Verse]\nShe dresses in black everyday\nShe keeps her hair simple and plain\nShe never wears makeup\nBut no one would care if she did anyway\nShe doesn't recall yesterday\nFaces seem twisted and strange\nBut she always wakes up\nOnly to find she'd been miles away\nAbsence of awareness\nLosing time\nA lapse of perception\nLosing time\nWanting to escape\nShe had created a way to survive\nShe learned to detach from herself\nA behavior that kept her alive\n\nHope in the face of our human distress\nHelps us to understand the turbulence deep inside\nThat takes hold of our lives\nShame and disgrace over mental unrest\nKeeps us from saving those we love\nThe grace within our hearts\nAnd the sorrow in our souls\nDeception of fame\nVengeance of war\nLives torn apart\nLosing oneself\nSpiraling down\nFeeling the walls closing in\nA journey to find\nThe answers inside\nOur elusive mind","timestamp_created":1606952755,"timestamp_updated":1606952755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.400291115045547485","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ486P2kvYCfIbwtgI="}
