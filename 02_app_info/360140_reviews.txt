Lo and behold, this album is a bit of a doozy! Super-atmospheric, surprisingly melodic...a simmering, sinister mini-masterpiece that threatens to explode into full-blown apocalypse at any moment.\n\n   Put it this way: there's a lot of bass frequency, yet very little for your average ecstasy-addled raver in pink furry booties to bop to. EBM-loving goths, maybe...but even that's a bit of a stretch. This is some moody, broody sh*t.\n\n   If you're still in your teens and living with your parents, and are looking for a fresh new way to \"rebel\" against them, I strongly recommend purchasing this soundtrack. Your folks will immediately cease searching your bed for marijuana and wank mags, and start looking for razor blades and Anton LaVey autobiographies instead. Forget Metallica and Marilyn Manson: take a gun to school with a burned copy of THIS surly f*cker sitting at home in your CD player, and the cops and courts will have a field day.\n\n   There won't be any \"but he seemed like such a nice, normal boy\" testimonies from people who know you. Even your Mum will say: \"Yep, I'm not surprised, given that depressing, Satanic crap he listens to. Now if you'll excuse me, officer, I was just in the middle of playing all my Beach Boys records in strict chronological order...\"\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Yes, the Beach Boys joke is a thinly-veiled Charlie Manson reference. No, I don't expect anyone except myself to get it. Yes, I am a sad, snarly b*stard who needs to get out of the house and watch happy-go-lucky Marvel movies more often.)","timestamp_created":1484320788,"timestamp_updated":1530887039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.656815230846405029","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gc3+t+QCfbG+bw=="}
