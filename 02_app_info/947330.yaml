      \ brought the city\u2019s thousands of buildings back to life, learn about the\
      \ famous seven hills and other natural features, and find out how the ancient\
      \ Romans lived, governed and provisioned themselves, took time off for recreation,\
      \ and worshiped their gods. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSee the Forum, Colosseum, aqueducts,\
      \ theater district, the imperial fora, the Circus Maximus, the imperial palace,\
      \ the tombs of Augustus and Hadrian, the Pyramid of Cestius, and much, much\
      \ more. The app has more than 30 points of interest and over two hours of content.\
      \ You can organize your tour with complete freedom. As you move from point to\
      \ point, you can listen to expert commentary about what you are seeing. You\

      \ of Rome\u2019s monuments will be raised. Your curiosity will be aroused. <br\

    reviews: "\u201CI am a professor of Archaeology at the University of Florence\
      \ specialised in Topography of Ancient Rome. I have followed the development\
      \ of Rome Reborn VR since its inception in the 1990s. Now that the first VR\
      \ applications of the project are starting to appear in online stores, I am\
      \ delighted to express my strong support for this unique initiative which combines\
      \ archaeological accuracy with state-of-the-art technology. The goal is to make\
      \ the core monuments of the Eternal City easily comprehensible even to non-experts,\
      \ and to bring ancient Rome into the homes and schools of people wherever they\
      \ may be. In my opinion, the Rome Reborn VR team has brilliantly achieved this\
      \ goal. --Prof. Paolo Liverani\u201D<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/romerebornvr/reviews/?ref=page_internal\"\

      \ Geografia, Arte e Spettacolo, University of Florence (Italy)</a><br><br>\u201C\
      As Director of the Civic Museum of Rieti, about 80 km north of Rome, on Saturday,\
      \ May 26, 2018 I organized, at the museum, two public demonstrations of the\
      \ Rome Reborn VR application presenting the Roman Forum. Over 100 people of\
      \ all ages attended both demonstrations. I can report that the response was\
      \ enthusiastically positive. The event showed that Rome Reborn VR has the potential\
      \ to make the study of history come alive for students and the general public.\
      \ Rome Reborn VR is a great tool for the museum world and for anyone around\
      \ the world who wants to learn more about ancient Rome by going back in time\
      \ to visit the city as it appeared at the peak of its development in AD 320.\
      \ --Dr. Monica De Simone\u201D<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/romerebornvr/reviews/?ref=page_internal\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Civic Museum of Rieti (Italy)</a><br><br>\u201C\
      This is an *amazing* pedagogical tool with lots of applications in secondary\
      \ and higher education. As a professor of Classics, I consider Roman Reborn\
      \ VR an indispensable tool for courses on Roman civilization, Roman history,\
      \ Roman archaeology, even Latin literature. While this app has a lot to offer\
      \ to faculty and students, it will also appeal to non-academics who are interested\
      \ in ancient Rome. --Prof. Zoe Stamatopoulou\u201D<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"\

    review: 'Pros: Accurate representation of 4th century Rome, good and informative
      audible guide, large area, unique.


      Cons: Can''t move freely around the map, sometimes confusing as to where the
      buildings are that the narrator is talking about as there''s no visual indicator
      other than a picture of the area attached to a panel on your controller, building
      and model details are basic.


      Overall: If you''re into Rome and all things Roman then it''s worth the money.  If
      you''re not interested this is going to be huge waste of your time and money
      as it won''t win you over.
