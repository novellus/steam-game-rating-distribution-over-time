    developer_response: "Hi there, Thank you for your feedback and we hope you accept\
      \ our sincere apologies.\nI want to use this opportunity to let you know why\
      \ we made this decision and what steps we have taken to be fair with those who\
      \ have paid.\n\nJoining the Steam store as a VR company, especially one that\
      \ is more of a serious game painted a very unclear picture for us. We had very\
      \ little knowledge on how this would pick up and therefore decided to like all\
      \ other markets kick it off with a paid model (which also peaks the interest\
      \ of the marketplace we are in to possibly feature us). \n\nUnfortunately we\
      \ realized that it was not meeting our expectations and we internally decided\
      \ to make the application free as we grew our library of games to the point\
      \ where a freemium model made sense.\n\nTo be fair with everyone who paid we\
      \ offer two options: (1) Immediately refund them and allow them to keep the\
      \ game (2) not refund them but offer them 6 months of subscription once the\
      \ freemium model kicks in which is a price value of much more than what they\
      \ paid initially.\n\nWe had decoded to go free a lot sooner (first few days)\
      \ but unfortunately Steam does not allow us to make changes in the first 30\
      \ days.\n\nThis being said we would be more than happy to refund you and hope\
      \ you continue to be one of the trail blazers in playing Enhance VR and helping\
      \ us make this the most powerful brain training application out there.\n\nFeel\
      \ free to get in touch with us through email: support@virtuleap.com and we can\
      \ discuss further if needed.\n\nHopefully this post can help you and others\
      \ who felt betrayed with our decision understand that this was not at all our\
      \ intention and we look forward to rectifying the problem. \n\nThanks again."

    review: "Beware!  This is a bait & switch gimmick.  After I purchased this game\
      \ / app, the developers sent out a notice saying they are switching to a monthly\
      \ subscription...even for existing customers.  They are only offering six (6)\
      \ months of this game's premium version, and then we get the shaft with the\
      \ free version!  I smell rip-off indeed....should be criminal if it is not already.\
      \ \n\nDevelopers took my money on terms of paid free and clear full version,\
      \ and now they change their terms and want me to keep paying monthly.  Wow....you\
      \ really need to have a lot of gall to pull this B.S.  I'm forced to have to\
      \ file a complaint now with the BBB just to get started."
