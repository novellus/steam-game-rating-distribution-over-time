      dedicated server which costs money so if the game doesn''t end in total failure

      in the upcoming months. I''ve been also considering adding Russian or French

    review: "Bought this game yesterday only because I've read it carefully on Steam\
      \ about how this bad is compared to games like Guise Of The Wolf, which I myself\
      \ consider as worst of all times (read my review about GOTW if you want to know\
      \ a bit why it's extremely bad).\n\nSo, this game is called The Rebel, where\
      \ the plot is about one last hope is an agent searching after Magnus, which\
      \ nearly destroying earth, i.e. the third war. To be honest, that might be the\
      \ only interesting thing about this game. Oh wait, you just know the main plot\
      \ but not details, which gave this game a huge con as introduction.\n\nThere\
      \ are three levels to play after installing, about 4-5 GB HDD space? First feeling\
      \ I got about it, was, well, limited levels why? But then I thought it might\
      \ provide a decent gameplay when starting one of the levels. Believe me, it\
      \ didn't give me any good impression at all, the loading screen was misplaced\
      \ at hell and it loaded extremely slowly in maybe 45 seconds.\n\nFirst level\
      \ is located in a forest where you are hunted by a dinosaur (Tyrannosaurus Rex\
      \ type) and some useless enemy NPCs like robots. Sure, they are trying to kill\
      \ me, so I ran from them. The robots disappeared, but the dinosaur didn't. I\
      \ decided to shoot at it a few times, but nothing happened. I got stuck and\
      \ the dinosaur attacked me. I got hurt, and I thought I was killed in the game.\
      \ That's what any of us would believe in this game, but no. You couldn't die\
      \ EVEN THOUGH you are getting eaten by a dinosaur, and you can't hurt it with\
      \ your weapons. So, great. I tested to jump, and my jump high was like a height\
      \ of a mountain. Incredible, how bad level it was for not achievening anything.\n\
      \nSecond level? A space station with, again, robots and some invicible soldiers\
      \ with sci-fi themed weapons. I were being told in the game to do anything,\
      \ but I couldn't because the enemies were just shooting at me and I couldn't\
      \ kill them. Again as expected, as they couldn't kill me. After this level,\
      \ I directly thought this game is a joke. But it felt impossible, it can't be\
      \ that bad. That's where you and I was wrong until the last level.\n\nSo, third\
      \ level you are supposed to be in a center of a city finding codes, for whatever\
      \ I'm not been told for what for. I'm just standing there in the city, and fighting\
      \ against same type of enemies. Robots and soldiers with transparent visibility.\
      \ Now, why this is extremely bad, is because the map feels like a huge square,\
      \ where the city is placed in the middle of it, and the rest where it doesn't\
      \ belong, is outside the side, like extremely high growth grass, misplaced everywhere\
      \ outside of the city. Now, the worst thing of this map, is the flashing details\
      \ of buildings. Everything on the map looks extremely bad, worse than ugly.\
      \ Weapons you can't use to kill enemies, and very bad focus on how to solve\
      \ objective in a FPS game.\n\nThe conclusion of this game is, it's the worst\
      \ game I've ever played since Guise Of The Wolf. Sure, GOTW has extremely bad\
      \ graphics and is boring at times, but it surely is made to complete the game.\
      \ This game, however, can't be defined as a completed game. There is nothing\
      \ to do in this horrible game except getting hurt 24/7 without dying. The devloper\
      \ of this game should be ashamed of making this game.\n\nAdvice: Don't even\
      \ buy this game. It's a scam.  \n\n"
