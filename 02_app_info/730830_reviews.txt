Sure the puzzles are easier (and you can find hints), and some of the map areas and items can be difficult to find with the clunky movement/turning, but the story and humour make up for the shortcomings of this instalment in the grand scheme of Monkey Island games.","timestamp_created":1609905671,"timestamp_updated":1609905671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4teH26vYCfa/zwAI="}
