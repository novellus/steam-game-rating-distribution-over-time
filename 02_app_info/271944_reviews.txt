As with the other Dark Souls II DLCS packs, this one features new areas, new enemies, new equipment, new boss fights, and a co-op \"dungeon\" segment. There's also a lot of lore stuff here and there that ties Dark Souls II back to the first game. I appreciated the lore once, but it didn't strike a chord with me this time around.\n\nThe icy castle town hasn't aged perfectly, and its blank stone corridors look more video game-like than physically believable in 2020. However, the mechanics behind it all are still compelling and surprising. You're encouraged to explore Eleum Loyce multiple times, and it changes each time in challenging ways. The enemies are just okay, though, bordering on forgettable. I barely remembered them, and I can see why on my second pass.\n\nThe bosses look great, but they're mechanically simple. I beat the two main bosses by circling to the right and hitting their blind spots. I did not feel particularly engaged, but that was partially due to my own familiarity with the series. The co-op segment is also frustrating, with a visibility and mobility-reducing blizzard and those awful reindeer enemies that spawn behind you.\n\nCrown of the Ivory King also wraps up the game's arc on \"Fragments of the Dark,\" a quartet of magical women in various kingdoms who oppose the player character. Unlike the rest of the ladies, however, Eleum Loyce's oracle is your ally, which results in a unique dynamic. Her unexpected turn was one of my favorite parts of this DLC.","timestamp_created":1608934746,"timestamp_updated":1609379951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4maah2/YCepmYvQI="}
