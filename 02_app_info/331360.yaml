      This is a fantastic mashup between Twisted Metal and Rock N Roll Racing all
      folded into a MOBA format.  The game is 4 v 4 Bomb Run, which pits playes in
      a symmetrical arena with mini race tracks on either side.  The bomb spawns in
      the middle and the teams fight to carry the bomb through the opposing team''s
      track and into their goal.  There are three classes: transporter, support and
      interceptor.  Transporters specialize in moving the ball, interceptors specialize
      in damage and crowd control while support specializes in heals and crowd control.  The
      first time I played it, I honestly thought it was a frantic mess.  Ten games
      later, I''m strategizing with my friends over team comp, devising new ambushes
      and learning to drive backwards while carrying the ball and fighting off enemies.  The
      game offers surprising depth and competition, while the devs have already promised
      new modes which all sound amazing.  I''d say the only thing the game currently
      lacks is a playerbase, so hop on in!'
