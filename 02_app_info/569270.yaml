    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Sable Maze: Sullivan River" Collector''s Edition is a Hidden Object Puzzle
      Adventure game. The game was developed by Daily Magic Productions and published
      by Big Fish Games Studio.


      "Sullivan River" is the first episode of "Sable Maze."


      Since this is a collector''s edition game, it comes with extra features that
      are not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visual for the game is nicely done. The visuals can
      be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are three different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual; Advanced
      and Hard.


      The notebook keeps track of the progression in the game. Such as story events
      and clues.


      There is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel
      between each location quickly. It also indicates that there are certain tasks
      that need to be completed at certain locations within the game. The interactive
      map is not automatically given at the start of the game.


      There is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in
      place. The inventory panel is stationary.


      The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Traditional word lists. Some
      of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interaction.


      The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of
      them.


      Since this is a collector''s edition game, there is a bonus chapter, but it
      can be accessed only after the main story is completed.


      Miscellaneous


      There are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Game Strategy Guide; Soundtracks;
      Concept Art and Wallpapers. Most of these extra features can be accessed only
      after the entire game is completed.


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I recommend this game, but not at the game''s full
      price value.'
