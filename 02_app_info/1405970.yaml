    review: Very realistic 1850s western cowboy atmosphere, you can ride and shoot.
      Coupled with cowboy music, it is really the feeling of the gold rush era in
      the western United States. One disadvantage is that although riding a horse
      feels good, it is easy to faint when play for long time. very realistic scenes,
      including bars and deserts.
