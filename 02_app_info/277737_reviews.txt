That is literally the only reason I buy DLC, so I can play more scenarios. I have no interest in quick drive, with one exception (See my bubble car review).\n\nDo not buy this. I can only hope that someday Dovetail fixes this. I'm sure they wont, but I'll change my review if they do.\n\nUpdate April 2020\n\nI have been able to successfully complete the scenarios. When tracks.bin or whatever fails to load, I hit F2 to save and it as per someone's advice, and somehow sorted it out for me.\n\nI don't care if the horn doesn't sound right or all the lights don't work, I'm really not overly concerned. But I can do the scenarios now.\n\nBuy it on sale if you're going to buy it at all.\n\nAlso, since as far as I can tell this fix doesn't come from Dovetail, i'm not going to change the positivity of the review.","timestamp_created":1495411362,"timestamp_updated":1586919419,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55929487943649292","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x5XxvfECfOHUeQ=="}
