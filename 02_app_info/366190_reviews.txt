While I like that the lighting physics have had several adjustments in CopperCube 6, since the swf was removed and the Javascript is still version 3 in both 5 and 6 until later updates, I think 5 Pro has more benefits to me since I am still in the planning stages of a game.  For the planning stages, I think CopperCube Pro is great.  As far as outputs, the more the merrier. When it comes to considering making a game pretty, well, AGK is on phones, works on Linux, and has incredible manuals available in addition to all the documentation available online.  \n\nI remember when I first got CopperCube Pro DLC, I ran across a dismal scripting interface, but when I open it these days the scripting window is far more of what I expect of a good spartan scripting window.\n\nThe major weakness of CopperCube is a lack of walkthroughs, example games to learn from, and offline documentation.  I think the documentation on the website for CopperCube is very nice, yet when compared to AGK, even the phone app has example games to look at and learn from.  CopperCube is more like getting a nice toolbox with no one to learn from.","timestamp_created":1558139272,"timestamp_updated":1558739599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596794366836547852","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46deH9uoCcd2wwQE="}
