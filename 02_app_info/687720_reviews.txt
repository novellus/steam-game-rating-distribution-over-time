It's a neat town, but do note that the time of day affects who and what will show up, and that's tied to your PC clock.  An NPC tells you this during the day, but if you work during the day, and can only play this at night, you'll never know; bad move.  You can also switch between day and night by pressing P; it never tells you this at all.  Overall, it just isn't quite as good as the first episode; it's still plenty weird, and I loved that, but it ends with one of those mazes where choosing the wrong direction takes you back to the very beginning, and only some of the screens have clear visual cues as to which way to go.  And it takes you back SLOWLY; your patience is wearing thin, but you still have to wait for it to fade out and back in without the ability to move EVERY TIME.  Everything is slow, even pressing the button to skip the text crawl; controls are very delayed in most everything that isn't just walking around.  That's a problem in the first episode, too, but it really starts to wear away at you here.","timestamp_created":1609820548,"timestamp_updated":1609820548,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuoWy6PYCc9PMwAI="}
