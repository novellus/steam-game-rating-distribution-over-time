It is a buggy mess (from resetting options and typos to progress-stopping bugs), but the game is amusing enough to recommend - it is LGBT-friendly, all characters look like adults and there is no porn. There are character customization ([spoiler]for some reason, my fighter turned into a druid after the first session, an intimidating druid with a battle axe and green hair[/spoiler]), dialogue options and very basic turn-based combat. The controls are not rebindable. Also the game uses auto-saves (5 save slots), meaning that to save at a specific point one has to use Windows Explorer (C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Owl Sanctuary Studios).","timestamp_created":1580862107,"timestamp_updated":1580862688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsMmwifACdoyi8AE="}
