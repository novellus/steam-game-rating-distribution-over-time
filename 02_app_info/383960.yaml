      Tree, Esthanatelle.<br>After the destruction of the &quot;Old World,&quot; the
      Esthanatelle Order, worshipers of the Planet Tree, took control of the world.<br>During
      that time, &quot;Attributes,&quot; relics of the &quot;Old World&quot; were
      being excavated in ruins everywhere, and the Order established Halbern Machinery
      Academy to research these &quot;Attributes.&quot;<br>The stated purpose of the
      Academy was the management and control of &quot;Attributes&quot; but, as it
      began to bring more places under its control, gradually the Order's control
      on it lessened and the Academy soon began to act independently, as a governing
      institution over a large part of the world. <br><br>At the height of all this,
