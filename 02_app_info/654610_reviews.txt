The gravity feature is a tad bit inconsistent as it effects how fast you fall randomly, i could say the same about the dash, when you dash forward while falling or jumping the dash effects you in a annoying way, keep playing through the game and you'll know what i mean. Another thing this game kinda lacks is the level mapping, i feel like the developers stopped making an obvious path in which your supposed to go and instead started throwing in spikes, gates, and blocks then have you find your own way to cheese through it. That being said this game \"IS\" difficult, but not that difficult, not until the last level at least, now that's a shit show.  (P.S There is a very annoying glitched spike/block and shock gate on lvl 21)","timestamp_created":1607481253,"timestamp_updated":1607481253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yKvWovYCcNKnuAI="}
