    review: It's a fun pack of challenges that puts together all the skills you've
      learned in a way that the game didn't take full advantage of. The platforming
      is fun and introduced a few neat tricks I hadn't thought of, and the combat
      had some humor mixed in with the challenge. It's overall pretty fun if you have
      the dexterity for it.
