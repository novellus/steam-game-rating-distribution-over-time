For those hardcore gamers who love unforgiving time-trial games, perhaps this is the game for you. For those gamers who want a casual experience, this isn't it. There are some frustrating mechanics. The game is labeled as hardcore and I understand that it's developed to be time-based gameplay. You will have to repeat levels dozens of times before you finally get the hang of it and then start to improve your speed. There are some key flaws that really hold this game back from being better. Some wonky fight mechanics that are incredibly unforgiving (boss battles), weird bugs, gun shooting mechanics feel wonky, hit detection is a MAJOR issue, and there's not enough content. If you go into this game thinking that it's a proof of concept for an indie project, then it's understandable and it's quite interesting. Unique art style that makes me want more if it was slightly more forgiving. I'd recommend it for those gamers who like a hardcore experience (even on casual).","timestamp_created":1562215491,"timestamp_updated":1562215491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ425TT3esCecT6ywE="}
