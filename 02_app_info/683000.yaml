    review: "I guess at one point this game was going for $40 which caused some negative\
      \ reviews, and no this game is not worth $40 at least not if you're playing\
      \ mostly solo.  Devs seems to agree so at $20 it's an easy recommendation. \
      \ Crazy to me that a VR game with solid performance, decent graphics, free locomotion,\
      \ quality 90s Fear Factory inspired soundtrack, and a pretty wicked leash system\
      \ (for weakened enemies) is sitting on Mixed reviews.  On a 50% sale this is\
      \ an absolute steal but it's worth it at $20.  \n\nThere's even destructible\
      \ environments / cover and I can't even think of another VR game pulls that\
      \ off as well as this one does.  And sure the story is goofy and by-the-numbers\
      \ but if you're playing sci-fi VR shooters (that aren't HL: Alyx) for the story\
      \ then you're gonna have a bad time.  \n\nThis game bangs and needs far more\
      \ exposure.  Will at least watch for more from these dvs."
