    review: This game is truly ahead of it's time. With simple yet addicting gameplay
      and genius level design that has the player get really invested in each level,
      this game has it all. The story is rich and complex, but not told directly to
      the player, which I can appreciate. You have to put in the effort to get fully
      invested in the complex lore. The game is a graphical achievement. The main
      menu immediately sets a standard for the entire game unmatched in the industry
      today. Environments are gushing with detail, you'll find yourself getting lost
      in levels, distracted by the beauty in front of you. Enemy designs are a perfect
      portrayal of vaguely human yet grotesque and unnerving. The game has great physical
      feedback as well, every time you fire your keyboard rumbles, which really boosts
      the immersion to another level unmatched by its competitors. Another factor
      contributing to this immersion is the sound design. The ambiance as you walk
      through each level is perfect for the bleak hallways of the game. One thing
      I wish was better was the characterization and pacing. Plot points happen in
      quick succession, with long breaks in between, it came off as very uneven. The
      character arks also feel unfinished, the ending is a little disappointing. All
      in all, this game is a must buy for any gamer.
