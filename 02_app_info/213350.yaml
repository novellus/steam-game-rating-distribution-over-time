    review: Great. As i remember it. It works great with an old desktop pc with a
      gigabyte P43 + Intel Q9550  AND a Gigabyte GTX1650 SUPER. I am very satisfied.
      I also tried the game at a simple HP laptop with core i5 4200U and an AMD 8600M
      graphic card and its true that it didn't work.  I bought the game at 5,09 euro.
