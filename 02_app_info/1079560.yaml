    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2>Each ship in the game comes equipped
      with three unique weapons and a passive ability. These weapons offer the same
      creativity and depth of abilities found in the best MOBA games, but you will
      not find a single cooldown on any of them. Instead, all weapons in the game
      work on a charge system that builds off the damage you deal. Abilities charge
      fast, and playing well makes them charge even faster.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1079560/extras/miniPlay1.gif?t=1605916688"
      /><br><br>But don't get too carried away. Zero Strain's shoot em' up DNA is
      in full effect. Enemies defend themselves and require a mix of strategies to
      take down. Bosses shrug off mindless spamming and demand careful observation
      and reaction. Bullets fill the screen and force well-timed dodges to avoid them
      or well-aimed shots to shoot them down. You'll need to balance offense and defense
      at all times.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1079560/extras/miniPlay2.gif?t=1605916688"
      /><br><br>At first you'll struggle, but before long, you'll be slinging around
      enemies and unleashing perfectly timed weapon combos in a spectacular dance
      of destruction!<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Multiple
      ships to master, each with their own unique weapons and abilities.<br></li><li>

    review: "If you are looking for a bullet hell and something you will have to take\
      \ a few swings at to clear a boss / stage this is it.\n\nEach ship has their\
      \ own mechanics that change how you approach each stage a bit differently. There\
      \ is some back tracking that takes place to earn upgrades. Easy to get sucked\
      \ in by the visuals and lose your place on the screen. Feels very satisfying\
      \ to utterly blow up a boss and struggle against them for hours at a time until\
      \ you master your ship.  \n\nAwesome game!"
