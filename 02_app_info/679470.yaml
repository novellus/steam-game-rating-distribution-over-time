    review: 'Solenars Edge Rebirth is a garbage-tier RPGMaker game, featuring a progression
      of dozens of characters you can hardly care about going through a more-or-less
      strictly linear adventure across poorly-drawn maps. Unlike the previous similar
      game I reviewed, Fateholders of Tetsoidea, Solenars Edge Rebirth is much longer,
      takes itself far more seriously, and uses a bunch of plugins to customize the
      game system. Unfortunately, none of those things ends up really being a point
      in its favor.


      First off, the only real positive is the story. It''s an... attempt at telling
      a fantasy epic, and is easily the best part of the game. Unfortunately, it''s
      also poorly-written (in the sense of being full of typographical and grammatical
      errors) and full of stupid turns of event. A few of them work, but in a better
      game the story here would be a weak point. "Actually, the first evil king you
      killed was a fake, go kill the real one." was probably the worst part, in that
      it still sticks in my mind a few days later.


      The gameplay is rather lacking, though I''m not sure whether the bigger cause
      of this is it letting you put eight characters in your party at once, or basic
      attacks with high-end weapons getting multiple hits, which makes basic attacks
      from those characters by far the most effective thing you can do for 90% of
      the game and also fairly time-wasting, especially once you start hitting 8 or
      12 times on a normal attack string with those characters. Both contributed to
      a gameplay that was either intensely boring grinding-down of permanently stunned
      foes with too many hit points, or waiting for a twelve-hit dagger combo animation
      to finish.


      As sidenotes: there''s a bunch of weird minigame plugins that only come up once,
      including a QTE-ish minigame, a fishing minigame, and a 2D fighting minigame.
      Only the fishing minigame is at all useful, and none of them occur more than
      once in the entire playthrough, since the game is linear and you never return
      to those locations. It''s interesting, but it felt more like a tech demo that
      was probably downloaded off the internet anyway.


      Also, the music is... something. On one hand, the dubstep boss battle music
      isn''t generic, and the random battle track is actually pretty okay and - I
      believe - composed just for this game. On the other, the dubstep boss battle
      music is bad and made the overly-long fights worse.


      Anyway, yeah. Solenars Edge Rebirth is free, at least, but there''s a lot better
      RPG Maker games out there even for free. Not recommended, as the story isn''t
      anywhere near good enough to make up for the tedious gameplay and terrible map
      design.


      (EDIT: I forgot to mention there''s an arena mode unlocked after beating the
      game. It''s pointless and you can 1-turn basically everything using the equipment
      and money you''ll carry over from the end of the game, especially once you give
      Aionis dual Solenars Edges. Of course, that also provokes the "turns take forever"
      thing excessively hard, as he swings something like 22 times per basic attack
      with that setup.)'
