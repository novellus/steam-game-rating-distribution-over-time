    about_the_game: <i> <strong>Note to players about DEMO:</strong> We have a very
      early demo build available to play (inspired by EGX PAX 2020) and things aren't
      fined tuned as they should be. You still need <strong>keyboard to exit and start
      your game</strong>, your game <strong>will not save</strong> and the <strong>menus
      do not have delay response for some people</strong> which will not be the case
      when the full game is released. You can consider this demo a <strong>'limited
      early access'</strong>. And lastly, the difficulty is set to <strong>hard 'cinematic'
      mode</strong>; You will die very easily within reason... But so does the enemies.
      This is for stress test purposes but do you think you can handle this? Would
      it be too much for players? Feel free to leave your thoughts! This will improve
      our game and make it a better experience for you. We want you to have a genuine
      good time and appreciate your time to help create this game! </i><br><br>Welcome
      to <strong>Night Light City</strong>, a dark, dystopian alien City, where four
      factions want the incredible powers of a Detective Hunter for their own ends.

      and destroy the sentient populous. You are feared, but maybe that can change
      as you discover the secrets of the <strong>sentient city</strong>.<br><br><img
