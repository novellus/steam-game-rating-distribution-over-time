      Prison, Kiera Vale finds herself drawn back into a web of occult sciences, mysterious

      Kiera is happy to receive the call, but soon after her arrival finds that things

      why didn''t they tell her the whole story? What is the true nature of the Blackwater

      cell? From the top secret labs in the depths of A.R.C.A.N.E.''s headquarters
      to the distant spires of alien worlds, Ms. Vale will seek answers, solve cryptic
      puzzles, banish evil otherdimensional creatures, and perhaps even make a new
      friend over a game of Piggy Princess along the way, in Nightmare Adventures:
      The Turning Thorn.'

    review: 'This game was good! I love science-fiction mixed with fantasy. Honestly,
      it has a little bit of all genres. What can I say other than cheers to the developers
      of this series? I love Kiera Vale''s adventure and I would want to know the
      rest of her story. For understanding of the plot, you need to play Nightmare
      Adventures: The Witch''s Prison first and then The Turning Thorn. This game
      comes right after the main events. So, without further ado, I will list the
      good list and then the bad list.


      PROS:

      - Intriguing plot with mystery and suspence;

      - Realistic backgrounds and outwordly worlds;

      - Journal entries;

      - Photographic clues;

      - Various puzzles with diversified difficulty modes.


      CONS:

      - No fast travelling map;

      - No Steam achievements;

      - No trading cards.


      Of course, I''m not here for the achievements or for cards. I am here for the
      story and this, by far, is the best story I''ve participated in since True Fear:
      Forsaken Souls Part 2. Congratulations!'
