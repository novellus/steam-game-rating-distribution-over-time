Free control would be great, adding a and d when moving should have been mandatory IMO.\n\nCookie cutter design, unintelligent AI...simple and boring, not worth the time or money.","timestamp_created":1581647730,"timestamp_updated":1582252019,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530697941780090332","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ407nksvACdv6L8gE="}
