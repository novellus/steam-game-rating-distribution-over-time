I wasn't able to make it run. At first I've got an error message that asked me to delete and reinstall the game. Tried that a lot of times and nothing changed. Then I tried installing on my boot drive (C:) not my usual game drive (D:) and got a positve response from the program, a \"Checking Steam Session... OK\". But that's all, game freezes at a \"Checking Active Purchase\" until the app closes itself.\n\nAlso no word from support.\n\nDRM is awfull already, but a weird unknown, untested and bogus DRM is ten times worse. Add to the bascket an unsupportive developper that has never answered questions on the forum and you get a complete nightmare.\n\nBottom line: avoid at all costs.\n---------------------------------------\n\n---- 2nd post ---------\nI've got a message from support, the server was down, so the DRM wasn't working at all.\nNow I've got the game running.\nStill really unconfortable with this kind of DRM.\n---------------------------------","timestamp_created":1566950480,"timestamp_updated":1567086985,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47698211669921875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48rfq7uwCec6c0QE="}
