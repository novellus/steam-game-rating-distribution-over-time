This campaign Blitzkrieg i'm just starting to invade the USSR, and albeit this DLC is very similar to Panzer General 3D, i cant blame the company for doing the same missions as they technically are the campaigns that were fought.\nWould i recommend this DLC, sure. Honestly its the first i bought and i've played it more than most games i buy. Fun, has different difficulty modes. I stick with easy mode as i don't like losing. ;) Just be aware that as in other comments on this DLC, it is a frequent;ly created campaign to have the poland and france invasions, but they did add the yugoslavia and norway invasions that we didn't see in panzer 3d general. I actually love the fact that you don't have to buy all the additions and can get a good glimpse and game with $15, but be aware that its going to cost you to get everything. Finally am i disappointed that the enemy has more troops than I as in other posts; not really. Its how the game operates. Plus im about to start russia; wasn't that frequently how it was? Either way id recommend. Especially if you want a cheap new game and generally lose interest within a month or two.","timestamp_created":1604677929,"timestamp_updated":1604677929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gsGQz/UCcP/ZrAI="}
