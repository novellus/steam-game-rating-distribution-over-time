      /><br><br>You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade
      other bytes around you and thus modify their values. <br><br>The game features
      various types of puzzles:<h2 class="bb_tag">Explore</h2><br>With ability to
      XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in
      the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without
      getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and
      ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a
      particular puzzle.<h2 class="bb_tag">Decipher programs</h2><br>Various programs
      run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The game includes a disassembler
      showing you the assembly language corresponding to the machine code that is
      being executed. Don''t worry if you don''t know any Assembly. There are only
      a handful of CPU instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete
      the puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see
      which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those locations
      to get the program to do what you want.<h2 class="bb_tag">Invade CPU registers</h2><br>The
      computer you are trying to escape has a simple CPU with a couple of registers.
      You can trick the CPU to load yourself into the registers and affect code execution
      or offload yourself into otherwise unreachable memory locations.<h2 class="bb_tag">Hack</h2><br>For
      some puzzles, it isn''t enough to change the data in RAM or registers. You can
      also change the machine code to get the computer to do different things.<br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Tips</h2><br>Carefully observe the bytes on the screen
      and what the CPU is doing. Sometimes you need to read the code in straightforward
      manner. Sometimes you need to work your way backwards: find the line of the
      code you want executed and then trace the code backwards to figure out how to
      trick the CPU to get to that instruction.<br><br>The game only has about 30
      puzzles, but some of those might take considerable effort to solve. So take
      it easy and don''t rush to the end. If you solve a puzzle by accident, don''t
      go forward until you understand why it happened. You might miss some small detail
      and get completely stuck on the next puzzle.<h2 class="bb_tag">TL;DR</h2><br>The
      game is about the way computers work internally. This isn''t a game about writing
      new programs, but hacking existing programs and their data to clear the path
      or teleport across memory until you find a way to escape the computer completely.
      <br><br>Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn''t
      required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the
      game. As long as you like doing basic math, you should be able to figure it
      out. That being said, it isn''t a game for general population. It''s meant for
      players who are interested in computer internals, assembly and machine languages
      and programming.'

    review: Though short, Rogue Bit was a lot of fun and very clever in its design.
      I appreciated how it diverts from the typical coding game where you solve puzzles
      by directly writing code - instead, Rogue Bit has you reverse engineering a
      simple 8-bit computer, manipulating memory in both data and code segments to
      hack past various "barriers". As someone who enjoys debugging machine code,
      reverse engineering, and writing cracks (for learning purposes, not for the
      public), I had a lot of fun with this.  It starts out simple, but I had to eventually
      jot a few notes down and do some math to progress (eg the calculator problem).
      It was a nice touch to illustrate the game as the ASCII representation of memory,
      it adds a lot of retro atmosphere to it while simultaneously providing a play
      field.  Really cool idea - kudos to the devs on this one!
