I will say that the model for the flying isen't.. Exactly up to par when compared to the rest of the game. It feels rather static which is probably to help you not get distracted from the flying infront of you. i couldn't find anyway to speed up and you have to unlock a skill to slow down. There's not exactly a full turtoial other then just the movement keys showing up when you start. The gameplay itself is fairly smooth, although if you hit anything it's basically game over as you lose so much energy. There is customization, although minimal.","timestamp_created":1562828401,"timestamp_updated":1562828401,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539748966693878174","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lp317+sCeJaNzgE="}
