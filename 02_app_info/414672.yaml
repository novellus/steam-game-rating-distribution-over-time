    short_description: Nameless will heal your heart ~Tei~ The scripts of the dummyhead
      audio drama were originally written by Crobidoll, and supervised by Cheritz.
      The drama shares the same characters from &quot;Nameless ~the one thing you
      must recall~&quot; but the traits of the characters and the world are drastically
      different.

    review: "Althought none of the Nameless will heal your heart DLC follow the same\
      \ storyline as the main game (beside Black & White Christmas being a direct\
      \ sequel), this one is an fairly enjoyable experience. I gotta hand it to Beomgi-nim\
      \ for doing such an ethusiastic playful performance, you really feel that having\
      \ fun with Tei.\nSo if you want experience what it is like going on a date with\
      \ Tei and see more of his amusing and teasing sides, you would be thoroughly\
      \ satisfied with all the crazy stupidly doting advance [spoiler] yanDERE [/spoiler]\
      \  things we love about him. \nSadly no implied naughtiness involved but  we\
      \ can all imagine ( \u0361\xB0 \u035C\u0296 \u0361\xB0)\nI very much recommend\
      \ this DLC to people who love Tei as a character or his voice XD"
