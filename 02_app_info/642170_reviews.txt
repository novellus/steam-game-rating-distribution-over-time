Modernized Duck Hunt. Very simple, and gets kinda terrifying when the game turns to a storm during the night and the only light you have is lightning while you head a gator crawling out of the swamp.\n\nPlayed with a Samsung Odyssey+. Control scheme is simple. You only stand in one place but you can turn 360 degrees. Again, like a modernized duck hunt game. Its only 400mb so you have to understand you arent wandering around in a map. There is just a single stage with a global survival high score, limited ammo. Probably not a $10 game, but definitely fun for under $4.","timestamp_created":1606500101,"timestamp_updated":1606500346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwib24hfYCdN7lswI="}
