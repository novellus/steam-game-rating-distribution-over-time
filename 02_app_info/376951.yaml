    about_the_game: "First designed in the 1990s, the Talent truly is the forefront\

      \ such sparks as the ever-successful Talent 2 in its legacy, the Austrian Federal\
      \ Railway can be proud of operating such a uniquely versatile EMU. Be prepared\
      \ to experience this modern passenger workhorse for yourself as the \xD6BB 4023,\
      \ from Partner Programme developer RSSLO, is now ready for service in this Pro\
      \ Series Add-On for Train Simulator.<br><br>\xD6BB ordered their Talent EMUs\
      \ from Bombardier in the early 2000s as a modern helper to their ageing \xD6\
      BB 4020 fleet. While a majority of the order was comprised of the four-car variant,\
      \ the \xD6BB 4024, a handful of three-car variants were also part of the bill.\
      \ The three-car Talents were classified as the \xD6BB 4023 and were designed\
      \ to serve more rural routes where passenger numbers were lower and platforms\
      \ were not suitable for their longer siblings.<br><br>After addressing comfort\
      \ issues raised by the passengers, the \xD6BB 4023 was a network-wide success.\
      \ Its powerful nature and generous capacity made them ideally suited for routes\
      \ such as the Semmeringbahn, being able to effortlessly crawl up and down the\
      \ winding rails in all conditions.<br><br>The \xD6BB 4023 provides a very smooth\
      \ journey thanks to its shared Jacob\u2019s bogies, both reducing drag and increasing\
