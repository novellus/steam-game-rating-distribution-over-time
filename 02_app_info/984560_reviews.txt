Holy shit man.\nI love this game so much???? The story is fun, I love all the characters, none of the gimmicks are too annoying and every time I come back to Heartbeat I just have an all around good time.\nI highly suggest Heartbeat if you're looking for an Earthbound-esque rpg.\nEasily a 10/10","timestamp_created":1610136592,"timestamp_updated":1610136592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6NPn8fYCfPrPwQI="}
