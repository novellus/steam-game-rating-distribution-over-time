This looks like an ambush, don't stop me now\" actually is impossible (in shocking accordance to what the game title is claiming). After at least 12 hours of repeated tries I now demand (Hell no! We wont go!) video proof that the level is actually not impossible. All the other levels were too easy.\n\n\nThe game is scrappy, but I'll admit that I did enjoy it a lot. The thumbs down however stays until I have redemption.","timestamp_created":1572431945,"timestamp_updated":1572432385,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vsKRju4CduGe1QE="}
