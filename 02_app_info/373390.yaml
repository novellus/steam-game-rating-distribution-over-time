    about_the_game: "Contradiction is a unique adventure / murder mystery game that\
      \ uses live-action video for the entirety of the game play.  All you have to\
      \ do is interview characters, spot their lies and catch them out!<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nContradiction is a brand new take on the concept of an interactive\
      \ movie and brings the genre to a whole new level of playability.  It plays\
      \ as smoothly as a 3D graphic game. You can wander freely around the game environment,\
      \ collecting evidence and witnessing constantly changing events. <br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nBut the game is all about interviewing the characters you meet, questioning\
      \ them about all the evidence you\u2019ve collected and things you\u2019ve seen,\
      \ then spotting contradictions in their answers.  Pair two contradictions together\
      \ and watch them try to worm out of it!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWorks best plugged\
      \ into a TV preferably with a bunch of people to help spot the lies - but can\
      \ be played alone on your laptop or PC just fine!"
