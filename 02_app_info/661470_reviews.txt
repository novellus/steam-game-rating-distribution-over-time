I was looking forward to buying this game, and while its not god awful its definitely disappointing.  The puzzles and environments in the first game were varied and compelling. Here they are extremely repetative. Its almost entirely consists of tile puzzles, some of which barely even qualify as puzzles. To make matters worse, it hardly relates at all to the original story. i thought that the second game concluded nicely and was curious to see where the devs would take things from there. well turns out it adds literally nothing except for the ending i guess (?) which was honestly confusing as hell. maybe im just dumb but I really did not understand any of it. the original two games are good but they were already free, so youre paying $10 for a less than one hour game that is mostly bad tile puzzles. \n\nOne other thing is that in gateway two theres this super obnoxious and grating high pitch noise in some parts of the game. Wtf? its remastered but evidently all they did was make it worse. these devs can do better","timestamp_created":1606345856,"timestamp_updated":1607626888,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtPKBp/YCe5CfsQI="}
