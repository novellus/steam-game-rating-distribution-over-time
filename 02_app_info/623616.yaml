      \ first plans for building this airport date back to 1973; ten years later it\
      \ opened as \u201CSouthwest Florida Regional Airport\u201D. In 1993 it got its\
      \ present name. At the same time the runway was expanded from 8,400 ft to 12,000\
      \ ft. Since then, the airport has been expanded several times. For example,\

      \ made sure to use non-repetitive textures. Baked night illumination and ambient\

    review: This add-on airport is pretty good and in my eyes gets a 8/10. The taxi-ways
      are extremely detailed and have the same layout and color as the real ones!
      But yes I would reccomend this add-on to anyone who's looking for a smallish,
      medium sized international airport with excellent detail!
