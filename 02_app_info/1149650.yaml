      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Overview</h2><br>Mission Pack 2 gives you the second 3
      Missions of the Siberian Dawn story, completing the first chapter of this tale.
      These missions bring a unique set of objectives to be completed that will push
      your strategic abilities beyond what has come before. With new cards, hostile
      units, and challenges for each Mission this pack takes Siberian Dawn and the
      Lore Engine to the next level.<h2 class="bb_tag">Requirements</h2><br>In addition
      to the Siberian Dawn base game Mission Pack 2 also requires Mission Pack 1 DLC
      in order to play its contents.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1149650/extras/Store_Banner_Rat.png?t=1576232461"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Mission 1-4 Rat Hunt</h2><br>More has been discovered about
      the activities of the Dawn cultists following the rescue of the captives. A
      rogue Overseer called a Null is helping the cultists and has built a rats nest
      somewhere in this area. You have to subdue any cultists you find to discover
      the location of this rats nest and capture the Null.<h2 class="bb_tag">Mission
      1-5 Dawn Born</h2><br>From the data found in the rats nest we believe the dark
      plans of the Dawn cult are near completion. The location of this final activity
      has been found and your mission is to quickly destroy the Dawn cultists. You
      have to stop whatever they are doing before it can be finished.<h2 class="bb_tag">Mission
      1-6 Lockdown</h2><br>IH-54 has been judged to be beyond saving from the corruption
      of the Dawn cultists and their dark plans.A complete lockdown has now been ordered
      but the innocents who are vital to the Union must be saved. Get the innocents
      to safety before securing your area and getting ready to seal IH-54 for its
      final fate.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1149650/extras/Store_Banner_Innocent.png?t=1576232461"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Your Challenge</h2><br>The fight against the Dawn in IH54
      comes to a conclusion with these missions and the fate of the Union and Siberian
      Dawn is now in your hands. Will this be the end of the world or the start of
      a new dawn?
