      notes: "This is visual novel in which players assume the role of a high-school\
        \ student investigating a series of mysterious deaths in Tokyo. Some scenes\
        \ depict still images of characters engaged in violent acts: characters threatening\
        \ people with knives, strangling other characters, and involved in torture.\
        \ Crime scenes are graphically depicted with extensive blood-splatter and\
        \ large amounts of text detail. Corpses are frequently depicted with bloodstains\
        \ and sometimes mangled fingers, dangling entrails, or exposed brains. The\
        \ game also contains sexual material, in still images and text; references\
        \ to sexual fetishes and masturbation. Still images also depict partially\
        \ exposed breasts and buttocks. The words \u201Cf**k,\u201D \u201Csh*t,\u201D\
        \ and \u201Ca*shole\u201D appear in dialogue."
