This game has loose ties to the war of the roses, GOT, and Arhturian chivarly tales. Overall while I found the story enjoyable I wished there were more oportunites to branch off from the main narritive. Perhaps romance was possible, but if so, I did not find it in this game. The story and ending were a bit forced. I decided towards the end that I would side with a certain faction, and despite my desire to join this faction, I was forced to fight against them and lose everything and have a bad ending. So there's that. However, if you can forgive the plot being a bit forced and there being a bit less choices that really matter than some COG games, it was overall a good tale with a strong romantic chivarlrous knight errant tone and style that I found very charming. So, in short, if you like choose your own adventure style adventures, are okay with your video game being text only, and want a bit of knightly questing, this is a good game for you.","timestamp_created":1590289226,"timestamp_updated":1590289226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505300343036651611","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkfunovICd/vxiQI="}
