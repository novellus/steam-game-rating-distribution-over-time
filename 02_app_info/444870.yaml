    review: 'The cars drive *terribly* and with uncontrollable cars, there''s uncontrollable
      combat.

      Also, there''s no variation to the gameplay... it''s arena battle only, no racing.

      Also, the weapon balance is poor.


      I gave 45 minuted to Combat Racers, and that was plenty. I don''t think there''s
      anything this game does well.'
