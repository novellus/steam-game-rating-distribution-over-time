    review: 'Music of the game "Squarism" (who would have thought that?! :D:). Consists
      of 4 songs in total, with 2 different songs, each in a "Radio Edit" (about 3
      minutes playtime) and an "Extended Edit" with a length of about 9 minutes.


      All songs are encoded in 320 kbit CBR MP3 format. ID3 is completely tagged and
      the songs even have a cover included. Thumbs up!


      Track 1 - Mirrors - is a simple, yet catchy synth tune, in an unobtrusive, ambient
      style. Track 2 - Sleep - features some instrument that I''d describe as "Tibetan
      singing bowls". Decent underlying percussion, will probably make a good songs
      to do some meditation to (hope I don''t falls asleep to it :D:).


      Is it worth the 99 cents? My opinion: definitely. Go to iTunes for instance,
      you''ll get a single song for the same price instead of 4... Recommended!'
