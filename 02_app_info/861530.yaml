      \ /><br><br>Welcome to Insula<br><br>That was the tagline\u2014humanities\u2019\
      \ new hope.  At least, until they all disappeared, working with a mysterious\
      \ organization known as H\u01CEid\xE0o (&quot;HighDow&quot; \u6D77\u76D7), you\
      \ are tasked with exploring Insula and discovering what really happened to all\
      \ the poor souls that had called this home.  To survive that, you will need\
      \ some serious tech and no small amount of credits.<br><br>You know of one way\
      \ to get that out here.  The Bounty Royale, a brutal, mechanized bounty-hunting\
      \ bloodsport that runs autonomously right here down on the surface of Genesis.\
      \  To get started, you'll need to recover and repair one of the light and agile\
      \ combat exo-suits that were used early on by the security forces on Insula.\
      \  If you survive, you can use your winnings to start amassing the tech you\
      \ will need to build your own anthrobot, a fully mechanized combat-ready battle\
      \ chassis that you control from afar via neural link.<br><br>One way or another,\
      \ your only hope of making it home, relies on solving the mystery of a now-dead\
      \ Insula.  All paths to that end, begin in the arena.<br><br><br><strong>Battle\
      \ Royale Reimagined</strong><br>In Insula: Bounty Royale, you play as an Anthrotech,\
      \ ex-military combat engineers specially trained in building and maintaining\
      \ the Drakonis Anthro combat machines known as Anthrobots.  Recently awoken\
      \ from stasis and apparently stranded on what used to be a thriving mining colony\
      \ in the atmosphere above Genesis, you must survive long enough to find out\
      \ what happened and find a way home.<br><br>Insula: Bounty Royale, is the first-ever\
      \ arena shooter built atop some of the more popular battle royale mechanics,\
      \ to fully intertwine a compelling and adrenaline-filled story with the competitive\
      \ PvP arena gameplay. Your base is where the story plays out, segments of solo\
      \ gameplay will occur to advance your story. Events in the multiplayer arena\
      \ will feed directly into that story and your character\u2019s progression through\
      \ it. While the solo story aspects are optional, there is much to be gained\
      \ by participating in that aspect of the game.<br><br><br><strong>The Arena</strong><br>In\
      \ the arena Insula further distinguishes itself.  You can compete in person,\
      \ donning a fully combat ready exosuit, or from afar using one of the neural\
      \ link controlled Anthrobots.  The arenas are highly vertical and utilizing\
      \ fast paced acrobatic flight capabilities, your tactical options are virtually\
      \ limitless as literally every inch of play space is traversable and usable\
      \ to your advantage.  <br><br><br><strong>Bounty Royale</strong><br>The Bounty\
      \ Royale is a unique twist on the battle royale game mode. When a new match\
      \ starts, each contestant has a bounty on their head. Outfitting yourself with\
      \ advanced technology, you must track and hunt down your opponents and eliminate\
      \ them to collect their bounties. With each opponent you eliminate, your own\
      \ bounty will increase, making you a more desirable target for everyone else.\
      \ The other hunters are not your only concern, however, nor are they your only\
      \ source of earning. There be beasties about in this place, and they be hungry!\
      \ Lucrum pays a hefty bounty for the extermination of these dangerous creatures\
      \ as well! <br><br>Be warned though, the commotion caused by the competition\
      \ often draws attention from larger hordes of creatures nearby. It is not unheard\
      \ of for the contestants to temporarily work together to survive long enough\

      \ And Abilities</strong><br>Once you've built your dream battle rig, finish\
      \ it off by adding the perfect companion drone. They\u2019ll provide data recording,\
      \ scan analysis, and resource extraction. They also offer specific skills to\
      \ use during combat. Armor repair, energy shields, advanced tracking, recon,\

      notes: Insula is an arena based shooter and revolves around combat with other
        players using both guns and melee weapons.  While much of the violence is
        against robotic entities, players can also choose to play as exosuit armored
        humans and there are alien lifeforms/creatures the player can encounter and
        fight as well, both human players and alien creatures show some form of blood
        / blood spatter when damaged.
