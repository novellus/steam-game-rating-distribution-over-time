    review: "\nOn the surface: A thrilling mystery with an intriguing philisophic\
      \ twist.\n\nBy putting the burden of insight on the viewer, this movie is either\
      \ a highly indepth and entertaining film or a total bore for the uncritical\
      \ thinker.  \n\nA man who became mathematically oriented finds a pattern between\
      \ the operations of life and nature. These subtle patterns of existence, which\
      \ are missed by extremists perspective, hold economic & religious value amongst\
      \ all sides.  By percevering Crippled by pressure headaches, stressed from those\
      \ chasing the information he has, and ultimately confused in a near existential\
      \ dilemma, the ultimate question is suggested and the resolution is found. \n\
      \nThe famous director's style leaves it up to the viewer to figure the philisophic\
      \ complexities between materialistic wallstreet and the non materialistic cabalists\
      \ and implications thereof.  \n\nAronofsky (director) is famous for bringing\
      \ us Requiem for a Dream, Sector 7 for Nickelodeon, and Batman: One Year.  This\
      \ was his first attempt at showing a highly unique style which earned him a\
      \ Best Director's award at the Sundance Film Festival in 1998.\nTruly a classic."
