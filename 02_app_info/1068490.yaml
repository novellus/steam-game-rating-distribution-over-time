    short_description: A classically styled Corgi 2D platform adventure game with
      an indie zest with an intriguing storyline. not a puzzle platformer, more a
      puzzling story platformer or corginoir (but cheerier!). Level by level you get
      closer to the truth that you perceive.

    review: 'Peanut had me excited with it''s premise and cute graphics. Unfortunately,
      the game itself is not very good.


      It''s just a sub-par Mario clone, and I don''t hate games on the virtue of them
      being Mario clones because some can actually be quite fun (Marisaland Legacy
      for example!) but Peanut feels more like the Mario ripoffs you find on the app
      store that play serviceable, but also not quite right. The level design leaves
      a lot to be desired, and many of the stage gimmicks, such as the movable boulders,
      just don''t really work and feel glitchy.


      The game itself just doesn''t feel finished, either. Peanut boasts about it''s
      story, but good luck experiencing it, because the text boxes don''t work. Unfortunately,
      I do not think it will get much better, as the devs seem to think that making
      a retro-style game means they can get away with their games being "less polished".
      (Seriously, one of their news posts says this!)


      I think that the game could be decent with some polish, but right now it just
      feels like a cheap, cynical Mario clone looking for a few dollars. I urge Team
      Spikkeee to do better.'
