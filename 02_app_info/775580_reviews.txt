I never felt like a boss was impossible once I got comfortable with the controls, but I also never felt like it was too easy or repetitive. The story is good, the visuals are good, but where this game really shines is it's gameplay.\n\n[b]The music and sound effects are what threw me off the most though.[/b] Whenever you'd die to a boss, it almost felt like the music didn't realize you were dead yet and kept going, and then would come to an abrupt stop when you came back to life. Sound effects also sounded very glitchy sometimes, especially when bosses started spinning and hit a wall, stuff like that made a grinding noise that didn't go away for a while. \n\nOverall, of course I recommend this. It's not a perfect game, but it doesn't have to be one. I waited somewhere around a year for this game's release and I was not disappointed. That's all I needed.","timestamp_created":1609323557,"timestamp_updated":1609899472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyI7f6vYCf4LevgI="}
