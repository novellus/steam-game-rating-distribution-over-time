    about_the_game: "The 2S14 Zhalo-S is an experimental light, highly mobile, Soviet\
      \ self-propelled gun from the 1980s. It is armed with an 85mm cannon on a BTR-70\
      \ wheeled chassis. Despite its unusually low caliber, the gun was very capable\
      \ of defeating older vehicles, but it lacked the penetration of 125mm guns,\
      \ a fact that ultimately doomed the project. The surviving prototype is currently\
      \ located in the Kubinka Tank Museum.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Armored Warfare,\
      \ it\u2019s one of the deadliest Tier 4 vehicles when driven by an experienced\
      \ commander. Its gun has a rather low caliber for its Tier, but it more than\
      \ makes up for it with its rate of fire and penetration power. The Zhalo-S can\
      \ stay hidden for extended periods of time thanks to its excellent camouflage\
      \ factor and, with a bit of luck, is capable of taking out entire squads of\
      \ enemies on its own."

    review: "After sinking more than 800 hours and a huge amount of money into Armored\
      \ Warfare (buying premium tanks for both myself and others)  I was permanently\
      \ banned from the forums politely pointing out that the Community Manager made\
      \ some mistakes in his very sloppy article about the Korean K2 tank.\n\n\"Silent\
      \ Stalker\" the Steam Community Manager wrote a very bad article about the Korean\
      \ K2 tank which contained clear factual errors (such as his claim that the license-built\
      \ Rheinmetall gun was NOT a licensed design but was actually designed in Korea.)\n\
      \nhttps://aw.my.games/en/news/general/black-panther\n\nWhen I politely pointed\
      \ out that this was incorrect since the gun was actually licensed from Rheinmetall\
      \ in Germany, he doubled down on his mistake by adding that the American M68\
      \ cannon used on the M-60 was an indigenous American development rather than\
      \ a modification of a Royal Ordinance L7. \n\nAfter I politely pointed out this\
      \ mistake making sure to praise his other articles, he became very hostile and\
      \ started rudely locking all the threads I posted in. He also deleted all the\
      \ comments on his bad article about the K2 though I saved a screenshot of myself\
      \ correcting him before he did so.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2126034055\n\
      \nAfter I made a post pointing out that it is kind of rude to just post \"no\"\
      \ and then lock the thread when a customer suggests something (I had suggested\
      \ adding the T-34-85 to the game) he perma-banned me for \"spamming.\"\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2125956158\n\
      \nA live-service is only as good as the people working for the company. You\
      \ have been warned.\n\nUpdate 6/12/2020\n\nThe ban was removed... from Steam\
      \ by someone working for Valve... but I am now banned from the AW Discord after\
      \ I made the mistake of asking the mod \"Soren\" for help with the Steam ban.\
      \ Soren is not even pretending to be decent as you can see. He even brazenly\
      \ put \"Thanks for the feedback\" as the reason for the ban.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2127547497\n\
      \nSo yeah, Steam is good but at least part of My.games is staffed by proud morons\
      \ who treat their paying customers like dirt... sad to see a potentially good\
      \ game in such hands.\n\nOld Review:\n\nThe Zhalo S is an 8-wheeled tank destroyer.\
      \ It's basically a turret with a quick-firing 85mm gun mounted on a BTR-70 APC\
      \ chassis. I like it though I don't particularly care for the paint job on this\
      \ version.\n\nIf you use the Zhalo, you should hide behind MBTs on your team,\
      \ advance cautiously, and provide fire support. You have a gun that can DPS\
      \ very rapidly but you won't get many 1-hit kills and you won't survive many\
      \ hits so be ready to shoot, back up, shoot, back up... rinse and repeat."
