I really liked the fresh take on the classic characters, but how could you not when one is a werewolf and another is a robot t-rex!? \n\nThe story was entertaining, has some good twists and does a very good job of capturing the essence of cliques in school. I would definitely do another couple playthroughs to check out the other love interests that I found entertaining.","timestamp_created":1529546900,"timestamp_updated":1529546900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJworCGkOQCe6jOowE="}
