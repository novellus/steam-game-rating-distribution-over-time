I've played a large number of adult RPGmaker games, and this one's at the top of the list, matched only by the other game by the same dev, The Last Sovereign. In both cases, what stands out is the writing; the sex never feels shoehorned in or forced, and the characters all feel real. Absolutely worth getting, even at full price. \n\nI could go on about this game, too, but other reviews have done that. In short, the systems work well, there's minimal grind required (though you can do more to get cool powers) and lots of nice lewd moments. The primary protagonist being a sex worker is a good excuse for fun to happen in many places you go, and the money you make from it is meaningful. Relationships develop, characters grow a LOT as people, and the world undergoes massive and dramatic changes.  Even without the lewd, it would be a good play~\n\nDefinitely recommend!","timestamp_created":1608782467,"timestamp_updated":1608782467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+4m6yfYCeajVvAI="}
