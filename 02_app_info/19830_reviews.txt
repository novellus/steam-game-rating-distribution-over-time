If you are a gamer who likes to choose your weapons before every single player mission, then this is the sniper game for you.\n\nRainbow Six: Raven Shield's load out for you and your team. Raven Shield may not have the best graphics nor does it have the best realism, but what it does have is the best load out. The player gets to customise their avatar, pick their primary and second weapons and pick accessories for them. In addition, the player can choose different grenades and other items. What makes the game real awesome though is that the player gets to choose the outfits and pick the weapons for the rest of the team. And some of the missions requires three teams of A.I to help you (so much fun). What makes the game most impressive to a sniper is that the player can pick a sniper rifle for each team. Better still, you can even have a sniper rifle for every member of all the teams (that is if you want to have a crazy sniper time). Probably the best single player campaign load out I have experience yet. \n\nRaven Shield's sniper rifles and accessories. There are a total of nine sniper rifles in the game. The best one for close quarters is the VSS Vintorez. In reality the Russian Spetsnaz use it to take down terrorists. For medium range you might want the SVD Dragunov. But for long range try using the SSG 3000. The accessories for the sniper rifles ranges from suppressors, to infa red attachments, etc. One bonus is that some of the sniper rifles come with a bipod, which works when the player's avatar is prone. The biggest downfall of the sniper rifle is that all the cross hairs in the game are the same! Other than that, the sniper rifles are very good.  \n\nRaven Shield's single player campaign for the sniper. In the single player campaign, after every briefing and team load out. The player will start by taking out bad guys with their A.I team in different locations around the world. I normally go sniper for my team and have a back up sniper in the other teams. In one mission, terrorists have taken over an airport. The player and their team will have to go and rescue the hostages and neutralize the bad guys. In another mission, it is snowing in a mountain town where terrorists have taken over. The player in their winter gear, with their team have to retake the town. There is a period where you can sniper the bad guys from the top of a hill. Overall, the whole campaign is great, the story line is good and the sniping is even better.","timestamp_created":1610073497,"timestamp_updated":1610073831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45Z747/YCf/u3wQI="}
