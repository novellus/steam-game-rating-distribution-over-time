    reviews: "\u201CNight and Day attracted my eyes with great character design and\
      \ what seems to be a more interactive visual novel than most. The backgrounds\
      \ are quite nice and soothing to see as, despite never being to Paris, they\
      \ make the city seem lovely. Speaking as NookGaming\u2019s resident admirer\
      \ of little details, I love the little nods to famous people who appear in Night\
      \ and Day.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.nookgaming.com/night-and-day-kickstarter-demo-review/\"\
