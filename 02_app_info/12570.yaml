    review: This is a fun and challenging game. Some recipes are very difficult to
      get full stars tho, it kind of frustrate me a bit, I had to retry so many times
      to find a very specific way to move or click my mouse. The way this game is
      play kind of unique compare to other time-management game, that's why I remember
      it after so many years. I play a lot of time-management game so it is kind of
      nice to see something different. This is not a perfect game but a game I not
      regret purchased.
