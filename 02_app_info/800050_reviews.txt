The relationships and friends you pick up along the way seem to matter a lot, and I found myself quite invested in all the side characters lives. Seems like there are many romanceable characters and all of them felt pretty interesting\n\nYour choices seem to matter a fair bit and can result in a variety of different paths and courses for you to take (these can be followed through to the next game, though see my review on it for some issues I felt)\n\nOne thing I did quite enjoy was there's an aspect of old gamebooks in this one, with stat based fighting and a bit of random variance. Nice to see that in a game, I used to love Fighting Fantasy and the like as a kid\n\nTowards the end of the game, it practically opens up into open world style travels and adventures, which was very surprising and ambitious for these type of games, was very interesting and I think it pulled it off quite well\n\nAll in all, I found the story and characters very interesting and fun, and I'd really recommend this game","timestamp_created":1557874798,"timestamp_updated":1557874798,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw292k3OoCeNGawQE="}
