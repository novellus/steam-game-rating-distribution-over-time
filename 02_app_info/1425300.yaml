    short_description: In Factorization, you must plan and build a factory capable
      of producing ever more complex resources. You focus on designing optimal production
      lines while carefully balancing your budget. In the meantime your workers build
      your designs and carry out the day-to-day tasks in your factory.

    review: "I love the concept but it's not implemented smoothly enough for a good\
      \ gameplay experience yet. \n\nThe UI is tiny (hard to see stuff) and doesn't\
      \ contain a lot of info. \n\nNo shortcuts for anything, you have to hit tab\
      \ and find anything you need every time you need it\n\nCan't press and drag\
      \ to set multiple pieces. So if you want to put down 10 conveyor belts you have\
      \ to click 10 times. \n\nEven with what I felt like was way too many workers,\
      \ building anything takes a very long time.\n\nThere is no speed up time functionality.\
      \ just pause and normal speed. \n\nOverflow is wasted instead of backlogged.\
      \ This could be a misunderstanding or user error, but so far if I understand\
      \ correctly, if your ratios aren't exactly perfect you will literally destroy\
      \ any excess material. Not fun. (if you have 5 iron running to a machine in\
      \ the time it takes the machine to use 2 iron, the extra 3 iron will be destroyed)\n\
      \ncan't zoom in or out\n\nOverall nothing feels cohesive or fun. It feels like\
      \ a struggle against a janky UI and barely functional descriptions. It took\
      \ me about 15minutes with my hands in the air to figure out how to...do literally\
      \ anything at all.\n\nI want to love this game, but it's just way too hard to\
      \ DO anything. This game needs a massive interface overhaul with a ton of customizible\
      \ options, hotkeys, zoom etc. Many features considered basic to this genre of\
      \ game simply aren't present."
