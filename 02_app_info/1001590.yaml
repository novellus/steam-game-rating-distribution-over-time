    review: "It's a fine game that cost me a grand sum of 75 cents on sale. In my\
      \ opinion Grab Lab is well worth 75 cents and the 361 megabytes of space it\
      \ consumed on my hard drive.\nAnd it's fun to say Grab Lab.\nTry it with your\
      \ friends.\n\nThe core gameplay involves you pressing a single button which\
      \ activates the grapple of your ever-walking hero.\nThe goal is to use the grapple\
      \ to move your hero onto surfaces, around which he or she always walks in a\
      \ clockwise direction. Use the grapple to avoid obstacles and traps, and navigate\
      \ each level in order to pick up strange chemical concoctions.\nIn some levels\
      \ there is a special bolt, which really looks like a nut, which you can collect.\
      \ Enough of these allow you to progress to the next set of levels, and eventually\
      \ unlock an achievement. \nCollecting the chemical potions will allow you to\
      \ also perform some weird science to change the looks of your hero. If you fail\
      \ on a level you can alternatively use 10 of those potions to continue without\
      \ losing your progress, however I think you're best to save them for weird science.\n\
      \nThe puzzles are simple. Few are very challenging although many of them require\
      \ good timing on your single button press. A few require diabolical timing.\
      \ This is really the only challenge of the game, however the whole experience\
      \ is relaxing. \n\nI recommend playing Grab Lab. And I recommend saying Grab\
      \ Lab repeatedly. Just say it. Grab Lab. It sounds good.\nGrab Lab."
