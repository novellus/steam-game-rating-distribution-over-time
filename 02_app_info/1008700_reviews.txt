The concept here is great, I enjoyed playing for a bit, but set down the game with the intention of waiting for more updates. I haven't checked on the game between release and now, and am currently disappointed to find that it hasn't been updated once in the ~six months since release. For this reason I don't recommend the game. I should mention that the environments are great and that the gameplay is decent, if you want to play pool at golf scale in VR (oddly specific request), this is your only option.\n\nEdit: Good to hear that the game is still being worked on! Stuff takes time, and that's OK, there's nothing to apologize for. I'll definitely check back post-update(s) and update my review as I see fit.","timestamp_created":1609162007,"timestamp_updated":1610078761,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609428515,"developer_response":"Sorry, there will be one extra map and the small arcade level within the next 3 months, I don't ask to accept my apology, I just wanted to let you guys know.
