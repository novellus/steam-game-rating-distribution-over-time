    review: "Great runner game, probably my favorite one outside of the bit.trip series.\
      \  \n\nControls are simple, you have one button to jump and that is it, there\
      \ is no verying heights, no slide, no other moves but jump, the only variance\
      \ is that you can hold the jump button to keep jumping as soon as you land.\n\
      \nThe game is divided into 18 levels, the first few are really easy and than\
      \ the game gets insanely hard a little more than halfway through and continuosly\
      \ ramps up the difficulty on each level.  There are a ton of different obstacles\
      \ and as the game progresses the loadout of the obstacles gets progressively\
      \ crazier and crazier. \n\nThere is a progress meter on the bottom of the screen\
      \ that shows how close you are to beating the level and respawns are lightning\
      \ fast, these 2 things give this game that addicting, \"just one more time\"\
      \ feel that is necessary for games like this.  I died a ton on the later levels\
      \ but finally completing a really tricky series of jumps  after dying 40 times\
      \ on it is immensely satisfying.  \n\nThe game took me about 2 hours to complete.\
      \  Each level also has 3 stars that you can try and collect as you play through\
      \ as well as 2 unlockable extra difficulty levels for each level, I am nowhere\
      \ near good enough to even think of attempting them but if you are into it I\
      \ would imagine that trying to unlock and playthrough these extra modes would\
      \ add a good amount of time to your playthrough,\n\nPurchasing this game is\
      \ a no-brainer, it is 3 dollars, has precise controls(including controller support),\
      \ and offers a really addicting and challenging experience."
