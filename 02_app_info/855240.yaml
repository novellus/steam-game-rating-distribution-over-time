      \ you will find complex codes, grand adventures and a new outlook on your world.\
      \ TheTruth.exe works to blend reality with the unreality, enticing its players\
      \ with not only the impossible, but with the inability to gauge what is and\
      \ isn't real. There is only one way to win. There can only be one winning team.\
      \ It's a marathon and a race. Will you be able to discover what's at the end\
      \ of this Alternate Reality Game? Or will someone else beat you to the end?<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce you purchase and download TheTruth.exe, everything becomes\
      \ a clue to solving the next puzzle. After getting past the first test, you\
      \ will be randomly grouped up with 9 other individuals of whom have passed their\
      \ test as well. This will be your team. You and your team will then work to\
      \ figure out how to beat the game, how to reach the end and work to solve all\
      \ of the puzzles in TheTruth.exe."
