    about_the_game: Once upon a time, the kingdom was a land of peace, harmony, and
      an all-consuming passion for the greatest sport - GOLF. Everyone in the land
      played day and night, and soon the kingdom itself was turned into the most beautiful
      course the world had ever seen. The land was happy. The land was good. <br><br>Until
      the monsters came...<br><br>In its obsession with golf, the people had become
      complacent, leaving the kingdom open to attack. Hole by hole, dungeon by dungeon,
      the monsters emerged and drove the people off the course. And a great sadness
      fell across the world.<br><br>Then one day, a brave girl appeared, determined
      to play the finest course in the world. Armed only with her golf club, she would
      set forth to play the nine legendary holes. But first, she would need to rid
      the land of the monsters...<br><br>RPGolf is an exciting blend of classic JRPG
      with 8-bit golf. Relive the nostalgia of the classic gaming age, but in an exciting
      new mash-up that combines the best of both worlds.<br><br><strong>Key features
      include:</strong><br>* Retro gaming graphics to transport you back to the 80s.<br>*
      Simple, intuitive controls enable you to battle, golf, and explore the world.<br>*
      9 holes of golf, ready to be discovered across the world map.<br>* Dungeons
      filled with treasure and danger!<br>* Deadly boss fights.<br><br>RPGolf seamlessly
      blends golf and RPG into one addicitve game. Battling monsters will level you
      up, allowing you to hit the ball further. Discovering new clubs and gloves scattered
      around the world will improve your golf game, and also give you the edge in
      combat. By blending 2 game styles together, RPGolf creates a brand-new take
      on both, unlike anything seen before.
