Everything in order.\nThe plot of the plot is that you acquired an island, knowingly knowing about the riches and treasures located there, but upon your arrival, a demonic incursion happened to your own island and now you, left penniless in your pocket, set off to destroy the heresy, demons and xenos that were waiting for you in the bowels of the island.\nThe game has two endings and their receipt depends on how much effort you spent on clearing the island, according to the classics, one of the endings is positive, and the other is deplorable. Only a blessed martyr will be rewarded with the opportunity to see a happy future. The ending depends on the level of difficulty of your passage, respectively, easy is bad, and more intense is a good ending, respectively.\nAs your adventure progresses, you go through eight unique locations, not counting the tutorial and the final location of the heldrazers.\nEach location has a unique original music and level design that immerses you in the world of the game. The structure of the locations, both geometrically-geographically and visually, give a sense of real presence and uniqueness to these locations.\nWith each new district design, unique opponents and traps only increase in quality, consistent with the design of the level and add more surroundings to the locations.\nAs an example, I will take my favorite and at the same time the most difficult location for me, the fortress, saturated with bats and rotating spiked spheres, creating the atmosphere of an abandoned castle supported by an original unique sauna track.\nEach district is divided into 6 levels, the first of which five are exploration and platforming. And the sixth level is always a battle with unique bosses with unique combat mechanics.\nFor example, the boss of the third forest location will spawn four opponents at a time from more difficult locations that will be further.\nWith the exception of the last location, which contains 2 levels, one of which is research and the second is a boss battle, these are the most interesting and difficult locations to pass.\nAt the beginning of the game, you are given three heroes to choose from, and you make this choice once:\nKnight\nMagician\nAssassin\nEach hero is equipped with melee, ranged, and superpowers.\nEach hero has 2 specializations at the start, which can be changed on the go via the escape button. The third specialization opens upon passing the game for all classes and is the best combat unit with unique anomalies, but this does not mean that you will forget about other specializations, I will analyze it using the example of a knight for whom I passed the game.\nThe first specialization is the melee fighter with the highest damage per hit, the ranged is a gun built into the sword, shoots 5 projectiles that fly vertically like a fan, and a super strike is a slap with a sword in a jump that deals 5 times damage.\nEach specialization is spelled out and described when choosing.\nGameplay locations consist of enemy traps and interactive objects:\nEnemies are mainly divided into two types of shooters and brawlers, but there are powerful opponents mini bosses, with a barrage of melee attacks.\nIn the game, an attack can be made only while standing on the surface, the protagonist has double jumps, but their height depends on the hero and specialization, as well as the speed of movement.\nTraps in the game do damage and are also definitely of two types, hidden and visible. Hidden traps like stakes pop out of the ground and deal damage, while visible traps like circular saws immobilize movement. As you progress through the game, the arsenal of traps increases and is also associated with the design of locations.\nInteractive objects are things that directly help you pass the location, you can easily notice them, their design is unchanged for ease of understanding. These are boxes lifts to jump higher or defuse traps. There is also a chest, they will help you replenish ammunition and the number of super attacks, but they need a key, so exploring locations is encouraged.\nCoins are scattered on the level, one of the main gameplay parts, different coins or jewels add points to you at the end of the passage, which means how well and carefully you passed the location. The game also has a so-called sulse-like element, backtracking, and truly interesting and exciting bosses that do not fall from one poke.\nIn general, Hellraizers is an exciting adventure in the world of fantasy from scratch, created by the author6 original musical accompaniment, design of locations, enemies and characters. Hellraizers does not make a martyr of you forcing a thousand times to pass, the same moment, it is pleasant to play in Hellraizers, interesting locations and their varied exploration is deeply encouraged. I advise you to play Hellraisers because of the above, the game is sincere and kind.","timestamp_created":1596292858,"timestamp_updated":1596292858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiYCe1fMCddHmmAI="}
