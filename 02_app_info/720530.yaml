    review: "I will update if this ever gets fixed, but DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE TIME\
      \ BEING.\nsomeone, somewhere bungled things up to where the soundtrack doesn't\
      \ download with the game. \nsoooo this \"dlc\" is basically throwing money at\
      \ nothing. i mentioned this in the discord and it's being looked into.\nsuch\
      \ a shame too, as it's a lot for your money. not just the games soundtrack,\
      \ but the official soundtracks of the first two games. \ni will update this\
      \ if it's ever fixed. for now though, STAY AWAY!"
