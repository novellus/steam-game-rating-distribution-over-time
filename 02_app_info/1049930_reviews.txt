Unfortunately, my experience playing Frank and the 10 roots is not positive at all. Although the game world looks nice and it has got a funky retro soundtrack, the problem is that your character, Frank, controls really poorly. You primarily have to move diagonally in this game, but in order to walk in for instance north-east direction you have to press the right and up arrow keys simultaneously (same goes for the other 3 cardinal directions). Controller support is limited as the stick on my XBOX controller is not recognized at all, so I have to use the D-pad, which is just as awkward and error-prone as using the arrow keys on my keyboard.\nAfter about 15 minutes I gave up after falling to my death for the 20th time only because of how difficult it is to steer Frank with any precision.\n\nI think this game certainly has potential to be enjoyable, but fix the steering first please!   :(","timestamp_created":1571778058,"timestamp_updated":1571778058,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8brR+u0CeZDI1AE="}
