    review: 'One of those game you with there was a neutral recommendation for...
      it''s a neat idea and not badly implemented. However, it has the look and feel
      of a game I should have played 10 years ago. Interfaces are butt ugly and obscurely
      laid out and as for the ship designer; it''s shockingly bad... All that said,
      combat is very intuitive, star map feels balanced and general mechanics seem
      sound.


      With some input from a UX/UI developer and a graphic artist this could have
      been a truly great game.


      Recommended but wait till it''s on sale.'
