Under his disoriented state, he meets a young girl by the name of Yukari, a close friend of his who tries her best to ease his troubles.

Kazu tries his best to remember anything about his mother, but nothing comes.<br><br>After Yukari leaves, Kazu gets up from his bed and drags himself down the hall to the other hospital room where she lays. The mother's crippled form, the unbreathable atmosphere, and the gentle sound of rain. Slowly, it dawned on him:<br><br>&quot;My mother's about to die. The mother I don't even recognize.&quot;<br><br>Shortly after leaving the hospital, he meets another old friend, Shiori, who also begins to help dispel the bleak and uneasy tension in the air.

Kazu thinks that it would be a good opportunity to get a hobby. He is presented with some choices about whether he should pursue painting, music, or whichever.
