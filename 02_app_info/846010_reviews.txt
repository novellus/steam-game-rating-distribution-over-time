Takes about 30 minutes to complete. By the time you complete the game, you may get all the achievements.\nThe stealth part of the game is very weak, it is more feasible to grab enemies attention and then outrun them.\nI highly recommend this game for achievement hunters. It is worth the $0.49 price.","timestamp_created":1575089937,"timestamp_updated":1575089937,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pqOr3e4CffPr3wE="}
