    review: 'A fun point & click adventure game overall, with an amusing retro style
      and some genuinely funny moments.  However, this one is held back by a couple
      of minor issues.  First, a solid handful of the puzzle solutions come off as
      either random, illogical, or somehow misleading.  You can usually get past this
      via the traditional point & click method of trying everything on everything
      else, but on two separate ocasions I genuinely found myself ground to a halt
      and needed a hint.  The game has no built-in hint system, so this quite literally
      takes you out of the game.  Second, though the translation is entirely coherent,
      it''s very often clear that the script was never edited by someone whose first
      language is English.  On the other hand, the game offers other language options,
      at least one of which is presumably fine on this point.  (I have a hunch the
      game would be best played in German.)


      Overall a positive experience if you''re in the mood for an indie point & click
      experience.'
