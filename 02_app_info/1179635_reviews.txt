But many of these outfits seem to be very lazy, like with this set so many are very similar and not unique to the characters. This has purple stripe so I guess that means Ayane, and Leifang has a orange stripe I think...really??  It was same as Halloween this year was very cheap and lazy, just all witches. And Ayane and Christie practically was same thing, pfft! Lets see some more cool ones next time and not just every character is same thing and not just revivals which you make me buy again!!","timestamp_created":1575733657,"timestamp_updated":1575733657,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42u/C8O4CcfrZ4gE="}
