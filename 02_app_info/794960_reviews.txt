There are 60 levels in total with most of them containing two puzzles. One puzzle allows you to proceed to the next level and the second is optional. You can come back to the optional puzzles after you beat the game. New game mechanics are introduced around the 20th and 40th levels. The combination of mechanics can sometimes make things quite tricky, but at the same time you get better at solving everything with practice.","timestamp_created":1609912981,"timestamp_updated":1609912981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44NKS6/YCdOD1wAI="}
