    about_the_game: 'Nanobots is a fast-paced casual game about destroying self-replicating
      nanotechnology robots. <br><br>You have to reduce the standing population to
      zero in order to advance to the next level, as even one overlooked Nanobot can
      replicate itself and bring you back to square one in a matter of seconds.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Lore</h2><br>The world was devastated by a dreadful war against
      intelligent machines. You are a survivor, and your greatest skill is to hack
      into machine cores and destroy them. But something unexpected happens. A sentient
      software named ADNA trespasses your local security, only to ask for your help.<br><br>Your
      mission is to exploit a newly discovered vulnerability. Machines use Nanobots
      (nanotechnology self-replicating robots) to repair themselves and keep their
      temperature low. By destroying them, a chain reaction causes entire systems
      to halt, even before they can identify the cause of the failure. It is your
      greatest chance to end the war.<br><br>Are you up to this task? Can you move
      fast enough without sacrificing precision and strategic decisions? If so, the
      world needs you!<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2><br>Your main ability is a small
      Magnetic Pulse that instantly destroys closeby Nanobots. Move the cursor as
      fast and precise as you can to obliterate all on its path.<br><br>Secondary
      abilities are: <br><br>- Static Charge (right click): Disrupts a small area
      with a permanent electric field that prevents Nanobots from replicating. <br>-
      Electric Surge (alphanumeric 1): Increases the area of effect of Magnetic Pulse
      (your main ability) for a few seconds. <br>- Malware (alphanumeric 2): Injects
      a malicious code that causes every newly replicated Nanobot to be destroyed
      after a few cycles.<br>- Discharge (alphanumeric 3): Drains the energy from
      nearby power plants, causing all cycles to be delayed.<br>- Prismatic Beam (alphanumeric
      4): Places a vertical and horizontal high-energy stream that divides the area
      temporarily.<br><br>There are <strong>60 levels</strong> available!<h2 class="bb_tag">Controls</h2><br>-
      Move the camera: WASD, Arrow Keys or middle click and drag <br>- Zoom in/out:
      Mouse Wheel or Q/Z <br>- Abilities: Mouse left and right, and alphanumeric keys
      <br><br>All keys can be remapped.<br><br>Music by: Mark Sparling - <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.marksparling.com"

    review: 'Updated over a year and a half later:


      The gameplay is *edit* still not fun and consists primarily of holding the left
      mouse button down and jerking the mouse around, preferably in slightly strategical
      ways, though just moving the mouse quickly enough can overpower the need for
      thinking.


      It was priced 0.89 euros. I''m going to ask for a refund.'
