    review: 'The game would not track game time when first released.


      I enjoy sending scouts forward, disrupting enemy weapons and flipping barriers
      to secure a room. The barriers are force-fields which allow units and damage
      to only pass one way. Often you have to be careful when entering a space as
      you will not be able to see if there are enemies within.


      It is like a maze, uncovering rooms as you move along the best route you can
      see.


      I like that the units have different benefits, so I often split my band ...each
      with a scout and an assault drone. The scout moving forward and disrupting enemy
      weapons/flipping barriers with the assault then following to destroy enemy units.
      Heavies are good for clearing heavily defended rooms.


      I like that the game is side-view rather than top-down. You have to consider
      which rooms to advance into, cover, barriers, sight etc. It just seems like
      a more effective way to present an area than top-down, reagardless; it works
      very well for this game.


      I like the backgrounds.


      You can upgrade drones to have different abilities or fulfil certain tasks.
      I always unlock hacking and pick the best disrupter for scouts and increase
      clip capacity and unlock mines for the assaults. Accuracy improvement would
      be a good idea for heavies.


      A really fun strategy game.
