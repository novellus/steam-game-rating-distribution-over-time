    review: 'Mystery Loss is a "match 3" game; obviously a phone game ported to PC.


      Now, main issue, for me, is the continuous requests to "buy" something. I just
      can''t stand it anymore. basically, the player can "buy" bonuses ingame with
      money earned while playing.

      While it''s not real money, it still feels wrong to me, as far as I am concerned.
      This is basically a chance game where origanization and skills have little impact.
      "Buying" stuff will lead the player to have extra bonuses ingame.


      Anyway, it''s still an OK game, considering the price.


      I''ve played this for a little more than 2 hours without problem on Win 7 64
      bit.'
