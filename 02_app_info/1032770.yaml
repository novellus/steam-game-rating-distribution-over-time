    review: "Tolle Wirtschaftssimulation mit vielen M\xF6glichkeiten und Zielen. Der\
      \ Aufbau und die Icons sind mit viel Liebe zum Detail gestaltet und auch die\
      \ akustischen Effekte sind super witzig und toll gelungen. Der Einstig wird\
      \ Schritt f\xFCr Schritt im Tutorial, w\xE4hrend des Spiels erkl\xE4rt, sodass\
      \ kein Frustlevel wegen hilfloser Startversuche zu bef\xFCrchten ist. Alles\
      \ in allem ist es ein gut durchdachtes, kurzweiliges Spiel mit gro\xDFem Spa\xDF\
      faktor und \"Suchtpotenzial\"\nKlasse!!! Daumen und Fu\xDFzeh hoch :-)"
