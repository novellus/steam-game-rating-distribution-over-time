Its not a great film. But it is not one you will fire up and walk away in disgust. Another of the slightly above B movie fare, while not by leaps and bounds, the acting is good, the story is good. Sure, it wont ever be on the list of high end cult films, or a must see of our time.. but it wont leave you wishing you had never seen it. I give it high regards for a new story also. Has some silly moments, and a few what the heck? Mostly around how the fictional air force functions.. but nothing to drive you away unless your so OCD you cant suspend some minor issues for a few moments in time....","timestamp_created":1485398990,"timestamp_updated":1485398990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574435293674468994","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy7ur7NkCdbzBcA=="}
