    about_the_game: "Polaris Sector is a 4X Sci-fi strategy game - take command of\
      \ your interstellar empire, manage all aspects and policies including diplomacy,\
      \ research, ship design and conquer the galaxy! Command your ships in tactical\
      \ mode: when a battle starts you can join the battlefield and maneuver your\
      \ ships. Alternatively use the auto-resolve mode when you have more urgent tasks\
      \ to attend to in your empire.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SETTING</h2><br>The ancients\
      \ who named this sector <strong>Polaris</strong> sure had a unique sense of\

      \ anyone build an empire in a place like this?</strong> Other factions are naturally\
      \ suspicious of newcomers and may wage war at the first sign of unidentified\

    short_description: Can anyone build an empire in a place like this? Other factions
      are naturally suspicious of newcomers and may wage war at the first sign of
      unidentified craft. Here, a natural death is an uncommon luxury.

    review: "First off, check out the positive reviews for why you should play this\
      \ game. I think the game itself has a lot to offer for select players.\nMy negative\
      \ review centers around the fact the game simply isn't fun and does not have\
      \ a lot of flexibility in terms of how you can play it. See the below notes.\n\
      - I've played against the AI at \"Normal\" and \"Challenge\" settings. In both\
      \ cases the gameplay is rather stagnant in the sense that there are only 1-2\
      \ optimal strategies. I.e. The first species to get the largest and fastest\
      \ territory is always ahead. This includes rushing technology that allows you\
      \ to colonize the most amount of planets first and then switching the combat\
      \ tech once the sector becomes stagnant. (Obviously this is usually the case\
      \ in most 4X games but this combined with below notes just compounds the problem).\
      \ \n- Combat has only one optimal strat. Mass fighters, limited bombers, and\
      \ maybe 1-2 cap ships to follow up. I spent several hours designing and testing\
      \ fleet strats (primarily at the mid and late game) and every single strategy\
      \ that did not utilize the above strategy simply failed. There is limited or\
      \ no counter play built into the game to the above strat so you are forced into\
      \ this every time. \n- Diplomacy (i.e. economic, trade, and science treaties)\
      \ has limited usage other than being able to bargain for tech or resources.\
      \ Espionage is actually kind of neat but in terms of effectiveness seems rather\
      \ limited. (I'll be honest and say I haven't fully experimented with espionage\
      \ beyond small scale sabotage but again this combination of limited game play\
      \ just compounds each small issue into a cumulative poo pile). \n- The tech\
      \ tree is cool. - However again there seems to be an easily defined min/max\
      \ strat that is obvious from the start and deviating from that strat has no\
      \ potential gains or alternative gameplay - again the obvious linearity of allowable\
      \ gameplay limits the entire game experience. \n- Finally, in the multiple games\
      \ sequences I ran, I noticed that the 1st species to gain a noticeable advantage\
      \ always won (at least against other AI opponents). Not once did a less powerful\
      \ AI come back from an even slight deficit. This was over the course of 6-7\
      \ games. Again, this indicates that there are very clearly defined optimal strategies\
      \ that simply have no counterplay.\n\nFinal note - I realize this is not an\
      \ AAA game and was not expecting an AAA experience but the simplicity and rigidness\
      \ of game/gameplay (combined with a $39.99 price tag) amount to an exploration\
      \ of the game mechanics and little more than that."
