And then you'll use anything to fill that vacuum. So it doesn't matter if it's coffee, if it's tobacco, if it's TV, if it's heroin, if it's ultimately hope. You'll use anything to fill that hole and when you feed the hole, just like the hole on Jared's arm, it'll grow and grow and grow, until eventually, it will devour you. This film is full of empathy, but also beautiful, almost poetic moments. Does not provide any glorification or condemnation of people addicted to drugs, but rather reflects the cruelty and darkness of this world.\n[h2][i]the requiem for a dream movie really represents what is in his name[/i][/h2]","timestamp_created":1526436673,"timestamp_updated":1605912475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577464818954467773","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41/b18/UCc4u5oAE="}
