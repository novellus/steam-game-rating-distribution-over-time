{"1149060":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"demo","name":"Vivid! Demo","steam_appid":1149060,"required_age":0,"is_free":true,"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Vivid! is a colorful 2D action-packed platformer where color dictates your actions. You'll guide our heroic young lady, Vivid, through the artistic world of Paper Craft and discover treasure, fight off amphibious wizards, and uncover the truth behind her lack of color. You'll even be able to play as her cute dog, Spirit!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis is a Demo build with a Tutorial Level and a Main level inside. If this is your first time playing, the tutorial will be helpful with understanding some of the basics in Vivid. Even if you're great at platformers it will be a good idea to try it just so you know about some of mechanics in the game. Once you're ready, you can tackle the main stage known as &quot;Azure Aqueduct&quot;. You can only play as Vivid for now with limited equipment. But once you beat this stage, all equipment will be unlocked along with the second character, Spirit!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe demo is around 30 minutes long, but can be longer if you decide to play around with Spirit and other weapons. Do note that the extra weapons and Spirit are still being worked on, so they may not be as fluid or lack sound effects. If you close out of the demo but want to play with all the weapons and Spirit again, when on the Level Select, Hold UP and then press the button set to ATTACK. This will treat it as if you beat the demo.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBesides beating the demo, you can also try speed running or getting the Platinum Rank! That is a very hard to earn rank which will require getting 8000 points, all Hearts, and beating the demo in under 3:40 at the same time! Good luck if you decide to attempt it.","about_the_game":"Vivid! is a colorful 2D action-packed platformer where color dictates your actions.
