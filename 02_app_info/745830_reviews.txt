Other than that, I would neither recommending it or not recommend it.\n\nPositives\n+ Mostly nailed the 8-bit aesthetic. (I thought I had connected my NES to my computer monitor at first- lol).\n+ A tribute to RPGs of that era.\n\nNeutral\n~ An obvious port of a mobile app to PC.\n\nNegatives\n- Repetitive battles (not much grinding required on normal mode, just unimaginative and the same after a while).\n- Way too easy on normal mode (whether you’re a veteran or new to the genre).\n- Instead of being good mazes, the dungeon and world maps are mainly annoying.\n- The lottery system through DRP can be game-breaking if you get a powerful item early in the game. (I didn’t even use one lottery ticket and beat the game with the true endings).\n- Missed opportunity to make the battle mechanics more sophisticated (think FF4 or FF6).\n\nI didn’t do the optional challenge dungeon near the end of the game. I also might update this review if I decide to play it through again on a higher difficulty mode.","timestamp_created":1607893163,"timestamp_updated":1607893163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v9P5rvYCd4v5uQI="}
