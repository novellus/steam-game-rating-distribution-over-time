If you are looking for this, maybe you don't even need a review. The story is like a very cheap 70's horror movie making fun of itself. The 'so bad it's good' definitely applies here. It also has an extra mode that's a point and shoot like the original House of the Dead game if you get bored of typing. Artwork gallery, extra arcade mini games and levels of difficulty adds to the overall experience.\n","timestamp_created":1609430266,"timestamp_updated":1609430266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiZ7h3PYCcdqRvwI="}
