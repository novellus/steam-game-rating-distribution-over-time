    review: 'Ok I had really low expectations for this game, i remember in ea2 i had
      no idea what i was doing. Now in stage one and beyond i feel like this game
      is now a proper game there are a few things that could be improved such as plume
      and adding an altimeter, and fixing a few minor bugs but overall this game literally
      made me scream at the top of my lungs "I AM F***ING ELON F***ING MUSK" Never
      felt this excited for a game in my entire life, 10/10 '
