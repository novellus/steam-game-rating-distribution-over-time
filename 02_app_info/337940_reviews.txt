Even with only three skills to invest in, and with explanation screens after you die to help you get to a better ending next time, I struggle to care enough to bother. The artwork is nothing special, the unique scenes that are supposed to be a bit better don't look much different, and there is a noticeable lack of variety of locations, and music. To emphasise my point, there isn't any voices either.\n\nI've replayed day 16 to 22 over and over, but with no guides to refer to on Steam (or anywhere else I could find) I've lost interest. Nothing seems to want to unlock. If you want an enjoyable experience I recommend [i]Long Live the Queen.[/i]","timestamp_created":1597680105,"timestamp_updated":1597680105,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44vbJ/vMCcpGHnAI="}
