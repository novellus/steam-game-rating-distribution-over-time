    review: 'Emerald City Confidential is an enjoyable romp through the land of Oz,
      set 20 years after Dorothy''s initial visit to Oz. In those 20 years, a number
      of things have changed, and although a number of the character names will be
      familiar, their personalities and motivations have changed.


      You take the role of Petra, a Detective, who is initially hired to find a missing
      person. That goal expands throughout the game. There also is ANOTHER underlying
      more personal case for Petra that spans the entire game. As Petra, you will
      not only visit the Emerald City, but you will also visit other lands of Oz as
      well


      The mechanics of game play are nicely woven to where the player is never at
      a loss as to what they must do, thanks to a hint system that provides as much
      or as little assistance as the player likes. The voice acting for all of the
      characters is excellent. Petra, for example, comes across as your typical hard
      boiled gumshoe. The other character voices fit just as well.


      The only negative for the game is that the cursor ''shimmers'' in Windows 10,
      but not so badly as to disrupt the game. So that is merely a small annoyance.
      The video is crisp, for a 10 year old game, and the sound is excellent.


      The game can probably be beaten in 5 hours or less, so that should be taken
      into account when deciding on a purchase.


      I give the game a solid  4 stars out of 5.'
