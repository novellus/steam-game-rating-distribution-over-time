    review: "I personally feel this application is more of a bank of words, rather\
      \ than an effective study tool. There are websites that I use that helped me\
      \ such as Real Kana and quizlet that is simply more polished to work with. If\
      \ there are going to be more updates, these are things that should be considered\
      \ to implement.\n\n1. Key inputs during quizzes\nI feel the lack of typing the\
      \ answer kind of loses my motivation to answer more than 10 questions. I personally\
      \ think it would be a more engaging experience if I am able to type these key\
      \ inputs. It really gives off of a personal competitive vibe that brings the\
      \ experience on a new level\n\n2. Customization for flashcards.\nObviously if\
      \ you are doing flashcards, it is almost essential to have a \"custom\" list\
      \ depending on what you want to learn. Although there is a looping system, it\
      \ doesn't really help since you don't choose what cards you want to study. The\
      \ only method I found is by missing them on purpose and then practice the ones\
      \ you missed.\n\n3. Provide audio for Kanji\nIt feels frustrating that there\
      \ is a lack of consistency when it audio isn't supported for everything. When\
      \ I was looking through the kanji section, I had a hard time how to \"pronounce\"\
      \ the words since it has different ways to spell it. Let's take the word \u672C\
      . It means book if it was pronounced as \u307B\u3093 aka hon. However there\
      \ is another way to interpret the kanji, which is \u3082\u3068 aka moto, and\
      \ I wish there is a default audio file that tells me which is the more common\
      \ pronunciation, which I learned from my Japanese Class was Hon.\n\nOverall,\
      \ it just feels this was made as a college project, I made a way worse version\
      \ of a flashcard app before and I can definitely say it takes a lot of manual\
      \ work when it comes to inputting a lot of information and files into an app.\
      \ However, it doesn't really excuse the lack of polish this product holds and\
      \ I do hope there are more updates so I can change my review."
