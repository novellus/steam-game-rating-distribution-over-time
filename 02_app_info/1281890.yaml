    review: "I wouldn't recommend this game if it was free.\n  \nI realize it's meant\
      \ to be more of an interactive art experience than an actual game, but the execution\
      \ is terrible. \nI also realize what the title of the game is.  It feels like\
      \ the title of the game has more to do with the technically/lazily flawed design\
      \ of the game, more than any kind of metaphor.  The game also has some very\
      \ bizarre, unexplained, dark moments...not \"relaxing\" at all. \nIt's like\
      \ they literally knew they were packaging and selling a pile of junk...and we're\
      \ the fools."
