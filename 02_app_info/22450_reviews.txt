It's not terrible, it's just really clunky, average and not worth your time. Go play Remnant: From the Ashes, Gears of War, or any Dark Souls game instead.\n\nShame about the protagonists, though. The voice acting and banter is the best thing about the game, I just wish they'd ended up in a better game.","timestamp_created":1609651899,"timestamp_updated":1609651899,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p9mu4/YCdJv8vwI="}
