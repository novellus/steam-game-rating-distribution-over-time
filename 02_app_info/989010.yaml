    review: 'Unfortunately I can not recommend this game.


      For language learning, this is a bad approach since the implementation of this
      game is just your bog-standard visual novel engine which doesn''t offer more
      interaction than clicking to get the next line of dialog and choosing an option
      from a list of choices. There is no feedback loop - as in, no way to review
      your progress, re-do lessons later on, quiz yourself on whether you actually
      learned anything. The model is fine for VNs, but not for language learning.


      Also, there does not seem to be an option to turn down the background music.
      While the music isn''t  bad as such, it does get annoying really quickly.


      It looks cute and all, and I wish it was better, but unfortunately this is not
      good.'
