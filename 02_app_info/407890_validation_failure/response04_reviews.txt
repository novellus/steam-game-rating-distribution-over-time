I am now looking forward to going through the tutorials again (and will actually finish them this time).\n\nI am happy to say that this tutorial video (with over 40mb of files) scores a recomendation from me as it is a more complete tutorial and is very informative. \n\nAfter looking at all the model files etc, I have upped the score to a respectable 8 out of 10.\n\n\nTo the author... Thanks for adding the requested files!\n\n\n_________________________________\n\n\n3 out of 10 is all I could give this tutorial due to the lack of support files.\n\nThe video itself is fine, the fact that the only assets are a set of stensils is disappointing.\n\nNo refund from steam as there's downloadable content (the stencils) is also disappointing.  I've seen numerous requests for the model files in discussions, and the \"support\" web page goes to your resume/portfolio web address.\n\nYou obviously know what you are doing with the software that's used in the videos, but to save time and help the people that are supporting you financially, the model files would have been useful.\n\nOn the whole, I've learned more off the substance youtube channels, but some techniques you've used will save me time in creating assets.","timestamp_created":1449631758,"timestamp_updated":1451972651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/4yUiNICcPPWSg=="}
