If you're bored of the typical strategy game, I would definitely recommend this game. It offers simulated aspects of all forms of first response. EMS, firefighters, law enforcement officers and utilities workers are the four primary first response uniforms that hold up their respective countries all over the world. As a Paramedic for 15 years now, some of these calls are legitimate, and some aren't even close, but it's definitely fun and you should give it a shot!","timestamp_created":1599937524,"timestamp_updated":1599937524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkqbtwfQCdZW0oQI="}
