I do really like this game and its soundtrack but its not worth buying on steam unless you want it that desperately, you're best off buying it on bandcamp or using a youtube downloader, as the songs are all on there, and this is why (it may not be always applicable but I think it happens often from other reviews). The thing hadn't downloaded even when it said it had and when I asked steam support about it they pointed me towards troves support team, who told me its an issue with steam. It may say that it has downloaded but it wont be where you thing, I couldn't find it in the game's files nor the steam music folder. If this is happening to you i would suggest using the steps that Johnny8435 mentioned in his review as they were very helpful and thanks to him i can finally rave to \"DancePad - Dracolyte's Dance\" on the train. I stress, it's very good and worth the money and i would recommend getting it but i can't recommend getting it on steam on steam as its too much of a hassle to install.","timestamp_created":1595851955,"timestamp_updated":1595851955,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s4uMyPMCfZbqlwI="}
