If the maker took some time to make an update addresing those things then it would be a nice little rpg horror but as it is, it doesn't justify itself as a paid game when there are a lot better free rpg horrors out there.You can easily fix this Satria, it only needs some tweaking to make it into an actaully enjoyable spooky game.","timestamp_created":1604961266,"timestamp_updated":1604961266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwla3J1/UCeeG3rQI="}
