      \ ways to upgrade them<br>\u30FBCo-op Connect Battles against gigantic bosses<br>\u30FB\
      Raid battles with up to 20 players<br><br>-What is Valkyrie Connect?<br>It's\
      \ a Japanese RPG set in a world that's basically an anime version of Norse mythology.\
      \ There are tons of Heroes to collect and upgrade, ranging from standard fantasy\
      \ fare like Elves and Dwarves to Jotun and Aesir and whatever Garm is. Some\
      \ kind of Doggo, we think.<br><br>-What's that Limit Burst thing mentioned a\
      \ few lines up?<br>All Heroes in the game have unique skills and something called\
      \ a Limit Burst. Limit Bursts are flashy abilities that can swing the tide of\
      \ battle. Assigning multiple Heroes with the same Limit Burst to your party\
      \ increases the Limit Burst's strength, which adds another layer of strategy\
      \ to party building. Both skills and Limit Bursts can be activated with a few\
      \ quick clicks, letting you focus on timing.<br><br>-Tell me more about upgrading\
      \ Heroes.<br>WHERE TO BEGIN. You can level them up, of course. You can upgrade\
      \ their star rating by collecting their souls. You can attach orbs to upgrade\
      \ certain stats. You can equip them with gear to give them extra abilities.\
      \ Gear can also be upgraded separately, by the way. Certain Heroes can also\
      \ be &quot;&quot;awakened&quot;&quot;, which grants them new passive skills.\
      \ Basically, you take your parties from lil' babby weaklings to powerhouses\
      \ that can take down literal gods. Their power scores get bigger, and you feel\
      \ better.<br><br>-Connect Battles... What are those about?<br>They're co-op\
      \ battles that you can run in real time with your friends. The bosses in these\
      \ battles are big. Real big. Connect Battles are the heart of Valkyrie Connect\
      \ (it's even in the title!), and this is where you can put your fancy powered\
      \ up heroes to the test. Many of our players spend hours each day running them\
      \ together.<br><br>-20-player raids... those sound fun.<br>They are! The bosses\
      \ are even bigger than Connect Battle bosses. Bet. Those drop materials that\
      \ let you craft artifacts, which are special pieces of gear you can equip on\
      \ your Heroes.<br><br><br>Free to play<br>*In-game purchases are available<br><br>*Please\
