    review: OJ is one of these devs that, even though their game is not as popular
      and not many people play it, they still deliver awesome events, new characters
      and new cards to shape up the "meta". All DLC card packs are a must-have, for
      a number of reasons, but particularly for the increased playing options. Some
      more cards you can unlock for a really nice price. Take note you still have
      to buy them from the packs, this just unlocks the pack in the shop and makes
      them available too you.
