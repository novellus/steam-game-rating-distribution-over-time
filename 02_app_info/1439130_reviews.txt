All I hear is a bunch of people moaning and I already have poor eyesight so my eyes took a beating trying to play this. Actually having difficultly getting my eyes to focus after about an hour of this which is troubling to say the least.\n\nThe journal is a little bit too vague. It says I have to find a way out. I think that is literally always the objective of every horror game ever, so I didn't really need a book to tell me that I needed to get out of there. What I did need, was a clue as to what the game actually wanted me to do next. Wandering in the dark straining my eyes wasn't fun at all. \n\nCrouching only lowers me about 4 inches from my standing position and I have no idea why it is even a mechanic. Picking up objects sometimes flings them several feet up into the air and away, causing them to somehow fall through objects and become unobtainable. \n\nThis is a fresh release so I understand that there is some polish that needs to happen. But good golly, this probably could have waited a little longer or been tested more. \n\nIf nothing else, at least make a brightness slider so I can see. As it is, there is no way I can justify the current price point.
