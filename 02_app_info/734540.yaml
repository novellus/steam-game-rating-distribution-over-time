    about_the_game: A game based on a well-known puzzle game, but with a gameplay
      changed to the core. Now the field of mines is a hexagonal cell, which makes
      sweeping mines more complex and unpredictable. Find out how well you can neutralize
      the entire minefield by calculating the location of the mines.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/734540/extras/Sapper.jpg?t=1510760118"

    review: This game is not that great, it is missing two critical things from the
      original minesweeper (the fact that you never explode on the first turn of minesweeper
      and that you can actually calculate where the mines are from the adjacent squares.)
      This just relies on blind luck most of the time. And the helper isn't helping
      much. Although I did enjoy the unusual field shapes.
