    review: "2nd Gig is certainly not what I had expected after watching Stand Alone\
      \ Complex. It\u2019s difficult to explain how a sequel can be so divisive of\
      \ quality while also standing up alongside the original on its own merits. It\u2019\
      s largely within the smallest of details that show the greatest deviations between\
      \ these two seasons, and if I had to choose which season was better I would\
      \ say the original; if I had to choose which season had more memorable episodes,\
      \ I would definitely select season 2. Whether or not you find one season of\
      \ higher quality does not diminish each season\u2019s merits, and that is why\
      \ 2nd Gig is perhaps only second to the greatness of the original.\n\n[h1]This\
      \ Wasn\u2019t from 2017\u2026?[/h1]\n\nHowever, of all the differences between\
      \ each season, it\u2019s perhaps the show\u2019s relevance to the present that\
      \ makes 2nd Gig more controversial to present times, especially within the past\
      \ year. As an English major, I am always wary of imposing current events onto\
      \ works with no relevance other than the subject matter itself, yet its similarities\
      \ border on the surreal if you try to separate the small differences between\
      \ fantasy and reality.\n\nThe set-up of the season is a large-scale postwar\
      \ refugee crisis in Japan.  Asian refugees are being taken in at such a large\
      \ rate that the government abides by its immigration crisis of economic instability\
      \ as a moral duty while taxing taxpayers to fund these initiatives. The result\
      \ of this larger issue fuels the ire of Japanese nationalists acting as a stand-alone\
      \ complex known as The Individual Eleven and a secret government intelligence\
      \ agency known as the C.I.S. These leads into random terrorist acts such as\
      \ nail-bombs and international attacks across the globe to affect the refugee\
      \ bills in Japan while a leader is orchestrated by the C.I.S. to become \u201C\
      a voice of the people\u201D while the government body is the producer of this\
      \ hero. \n\nThere are even less subtle implications such as Japan\u2019s first\
      \ female prime minister and the episode about the delusions of a war veteran\
      \ about his distrust with the media to report on these refugee attacks without\
      \ obfuscating the truth. Compared to the first season, 2nd Gig is more involved\
      \ with its political affairs than the transhumanism topics, which can be both\
      \ good and bad depending on how you think they are handled. Most episodes still\
      \ remain focused on the ramifications of technology on humanity, yet the emphasis\
      \ is definitely placed on its politics within the scope of the whole season.\n\
      \nIf the first season only had topics more relevant to the present with internet\
      \ culture attitudes, the season borders on self-reflection of the current political\
      \ landscape of the States. The ending itself doesn\u2019t address the issue\
      \ other than it remains divisive, which is probably the only fair way the show\
      \ could have ended yet it also lacks that sense of finality that makes the original\
      \ so beloved.  \n\n[h1]True Grit with Less Wit[/h1]\n\nSome of the other changes\
      \ that are easy to witness and harder to describe are small details made in\
      \ every episode. Characters we know already are quickly established and they\
      \ are given less episodes to flesh out their backstories any further. Violence,\
      \ one of the more tamer aspects of the original, is more gratuitous at any opportunity\
      \ to showcase the increased animation. Deaths in the first season were often\
      \ implied or obscured tastefully whereas the 2nd Gig will often show heads exploding\
      \ from gunshots or blood being shot out of a soldier. These little changes don\u2019\
      t affect the overall season but they do establish the show as a darker transition\
      \ from simple under-the-government-cover operatives of the former Section 9\
      \ into the more bureaucratic, manipulated Section 9 of 2nd Gig. \n\nAs a whole,\
      \ these changes are beneficial for 2nd Gig as the scenarios and obstacles Section\
      \ 9 has to overcome are more politically motivated and greyer than their previous\
      \ operatives. It\u2019s a shame then that the villains within 2nd Gig are too\
      \ blatantly obvious for their own benefit; Gouza, the head of the C.I.S., has\
      \ a facial scar that screams Skullface from Metal Gear Solid V. Kuze, a more\
      \ morally gray character with more sympathy, has more development as the face\
      \ of the refugees that is undermined by a convoluted connection to \u201CMajor\u201D\
      \ Motoko. The only benefit is the narrative doesn\u2019t deliberate on a very\
      \ schmaltzy revelation with Major and Kuze, so the connection remains as much\
      \ of a mystery as the lore about ghosts, AI, etc. \n\nIt\u2019s these little\
      \ defects within the larger narrative of 2nd Gig that makes it the lesser of\
      \ two great seasons as had they polished the tone-changes as well as flesh out\
      \ the villains to be more believable the storyline could easily be the greater\
      \ of the two. Now whether it was these changes and the shift from transhumanism\
      \ into humanitarian political affairs as to why there has not been an official\
      \ third season remains to be seen with Solid State Society."
