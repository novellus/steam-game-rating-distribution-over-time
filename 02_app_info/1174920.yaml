    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WARNINGS</h2>This game requires a controller\
      \ and is currently only available in French.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STORY</h2>Caught\
      \ in the infinite routine of the Metropolis, a city where nobody is allowed\
      \ to have a head, Blank feels an urgent need to escape from this suffocating\
      \ world. Filling the hole above his neck by a mannequin head, he begins his\
      \ journey towards freedom where he\u2019ll meet several colourful characters\
      \ along the way and discovers the secrets of the Metropolis, the Headless people\
      \ and his own identity.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAMEPLAY</h2>Blank\u2019s gameplay\
      \ is based on one main mechanic: Perspectives. It\u2019s a power that allows\
      \ you to make different elements of your environment appear and disappear. Furthermore,\
      \ you\u2019ll have to solve navigation puzzles in order to reach your next objective\
      \ and progress in the game and this, without being seen by any enemies that\
      \ might be lurking around.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PRODUCTION</h2>Blank is a school\
      \ project developed by Campus ADN\u2019s class of 2018-2019 in Montreal, Quebec,\
      \ Canada. It\u2019s one of the two games of the cohort, along with the other\
      \ game Ope, also available on Steam. Blank was created in only 15 weeks of production\
      \ by a team of 27 devoted students enrolled in Animation, Level Design and Modeling\
      \ programs during their third semester, under the lead of local industry professionals.\
      \ They have put all of their heart into it and sincerely hope you\u2019ll have\
      \ as much fun playing it than they had working on it.<br><br>Blank Production\
