    review: 'I honestly understand the criticism the game has gotten, and I won''t
      tell people they''re wrong. I will share my own experience with the game though.

      I''ve had a blast with it. As you can see, I''ve gotten 60 hours out of it at
      the moment, and I''m sure I''ll be returning to it. If your impression of the
      game from the store page and some youtube videos (I would recommend Scott Manley)
      was a positive one, I''m sure you''ll enjoy it. It''s true that you shouldn''t
      have expectations about the game being "finished" or receiving updates, and
      if that''s a deal breaker, fair enough. I, at least, enjoyed the hell out of
      it'
