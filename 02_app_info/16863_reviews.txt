Buy it only in a bundle or when it's on sale. Too expensive for just a map, could've been included in the base game.\n\n[h1]Long review[/h1]\n\nThis DLC allows you to play on a map representing Mesopotamia. The map is exclusively available in Standard size and is therefore relatively small. The strategic resources benefit from a better map location than the other DLCs from the Cradle of Civilization packs, making it much more enjoyable to play on this map. However, I consider these sorts of DLC a plain money grab.","timestamp_created":1605788023,"timestamp_updated":1605788023,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jZeb8PUCerakrwI="}
