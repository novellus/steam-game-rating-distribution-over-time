    review: 'I always try to give games the benefit of doubt but this one just doesn''t
      have what it takes - not as a released game.


      Open world - nope.  The actual area is very small and limited to only a couple
      of notable places.  I actually tried running to the edge of the world and once
      you leave the small initial area there is nothing.  I ran into the invisible
      wall that marks the end of the world so I know I got to the end. You can''t
      survive out there nor even build structures (not unless you want to ferry the
      materials out) because the necessary resources are not out there.  Building
      a big house substantially outside the initial play area is probably the only
      way to make this game last more than one day.


      Crafting - nope.  I go into these games looking for to build up on the technology
      tree.  But there is no tree.  There is an axe, a pickaxe and a hammer.  No way
      to upgrade those.  No better versions.  No swords, no bows, nothing else that
      is a weapon. Also no armor.  It is necessary to build some crafting tools but
      only so when one dies one doesn''t have to run across the entire map again.  The
      basic tools are all that is needed to build all of the buildings.


      Buildings - yes.  You can build buildings.  Wood and stone.  This would be the
      most "complete" part of this.  However that doesn''t mean there are a lot of
      options.  Definitely less than 20. And there doesn''t see to be much point in
      doing that.  I did seem to be able to escape the druids in them but I was concerned
      that it seemed more like because they couldn''t figure out how to get through
      the door.  There is no weather to be protected from, the buildings do not allow
      one to heal (even though there is a bed), there does not even seem to be a requirement
      to use them for crafting.  I put a bed and chest in one but not sure that was
      even required.


      Gameplay - not really.  Not really my thing but it seems like the only effective
      way to proceed through the game is to die.  Repeatedly.  Retrieving the goods
      to keep one alive, due to no technology means that getting the necessary materials
      will likely cost you more health than what it is worth.  I didn''t solve the
      plot mystery because I had run out of the technology tree and seen all of the
      locations mostly before I even thought to look at it.  I am not really a great
      fan of the druids respawning in the same spot over and over.  At one point I
      had to kill about 10 of them and I knew the only way that was going to work
      was if I deliberately planned for my death and respawn to finish them off. For
      the vast majority of people I suspect they will find the actual play easy but
      irritating because there is no real way not to just expect to die. And the actual
      effective game area is very small.'
