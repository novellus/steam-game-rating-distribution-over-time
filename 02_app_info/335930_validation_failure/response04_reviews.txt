If you notice in their pictures, there is no actual in-program screenshots. Only advertisements. This is because there is no interface. It is a terribly formated folder of a few files. I paid 70 dollars for files that I don't even understand how to use. I tried getting a refund, but I've had it collecting dust for too long so I don't fit the qualifications. Not happy. Do not trust this developer. I sure won't be purchasing anything from them in the future.","timestamp_created":1488709666,"timestamp_updated":1488709666,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":96,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.821114003658294678","comment_count":15,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzdiAz9oCdM/bcw=="}
