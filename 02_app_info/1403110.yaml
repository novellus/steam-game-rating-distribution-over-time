    developer_response: "There is no sugar coating on any of the pictures or videos\
      \ on the Steam Store page, what you see is exactly what you get, they are in-game\
      \ screenshots with the UI turned off.\n\t\n\tThe user interface is Unity asset\
      \ store pack stock images, nothing has been custom made yet.  As a matter of\
      \ fact, every asset in the game is from the Unity asset store because I'm a\
      \ solo developer that doesn't have a team of highly trained specialized individuals\
      \ at my disposal.\n\t\n\tIf the game crashes for you, you should give me some\
      \ more details either at the email address listed on the store page or on the\
      \ game's Discord because you're the first person out of all of my players that's\
      \ mentioned it and I'd like to get it fixed if it is indeed actually crashing.\n\
      \t\n\tThe AI is rough, everything currently has basic AI, I haven't gotten to\
      \ the point of adding in custom AI for each species yet.  Though dinosaur AI\
      \ does sometimes sprint, just in 20 minutes of play you aren't going to see\
      \ much happen in the way of AI, features, or gameplay because its a little bit\
      \ of a longer-term game at the moment.\n\t\n\tYou gain growth in two ways. \
      \ One, passively over time, the longer you play the more growth happens just\
      \ in case you have a hard time finding food.  Number two, food, eating, makes\
      \ you grow depending on what you've eaten.  Some things give you more growth\
      \ than others.  For herbivores there are common, uncommon, and rare plants and\
      \ the rarer a plant is the more growth points it gives you.  Also, plants in\
      \ different biomes are worth different amounts of points so it may be worthwhile\
      \ to travel to another area to sample the plants and see if they are more nutritious.\
      \  Carnivores, each dinosaur species gives a different amount of growth points,\
      \ the tougher and bigger a dinosaur is the more growth points it will give you.\
      \  Also with carnivores, a fresh corpse is worth twice as many points compared\
      \ to left over meat from an old corpse.\n\t\n\tThe parent AI comes to your assistance\
      \ if you call for help when something is either attacking you or chasing you\
      \ and to call for help you press the '1' key on the keyboard, which will make\

    review: "before i start id like to mention i am a regular of this game genre,\
      \ i play a lot of BOB, and isle.\ni love dinosaur survival games and games where\
      \ you get to play as a beast in general. i would like to have high hopes for\
      \ this game but i just can't.\n\nfirst of all the steam pictures of this game\
      \ are so sugar coated, the HUD is little low res pictures, they're is grass\
      \ always in front of the screen as a hatching giving you a seizure every time\
      \ you move forward. the AI just targets you and walks over and starts biting\
      \ like the robotic unintelligent stock asset it is. its not cinematic... the\
      \ camera is so non-dynamic and makes you feel sick especially with the Pterasaur.\
      \ don't glorify your game if it genuinely looks like garbage in game.\n\niv'e\
      \ played for about 20 minutes and the game is barley playable. it crashes continuously,\
      \ the AI is rough and robotic in movement and static behaviour. and every single\
      \ model is a stock. this game feels like beasts of 9500 because its so badly\
      \ put together. most things cost around 1000 to 3000 growth, you get about 1\
      \ growth a few seconds. they are expecting me to play this game for about an\
      \ hour? to get a slightly larger dinosaur? aha, no. there is a game called \"\
      dinosaur sim\" that's free on the app store and it has everything free to access\
      \ with the exact same models as this game, dare i say it? even better code.\
      \ it does not crash, it has extra features. the only thing this game has that\
      \ that game does not is parent AI. \nand parent AI, oh my god. its a non aggressive\
      \ regular dinosaur AI, it does not acknowledge your existence it just waltzes\
      \ away from the nest never to be seen again...\n\nOverall it feels like a cheap\
      \ app store cash grab, not to mention it costs 15 fucking pounds! honestly it\
      \ feels like a scam, but iv'e seen how many regular updates they're are, this\
      \ game is most likely a passion project by a caring developer, but it feels\
      \ so rookie copy paste code. i hope this game continues its development because\
      \ the dinosaur survival genre is seriously lacking and this game is an opportunity\
      \ to improve the genre as a whole. but i have to say even if it was free give\
      \ it a miss.."
