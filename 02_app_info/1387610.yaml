    developer_response: Hello, the SFX issues you were encountering have now been
      fixed and will be introduced in the next patch. I believe i have also managed
      to fix the resolution glitch you were encountering when switching scenes. Hope
      this helps. Thanks!

    review: 'Cowboys n'' Stuff is not a bad game but it is one i can''t recommend
      right now in it''s current state, the game feels unpolished in some areas. The
      game resets the resolution when you go to certain areas of the game, the UI
      is way too big almost like it was made for mobile, the mouse feels like it has
      a slight input delay/lag, the volume sliders don''t scale across the slider
      properly, some things in the game completely ignore whatever you set the volume
      slider to and i experienced all of these issues from playing the first 6 levels.
      The first 6 levels have the same music as the main music which makes the game
      quite annoying to listen to especially when the game is quite slow and some
      sound effects are just not nice to listen to. All of this wouldn''t matter if
      the game was in early access with the promise of future updates but this game
      has come out as a full release and therefore I must see this game as complete
      and one the developer was happy with. Cowboys n'' Stuff seems like it''ll give
      a lot of the  same things with the later levels since levels are defined by
      the colour of the background and some new enemy''s which undoubtedly will get
      repetitive quick. A few tweaks to the game play like making it faster, some
      variety in objectives, some polish to the UI and some new music could make this
      game genuinely enjoyable but right now it''s just not worth it, wait for updates
      and it could be a cool little game.

      ---EDIT---

      So I returned to this game after the christmas update and have had not much
      of a better experience, the new christmas levels were fun but glitches still
      run rampant. The volume sliders still dont work, the game forces me into windowed
      after changing menus and theres only 1 resolution at 50hz (my monitor is 75hz).
      As i said back in the original part of my review this game would''ve much suited
      being a early access review since this is the developers first ever game, fixing
      glitches and adjusting gameplay is probably hard without the experience. As
      an early access game these issues would be a lot more forgivable than it is
      now since the game is released as finished. Once again, not recommended in its
      current state espicically with the new christmas and halloween content which
      has been released since my last part of the review.'
