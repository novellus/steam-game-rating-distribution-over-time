    short_description: "Gloom and Doom is a visual novel throwback to 90s slacker\
      \ movies - complete with the solitude and sarcastic retorts - but with a supernatural\
      \ twist. Push a powerful but unmotivated wraith to complete\_his stagnated quest\
      \ to enter heaven, while trying to kill the suicidal but unkillable Doom Bringer."
