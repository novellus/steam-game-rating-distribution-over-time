    review: "The devs have just announced that they intend to use deliberately unfair\
      \ matchmaking to \"allow for more comfortable gameplay\" for people who purchase\
      \ \"Battle Hardened status\" (previously just an economic bonus) for their vehicles\
      \ with premium currency.\n\nYes, they actually publicly announced deliberately\
      \ broken matchmaking and they are trying to sell it as a feature.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/games/ArmoredWarfare/announcements/detail/2753341279118232121\n\
      \nOn a related note, My.games is so incompetent that they can't even get their\
      \ store page right (at the time of writing, the store page description text\
      \ is that for the ZBD-86 which is a completely different vehicle) and as you\
      \ might expect from a team too unprofessional to maintain a working store page,\
      \ My.com treats its customers like cattle to be milked and mistreated in that\
      \ order. \n\nShort version: The community managers are corrupt, post factually\
      \ inaccurate things they didn't actually write as their own work, and perma-ban\
      \ people who correct them. \n\nCustomer service is even worse. They will lie\
      \ and delete support requests in an attempt to hid their connections to the\
      \ corruption mentioned above.\n\nAfter buying a LOT of DLC and putting more\
      \ than 800 hours into the game (I started my own clan) I was perma-banned from\
      \ the forums in a case CM abuse so blatant that Steam actually overturned it\
      \ (as you probably know, Steam usually sides with the CMs if there is any ambiguity\
      \ regarding a ban.)\n\nNot coincidentally, the same CM who banned me was one\
      \ who had previously posted an article as his own work which contained both\
      \ factual errors (claiming that the Rheinmetall 120mm L55 was invented in Korea)\
      \ and sentences like:\n\n \"The K2 \u201CBlack Panther\u201D MBT is, without\
      \ any doubt, one of the most advanced tanks in the world \u2013 if not the most\
      \ advanced one because, unlike so many other designs that claim to be next-gen,\
      \ it can actually back this claim up with the very best technology the Republic\
      \ of Korea can develop,\" \n\nwhich STRONGLY suggested that at least part of\
      \ the article had originally been written by a super-patriotic Korean.\n\nhttps://aw.my.games/en/news/general/black-panther\n\
      \nWhile I didn't mention the latter point directly, I did point out the factual\
      \ errors and shortly afterwards, the CM deleted all the comments on the post\
      \ as you can see here:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/443110/eventcomments/1754654019204234445/\n\
      \nThough I did save this screenshot of myself politely correcting him because\
      \ I somehow knew that he was going to try something unethical:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2126034055\n\
      \nAfter Silent Stalker banned me and before Steam removed the ban, I went to\
      \ the AW discord to ask the CMs for help where \"Soren\" gleefully banned listing\
      \ \"thanks for the feedback\" as the reason for the ban. He literally didn't\
      \ even pretend to have a good reason.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2127547497\n\
      \nI then went to customer service where \"Ilya\" transferred me to \"Arthur\"\
      \ who literally pretended that he had no authority (an obvious lie since Ilya\
      \ transferred my case to him BECAUSE he had authority.)\n\nA live-service is\
      \ only as good as the people running it and I cannot recommend any product run\
      \ by such unprofessional, lazy, and dishonest people."
