      \ /><br><br>Your objective is to stop any visitors to your Monsters\u2019 Domain.\
      \ Start from simple monsters and skeletons and with time build up your defences.\
      \ You can play any monster from your army and give them specific orders to follow.\
      \ Every killed hero makes them stronger and gives you an opportunity to equip\
      \ them better or develop new skills or monstrosities. You can reanimate fallen\
      \ intruders or collect pieces of your slain warriors and research new ways to\
      \ use it. <br><br>Develop your preferred Style. You can focus on specific Style\
      \ or mix them together to create a unique army of loyal Monsters. Choose from\
      \ Necromancy, Vivisection, Mutation, Runes, Elixirs, Talismans, Forge, Techie,\
      \ Strategy, Roguery, Drilling or Sorcery and different schools of Dark Magic.<br><br>Grow\
      \ your beasts and monsters, make them unique or identical with others to unlock\
      \ specific skill trees, upgrades and abilities. Combine unique equipment and\
      \ skills and create your Bosses or Swarms. <br><br>Styles are complex systems\
      \ focused on specific areas but combined with others allow to create more powerful\
      \ weapons and upgrades. The vivisected finger of the mage combined with some\
      \ elixirs can be a very powerful upgrade for your simple skeleton. Reanimated\
      \ corpse of a fallen hero with some fresh mutations and newly forged weapons\
      \ can make a really nice new Boss for your realm.<br><br>Loot all you can as\
      \ bodies decay and some treasures can be lost to nasty imps or other thieves.\
      \ Store you treasures as a lure for visitors or forge them into powerful objects.\
      \ Every piece matters. Study new materials and runes, develop schematics for\
      \ your traps and devices, collect limbs, flesh and bones for your experiments\
      \ and new creations.<br><br>Learn and experiment. The way your monsters kill\
      \ new heroes can be entertaining but also eye opening. Develop your Strategy\
      \ and new Roguery tricks. Teach your zombies to play dead (sic!) or Drill skeletons\
      \ to fight in formation. Experiment in your Forge with loot and spells and combine\
      \ them into unique crafting materials.<br><br>Do all you can to defend you Monsters\u2019\
