There are a lot of addons to the base MoM game and lots of tweaks.  Most of the add-ons are pretty subtle and enhance what is there (i.e. spells, options for you wizard, monsters).  What you will notice this is a much harder game.  Everything is amped up including how psychotic the AI is towards you.  Random encounters will storm your towns so walls and garrisons are needed.  Armies to fly in and intercept are a huge plus.  The AI is super aggressive and expansive.  If you're alone in the plane DO NOT take a tower to cross planes until you are ready.","timestamp_created":1606929214,"timestamp_updated":1606929214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo72ckvYCecHmtgI="}
