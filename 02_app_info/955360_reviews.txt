The time skips in the second half felt rushed and broke up what was originally a very flowing and immersive setting. I also had a technical issue where the character I was romancing was suddenly replaced by someone who had approached us (it resolved after one choice click). And although I originally had planned to pursue the mining route, after chapter 2 I stopped getting options to address mining at all. Some choices and options seemed to vanish into thin air- never to be mentioned or offered again.\n\nDespite these minor issues, game play was enjoyable. In the vast array of choices and options I think there was only one or two times where I couldn't find a choice I agreed with. There were numerous times where I was torn between two very good options! This opens the door to multiple plays and I will certainly try the game again with a different approach.\n\nWhile I have played many choice-based games, was my first game in this particular style and I really enjoyed it. I feel like this experience is a wonderful blend of creative reading and modern technology- you get the best of both worlds! I'll definitely be looking into other games by this company.","timestamp_created":1607857974,"timestamp_updated":1607857974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr7XzrfYCcvrluQI="}
