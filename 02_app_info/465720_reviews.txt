The game was developed by Brave Giant Studio and published by Artifex Mundi.\n\n\"New Chapter\" is the second episode of \"Demon Hunter.\" Previous episode: \"Chronicles from the Beyond.\"\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are four different game difficulty modes to choose from: Regular; Advanced; Expert and Custom.\n\nThe notebook keeps track of the progression in the game. Such as story events and clues.\n\nThere is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly without having the need to constantly backtrack. It also indicates that there are a variety of tasks that can be completed at various locations within the game. The interactive map is automatically given at the start of the game.\n\nThere is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place. The inventory panel automatically comes stationary.\n\nThere are some interactive items in the game. Some of the interactive items may require extra components before they can be interacted with. All interactive items are marked with a symbol at one of the corners.\n\nThe hidden object scenes consist of the following: Shadow items; Find 'x' amount and Traditional word lists. Some of these hidden object scenes may require a little or no interaction.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.\n\nThere are twenty-five different collectibles in the game. They are scattered throughout the game for the player to find.\n\nThere are fifteen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThere are five different trading cards to collect. Only three of those trading cards are given out by the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading cards: Purchased from the Steam's Community Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and its Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1520626396,"timestamp_updated":1604278546,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.626722276210784912","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5f2cw/UCcJWdmwE="}
