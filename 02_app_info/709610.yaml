    review: Awful. I love Mahjong solitaire, this isn't even that. It's just a tile
      matching game that doesn't even follow the same rules, and no matter how I change
      the settings, the whole board is never in view. This is just a bad port of a
      mobile game. Avoid and save your pennies
