      &amp; online multiplayer mayhem. In a future of tasteless synth-food, the only
      real flavor is won from a game show battle against hordes of monsters and machines.
      In Death Carnival, winners feast, losers splatter, and the crowd roars. Players
      can play solo or bring along three friends in online co-op mode.<h2 class="bb_tag">Story:</h2>In
      the desolate future, mass extinction has eliminated most non-human life on Earth.
      With barely any plants or animals left, ninety-seven percent of the population
      survives on synthetic nutrient pellets. What little real food that remains is
      controlled as prizes in the highest-rated game show on Earth, Death Carnival,
      where contestants battle for their lives against hordes of relentless monsters
      and machines.<br><br>Survival rates for Death Carnival are notoriously low,
      but there is no shortage of volunteers willing to risk their lives for just
      one taste of real flavor. And whether these contestants should prevail or be
      crushed, whether they feast or splatter, it is to the cheers of millions who
      watch from around the globe. <br><br>For in addition to food, participation
      in the games grants instant celebrity status. Contestants are adored by the
      masses and approached by mega corporations in search of the most skilled candidates
      for sponsorship. And so order is kept in a flavorless world, by those who fight
      for feast and fame, and by those who watch them. <br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/827210/extras/conceptart-b.gif?t=1598363785"
