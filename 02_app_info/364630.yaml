    review: "I had this in my library for almost a year before I eventually got around\
      \ to playing it, and I'm really glad I did. I have 3 RTS games in VR including\
      \ this one and although it's not my favourite (Brass Tactics in case you were\
      \ wondering) it is definitely a close second. \n\nThe visuals have a bit of\
      \ a Command & Conquer vibe and the ability to control the Airmech to switch\
      \ from RTS to action gameplay is a really cool feature. I'm sure that RTS purists\
      \ will probably say that the game lacks the deep strategy of pancake RTS games,\
      \ but for me this is just right. Think of it as Arcade Strategy and you won't\
      \ be disappointed.\n\n"
