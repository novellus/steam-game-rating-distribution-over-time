    about_the_game: "<i>Rebel Cops</i> is a spin-off game from <i>This Is the Police</i>,\
      \ which exclusively focuses on the series' turned-based tactical operations.\
      \ Lead a ragtag squad of cops in rebellion against their town's new criminal\
      \ power to see how long you can hold out when you're constantly short on supplies\
      \ and a single shot can cost a cop their life.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/extras/GIF_01.gif?t=1569480233\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You\u2019re not exactly the police, but you're the\
      \ only ones on the side of justice</h2>Viktor Zuev, a sadistic crime boss new\
      \ on the scene, has quickly taken the town of Ripton by the throat. The community's\
      \ leaders and local police have surrendered to his will. A master of intimidation\
      \ and blackmail, Zuev has seized every major business in town, all of which\
      \ he now controls as his own private fiefdom. An outlaw band of renegade cops\
      \ refuses to bow, however. With little hope of success, they fight on \u2014\
      \ for justice, and the soul of their town.<br> <br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/extras/GIF_02.gif?t=1569480233\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gunfights are thrilling, but stealth is key</h2>You're\
      \ fighting a guerilla war, out-manned and out-gunned. Use concealment and cover,\
      \ approach the enemy quietly, and take them down before they can raise the alarm.\
      \ You have at your disposal an arsenal of non-lethal weapons and equipment,\
      \ as well as special tactical perks which you can unlock as you upgrade your\
      \ rebels. True, sometimes violence seems inevitable, but when the time comes,\
      \ don't hesitate: neither you nor the criminals have health bars. When someone\
      \ is shot, they'll bleed out quickly, and getting a bullet in the head means\
      \ instant death.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/extras/GIF_03.gif?t=1569480233\"\

      \ Cops </i>features not only compact operations where you need to fight for\
      \ every inch of ground, but also large, open locations to explore \u2014 the\
      \ sandbox levels. Search each room, crack open safes and vaults, try to get\
      \ into inaccessible areas \u2014 and, above all, grab everything that looks\
      \ useful. Stay together and proceed with caution, or accept the risks, fan-out,\
      \ and try to explore every corner.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/extras/GIF_04.gif?t=1569480233\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Take the high road, or the low road</h2>Zuev's mercilessness\
      \ is the key to his power. Can you defeat him without playing by his rules?\
      \ Will you answer the needs of the desperate townspeople, even if it means putting\
      \ the whole operation at risk? Will you spare civilian guards who are only doing\
      \ their jobs? Some say that in war, you have to do whatever it takes to survive,\
      \ but remember: reputation is more valuable than money. Bad blood on the streets\
      \ can easily put your good name in the mud. Merchants will refuse to do business\
      \ with you, and even some of your own people might turn their backs on you.\

    short_description: Lead a ragtag squad of cops in rebellion against their town's
      new criminal power and see how long you can hold out in this unforgiving turn-based
      spin-off game from This Is the Police. You'll be desperately short on supplies,
      and a single shot can cost a cop their life.
