She looked like an ice-cold snowflake and indifferently floated into Fujiwara Hiro’s heart. It seemed like a romantic beginning.<br><br>Miyazawa Moe looked pretty and had outstanding grades, but was very cold and detached. Her classmates did not welcome her, and did not develop close relationships with her. However, her talent and beauty touched Fujiwara Hiro, whose family had already been broken. Furthermore, she also seemed to regard Fujiwara Hiro as someone unique. He couldn’t help but feel moved by Miyazawa Moe, but it was just that when he tried to get close to her, he found that it was really too difficult to get close to this girl. <br><br>At the same time, Fukihara Reika, a charming girl with a warmhearted smile, also had a chance encounter with Fujiwara Hiro.         <br><br>She was outgoing and magnanimous, had a warm personality, and was also a bit bizarre, which gave Fujiwara Hiro a feeling he had never previously experienced. Fujiwara Hiro was obviously attracted to Miyazawa Moe, while Fukihara Reika’s vitality and uninhibited personality as well as her enthusiasm may have caused other people to see her as stubborn and unyielding. However, Fujiwara Hiro thought that Fukihara Reika was just like an angel opening up her wings in front of him. Fukihara Reika’s warmth and radiance sparked enthusiasm and hope within Fujiwara Hiro, who seemed to treat others with kindness, but actually was afraid of interacting with others. Fukihara Reika was too enticing for him.

However, on the inside, she was weak and lacked self-confidence.

She decided to abandon her desire for Fujiwara Hiro, and gave up her love for him that was not meant to succeed. <br><br>Romantic Journey:<br>Liked Fujiwara Hiro, so she envied and hated Miyazawa Moe.

She was the class leader before Miyazawa Moe arrived. She ran in an election against Miyazawa Moe, but the teacher preferred Miyazawa Moe because she had better grades. However, Miyazawa Moe had no interest in being the class leader, and chose to decline this position. This humiliated and embarrassed Nakiri Sayori. <br>Personality: She knew very little about herself because of her overwhelming support. She panicked when someone who was pretty and had good grades arrived at the school. At the same time, because Miyazawa Moe’s arrival made Tenjin Tatsuhiko feel uncomfortable, Nakiri Sayori felt enmity towards Miyazawa Moe. However, she never personally acted against Miyazawa Moe, but had Ozasa Megumi and Naito Amane cause trouble for Miyazawa Moe on her behalf. <br><br>Character Introduction: <br>She had a firm and magnanimous personality, was pretty and had excellent grades. The entire school also chose her as their campus beauty, and people at her school always supported her. <br><br>Romantic Journey:<br>Liked Tenjin Tatsuhiko, but was never brave enough to express her feelings to him. <br>When Miyazawa Moe arrived, she was vastly different from Nakiri Sayori. This made Nakiri Sayori instantly recognize her self-identity, which was something that she was unwilling to admit. Nakiri Sayori was devoted to being better than Miyazawa Moe, but later had to accept the fact that Miyazawa Moe would always be better than herself. <br><br><strong>Fujiwara Hiro<\/strong><br>CV: 矢田元基（Yada Motoki）<br>Age: 18<br>Horoscope: Capricorn <br>Birthdate: December 27<br>Height: 176cm<br>Class: Year 3 Group A<br><br>Character Image: Short black hair, well-proportioned body.

When Fujiwara Hiro was in primary school, he earned very good grades in his Culture class. However, after his father had an affair, his parents started an intense argument, which was when the young Fujiwara Hiro witnessed his parents’ relationship breaking apart. He discovered the ugly side of humanity, after which he found it difficult to believe in emotions, and was also no longer dedicated to his studies. <br>After his parents divorced, he lived with his mother, who influenced him due to her resentment for his father. As a result, he was afraid of and hated becoming someone like his father, and was also afraid of his mother’s hateful glare due to him disappointing her. Therefore, even if girls sent him love letters, he never responded to them and was not skilled at building relationships with other people. <br>He seemed like an optimistic person, but was not diligent about anything, and actually felt that he was very inferior to others. Due to his hesitation, he could not make decisions, and liked to avoid responsibility. <br>His only true friend was Tenjin Tatsuhiko.<br>Fujiwara Hiro was skilled at long-distance running, high jump, swimming, and shot put. At his school’s track meets, he easily broke school records in sprinting events. He liked basketball, but because his mother hated it, he abandoned his opportunity to play on the school’s basketball team. Many girls liked him, and every day, they sent him all kinds of love letters and snacks. He was gentle and a meticulous thinker, and could also closely observe others’ emotional changes as well as non-emotional changes. After observing others, he adjusted his habits. In addition, he tried his best to not cause conflicts with others, as he was afraid that arguing with them would cause him to recoil, and also liked being someone who tried to never offend anyone. Although people liked him, he actually was not good at dealing with girls. Emotionally, he was a very conscientious and meticulous person. <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1185680\/extras\/天神介绍ensteam.png?t=1603180360\" \/><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1185680\/extras\/妈妈介绍en2steam.png?t=1603180360\" \/><br><br><strong>Irie Kenji<\/strong><br>CV: 水野健介（Mizuno Kensuke）<br>Identity: Fujiwara Hiro’s father, Fukihara Reika’s stepfather<br>Age: 40<br>Occupation: Film Producer<br><br>Character Description:<br>Several years ago, Irie Kenji wanted to have a romantic life with Fujiwara Kayoko.

However, on the inside, she was weak and lacked self-confidence.

She was the class leader before Miyazawa Moe arrived. She ran in an election against Miyazawa Moe, but the teacher preferred Miyazawa Moe because she had better grades. However, Miyazawa Moe had no interest in being the class leader, and chose to decline this position. This humiliated and embarrassed Nakiri Sayori. <br>Personality: She knew very little about herself because of her overwhelming support. She panicked when someone who was pretty and had good grades arrived at the school. At the same time, because Miyazawa Moe’s arrival made Tenjin Tatsuhiko feel uncomfortable, Nakiri Sayori felt enmity towards Miyazawa Moe. However, she never personally acted against Miyazawa Moe, but had Ozasa Megumi and Naito Amane cause trouble for Miyazawa Moe on her behalf. <br><br>Character Introduction: <br>She had a firm and magnanimous personality, was pretty and had excellent grades. The entire school also chose her as their campus beauty, and people at her school always supported her. <br><br>Romantic Journey:<br>Liked Tenjin Tatsuhiko, but was never brave enough to express her feelings to him. <br>When Miyazawa Moe arrived, she was vastly different from Nakiri Sayori.

He discovered the ugly side of humanity, after which he found it difficult to believe in emotions, and was also no longer dedicated to his studies. <br>After his parents divorced, he lived with his mother, who influenced him due to her resentment for his father. As a result, he was afraid of and hated becoming someone like his father, and was also afraid of his mother’s hateful glare due to him disappointing her. Therefore, even if girls sent him love letters, he never responded to them and was not skilled at building relationships with other people. <br>He seemed like an optimistic person, but was not diligent about anything, and actually felt that he was very inferior to others.
