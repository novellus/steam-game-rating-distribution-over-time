The idea of limited moves makes planning crucial and execution harder with every level, but never TOO difficult. Pacing of new game elements make it so the game stays fresh, but never overwhelming. \n\nBravo!","timestamp_created":1526096687,"timestamp_updated":1526096687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+e2cqeMCe/yWoAE="}
