I was only able to start it one time, now, i have only a black screen. What i saw was not very good, a standard unity game. The game beginns with a cheap intro, and a little talk with an allied (only text). He mentioned something about that i shall go to a point on the map, but i did not find any key to look at the map. I found some generic enemies shooting at me, generic desert landscape and generic houses. I made a video, look below, but after not finding the map-key, i stopped the recording (wanted to look in the tutorial video in the menu, but it was only the trailer). After that, i was not able to start the game again, nothing works, so i have only a little bit of game footage. I show it to you because there are no other videos in the moment. I can not recommend the game.\n\n\nGameplay of the first minutes:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSm0muonXJg\n","timestamp_created":1485200887,"timestamp_updated":1485200887,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61139225959777832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4zeG35tkCe6SrcA=="}
