(already own the hard copy)\n\n\nCon: (Hope the following points will be fixed later... 16-07-2020)\n\n- In the whole book there are boxes from a missing fonts\n\n- There are allot of bullet-points  with no link in the table of contents \n\n- Clan bane is not drag and drop and you can't copy the text so need to type it yourself...\n\n\n\nThis is the first time i'm doubting to recommend it... Sure it is a great book with a lot of info and the artwork is stunning. Only would say, wait for the fix of the first to con points. \n\nI't feels a bit rushed","timestamp_created":1594915884,"timestamp_updated":1594915884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.712380707263946533","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvqGZrPMCf43YlQI="}
