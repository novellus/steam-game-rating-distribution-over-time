    review: 'This is a really huge amount of artworks and stuff.

      If you can buy it during a sale: It''s totally worth it.

      Especially if you are interested in the development.

      I wanted to support the developers, so I bought it.

      And I''m definitely going to leave a positive review.

      I enjoyed this game and everything it had to offer.'
