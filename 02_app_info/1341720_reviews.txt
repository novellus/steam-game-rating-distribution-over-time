The reason I bought the game (and created the Steam account) was the feeling it aroused in me when I remembered the good times I had as a child playing \"Adventure\" with my friends. However, the first impression with Alt254 was not as satisfactory as I expected, perhaps because I was looking for something similar to the experience lived with one of my favorite video games.\nFor some reason I kept playing and, despite a few moments of frustration and having found some minor bugs, I managed to complete the game ... twice. Now I have seen a new update, but I don't think I will play a 3rd time again to see the changes. What I am clear about is that it is a game that deserves a chance (sometimes it makes you want to quit) and that it may become one of those hidden gems that every player should enjoy! Congrats to the team!\n","timestamp_created":1604092138,"timestamp_updated":1604092138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529411792755126953","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwofLVvfUCdL6TqwI="}
