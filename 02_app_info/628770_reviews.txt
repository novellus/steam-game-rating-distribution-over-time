The discussion group is so out of date that no one responds to my questions.  I've found some wikis (whatever those are) but can't ask my specific questions.  I guess otherwise I'd recommend the game.  Maybe it just requires a younger player.","timestamp_created":1609880444,"timestamp_updated":1609880444,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479452043771743774","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxsOW6vYCe9vowAI="}
