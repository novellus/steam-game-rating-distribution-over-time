It's not terribly long or difficult but it's also not upsettingly short or easy. If you want some nice puzzles in a beautiful environment, then this game is well worth picking up.","timestamp_created":1589994899,"timestamp_updated":1589994899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ445jFmfICdu+IiQI="}
