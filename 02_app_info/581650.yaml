    review: "Length: Short (2-10hrs)\nAvg read: 35-45 mins per route (3 main routes)\n\
      Type: Otome\nDescription:\nAs one final vacation before their second-to-the-last\
      \ college semester ends, 20-year-old graduating student Cara Lee and her friends\
      \ decide to go to a rest house up in the mountains. However, along the way,\
      \ a minor landslide knocks her unconscious, and when she wakes up, she finds\
      \ herself alone in a dark and scary forest. Looking for shelter, she finds a\
      \ strange and haunted-looking mansion looming up ahead. Is there really more\
      \ to the mansion that it seems, or will Cara Lee uncover something sinister\
      \ about the house and its inhabitants?\n\nOverall Thoughts: Short little romance\
      \ released for halloween. The second half of the all the routes felt rushed\
      \ to myself. \nViktors route is way shorter compared to the other two, but feels\
      \ like the True End for the story. \nWasn't for me as I'm enjoying Rising Angels\
      \ and once on a Windswept night, which are on steam for Free Romance options.\
      \ \n\n5/10 Decent"
