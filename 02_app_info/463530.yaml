    about_the_game: <i>&quot;Your queen has set up home beneath a rotting log. She
      is fat, and vulnerable.  Her first brood will need to move quickly if the colony
      is to survive. Their priority now is to find food, and there is plenty around;
      but there are other hungry creatures in the undergrowth. The workers will need
      to be vigilant.&quot;</i><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/463530/extras/pagesnippet.png?t=1609782245"

      of unique DNA-harvesting ants as they work to assimilate the desirable traits
      of their foes. You can upgrade them by playing one-off missions, sometimes with
      your home colony and sometimes with other ant species.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Carve
