    developer_response: Thanks Xionwalker for your review. We are glad you enjoyed
      the game and found it funny! We are currently working to create and add new
      levels and experiences and have some great things planned for the next couple
      of months. As an early access game, we are relying heavily on the community
      so thank you for your feedback and ideas.

    review: 'Interesting idea, just needs something else. Maybe story missions. However,
      I do this kind of thing for a living and can play a similar game at work and
      get paid for it. It was kind of fun at first, especially with some of the humor.
      I kinda hoped for something like portal I guess.


      I still recommend it, just not for factory workers. :P'
