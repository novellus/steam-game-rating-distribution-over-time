Joking aside, some of the shots are quite unforgiving unless you are very accurate or you figure out the timing. There is a flipper at the top which can feel quite underused. The layout isn't perfect, but it ticks all the boxes.\n\nThe undersea theme is represented very well by the sound effects and the updated graphics look very good indeed.\n\nOverall, it's a good table for a seasoned player and also fun for the unseasoned. It's one of my favourites on Zaccaria, or any other pinball platform on Steam.","timestamp_created":1547764668,"timestamp_updated":1590398293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.697122812271118164","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wILIpfICcMPMuAE="}
