A witch is cursing a kingdom, and all sorts of dark things are happening… and then suddenly, you are pulled into that medieval land by a magician, who tells you that you are their only hope. And if you wish to return to your time, you’ll have to defeat the witch. Nice…\n\nHO scenes are challenging, minigames fun, and the plot is… adequate. Would suggest getting in the bundle.","timestamp_created":1570586287,"timestamp_updated":1570586287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uZuP1+0CfsLk0wE="}
