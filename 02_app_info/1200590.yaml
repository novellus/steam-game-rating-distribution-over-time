    about_the_game: "The Sword is a 2D action game for one player reminiscent of the\
      \ Gameboy era.<br />\r\nYou play as a Beggar who is led through the forest by\
      \ a mysterious voice and arrives at the base of an old tower. The voice speaks\
      \ of the tower being trapped in a nightmare and commands that you enter its\
      \ perilous halls and slay the 1,000 beasts that infest it.<br />\r\nGameplay\
      \ is straightforward and focuses on engaging beasts in swiftly-executed combat,\
      \ navigating hazardous areas of various effects called Terrain, and doing both\
      \ in tandem in an &quot;obstacle course&quot; style of ever-increasing difficulty.\
      \ Another focus is on the acquisition of magical Orbs that grant new abilities,\
      \ and the collection of equipment from difficult yet optional Lairs which makes\
      \ the slaying of beasts and navigation of Terrain easier. <br />\r\nThe player's\
      \ progress is saved at the beginning of every new floor, and the use of gamepads\
      \ is supported."
