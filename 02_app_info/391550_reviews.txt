Eats a lot of computer power\n2. talking heads really think the player dumb. after doing somthing for the3rd time dont need a head telling me how to redo it.\n3. talking heads eat a lot of ram\n4. the middle up button doesnt work game restarts by itsself in a few seconds. would be nice to have it work give you time for a break water bathroom what ever. Broke it down just like talking heads. Most people would know what the break is for\n5. needs a hud or something to help find the attackers. Clicking c and using the scanner is very hard to find them . A hud radar would allow you to see them coming no need for talking heads. \n6. 2nd suit needs a better gun or the missle should stay online till you run out then refill\n7. you get killed running after the energy globes make them come to you I have had to restart game twice because of getting stuck getting the globes of energy.\n8. 4 human will kill you faster than you can shoot them. humans are much to hard to kill. \n9. why does some water kill you and other water you can wade thru either it kills you or it doesnt. and if it kills you give the humans squirt guns instead of rifles. Talking about the area toward beginning when you shoot down the trailer held by the crane. you cant explore cause the water kills you. \n10.Im guessing the GRU HAS A LOT OF Satilites so maube use these to get overhead view insted of talking heads. or send the missles down insted of them to stop working when you ned them. Shows missles on bottom rt corner I always show more when I run out.\n11. 2nd Mech takes to long to shoot. them red line look cool but they get you killed.\n12. garnades would be fun have the humans leave a few around. \n13. what good is a sniper rifle at 500 yds if you cant use a scope or your mech eyes cant zoom the sniper area could have been great . but no zoom and while the human are killing you. and you them the little energy balls lay 400 yds out so all in all you need to take the fight to them to get rehealed. plus no way to return their medicen if you have to stand in the window to shoot ccause your rifle doesnt go over the top and shoots the wall in front of you. sam for you missle by comming out of the top back of the mech they hit the ceiling and walls around you. \n14 very enjoyable but computer really slows down when you use talking heads or shows incoming. the little warning signs would be enough.\n15 really do love it so far cant wait to see where you go. \n\nIf your reading this to figure out if you want to buy or not. Id say buy the game. it arena fighting, plus followwing a script but once you get past the script its great.","timestamp_created":1472667624,"timestamp_updated":1526489177,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509331762790679932","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4uov2tOMCe6e0YA=="}
