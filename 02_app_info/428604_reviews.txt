This is excellent, however, and the missile-zip motion and ever-so-brief invulnerability work well as both tactical battle options and escape techniques for more new gameplay.\n\nI enjoyed this, it's not much of a review but I wanted to recommend.\n\nPlease please please add the DLC ships to CS mode, even if they're only available once a level has been completed with a Darius ship.\n\nBorder Down DLC would be fantastic. Unless you're done after producing the dozens of packs already available (thanks for these, I'm slowly making my way through them).","timestamp_created":1490994305,"timestamp_updated":1490994305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593719899654388428","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/vKLk9sCeqHddQ=="}
