This is such a GEM, it's nuts! The music is addicting and so soulful and relaxing, the graphics with the color scheme is on point! The missions, the goals that you need to do in the game are so fun and addicting and easy enough to get the hang of each little mini game. There is dialogue between each character , you are the main character, the main character (you) meet a lot of other people, and you start flying your kite and playing mini games to advance. Each mini game is creative, fun, and different. The game runs smooth and is a really good fun friendly time to be had..the music slightly nostalgic of mario kart, and that is a beautiful thing. Just really happy I found this game, and it's so ODD to see no reviews really...glad the one out of two people who left a review got a lot of likes...but anyways, get this game, you WILL NOT REGRET IT. Good job to the devs, you guys seriously knocked this out of the park!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1588043395,"timestamp_updated":1588456929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476544022560119629","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47qba6/ECe7L+gwI="}
