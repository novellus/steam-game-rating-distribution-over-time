    review: "This beautiful and kinetic composition delivers, encompassing an array\
      \ of tracks both serene and energetic.  This soundtrack really makes me believe\
      \ it fits with the older, retro-electronica era of the 80s and 90s. When coupled\
      \ with the graphics and gameplay it makes me feel like I'm playing a video game\
      \ from that same time period. To the composer: you did a stellar job with this\
      \ set, and must be so proud. \u2665"
