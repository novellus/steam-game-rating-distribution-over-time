It doesn't support modern resolutions and generally looks old and clunky.\n\nIt's kind of not what I was expecting, in that it's not much of a simulator; driving the truck doesn't feel realistic and isn't even a big part of the game. It's mostly focused on collecting garbage, taking it to the truck and then taking the bin back. Controls are unintuitive, making you press space to hop off the truck even though it feels like trying to move should do that automatically.\n\nThis is really a classic \"thumb sideways\" recommendation. I can't praise this game, but it fills a unique niche and for the price it's pretty fun. I feel like if you're looking at this, you probably know if you're interested in this kind of game or not.","timestamp_created":1593881742,"timestamp_updated":1593881742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq6mwjfMCe8rkkgI="}
