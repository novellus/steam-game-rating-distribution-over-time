I think it's a bit hardcore, but I still completed it (except for the last optional fight) with only very basic knowledge of the ruleset and crappy builds. Planning your build at least a little bit should help (particularly, in the last optional fight).\nThe story is only there to guide the action, so don't go into the game hoping for a good story. Just read the dialog when you think that you'll need it to solve a puzzle.","timestamp_created":1608654532,"timestamp_updated":1608654532,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2oXSxfYCeduavAI="}
