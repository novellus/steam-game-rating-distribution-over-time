    review: 'Ozapell Mystery Text Adventure (OMTA) is a text adventure with an interesting
      concept that gets horribly mutilated by a crude presentation, a primitive parser,
      and bland writing. It was also coded in a clunky programming language that apparently
      made it hard to include even the most basic usability features.


      I''ve been in love with text adventures ever since the first Zork found its
      way to my C64, and whenever I see one on Steam, I really want to like it - but
      in this case, I just can''t. This is not a retro game, it''s a considerably-worse-than-retro-ever-was
      game. After the 20-30 minutes that I needed for my first playthrough, it unfortunately
      became obvious how lackluster it was in practically every single aspect.


      Where to begin? Let''s have a word about presentation first, and then I''ll
      go through the main components of a text adventure - puzzles, writing, and parser.
      Fair warning: One of my usual walls of text is following, for those who are
      interested in a detailed analysis. :)


      [b][u]1. Presentation[/u][/b]

      This isn''t the most important aspect of a text-based game, nor is it terribly
      difficult to get right, but OMTA manages to botch it up. The text is in all-caps
      in a crude fixed-width font, and limited to 40 characters per line, which looks
      ridiculous on a large monitor. While excessive use of caps _did_ occur in many
      adventure games of the 80s (especially those of poorer quality), it''s worth
      noting that even the venerable Zork had lowercase letters, and almost all of
      them used a more readable font. Simply using the operating system''s display
      functions, or one of the popular text adventure interpreters like Frotz or Lectrote,
      would have provided a much better display. The problem here seems to be that
      OMTA was written in a crude and clunky programming language called "Ozapell
      Basic", which is stuck with a 40-character line length and that terrible font.


      [b][u]2. Puzzles[/u][/b]

      In theory, the idea of a murder mystery with randomized culprits and clues is
      intriguing. In practice, it requires a lot of work to get right. Sadly, OMTA
      is very far from turning this interesting concept into an engaging experience.
      Its structure is very simple: The same seven clue items are randomly distributed
      among in-game furniture objects, with no discernible reason as to why you would
      find them at that location. Each clue item always provides the same information,
      but includes the names of different suspects each game. So while you technically
      have a "new" case each time you start the game, in practice you''re just doing
      the exact same things with the exact same objects, you just arrive at a different
      name at the end. The game''s replayability value is therefore low, other games
      use smarter and more intricate methods of randomization.


      [b][u]3. Writing[/u][/b]

      The game''s writing is incredibly dry, matter-of-factly, and on-the-nose. The
      style is approximate to the level of a 10-year-old who has learned to convey
      information, but has not yet understood how to create an experience for the
      reader. Aesthetically, the game''s terse one-liners are as bare as texts in
      an instruction manual or dictionary.


      I really don''t like to dish out such hard criticism about a game whose genre
      I like, but what else can you say when the entire description of the bedroom
      is "A room for sleeping", the entire description of the kitchen is "The kitchen
      is where food is prepared and cooked" (oh really?), and so on? Compared to the
      literary quality of actual 80s adventures from Infocom or Magnetic Scrolls,
      or hundreds of excellent free games that the IF community has written, this
      is just painful.


      [b][u]4. Parser[/u][/b]

      OMTA''s parser understands two-object commands like "give (object) to (person)",
      as well as phrasal verbs, and in that way it''s actually more sophisticated
      than the more primitive 80s adventures like, say, Alligata''s "Aztec Tomb".
      That said, the parsers of other 80s adventures like Melbourne House''s "The
      Hobbit" or literally every Infocom game ever released were much more powerful.


      What kills the parser of OMTA, is its failure to provide even the most basic
      quality-of-life features that were already present in _good_ 80s adventures,
      and have become standard since then:

      [list]

      [*]No cursor movement in the input line, all you can do is type a new character
      or delete the previous one

      [*]Using "cursor up" to scroll through past inputs in order to select one and
      edit it is not possible

      [*]No use of pronouns, e.g. after entering "look under bookshelf" you can''t
      just type "look behind it", you need to type "bookshelf" again.

      [*]Similarly, "Ask Cynthia about herself" does not work, you have to resort
      to crude constructions like "Ask Cynthia about Cynthia".

      [*]Issuing multiple commands in a single line (e.g. "take coin and newspaper,
      then go north" is not possible.

      [*]When you mistyped something, e.g. "Ask Cynthia about lettr", and the game
      replies with "Ask about what?", you cannot just type "letter" or use the Infocom
      standard of "oops letter", you have to retype the entire sentence.

      [*]No "Examine" command. Instead, the game wants you to look in, look under,
      and look behind things. Since you usually have to do all three to find all the
      clue items, and the items are just placed randomly with no regard for thematic
      fit, this adds nothing to the game except tedium and repetition.

      [*]Extremely small vocabulary

      [/list]


      From the game''s description and its title screen, I got the impression that
      it was supposed to show off what can be done with Ozapell Basic. The logical
      conclusion is that Ozapell Basic is a much poorer programming language than
      those that have been used to create text adventures in the 80s. And believe
      me, many of those languages were absolutely terrible. If Ozapell cannot improve
      over something as unanimously loathed as C64 Basic, then I really have to wonder
      why it even exists.


      [b][u]5. Conclusion[/u][/b]

      I''m sorry, I really cannot recommend OMTA to anyone. I do not see an audience
      for it at all.


      As a nostalgia game, it fails because it has none of the aspects that made the
      old games good.


      As a text adventure, it fails because its writing, design, and parser are so
      much worse than literally hundreds of freely available games that it''s hard
      to find words for it.


      As a replayable randomized puzzle game, it fails because its structure is so
      simplistic and repetitive that the second playthrough becomes boring already.


      As a showcase for Ozapell Basic, it fails because it''s so much worse than other
      text adventure games that it damages that product instead of helping it. Had
      this game been written in one of the existing text adventure design languages
      like Inform, TADS, Hugo, or others, than at least its parser and presentation
      would have been much better, and the randomization would probably have been
      easier to implement and improve upon.


      If you are looking for games that actually evoke the spirit of _good_ old text
      adventures (and often even improve on those), have a look at hundreds of excellent
      free games in [url=https://www.ifarchive.org/index.html]The Interactive Fiction
      Archive[/url]. Or, if you want something that''s ready-to-use and already on
      Steam, check out Thaumistry, or Anchorhead, or classics like Eric the Unready,
      the Spellcasting 101 series, and the Zork Anthology. But not OMTA, it''s unfortunately
      not even worth its low price.'
