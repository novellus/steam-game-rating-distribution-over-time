It has desperately little to do with shooting; it has tinny annoying music in the background; once you start a level YOU CANNOT EXIT THE LEVEL AT ALL! Literally hammering all of my keys, and nope, nothing gets you out of the game once you've run out of ammo. I hit high scores constantly that didn't register; there's no intro to show you how it works. I'm annoyed I paid Â£0.79 for this - yes, pennies, but massively inconvenient and bad bad bad. \n\nDo not play this game unless you want your time wasting, and/or you are happy to never come off one screen again.","timestamp_created":1595193570,"timestamp_updated":1595193570,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrca8tPMCfM2tlgI="}
