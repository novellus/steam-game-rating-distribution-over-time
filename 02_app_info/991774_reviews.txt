This is my first Destroyer from this game. I love it, It has made grinding less of a pain in the butt. It has made the game more fun as well, which is what games are suppose to be. The decals that come with it for the Elidium Corperation are pretty neat. Since Elidium was only added about a year or two ago. Aside from this I also have the Waz'Got which is also a great DLC ship.","timestamp_created":1548140079,"timestamp_updated":1548140079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513329565525054932","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+dyVuugCddH5uAE="}
