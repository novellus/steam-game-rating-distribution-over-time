      Shark&quot; attack helicopter.  <br><br>The &quot;Black Shark&quot; is a unique
      and deadly single-seat, Russian attack helicopter that has seen combat in the
      Northern Caucasus. It combines a high performance dual rotor system with a deadly
      weapons payload of guided missiles, rockets, bombs, and a 30mm cannon. The Ka-50
      is also unique in that it has an ejection seat. Virtually every switch, button

      the Ka-50 Black Shark</h2><br><strong>Ka-50 attack helicopter design</strong><br>The
      Ka-50 helicopter is a high performance combat helicopter designed for daytime,
      good weather combat.<br><br>Extensive all-round armor installed in the cockpit
      protects the pilot against 12.7mm armor-piercing rounds and 23mm projectile
      fragments. The rotor blades are rated to withstand several hits of ground-based
      automatic weapons.<br><br>The Ka-50 is the world''s first operational helicopter
      with a rescue ejection system, which allows the pilot to escape at all altitudes
      and speeds. The K-37-800 rocket-assisted ejection system is manufactured by
      the Zvezda Research and Production Enterprise Joint Stock Company in the Moscow
      region.<br><br><strong>Weapons</strong><br>A combination of various armaments
      to a maximum weapon load of two tons can be selected according to the mission,
      including anti-tank missiles, unguided aerial rockets of different calibers,
      air-to-air missiles, guns, bombs and other weapons.<br><br>The helicopter has
      small mid-mounted wings, fitted with four underwing suspension units and wingtip
      countermeasures pods. Up to 12 Vikhr supersonic anti-tank missiles can be mounted
      on the helicopter''s two underwing external stores. The laserbeam-riding Vikhr
      missile is stated as having a target hit probability close to one, against a
      tank at a range of up to 8km, and the capability of penetrating all types of
      armor, including active armor up to 900mm thick.<br><br>The Ka-50 is armed with
      a 2A42 quick-firing 30mm gun, which has an unrestricted azimuth and elevation
      range mounting for use against airborne or ground targets. The gun is equipped
      with 460 rounds of ammunition: two types being carried, high-fragmentation and
      explosive incendiary rounds and armor-piercing rounds. The pilot selects the
      type of ammunition in flight. The weight of the ammunition is 0.39kg each round,
      the muzzle velocity is 980m/s and the range is up to 4km. The gun provides an
      angular firing accuracy of two to 4mrad.<br><br><strong>Avionics</strong><br>Flight
      systems include inertial navigation system (INS), autopilot and head-up display
      (HUD). Sensors include forward-looking optical system called the Shkval.<br><br><strong>Countermeasures</strong><br>The
      Ka-50 is fitted with flare dispensers.<br><br><strong>Engines</strong><br>The
      Ka-50 is powered by two TV3-117VMA turboshafts engines, each providing 2,200hp
      (1,660kW). The engines are placed on either side of the fuselage to enhance
      the combat survivability. The helicopter also has an auxiliary power unit (APU)
      for self-contained operation.'
