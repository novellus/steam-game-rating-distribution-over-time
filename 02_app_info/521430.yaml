    review: 'Not recommended. The core idea of the game is fine, but the implementation
      is poor.

      The developer recommends using an XBOX controller, but the right trigger of
      my XBOX controller (which is the default for switching between worlds) was not
      recognized. I had to rebind the right trigger to SPACE in order to get it to
      work. But the main issue with this game is that you cannot reliably do walljumps,
      so I got  frustrated at the first level where you have to use long series of
      walljumps to climb up between walls full of saw blades - I kept falling off
      the wall.'
