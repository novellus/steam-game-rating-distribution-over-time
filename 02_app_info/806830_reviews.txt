It plays like a mobile game. \nIt feels cold and lifeless. The animations are outrageously bad. The horses often clip through obstacles while jumping over them and, in first person camera mode, you can see the horse's rear end when jumping. \n\nThis is an empty shell of a game. Young children who love horses deserve a better game made with more care and with a real story. I would recommend you purchase Petz Horsez 2 instead.","timestamp_created":1609605724,"timestamp_updated":1609605724,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9sb+4fYCetfjvwI="}
