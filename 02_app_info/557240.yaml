      \ in a god-knows-where galaxy. As a &quot;regional spiritual director&quot;\
      \ your task, given to you by the Powers That Be, is to develop two prime planes\
      \ of \u201Cunreal estate\u201D - heaven and hell - simultaneously. Keep the\

      \ the dearly departed arrive in droves. Keep them in your afterlife and you\
      \ flourish. Lose too many along the way and it may mean a visit from the Four\
      \ Surfers of the Apocalypso (not a good time). Factor in a half-dozen or so\

    review: "I downloaded this game for nostalgia. I always remembered it being really\
      \ difficult and near impossible to manage. Well, I remembered correctly. I love\
      \ the graphics, the humor, and the idea/concept of this game but I just can't\
      \ win. I can't win even on the easiest mode. \nPersonally, the commuting and\
      \ importing angels and demons is a pain. I can't get enough to STAY, even after\
      \ adjusting the planet's beliefs and toying with the collages entry percentages.\
      \ It wouldn't be so bad if every building had to have it's own efficiency between\
      \ imported and local workers. I can fix it with the Micro Manager thing but\
      \ for way too much money. It should be a convenience, not a hassle to use.\n\
      \nWhile I really want to recommend this game, I can't. It's not even that it\
      \ is dated, but more that there is TOO much to manage even in the beginning.\
      \ Nothing gets easier or better and there is no reward for trying. \n\nIf you\
      \ like true impossible odds, go ahead and get it. Otherwise, you'll get a laugh\
      \ or three out of this game but that's about it.\n\nI think the game itself\
      \ needs a lesson on how to be \"balanced.\""
