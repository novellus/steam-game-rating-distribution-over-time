    short_description: When Valve launched Early Access in 2013, we hoped to give
      developers and customers a new framework for designing a game directly alongside
      customer feedback. But there are a bunch of risks and challenges associated
      with Early Access, and our panelists will address the ups and downs of Early
      Access.
