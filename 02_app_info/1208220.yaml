      /><br><br>I'm a 15 year old solo developer from Sweden, and this is my passion
      project I've been working on for about 1.5 years. It's a very personal game,
      with almost every tiny detail having its own little story to tell. I hope you'll
      enjoy it as much as I've enjoyed creating it :)
