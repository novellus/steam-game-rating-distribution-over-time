But after more hours of play, im sad to see it is completely RNG based (as opposed to skill / wits based), unbalanced, and very poorly implemented.\n\nYou have tons of stats like damage & defence types, but almost never the tools (weapons shield types) to exploit them. What you get is 100% RNG based. For example, you face enemies succeptible to say beam weaons, but oops! RNG decided there are no beam weapons available. And this happens most of the time.\n\nYou are tasked missions that (again, based on RNG) will probably be IMPOSSIBLE to complete. And i do mean Impossible! Like destroy things that are in a room that is about to collapse, except weapons fire Damages the room! so how do you complete it without blowing up the room? oops! \"RNG\" dint favor you this time. Start the whole camaign over!\n\nThat, plus a TON of UI / QOL \"little\" annoyances that become unbearable over time. E.g. you cant sort your crew members the way you want (yep, even THAT is RNG). So its impossible to say 1 and 2 are soldiers, 3 is hacker, 4 is shields, etc. Add to that that on every campaign the game assigns different Pictures to your team (you guessed it! RNG!) and its impossible to become acustomed to a team.\nAnd many other \"little nuances\" like that, wich add up to suck all the fun out of the game.\nGet Duskers instead. Its a very similar game, but FAR superior in every way, plus the devs of Duskers DO know how to implement RNG properly on a game.","timestamp_created":1608122310,"timestamp_updated":1608286610,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538222730159759521","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpcTWuvYCcJnYugI="}
