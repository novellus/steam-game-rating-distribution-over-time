    review: 'I brought this game before any other reviews so I thought that I would
      be the first. The gameplay is dull at best and more feels like a flash game
      than something on steam. The only input to the game is the left click mouse
      button so you don''t really feel engaged. To sum up I wouldn''t buy this game
      because there are similar games on mobile / flash.


      TLDR : Mobile port with no special gameplay.'
