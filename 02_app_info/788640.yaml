    review: "The game's old price tag was ridiculous \n$9.99 however feels more reasonable\
      \ but not what it is \nGranted I got this for much MUCH cheaper than that as\
      \ it was in a bundle, but it feels right-ish for it even though I still think\
      \ it should go lower.\n\nThough the game suffers from a lot of flaws\n\nThis\
      \ is clearly a mobile port, it is so clear that you can instantly see it if\
      \ you pay attention \n\nThe game dont have Early access tag on store page anymore\
      \ ....why is it when I open the game I get \"welcome to early access version\
      \ of dungeon stars\" ??  really I think the devs gave up on this completely\
      \ \n\nThere are issues where no music playing in certain places, bugs where\
      \ items equipped in the wrong slot, unable to unequip something must replace\
      \ it with something else, transitioning from screen to another feels stutter-ish\
      \ \n\n\nThe game itself ?  its fun actually \nYou can attack, block, charge\
      \ attack\nPress Z  X  C to use 3 spells \nEach character has different spells\
      \ \nYou can switch between 3 characters while fighting monsters which is cool\
      \ \nDesign looks great, graphics are pretty, gameplay and animations are great\n\
      \n\nSo I am recommending this game if you get it cheap, I am talking $4.99 or\
      \ so for the lack of achievements ...maybe cheaper who knows \n\n\nOverall a\
      \ fun game that feels like an unfinished product, with some unpolished aspects,\
      \ fun gameplay and controls, lack of achievements is expected from a mobile\
      \ port\n\n[h1]Recommeded Only at 80% sales or so[/h1]"
