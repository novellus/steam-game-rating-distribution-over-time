    review: Calvin Tucker is the best game ever made. You can play as pig toad chicken
      or even goat! This is a racer where you can play up to like 4 levels in 18 different
      racvve. One of my favorite is farm h.q where you go through a bvarn and a funny
      hay ball can fall haha. And then there is another level and its in farm h.q
      and it go backwards haha. and ther is another level where you play at farm hg.q
      but goal in different spot and even that one goi backwards haha.
