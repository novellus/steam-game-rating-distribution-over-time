You decide to visit a mall which is dying and the owner of the mall wants you to help her assemble a calendar with the girls working at the mall in the hopes of saving it.\n\nThe story is pretty much identical to the first game, where you try to save a dying business by taking photos. It's fine for what it is and it does what it sets out to do, but again it's nothing special. Writing is again pretty cheesy, but I still enjoyed the story somewhat, not to mention the crazy cliffhanger ending.\n\nHowever I will say the cliffhanger ending is really disappointing since there's basically no chance of a Foto Flash 3 because the dev has gone quiet since the release of this game, I would definitely buy a Foto Flash 3, but it's unlikely to ever happen.\n\nGraphics:\n\nOne thing that I really liked about the first game is the bright and colorful art style of the world. It was an absolute joy to explore the world, which is why I'm so disappointed about the sequels choice of ditching a bright and colorful world into a drab and bland shopping mall.\n\nThe mall itself just looks boring, all of it mostly looks the same, with white tiles and mall stuff like benches and trash cans scattered everywhere. It's really boring and kind of depressing to explore, not to mention since most of it looks the same, it's kind of difficult to find your footing. \n\nI will say the design for the girls is just as good as the first one, so there's at least one positive, but everything else is an absolute downgrade.\n\nAudio:\n\nThe music is also not as good as the first one, it's just okay at best. Since you're stuck indoors at a mall, there's not really much ambience, just music that sounds like it's coming from the malls speakers, which was a cool touch, but other than that it was just sort of disappointing. \n\nGameplay:\n\nFoto Flash 2 is almost identical in gameplay to the first one. There's 10 girls and to get their photos you have to do a favor for them to get their photo. The puzzles this time are around much easier than the first one and actually in some instances even worse. \n\nOne of the worst additions was the arcade games you have to play to get a photo of one the girls. There's three games and you have to get a high score in each of them and the controls of them are horrendous. Because of the insanely stiff controls they are super difficult to play and give the game a massive difficulty spike. \n\nThe slippery controls return and due to the malls design it's easy to get stuck in very tight corners and when you get to the box pushing puzzle, it really becomes annoying. I think the game is much easier overall and also much smaller in size.\n\nVerdict:\n\nFoto Flash 2 is a really disappointing sequel and a downgrade to the first game in every way. I still had a fun time playing, but I can't deny that I didn't have as much as fun as I did with the first one. It's also much shorter than the first one, just roughly an hour, but the developers even warned about this on the store page so I don't mind that much. The game also has more bugs than the first and more issues, but on a sale I can still recommend this one. \n\nFinal Rating:\n6/10\n\nPros:\n+ The art of the girls is really good\n+ Some decent puzzles\n\nCons:\n- The Mall is a terrible location\n- The slippery controls are even worse here\n- Those arcade games\n\nIf you liked the review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews","timestamp_created":1608046601,"timestamp_updated":1608046601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578347325325012207","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4svzCs/YCffS7ugI="}
