If you don't play the style the developers *want* you to play (spoiler: [spoiler] Play a mission multiple times without going back to the main menu, in a game which doesn't have a save game mechanic and crashes every now and then. [/spoiler]), you have no chance of advancing in the campaign. You have no chance of even *recognizing* why you don't have a chance of advancing in the campaign.\n\nDeliberately done worst game design decision possible. Strictly avoid.","timestamp_created":1596886852,"timestamp_updated":1596886852,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmvT35vMCfqWWmgI="}
