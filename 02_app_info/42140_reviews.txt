I like the concept and this could have been a fantastic little game but there are numerous issues with it.\n\n1. The game crashes..A LOT.  Expect to crash to desktop at least every other level.  Plus side is that the levels are short and getting back to where it crashed is only a few minutes, at least early on, but it gets really annoying really quick.\n2. Controls are terrible.  The controls for Hamilton are fine, WASD to move and space to open doors but when you have to use the bird...oh boy, it is supposed to mouse click and move but its AI gets stuck on literally everything.  You will click to move it to a lever and it smashes its face into a wall for 2-3 minutes before warping to the lever.\n3. Building on number 2 here, after a few hours of playing I don't even know how to make the bird do things.  Apparently it can taunt enemies.  Instructions say middle mouse button but when I click it nothing happens.  Instructions say it can teleport, which is listed as a key called \"extra__1\".  No idea what this key is on my keyboard or mouse.  Also in some videos I have watched to get hints when I got stuck, they seem to take control of the bird and fly it around taunting enemies out of the way.  Nothing in the tutorial or even searching online tells me how to control the bird in this manner, I can only make it hover over Hamilton and it is limited to the screen centered on Hamilton.\n4. Some of the levels are extremely complex even early on.  Normally I have no problem with this and enjoy things on the more difficult side but it is very unforgiving.  As in if you step one step off of the optimal (and only) solution path three tiles before the exit you are left with no choice but to restart the whole level as reaching the exit becomes impossible.\n\nIn summary, avoid this.  There are plenty of better options to occupy your time.","timestamp_created":1608741769,"timestamp_updated":1608741769,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48umeyPYCeIvDvAI="}
