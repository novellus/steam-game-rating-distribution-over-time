    review: 'It''s an indie project and has to be evaluated as that. Full price looks
      a bit excesive because the game is not polished enough and still contains several
      bugs and achievements that can''t be unlocked. I highly recommend to buy it
      on sale except if you want to help indie developers.


      The game is extremely simple and fun. The story is compelling enough to keep
      you going. Like reading "the crazy adventures of..." kinda book. It''s interesting
      to see personal projects like this come to reality.


      However, if graphics are very important to you then this is not your game.


      I, overall, enjoyed it quite a lot. That''s why I recommend it.'
