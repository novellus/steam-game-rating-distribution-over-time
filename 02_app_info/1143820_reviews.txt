The story comes together in this much better. The \"Ghost Fleet\" mechanic is a welcome change of pace in you typical fleet planning strategy. The new ships did not really have an impact for me, but they offer cool new features. \n\nThis DLC is worth picking up, especially on sale.","timestamp_created":1609406179,"timestamp_updated":1609406179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ466yF3PYCfLOGvwI="}
