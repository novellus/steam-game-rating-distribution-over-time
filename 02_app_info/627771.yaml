    review: 'This was one of those anime that I will be honest I had no clue what
      to expect when going into it. ( I knew nothing about it. Impulse buy.. Yea I
      know.. )


      Due to a error on steam''s description ( that I knew was not right when I looked
      at it ) I am going to provide a link to a site that actually has the correct
      synopsis for the anime and not for the wrong one. ( Since this is not Bloodivores
      and I know that is bound to cause some confusion. I hope this error on the store
      page gets fixed soon. I will edit out this link and this little message about
      the reason why it was put here when I notice the fix on the storepage. )

      https://myanimelist.net/anime/33421/Hitori_no_Shita__The_Outcast

      Now that is out of the way. Back to my.. "review" if you call it that. ( As
      with my other anime reviews I will am staying away from spoilers as best as
      possible.. Perhaps to the point of not giving enough info and I am sorry for
      that. That is something I might change at a later date when doing this stuff.
      )


      Do I regret it? No.

      While I did enjoy the anime I will say that it does need a lot more episodes.
      With what is currently available for the anime its just not enough and ends
      without a real ending. Sure you find out a few things but that just opens up
      more questions. ( and some of those questions where really the same as they
      where at the beginning. )


      Considering how new the anime is, there is still of course the possibility of
      more seasons and I hope they do come. As this anime has really made me interested
      in it by the end of the first season.


      All that said while I will still recommend this anime. As what IS there is still
      good. In its current state as a unfinished anime.. Well its hard to say how
      good it really will be later on if it does get continued. ( and if I find out
      that it wont. I will adjust this review depending. )


      So as long as you are prepared for what I have stated you should be fine...
      Another note I find interesting is that, some real life things are being used
      in this and I quite like it. Liberties are being made of course but thats how
      this sort of thing goes anyways.


      Now to go into my normal thing about the steam player and crunchyroll. Steam
      video player needs work. It has a few issues and of course like with one of
      my reviews thus far. Due to the video portion being supplied by Crunchyroll.
      It is sadly censored. That said its only one scene ( far as I can tell/remember
      ) that is censored and its the normal and "mysterious" sunrays or white rays
      of light in just the right spots to block our sensitive eyes. However it is
      just one scene, in one episode, and it really is a minor thing in this regard.
      So take it for what you will.'
