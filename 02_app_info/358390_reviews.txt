What you do get is a competent 2D shooter with colorful graphics, tight controls, fun enemies to mess around with, and a kickin' soundtrack by Lee Jackson himself, which flows quite nicely with the action. Not to mention, the game is free, so there's not much to complain about.\n\nGive it a shot. You don't have much to lose.","timestamp_created":1568573320,"timestamp_updated":1568573320,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtK2Qm+0CcNmm0gE="}
