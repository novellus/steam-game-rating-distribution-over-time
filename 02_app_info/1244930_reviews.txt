Although the story is contained for the most part within one town, the many areas and constant excitement make it feel like a vast world ripe for exploring. There are constant twists and turns, and I found myself often wondering which direction different choices would lead. I have now finished the game twice and had two quite different experiences- they are plenty of ways to go through this game.\n\nI don't have many downsides to speak of- although romance is most definitely not the focus of this game. There are only 3 choices, romantic moments seems few and far between, and it was surprisingly easy to jump in/out of a romantic pairing accidentally. Sometimes comforting a friend is simply a nice gesture, but other times it ends up in bed with one another- oops! \n\nIn the entire game I only spotted a handful of spelling/grammatical errors- truly impressive for a piece this size. There were a few inconsistencies where a choice or situation I hadn't been in was referenced, but these were also few and far between.\n\nThe main goal of saving the town is not overly easy to achieve, and there are plenty of ways to fail. But it is also not a challenging game that leaves the player frustrated. It is a wonderful mix of challenge and success and leaves the player ready and excited for another play-through when the credits roll.\n\nAll-in-all a delightful story and a highly recommended game!","timestamp_created":1609340051,"timestamp_updated":1609340051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502380967140197754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ444uJ2vYCdvzlvgI="}
