It is essentially a combination of Civilization and Total War, though not as good as either. I encountered a few problems with the controls (UI elements being unresponsive to the mouse, mainly, though the camera controls in the battle sequences are awful), and the AI is not good (dumb as dirt on the overworld, always reacts the same in battles, etc.). Still, despite these shortcomings, I feel like this is a pretty okay game, especially if you grab it during a sale. I love 4X games, so I am willing to overlook some flaws, and I like the random worlds/factions and fantasy themes/races a lot. If you are not so much a fan of strategy games, this game will not change your opinion. I recommend it to others who like the genre.","timestamp_created":1577928391,"timestamp_updated":1577928464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6LL3se8CcvuL6QE="}
