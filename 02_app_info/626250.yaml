    about_the_game: "Inspired by both the original CONSORTIUM and old-school sci-fi\
      \ first-person shooters, Consortium: The Tower is a role-playing experience\
      \ with an unparalleled degree of player freedom.\u200B<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/626250/extras/TowerRoof.jpg?t=1580500574\"\

      \ here at iDGi have invented a satellite capable of opening a rift through time\
      \ and space. Travel with us through this rift to the year 2042, and take first-person\
      \ control of Consortium agent Bishop Six on his first official mission. The\
      \ result is a highly unique, fourth-wall shattering role-playing experience\
      \ where you essentially play YOURSELF in full control of another human being.<br><br>While\
      \ the game presents you with a seemingly straightforward mission to rescue hostages,\
      \ you have complete freedom to approach all situations as you see fit. Decisions\
      \ are remembered, and can drastically change the outcome of the story. Follow\
      \ the Consortium mandate and work with your team to accomplish their goals,\
      \ choose to work directly against them, even fully joining the other side, or\
      \ skirt the line and play both sides for as long as you can. Both sides have\
      \ their own truths, and it\u2019s your job to sort them out and decide for yourself\
      \ who to believe and why. In the middle are a host of characters from all sides\
      \ of the conflict, each complete with hundreds of lines of dialogue, as well\
      \ as interconnected backstories and motivations.<br><br>We aim for Consortium:\
      \ The Tower to become the ultimate sci-fi action immersive simulation.  Absolutely\
      \ everything in this game has a narrative or world-building explanation behind\
      \ it, including all of the game mechanics. In other words our goal from the\
      \ very beginning was to ensure there are no \u201Cgamey\u201D elements, allowing\

      \ mission.<br><br>In the weeks prior to this incident industrial nanites, the\

      ><li>Choose to pit yourself against AI driven mercenaries and soldiers that\
      \ will flank you, take cover and have a genuine sense of self-preservation -\
      \ they will surrender to you if they are clearly losing. They can also fall\
      \ unconscious, but be sure to inject them with incapacitating nanites or they\
      \ will eventually wake up and re-join the fight! <br></li><li>Battle against\
      \ a variety of deadly security turrets that are challenging to destroy<br></li><li>Utilize\
      \ SIX different weapons and a total of TEN different fire-modes with differing\
      \ tactical value. Your equipment will take damage from incoming fire, so you\u2019\
      ll have to deploy repair nanites to keep your gear in working order.<br></li><li>Multiple\
      \ lethal and non-lethal solutions to resolving combat. If you want to avoid\
      \ being kicked from the Consortium, you\u2019ll need to try for non-lethal solutions\
      \ when you can. <br></li><li>Learn to switch between the Freefall Suit and Battle\
      \ Utility Suit, and understand the pros and cons to each.<br></li><li>Deep and\
      \ realistic player damage system. Manage shields and armor to avoid taking any\
      \ damage. If you let your defenses down you may start bleeding out or incur\
      \ serious organ damage, meaning you\u2019ll have to deploy expensive medical\
      \ nanites to stay alive.   </li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/626250/extras/Explore.jpg?t=1580500574\"\

      \ to expand the scope of the environment in the future:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"\

      \ the engineering system to upgrade your gear\u2019s acoustics and become a\
      \ truly silent prowler!<br></li><li>Use the Tactical View to see potential combatants\

      \ up behind combatants and use your Taser to take them down without drawing\
      \ the attention of their squadmates.<br></li><li>Find and use the Stealth Shield\
      \ node to make yourself completely invisible to pass in front of turrets and\
      \ enemies with ease. Beware that you will still make sound, which can be mitigated\

    review: "When a game is in early access, one knows the experience might be a bit\
      \ rough. But surely the developer would only release a game that is playable,\
      \ right? Well, that's debatable here.\n\nThe game is as exciting as the first\
      \ one, if not more. We are given a much bigger world, and with that comes more\
      \ freedom, more discoveries, more dialogues, more mysteries... The thing is,\
      \ it's harder than ever to find a way to the objectives on the map. There is\
      \ just no obvious way to get where I need to get. On top of that, I might get\
      \ distracted when I find secondary objectives. On paper, they're great and exciting,\
      \ until I realise I can't quite figure out how to complete them either.\n\n\
      When you combine that with the bugs and quirks and the fact you can't save at\
      \ any time, anywhere, you are left with a frustrating experience. You see, I\
      \ don't feel like I'm ever guided in the right, or one of the right directions.\
      \ Maybe there has been a bug and I'm not supposed to be here. Or I've accessed\
      \ an area which I was clearly not supposed to access given how utterly empty\
      \ it looks. On top of that, when I explore vents or pipes, I can get killed\
      \ very, very easily because of one misstep. And because I can't save all that\
      \ often, I end up loosing quite a bit of progress. This doesn't encourage me\
      \ to take risks and explore the world. \n\nWorse yet, I don't understand the\
      \ enemies. They seem to get upset by the fact I'm walking around them, as I'm\
      \ exploring the tower and picking up supplies. This further reinforces my feeling\
      \ of \"am I not supposed to be here?\" and makes me feel more and more lost\
      \ as time goes on. You do get a map that is revealed as you go along... but\
      \ how do I know if I'm going in the right direction? Also, why, oh why, does\
      \ it have to get wiped every time I start a new game? At least keep the save\
      \ spheres I've found on there!\n\nThe game isn't missing much to be enjoyable.\
      \ 1: more explanations, guides, or tips so that I can complete objectives. 2:\
      \ exploration must be easier. This could be done with a save history, and by\
      \ keeping the map revealed across saves, so that I can literally go down rabbit\
      \ holes and explore the world without having to fear bugs or being killed because\
      \ of a small misstep. Unfortunately though, the game hasn't changed all that\
      \ much since I bought it almost two years ago..."
