    review: "I bought this game because I wanted a peaceful and nice game to relax\
      \ to, and this game surely is that, if you want to relax and just pet sheep\
      \ I would go for this game. I still don't think it was worth it though, because\
      \ if all I'm going to be doing is petting sheep for 4 dollars (bought it on\
      \ discount) I can surely do that in real life. There is many things that needs\
      \ to be fixed, I only played the game for 15 minutes and it was enough time\
      \ for me to know that this was not worth my purchase. This game is in early\
      \ access, so I will not refund this game until they can do some simple bug fixes/patches.\
      \ I'll be going through some things I found out.\n\n-If you walk far enough\
      \ there will be an invisible ramp that you can just follow endlessly and until\
      \ you fall. Towards the mountains.\n-I can walk straight through some of the\
      \ rocks and trees.\n-There wasn't an invisible wall at one side of the map and\
      \ I fell straight through.\n-One of the sheep facts was quite disturbing, saying\
      \ that sheep intestines or something was needed to make a tennis racket.\n-I\
      \ can't teleport when I enable the teleport option in settings. For some reason\
      \ I can only teleport when there is no trees near me. If I go anywhere near\
      \ a tree my teleport button will just float inside of my hand and go no where.\n\
      -I went to settings, sitting was enabled and I clicked standing because I was\
      \ standing at the moment, and when I clicked it the UI was glitched and for\
      \ some reason it was somewhere where it wasn't actually, finding it difficult\
      \ to fix.\n\nThis game is still in early access, and I hope they can get something\
      \ out of my review and do some patches. I would also like it if the game were\
      \ a bit more realistic, because this reminds me of a free online game that I\
      \ would download and play normally on desktop. \n\nedit- considering how the\
      \ developers of the game reached out to me and are fixing the game and patching\
      \ bugs and working hard to make this game as best as it can be, i will be recommending\
      \ this game. if you dont want to buy it right now then dont. the game is very\
      \ very early access and is very buggy, but in the future will more and likely\
      \ be fixed, if you want to buy the game then, then you will have to wait a while\
      \ so the developers can patch up everything."
