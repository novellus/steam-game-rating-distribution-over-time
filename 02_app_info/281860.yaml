    review: 'Nice shield mechanic, reflecting all white bullets, hence the name RefleX.
      If the reflected bullet hit the enemies, there will be multipliers for scoring.
      Gameplay looks fun. Good music too.


      One minor issue is that the game doesn''t recognize Xbox controller, so you
      have to turn off Xbox controller support in the Steam setting.


      Edit:


      I revisited this game after amassing a lot of credits to see the ending. This
      game gives extra credit every game over. And wow, this game is just so good!


      [Spoiler Alert]


      [spoiler]

      Stage 1 & 2 is what I would expect from an indie game, but then came Stage 3.
      This stage is what I would want if a game company ever want to make a Star Wars
      shmup featuring a Starfighter fighting a fleet of Star Destroyer. That was a
      blast to play.


      Due to the mechanic of the reflector shield, some instance force you to play
      like Ikaruga due to how they design the enemies and the bullets. Really great
      gameplay and satisfying to pull off.


      There is also a boss fight (?) where there are like 5 or 7 ships and they just
      send 2 by 2 to fight you while the rest just observe from far away. That was
      badass.


      Last boss fight. Oh my god! That was just over the top, it''s so insane! After
      you fight for awhile, then came the ''wing'' moment. That was so epic! I really
      got goosebumps witnessing that. My jaw just drop opened trying to finish the
      fight.

      [/spoiler]


      The whole gameplay is like 40+ minutes so it''s like two loops of normal shmup.
      Really really fun to play even with credit feeding. I really recommend people
      to play this blindly towards the end.'
