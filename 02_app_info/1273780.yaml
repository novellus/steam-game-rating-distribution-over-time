    review: "I was skeptical about all the positive reviews, but this ended up being\
      \ a neat set of games(mostly). \n\nThe first game was very art house with looping\
      \ hallways. I always judge looping hallways harder than I do other tropes because\
      \ lots of people do them. I liked this one. It felt pretentious in the beginning,\
      \ but the longer I stayed, the more it grew on me. The ending was a nice cherry\
      \ on top and it had me sashaying away feeling satiated. Well done. :)\n\nThe\
      \ second game wasn't too scary. It was more...unsettling. The kind of beast\
      \ that pries open your jaws and gets deep inside. I won't say too much because\
      \ I don't want to spoil the story, but I didn't really care for the combat at\
      \ the end. It was a little janky-- I managed to get through after 3 tries. \n\
      \nThe third game I gave up on because I had to sift through a gajillion frequencies\
      \ on a radio and I got bored with it pretty quickly because the stuff I managed\
      \ to pick up wasn't scary. This is probably a personal preference thing. :P\n\
      \nThe Peekaboo Collection is fairly priced at $2.99. Give it a whirl if you're\
      \ a fan of creepypasta or artsy indie projects. :)"
