      \ protects its wearer from one direction."

    review: 'Shield- A good substitue to bubble, but not usefull against illuminate
      confusion

      Barb wire- Great in retaliatory strikes, or when defending objectives. Can annoy
      a lot of people though

      AT-47 (nicknamed ''Office chair'') Recently its got nerfed so it takes damage
      when firing at things point blank, soo its not as good as it used to be, but
      thats no issue if you have a friend to cram a medig... uhm, rep-80 up your backside
      24/7

      Makes a lot of things pretty braindead'
