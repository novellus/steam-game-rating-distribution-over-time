As for me, it would be more nice to see ingame graphics closer to those arts.\nOr even 3d. As what we can see in community.\n\nThe puzzles are quite fun. \nDialogs are okay and fun sometimes.\n(Bug report on 2020.12.29: In some moments thre looks like there are lost audio and quite long pause before dialog starts.\nI played English version.)\nThere is difference between what main charater says and what is written in dialog options. \nHowever, there in not much outcome in what you choose to say. Maybe some hints on what to do.\n\nCharacters look promising and charismatic (their arts, too). But their story lines are hollow and shallow.\n\nThere are a lot of unfinished story lines and stuff can be seen here and there in the game.\nThe story about \"escape from school and not getting caught for that\" yells to be just introduction but turns out to be main story. Unfortunately, all other stories around are not developed enough. Even story with band is quite broken in its final.\nThe theme of aliens and saving the world is a decoration mostly. Those creatures just appear in a couple of moments as some surreal trip and then dissappear with no big reason and logic. \n\nThe ending is abrupt. I expected to be second chapter here. Where the story of aliens would be told...\nAnd third chapter where they truly save the worldand as a by product main character befiend with rock-girl and bass player... But nope.\nObviously, scenario was patched and shortcutted to jump to final.\nSeems like the intentions and ambitions were quite bigger but this was not put into action due to deadline and/or lack of funding.\n\nAs to indie developer I respect those good intentions and efforts.\nBut final product was quite dissapointing for me just because It promissed more,\n\nAs a resume I'd say if you like quest puzzles and some fun then this game is ok. \nBut do not expect very deep and developed story here.","timestamp_created":1609247383,"timestamp_updated":1609247383,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43cun1/YCc/S3vgI="}
