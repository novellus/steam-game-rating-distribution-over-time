Not as many puzzles, more story board games you just click on to progress. Which I don't find that much fun when in large quantity like they were. Even though they progress the story, they took the place of true puzzles. HOPs were pretty good though. Going to recommend it more based on the story than anything else.\nWorked Great in Linux without a hitch. Didn't even have to resort to Proton.","timestamp_created":1609096401,"timestamp_updated":1609096401,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4htLn0vYCeqnsvQI="}
