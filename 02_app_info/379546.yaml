      \ enables you to customize numerous aspects of your aircraft\u2019s behaviour,\
      \ from the level of turbulence and drag rumble experienced in different flying\
      \ conditions to the amount of tyre screech on touchdown. The name Accu-Feel\
      \ was chosen because this best described what this product does.You can even\
      \ control how well or poorly maintained the aircraft sounds! Accu-Feel comes\
      \ with an easy-to-use user interface enabling you to fine-tune your preferences\
      \ in the air, on the ground and at sea. From the volume of wind noise caused\
      \ by opening a cockpit window to the amount of drag experienced when landing\

      \ was to add the Accu-Sim experience to core FSX aircraft, and this has been\
      \ achieved with Accu-Feel. Accu-Feel enhances the FSX:Steam Edition flying experience\

    review: "It was awesome when it was working but after month of normal use it suddently\
      \ stoped wrking, now i'm stuck with this problem and without money.\nIf you\
      \ are gonna buy it go to to the A2A store and buy it. NEVER ON STEAM! \nPD:\
      \ sorry about my english.\n\nEDIT: FOUND A SOLUTION!!!! \nIn the same folder\
      \ that fsx.cfg is located you will probably find the \"dll.xml.a2a\"\nfile ,\
      \ backup the \"dll.xml\" file and delete it, next rename the \"dll.xml.a2a\"\
      \ file to \"dll.xml\"\nand that should solve the problem! ;)\n\nBtw, I recomed\
      \ you to make a copy of the \"dll.xml.a2a\" file if you have the same problem\
      \ in the future. :)"
