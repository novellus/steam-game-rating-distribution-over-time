You can accomplish that in 2 ways - trading goods in the marketplace, or collecting bounties on pirates. The game doesn't really care which you choose, and you're not locked in to either pathway either - you could do both (simultaneously) if you want to.\n\nMe personally, I found the trading to be boring. It's more or the less the same mechanic you find in other RPG's, but with less polish. Fair enough, this game is significantly older than most of these RPG's I'm talking about, but it doesn't change how I feel about it. The trading game loop is as follows - sail to a town, see their prices, consider whether to buy or sell, then go to the next town and repeat. Not my cup of tea, but it works as far as I can see.\n\nInstead, I chose to play as solely a bounty hunter. The gameloop is as follows.\n\n* Accept a bounty request for a specific pirate (you may run into other pirates besides your bounty)\n* Find the bounty pirate by travelling between the towns they were last seen in\n* Beat the bounty pirate\n* Make it home alive to accept your bounty\n* Repair your ships and buy whatever upgrades you can afford\n\nIn my old review, I said this loop was fun, but a little chance based. I now have to rescind that statement - once you get more than 100 million of the in-game currency, bounties become EXTREMELY chance based. Basically, if one of the locations that the pirate is traveling between doesn't have a ship repair shop, then it becomes borderline impossible to fight them and survive. Let's say you travel to location A that does not have a repair shop. You find and beat the pirate along the way, but you are at very low health when you arrive at location A. You now have to go to location B (to repair your ships at B's repair shop) and pray that you don't run into any pirates on the way. And there's no definitive way to avoid them - the game just rolls the dice and decides whether or not to have a pirate encounter. So like I said, chance based. Save-scumming will be a necessary tactic in your arsenal.\n\nOne other flaw I should point out - late game means that there will be a LOT of enemies on the screen. There may be so many that the marker that identifies them (and allows you to choose which enemy to attack) might be covered up by other enemies. As a result, it becomes a literal pixel hunt if you still want to strategize on which opponents to target. Me personally, I just gave up and clicked fire all. Trying to click on individual pixels just drags fights on, so it's not worth the effort anymore. Thankfully, my fleet is strong enough that I can afford to just click fight all.\n\nBut all that said, you can sort of deal with all of the above by just running from all fights except for your bounty. Annoyingly enough though, the only time the game encourages you to flee is in the beginning where fleeing would actually be a bad idea. I guess once you get a fleet of strong ships, you are able to flee much easier. Regardless, fleeing isn't that much fun, and ironicallu, fleeing is ALSO chance based.\n\nStill, if you limit your travel to locations that DO have boat repair shops, you will eventually reach your goal. Thanks to the flee option, battles don't have to be slow. And when I say slow, I mean compared to the pace before reaching 100 million in-game currency. This game is actually incredibly fast-paced. I can accept, capture, and cash in about 1 or 2 whole bounties in under a minute. Currently at 200 million, and each bounty is usually worth a 100 thousand minimum. At this point I've got an hour or 2 of playtime left until I win. That said, it has started to become repetitive.\n\nAll in all, it's a matter of whether or not you care about the above mentioned flaws. I bought this game as a package bundle, so 3 games total for $4.99. In that respect, I would recommend it, but for anything more expensive, just don't bother. Plus, if anything I criticized above is something that would bother you, then definitely don't buy this, since the game kind of revolves around these mechanics. But I'm dealing with it well enough because the game is surprisingly fast paced, so you can approach end game rather quickly. Frankly, if it wasn't for the speed of this game, I would have dropped it once things got unbalanced.","timestamp_created":1608444732,"timestamp_updated":1609702916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+qfx5PYCddjQuwI="}
