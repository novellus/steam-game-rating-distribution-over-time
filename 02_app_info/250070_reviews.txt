Having finally played the full version now, I'd say it's about what I expected, for better or worse.\n\nFor the most part the game controls fine, but there were a couple things that confused me a bit, like extending on platforms like seesaws giving you way more aerial momentum than normal, or how air streams reversed your rolling controls. Controlling the sides of the square does get extremely confusing in faster paced sections.\n\nWhich leads me to level design. The difficulty was a bit all over the place and a couple levels were so precise that I felt luck played a pretty big part when I finally finished them. Outside of the two or three levels like that, most of the levels I played were pretty decent. I don't see myself coming back to the game to try the other routes, but it's cool to see there are multiple paths for added variety.\n\nThe music was cool too.\n\nI'd say it's worth checking out, but if you're only interested in just a single playthrough, then waiting for a sale may be the best choice.","timestamp_created":1605399604,"timestamp_updated":1605399604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsr3R5PUCdOy2rgI="}
