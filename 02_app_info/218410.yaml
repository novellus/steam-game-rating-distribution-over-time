    about_the_game: 'Defender''s Quest is a Tower-Defense/RPG Hybrid (Think Final
      Fantasy Tactics meets Tower Defense). It focuses on three things: tactical depth,
      customization, and story.  That means no random encounters, no spikey-haired
      emo kids, no forced time sinks, and no tedious, repetitive battles.<br><br>The
      battle system builds off of tower defense, with individual characters taking
      the place of towers.  Each character levels-up, learns skills, and equips gear
      individually, allowing the player to customize their battle experience and strategy.  The
      overall game structure is similar to &quot;tactical&quot; RPG''s, but with a
      real-time battle system.  Game speed is adjustable, and commands can even be
      issued while the game is paused.<br><br>It also features an engaging, character-driven
      story written by an actual English major! The story strives to be fast-paced,
      snappy, and always relevant to gameplay with minimal exposition. Finally, it''s
      got options and accessibility settings out the wazoo, so that you can have the
      best possible experience!<br><br>---------<br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.defendersquest.com/1/?page=eula"

    review: 'This little gem is way better than I anticipated. Don''t be folled like
      I was by the preview screenshots; this is a very solid and fun game.


      Defender''s Quest is a tower defense game with a fantasy spin: the "towers"
      are heroes and there''s a meta progression where they level up and you can spend
      skill points to focus each hero on a specific role, as well as equiping weapons
      and armor on them.


      The game is very polished and it has lots of quality of life features. It has
      a surprising amount of maps and challenges to replay. There''s a surprisingly
      big amount of content packed in here with extra difficulties for each battle,
      different skill builds, bonus challenges and an entire new game+ which all togheter
      lead to a whole lot of replayability.


      Also it''s very well designed the fact that it is up to the players to decide
      how much of the grind they wish to engage with, so you''re not forced to grind
      if you don''t want to and can complete the game easily. But if you wish, you
      can grind to get better gear, money and experience. I generally dislike grind
      so it was a pleasant surprise to discover that not only the grind is opitional,
      the grind that is there is actually quite fun and rewarding!


      It''s funny because I''m not even that much into tower defense games but this
      one is honestly amazing and fun so I''m highly recommending this game even at
      fulll price!'
