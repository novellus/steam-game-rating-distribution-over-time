    review: "This game is a gem, plain and simple. It's made for a very narrow spectrum\
      \ of gamers though, you'll probably know if it's for you by just looking at\
      \ the screenshots and reading the description, but I encourage everyone who\
      \ is even a little intrigued or who enjoys relaxing sandbox style games to give\
      \ this game a shot. Everything you see and read about it is what you'll get\
      \ when you buy this game. Nothing more, nothing less. If you bought this game\
      \ and don't like it, it's because you didn't pay attention or had unfounded\
      \ and unrealistic expectations.\n\nI'll briefly summarize the features:\n[list]\n\
      [*]You run a shop (duh). There are dozens of products you can buy, craft, grow\
      \ and sell. I've unlocked ~ 60 products while only focusing on two \"specializations\"\
      \ (more on that in a bit), but I know there are at least a few more I'm close\
      \ to unlocking in my chosen areas alone.\n[*]You may farm, albeit in a simplified\
      \ manner. There are many crops you can grow which can be sold as they are in\
      \ a sort of Farmers market or used in cooking to expand what you sell (or you\
      \ can choose to only sell the food you make as well, nothing wrong with that).\n\
      [*]There are half a dozen or so other \"Crafting Stations\" used in Cooking,\
      \ Farming, Smithing/Forging, Alchemy, and Tailoring you can use to specialize\
      \ your shop, or you can ignore crafting altogether and just \"buy low, sell\
      \ high,\" serving as the middle man.\n[*]You can build and expand your shop\
      \ in a surprisingly large number of ways for virtually endless variation. You\
      \ can have a large, open facility filled with aisles of cabinets/shelves like\
      \ modern supermarkets or cozy, smaller rooms with wooden tables separated by\
      \ archways, doors, and windows. You can have shelves lined with goods hanging\
      \ on the walls or you can hang paintings/wall art for more aesthetic appeal.\
      \ You can even build what basically amounts to an outdoor market, with stalls\
      \ and carts and fences replacing cabinets, tables and walls.\n[*]You may choose\
      \ to specialize in a certain category (Farmer, Cook, Tailor, Alchemist, etc),\
      \ which the shoppers will, after a few days, adapt to and only those shoppers\
      \ interested in your chosen specialty will shop at your store. If you would\
      \ prefer being a general goods store you may specialize in two, three or ALL\
      \ of the categories, though keeping that variety on hand ready to sell may prove\
      \ challenging.\n[*]There are different seasons and events in the game that affect\
      \ pricing of goods and number of shoppers\n[*]Finally, the basic gameplay loop\
      \ goes like this: Buy/craft goods > Organize your shop (shelves, tables, cabinet\
      \ locations, decor) > display your merchandise how you see fit > open the shop\
      \ for the day >  monitor inventory levels throughout the day and restock when\
      \ necessary > respond to customers when they overlook a product they're looking\
      \ for/need something you don't have displayed > close, prepare for the next\
      \ day, expand your shop and repeat\n[/list]\n\nNow a little more on specializations.\
      \ \n\nMy first shop went like this: I bought a bunch of random goods to sell\
      \ to people, not knowing exactly what I wanted to do or even what I could do\
      \ yet. I set up tables, shelves, etc around the small room and sold to everyone\
      \ whatever I could get my hands on at a good price. This is where specializing\
      \ (or not) can help (or bite you in the backside)... \n\nWhen you display a\
      \ large variety of goods, customers expect that variety every time they shop\
      \ there. When you lack something a shopper desires, they go to your desk and\
      \ request that good. If you wish, you may \"special order\" it right then and\
      \ there and a merchant will bring it to you, but you'll make very little profit\
      \ on these types of sales. If they leave without the good, they are dissatisfied\
      \ by their experience. I faced this for some time before I decided to become\
      \ a grocer. I purchased fruit and vegetables in bulk, stopped buying potions,\
      \ smith supplies, clothes and firewood and began telling people no when they\
      \ wished to order things I no longer wished to carry. They only asked about\
      \ those types of goods for another day or two after I stopped selling them.\
      \ They learn quickly what you carry and what you do not (you don't go to the\
      \ hardware store to buy milk and bread, do you?) and I stopped getting orders\
      \ for things I stopped carrying. Customers ONLY come in this shop to purchase\
      \ my produce. By the end of the season I was growing my own crops and my customer\
      \ base was satisfied.\n\nI decided to expand a little bit and began using the\
      \ excess produce in preparing meals for customers. I lined cabinets and shelves\
      \ with potatoes, cauliflower, asparagus, apples, etc., for customers to buy\
      \ but started serving meals in a separate area, similar to a grocery store you\
      \ visit today. Customers began to purchase these prepared meals in addition\
      \ to the produce and raw materials. I carved out a satisfying niche, a sort\
      \ of grocery store/farmer's market where customers may buy prepared meals if\
      \ they wish, just the meat, fruit and vegetables used in cooking, or both.\n\
      \nThere seems to be a lot of confusion and questions about the specialization\
      \ system, so I hope this all clears it up/helps you understand. You may specialize\
      \ if you wish, into as many categories as you wish, and the game behaves incredibly\
      \ intuitively. In my example, if I suddenly stopped selling prepared foods,\
      \ customer will still ask me to sell them prepared food for a day or two but\
      \ will eventually stop. If I started selling clothes, customers may not buy\
      \ many articles of clothing for the first day, but will begin to do so as my\
      \ shop becomes \"known\" for it.\n\nI've rambled a bit more than I planned to,\
      \ suffice it to say, this is a really neat, unique game I encourage you to try\
      \ if you enjoy this type of game. You probably know if you're in that group.\
      \ If you are intrigued by it but aren't completely sure you'd like this type\
      \ of game because you've never played many simulation games or \"open-ended\"\
      \ games without a specific, linear story or goal, I encourage you to try it,\
      \ but don't expect anything it doesn't advertise. There is no action, there\
      \ is no adventure mode, there is no combat, you don't fight monsters, there\
      \ is no danger (except bankruptcy lol). You're literally running a shop.\n\n\
      If this sounds boring and you don't see the point, that's fine, you aren't the\
      \ target audience lol."
