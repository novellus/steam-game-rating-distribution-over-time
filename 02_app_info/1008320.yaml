    review: 'I gotta say this: IF the game doesn''t look like you will have fun with
      it, well... you are in for a surprise!  The game offers a variety on Hidden
      Object levels.  "How?"  Well, how about a few levels where you have to mix and
      match things for a dress of a specific color? (It is shown above, so I am not
      spoiling).  That one took me some time... Also, there are puzzles and puzzles
      with documents... so you aren''t only looking for items all the time!


      Is there a story line?  OF COURSE!  It is a murder mystery... which you "help"
      solve.  You get to go on an adventure with characters and visit the Amazon jungle!  Oh
      and yes, at some points the character models look a bit... strange, but when
      you play the game, they tend to look different.  (This isn''t a complaint, just
      pointing out to those who notice).


      The ONLY problem (yes... only) I had was with the boxes and keys puzzle, as
      the keys refused to go in, unless you are in incredibly specific spot!  Imagine
      failing 20+ times, to only realize that you had the right idea the entire time?  That
      and some items are so well hidden, that if you miss just a tiny bit... you don''t
      get the item.  Well... there is no penalty for failing... except your mouse
      pretends to be an airplane for a few seconds when you click incorrectly too
      much.


      Oh and the story works out.  I didn''t try to guess what they are ever going
      to do... because that''s the fun of it.


      Have fun, if you like these type of games!  Just don''t get mad at the "berry/mushroom"
      level... they are so tiny XD... Thank you for an enjoyable game, that did an
      interesting "questions" game at the end!  :D :> :)'
