    review: 'REX 4 is currently SOLD as addon for FSX. With FSX beta, a very nice
      update indeed, REX 4 BROKE. After contact: NO SUPPORT. Why? If you SELL stuff,
      you support it! Right? So if you are a newcomer to FSX (yes i recommend FSX),
      get it and NOT in combination with REX 4 since this is a waste of money.'
