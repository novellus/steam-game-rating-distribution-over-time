Also, in response to a forum post I made, one of the developers confirmed the game is abandoned, so nothing will ever be fixed.\n\nThe game has bugs that make it unplayable for the PC players.  Sometimes they simply can't disable a terminal. Other bugs include NPC robots that get stuck in place, walk continuously into a wall, and make the falling animation as they walk around the room. The PC player characters' arms don't reset to normal if picked up and put down by the VR player. This means the VR player can pick up robots one after another and find the one that remains deformed after put back down.\n\nGame settings reset after every level, meaning you will constantly go back into the settings menu to make them what you want. \n\nAs the VR player, I need ability to rotate the room without having to turn my head. Spinning in circles gets this headset cord all tangled. The game allows you to laterally move the map with the Grip buttons on the controller (this isn't in the tutorial, by the way), but there is no rotate feature.\n\nFinally, ignoring all the above, you can experience everything this game has to offer in only 40 minutes of play time. When the VR player wins, a map can be finished in under a minute. For the PC players to win, it takes closer to 5-10 minutes. But with only 4 levels to play, they're played very quickly. The game not only needs more levels, but also some variety! Different scenes are great for the VR player, but the levels need to actually feel different for the PC players, not merely look different. Walking up and down staircases and across walkways doesn't have to be the only layout the PC players are stuck with.\n\nThe one positive I'll leave with is that the ability to play with up to 5 players is fantastic.","timestamp_created":1609717551,"timestamp_updated":1609802082,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.587301552295684814","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7czr5/YCcPydwAI="}
