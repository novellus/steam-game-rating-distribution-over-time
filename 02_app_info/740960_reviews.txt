The store page here says the English version is under test and will be finished soon, but I can confirm that I've played the entirely of this chapter and it's all translated.  The translation is also quite well done, with only a few minor \"quirks\" that are still easily understood and don't cause any problems for the story.\n\nThis is a pretty dark chapter, story-wise, and very interesting.  I liked it better than the previous chapter.  There's also a new reasoning system that pops up a couple of times that is somewhat reminiscent of the Sherlock Holmes deduction system, which I enjoyed putting together.\n\nOverall, this is a good purchase especially if you enjoyed the base game.  It's inexpensive even at full price, has a decent length of content, and both the good and bad endings are compelling (and the bad ending is downright creepy).","timestamp_created":1601146019,"timestamp_updated":1601146019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y6vv5fQCffSgpAI="}
