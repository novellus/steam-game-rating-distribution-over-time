    review: "A neat concept with a meh execution. You travel back and forth through\
      \ time to solve puzzles. The story is simple and predictable but does its job.\
      \ The platforming is not great, but functions.\nIm not bothered by the simplicity\
      \ of the game, im bothered by the characters not having likeable personalities.\
      \ It's this \"snail is an annoying young brad and old man is cynical old man\"\
      -dynamic, but not in a way that makes either character fun. Honoustly I'd have\
      \ preferred if they had just removed the dialogue completely, it doesn't make\
      \ me care for the characters anyways. \nI got it on sale for 50 cents, I'd say\
      \ that for that money you could enjoy your 2 hours of gameplay, but I refuse\
      \ to believe that there aren't any games out there that do this same mechanic\
      \ but better."
