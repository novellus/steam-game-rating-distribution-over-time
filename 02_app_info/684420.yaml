    review: "Really can't recommend this one, a lackluster effort, sub-par and rather\
      \ bland.\nThis is a tower defense game, which is nice because not everything\
      \ advertised as one actually is, but that's about the best that can be said\
      \ for it. \nThere is no pathing, and the maps I played (about the first twelve)\
      \ were boring. \nYou get four types of units, towers, heroes, support units\
      \ and after the first few levels a giant mech that stands at the end.\nThe towers\
      \ are basic, and lack creativity. Even worse, they in no visible change when\
      \ they are upgraded. The graphics only show four directions, so it all looks\
      \ very clunky. There are few options in upgrading, and every tower type appears\
      \ to be identical when maxed.\nThe heroes are cute to look at, but really offer\
      \ very little in the way of game play, aside from the fact that you can move\
      \ them around the map.\nThe support units are the weakest, like weak heroes\
      \ that you can place, and that only exist for a short period of time before\
      \ vanishing, if they live that long.\nThe mech unit offers two tactical options,\
      \ a cannon ball, and a machine gun burst.\nThe card collection aspect of the\
      \ game is also weak. There are no choices or options, they simply incrementally\
      \ improve the matching unit or tower type. There is no combining them, they\
      \ don't play off each other in away way, they are simply a weak mechanism for\
      \ upgrading that could have easily been replaced with experience points for\
      \ all the blandness. They don't even work well and internal info contradicts\
      \ itself, in total confusion.\nAs such, the game gets very grindy early on,\
      \ as you try to build up your cards, but even this gets difficult fast as the\
      \ early levels get harder faster than your units gets stronger. \nThe shaving\
      \ cream atop the mud pie is the complete lack of personality. The game has cute\
      \ (but repetitive) art, there is no fluff connected to the heroes, the villains\
      \ or the units, and the story is nearly non-existent. (Really curious if there\
      \ is any backstory to the villainous unit that has spider legs and a baby dolls\
      \ head. We may never know,) \nI would give this one a pass, even if you found\
      \ it for free, as there is little to no fun to be had. The sad thing is it wouldn't\
      \ have taken genius to make it fun, only a little effort. Even a cookie-cutter\
      \ tower-defense game would be better if it had all the pieces."
