This game has a ton of potential to grow, and can be very prominent as a game. However, the fact that it is not original in itself compared to the actual banner saga game, and the fact that no one is able to play the game, as there is no one to play against in this multiplayer only game, makes this game a little less than promising. I would not waste time on this until the developers work on the game to increase popularity, through advertising or working on the game's content, of which it is lacking, if at all.\n\nRating: 2/10\n\nOverall Review:\n\n        Pros:\n\n                -Interesting Gameplay / Potential\n\n\n        Cons:\n\n                -Not original in any way\n\n                -Very small playerbase for a multiplayer game\n\n                -Gets boring if you have any luck finding matches","timestamp_created":1486618268,"timestamp_updated":1507775405,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540126025676727295","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vNuah98CdsHUcQ=="}
