    review: I bought this game on sale for $1.50 after completing some badges.  It's
      not a game I would normally buy, but I do enjoy mazes and even if it sucked
      it was only a buck fifty.  Depending on how fast you can complete the mazes
      you can finish all 26  within an hour or two, so take that into consideration.  The
      mazes do get larger and harder the further you go, but so far I've done 23 of
      them without much trouble.  The biggest cons to me are the fact you have to
      use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your character and the music is
      loud and annoying.  I wish you could set the options to allow you to use the
      WASD keys or your mouse to move and to have volume control for the music.  I
      would recommend buying it on sale, but if you really enjoy mazes this game could
      be for you.
