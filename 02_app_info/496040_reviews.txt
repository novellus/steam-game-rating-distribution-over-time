Only Shaq. No one else. [/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \nAn abomination of beat em ups, Shaq-Fu: A Legend Reborn quickly wears you down with attempts of humor that hit the mark once in a blue moon, and then make you wonder what the hell the writers were attempting to joke about in the next breathe. Granted, you'll get shock value out of the reveals in the game here and there, but a lot of the dialogue is cringeworthy in a bad way: the type where you feel sorry for the game and can't even laugh at it. But despite a presentation that's passable in the gameplay side of things and cutscenes that are actually well done from an art perspective, Shaq-Fu truly fails when it comes to gameplay.\n\nThe simple beat em up runs out of tricks quickly despite some early enemy variety. The game's simple combo system can't keep you entertained because it's just beating up the same types of enemies, despite minor differences, over and over again. Sure, you'll run into an enemy that you can't dash into for example, but he won't feel like he's much different from any other enemy that you face. It doesn't help that the combos are too simple and don't have any complex interactions with them, other then, beat the shit out of opponent. Even when the game tries to mix things up with a dance off section or suit gameplay, it feels hollow as it's the most boring versions of those elements and sometimes don't even match to the actions that you are doing.\n\nThe worst part about Shaq-Fu is that it wastes your time by repeating sections over and over again, especially in the last two levels of the game. Hell, the game knows this and tries to make fun of it, but ultimately proves the point when it immediately goes back to not even trying to keep things fresh. It drags and drags and drags. Yes, some people don't want a short game, even those this game can be beaten in two and a half hours. But when getting through the last hour is like getting through a CSPAN senate hearing, somethings terribly terribly wrong.\n\nThis is the kind of game where it's not even worth looking at. Sure, there's a shock factor at times and there are elements to the game that do work, but the sheer lack of fun kills the game before it can even get off the ground. There's tons of much better Beat Em Ups out there, and Shaq-Fu pulled a J.R. Smith. It didn't even show up when it was game time. \n\n[b]Video Review: [/b]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJTYePUKq4M\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Once in a while, a clever reference finds its way into the game, such as the China's overpopulation joke at the start of the game. A lot of them are hidden in the environment, definitely making it worth searching them out.\n[*] The art in the cutscenes in particular is rather well done and stands out a bit compared to other games in the genre.\n[*] Shaq's voice is iconic and does at least add something to the game.\n[*] The game definitely has a WTF element to it for those wanting that.\n[*] It has controller support? I mean, I really digging for positives here.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Too simple gameplay for the length of the game here. Within 15 minutes, you get almost 95% of what the game has to show you.\n[*] The suits (Diesel, Cactus) turn the game into a mindless bore, and don't make the game more fun.\n[*] The repetition. The repetition. The repetition. Did I get the point across about repetition? When the game makes a meta joke about the gameplay getting stale from a repetitive standpoint....and then does the same thing over again, you know something's wrong.\n[*] There seems to be missing sound assets during specific attacks, and once in a while the music seemingly just dropped off the face of the earth. \n[*] Some of the interactions with characters are off, leaving weird animations and being awkward for all.\t\n[*] The game feels slow in a lot of cases, and while the enemies match your speed for the most part, I wish the game didn't match Shaq's speed in real life. Because it's painfully slow at times.\n[*] Level Length is way too long, and drags out the game to try to get 2 and a half hours. Hm, just more then the length of refunds on Steam. I wonder why that could be. \n[*] Boss design is lazy most of the time, barely going over one or two attacks that are easy to dodge most of the time.\n[*] Reused models for “new” enemies has RUSHED written all over it\n[*] The whole last two levels and everything about them, but their attempts at meta humor in particular. They feel so......off.\n[*] Random “insta-kill” moments that your character gets actually hurts the strategy portion as like I said, it's completely random. It could put you into a dangerous situation not of your own doing, and without you feeling like you were the reason they happened, don't give any satisifaction.\n[*] The skill element of the game doesn't exist, even at hard difficulty. Or barely does, compared to fighting games of the past.\n[*] You sit there asking why a lot of the time. Why are these bodies so misshappened? Why did that insta-kill me? Why am I still playing. These are not the questions the game should be getting you to ask.\n[*] Shaq's sponsorships with things like Gold-Bond attempt to get plugged in cleverly in the game, but fall flat and make you feel like it's more interested in getting you to buy them then entertain you. \n[*] Some of the sound design gets overshadowed very quickly by the music. They don't work well together.\n[*] There are some bad textures, especially in the background.\n[*] Voice acting at times absolutely does not match the body/character that's being portrayed. Like not even in a parody way: it's downright cringe at times. \n[*] Pricing questions, but this is a less of a PC problem. Why does the game cost twice as much on the Switch for the physical version? I have no idea. \n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.
