    review: '[code]If you like [b]top-down racing[/b] games, please follow our [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/36693366/]curator
      page[/url].[/code]

      Regarding its power up system Retro Racers 2 is just a mindless rip-off of Mr
      Qwak''s Retro Racing (2012), which is actually a game you should check out (Mr
      Qwak is the same guy, who is responsible for the Amiga classic Nitro). Retro
      Racers 2 however is at best a cheap and passionless casual game to waste your
      time. As you can see in my [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEMwdelIlOI&t=593s]playthrough[/url],
      the game do not even have any collision detection between cars. It also has
      no kind of multiplayer.'
