It is designed for 4 players, but contains rules to account for smaller or bigger arty sizes.  The AP is 7 Chapters, and actually has your players play a total of 3 PC's.  Although 1 is the primary, and the other 2 are there to influence the larger world at different point.  The adventure will see your primary characters go from lvl 1 - 17.","timestamp_created":1544825189,"timestamp_updated":1544825189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qLaw1+cCd4+ptQE="}
