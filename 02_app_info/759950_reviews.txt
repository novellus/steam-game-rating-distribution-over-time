On the steam store the game looks really fun and enjoyable and it is designed to not show any of the flaws. While that is fine I dont like the case that a have spent my hard earned money on a game that looks fun on paper but in the end is just plain bad.\n\n2. While the levels I have played are different from eachother. alot of them you can just win by holding your uizuno blade (lightsaber) in a fixed location.\n\n3. the aiming of blaster weapons is horrendous. I have an oculus rift and the aiming might be better with other headsets but for rift users it will be incredibly hard to aim.\n\n4. the game has been in early acces for 3 years and no one knows when it is accually going to be released.\n\nIn conclusion the game is shallow (at best) with bad controls and not enough variation between levels.\nIf you are a rift user do NOT get this game as the controls are most likely even worse. If they at some point release a full version of this game i hope these things can be fixed. because at the core. This game has the potential to be really good.\n\n\nIN ITÂ´S CURRENT STATE NOT WORTH THE 5 BUCKS","timestamp_created":1605101202,"timestamp_updated":1605101202,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwpZXf2/UCfpvfrQI="}
