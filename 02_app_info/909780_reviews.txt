The game does not do a great job of explaining the various mechanics, and there are quite a few.  Once I figured out how to repair and recharge at maintenance stations, and purchase ammo, the game became fairly manageable, with the exception of some boss fights.  Some of the fights seemed dependent on luck and when fighting the final boss, I had a few attempts where I was fairly unlucky and died almost immediately.  This boss also included a lot of terminal interaction while avoiding the boss and other enemies, and just didn't feel great.  I think a part of the problem was simply how slow you are, even with some boost upgrades.\n\nThat being said, I did enjoy this game and would recommend it.  It is very polished and does a lot of things right.  The interactions within the pod feel great, and the menu system is really well done.  I liked that the holographic menus could be moved around dynamically.  Unfortunately, the game is too brief to utilize many of the more in depth mechanics, such as upgrades, but the game could definitely be expanded on with this groundwork.","timestamp_created":1577331423,"timestamp_updated":1577331423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48e6RoO8CdsOG5wE="}
