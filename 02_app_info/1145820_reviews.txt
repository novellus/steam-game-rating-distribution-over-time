And the ending really should have some music. Ambience works fine for the exploration and stealth stuff, but a climax really could use something a bit more exciting.","timestamp_created":1600966085,"timestamp_updated":1600966085,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mPnA4PQCcOvjowI="}
