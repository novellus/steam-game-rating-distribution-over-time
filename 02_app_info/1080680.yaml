      The army and police are disbanded, firearms are withdrawn and banned. Spy drones
      fly over the streets, collecting information about all the inhabitants. Corporations

      the main character so much</strong>. She lost her parents in the war. And did
      not make it to the frontline - the government capitulated as soon as she finished
      the training. Implanted military augments are turned off and have no power sources.
      All that remained for her was to put up with a low-paying job in the nearest
      grocery store, and wait until the occupants get out, in the hope that at least
      something will change for the better.<br><br>Yesterday she dreamed of how she
      dealt with a gang of thugs and their boss, who was driving a stolen APC with
      a machine gun, all alone. During this dream <strong>some joker remotely hacked
      her implants</strong> and turned on the increased adrenaline secretion by the
      adrenal glands. Back In the army, soldiers had the adrenaline pumped up before
      the attack - for courage. Now she can''t sleep until she lets off steam. So
      she had to get her bat out from under the bed and go out into the street, in
      the direction from where the loud music sounds, which the thugs love to listen
      to at night ...<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1080680/extras/wish_3.png?t=1609323554"

      <li> <strong> Melee</strong>. Firearms are banned in the society, bat and police

      important is always highlighted and in plain sight.<br></li><li> <strong> Use
