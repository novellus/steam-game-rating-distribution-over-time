ALL the games suffer from characters not talking, but just being exposition dumps. It's not natural, and it's very robotic at times. It really draws away from the intrigue of the game, which at its heart, is an OK military mystery sort of thing.\n\nThat and the abrupt endings. Those are the WORST. I get you want to leave it on a cliffhanger, but this just annoys more than builds interest and a desire to see more.\n\nOnly get on sale, if you HAVE to own it.","timestamp_created":1596055362,"timestamp_updated":1596055362,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.457589268684387207","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnYOUzvMCc5iomAI="}
