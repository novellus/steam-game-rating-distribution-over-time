But soon food will run out, so Steve and his two friends must find a way to escape.\n\nNow what I liked, story was good. I feel the rpg elements were used a bit better here than the main game. And there was not nighttime part that made the game hard to see.\n\nNow for the bed, really there is just two. Like the character management still annoying, and there are some bugs were you can go into the well and get stuck or you can get stuck by a zombie corpse that is in front of the door.\n\nSo with that said not a bad game a bit better then main one, so I say get this DLC if you want to buy the main game as well.","timestamp_created":1516319860,"timestamp_updated":1518549439,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489285707473754883","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4obKmyOECftG9lgE="}
