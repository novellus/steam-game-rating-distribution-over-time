    about_the_game: Paddle Master VR is a cross between a breakout-style game and
      racquetball, inspired by a popular mobile game (Ballz).   You play inside something
      like a racquetball court, but with numbered blocks that you must destroy.   You
      have a gun that you use to shoot balls at the blocks, and a paddle to keep the
      balls in play when they bounce back to you.   When your balls are all gone,
      your gun is automatically reloaded, and a new row of blocks appears, and any
      old blocks are moved closer to you.  You lose when any blocks get pushed past
      the red line marking the front of the play area.  Oh, and the balls have a tendency
      to explode... How long can you last?

    review: 'Paddle Master is an entertaining, casual title that nails the immersive
      room-scale VR feel. I quickly found myself attempting desperate, futile saves
      with my feet when I couldn''t stretch my paddle arm in time.  The challenge
      tapers a bit as you collect ammo and damage upgrades, but you can step up the
      difficulty (and fun!) at your own discretion by fielding several balls at once.


      Great game overall, and I''d especially recommend it as an accessible, affordable
      introduction to casual arcade/sports games in VR.'
