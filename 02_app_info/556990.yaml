    review: A very very boring cell phone game ported to PC. You can only move mouse,
      not your character. You stay stationary behind a barricade as a muscular ripoff
      of Freddy Mercury who wears a Hello Kitty shirt and click on enemies to get
      the same reactions with hits until they die. Over, and over, and over. It's
      the same unsatisfying thing again and again. The "story" of the game is you're
      (look a like) Freddy Mercury and a zombie stole your guitar so you travel into
      a zombie infested city and just shoot zombies. There is no challenge in any
      way shape or form. You'd have to be a toddler or using the original cell phone
      game to face any sort of challenge and that would only be because the screen
      is small and you'd be using touch not a mouse. If you want to force yourself
      through long monotonous unrewarding game play, you can unlock a few new weapons
      but I fail to see how that would make the game any more enjoyable considering
      how utterly dull it is. If I had this on cell and had a choice between playing
      this while waiting in a doctor's office or mindlessly flipping pages in Vogue,
      I'd opt for Vogue... and it wouldn't even be The Broodwich Issue.
