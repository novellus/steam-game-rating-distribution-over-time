      with 40 A, advancing enveloping Voronezh from south, is to encircle Voronezh
      and destroy the enemy Voronezh group, followed by reaching the river Don at
      Star.Semiluki, where to gain a firm foothold and capture the crossings. The
      enemy defense was based on strong support points, one of which was vlg.Gubarevo
      with adjoining garden and svfm.Opornyy punkt. The enemy concentrated heavy artillery
      and mortar batteries, using a vantage flanking position of svfm.Opornyy punkt.

    review: 'Great infantry only operation. Not too long, but enough for both sides.
      Very interesting to play from both sides, but I prefer the attacker, which is
      a real challenge.


      Worth the price. I hope to see more infantry centered ops in the future.'
