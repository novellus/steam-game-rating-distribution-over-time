It's great for local co-op and single player. Racing unlocks in-game cash which unlocks music, tracks, and new carts and designs. Runs fine with an xbox one controller on windows 10 and even it it doesnt there is xpadder and x360ce. \n\nAlso buying this game also supports Gravity Chase and other great games coming out from this small indie team! \n\n","timestamp_created":1588297758,"timestamp_updated":1588297758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.397781699895858765","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw04775vECc/PWhAI="}
