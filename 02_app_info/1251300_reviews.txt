So horrible it made me give up on playing after trying several times. And then I just felt stupid on continuing. It was very upsetting.\nIf they improved the controls I could even think about playing it again, but while nothing is changed this game is a NO for me.","timestamp_created":1610138752,"timestamp_updated":1610138752,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwPLv8fYCevfQwQI="}
