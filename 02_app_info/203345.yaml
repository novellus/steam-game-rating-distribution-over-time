    review: Of the two DLC's for JABIA this is by far the worse of the two.  The strength
      of the franchise has always been the roll playing elements and they are frankly
      non existant here.  The briefing is inadequate to say the least.  The selection
      of merc and deployment thereof seems to have been done entirely at random.  While
      it's nice they gave you extra equipment in a paradrop, putting it on top of
      a building that only 2/3rds of your mercs can get to seems insane.  The number
      of op-force solders firing rocket launchers at you is beyond absurd.  If you
      are looking for a stupid difficult scenario with a pretty map, you may like
      this.  But if there is ANY additional background information on any of these
      mercs in the game, I haven't found it.  It's great that someone tried to do
      some DLC for JABIA.  It badly needs it.  But just handing out rocket launchers
      like they were candy to the bad guys is NOT the way to make a scenario interesting.
