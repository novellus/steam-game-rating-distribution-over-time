It doesn't mes with MV graphics at all, whether you incorporate from other tile sets to match or even the character sprites.\n\nIt works great for VX Ace, however!\n\nMy advice: Only buy it if you want to use it with VX Ace. Do NOT waste your money if you only want to use with RPG Maker MV.","timestamp_created":1581629065,"timestamp_updated":1581629156,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqrWcoPACdruH8gE="}
