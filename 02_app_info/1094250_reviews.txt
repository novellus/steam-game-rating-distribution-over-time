Kudos to the developer and team. If you're a fan of macabre tech-dystopianism, weirdness, nailbiting gameplay and amazing visuals and audio- this game is for you!","timestamp_created":1608918389,"timestamp_updated":1608918389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4kMrAzfYCf4mPvQI="}
