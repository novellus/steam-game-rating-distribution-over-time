It's pure 90's cheese mixed with a heavy dose of Bladerunner.  \n\nWhen it comes to the cast, Jack Palance and Billy Drago are absolutely insane, as always.  A jaded combat trainer, Elias Koteas (the original Casey Jones), and an acrobatic kung-fu cyborg portrayed by a young Angelina Jolie make for amazing protagonists in a dark sci-fi, post-apocalyptic world.  \n\nI have owned this film on different formats from VHS to DVD, and now digital.  I purchased it on Steam just so I could write a review since I truly believe this is a 'diamond in the rough', and it needs to be seen by more people.  \n","timestamp_created":1515458169,"timestamp_updated":1515458169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ipGW7OACfbDClQE="}
