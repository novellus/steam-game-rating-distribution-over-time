    review: 'This is a fantastic campaign, especially when paired with the book.  Read
      Pierre Clostermann''s book about the missions he flew then experience them in
      DCS.


      A number of reviews are negative regarding the performance DCS not the campaign.  DCS
      is currently very CPU intensive (2.5.6) as much as it is GPU.  It is not optimized
      for VR, although that is how I prefer to experience it.  I''m getting 30-60
      FPS  except for when 70+ B-17s drop their bombs.  That brings the FPS down into
      the teens.  Eagle Dynamics is working to improve things but if you expect the
      fluidity of War Thunder, hold off.  For me, I prefer the interactive cockpits
      and more realistic flight models.'
