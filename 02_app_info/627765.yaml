    short_description: "Soran is kidnapped, and met by Chou Reigyoku. Reigyoku uses\
      \ kinkou, the techniques that Soran was taught by his father when he was little.\
      \ His kinkou is more powerful than Soran\u2019s, so Soran has no way to fight\
      \ back. At the same time, Houhou goes to save him, but Fuu Saen blocks her path."
