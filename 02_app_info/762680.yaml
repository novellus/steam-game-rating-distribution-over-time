    review: "[h1]Nice idea and design, poor realization[/h1]\nThe game can't be considered\
      \ as a finished project even if one overlooks the lack of content, because some\
      \ fundamental features don't work:\n[olist]\n  [*] AI in Practice mode doesn't\
      \ work: an NPC just stands still and meekly gets player's hits. If it's supposed\
      \ to be so, then the developer should have added several options to adjust the\
      \ NPC behavior like make it always blocking or jumping or performing a sequence\
      \ of movements.\n  [*] A player's profile disappears after closing the game,\
      \ that leads to disappearing of a gamepad custom configuration also.  Moreover,\
      \ the game doesn't allow me to create a profile with the same name again although\
      \ I don't see it and can't choose it.\n  [*] Uselessness of Grabs: you can just\
      \ spam a Strike button, because Strikes break Grabs, then you dash or run away\
      \ and spam the button again. Such the algorithm let me win the Battle Royal\
      \ mode at the first attempt and apparently works well against other players.\
      \ You'll never be in a situation where an enemy stuns you and then make a throw,\
      \ because there is a cooldown after his hits which is longer than your stun,\
      \ so it makes Grabs worthless (if the enemy uses environment that stuns you\
      \ for a longer period, you will be already on the ground, so he won't be able\
      \ to grab). To fix the issue the developer could change the rules: let a Grab\
      \ button break other's Grabs. Then a player needs a good reaction to counter\
      \ them and won't spam strikes.\n[/olist]\nFor me it's also confusing that:\n\
      [list]\n  [*] There is no character customization, although NPCs appear with\
      \ various color palettes.\n  [*] There are no regimes with ladders and tables\
      \ in Singleplayer mode, although they are presented in the local multiplayer.\n\
      [/list]\nDouble Turn has a potential and could become a good fighting, if there\
