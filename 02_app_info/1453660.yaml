      /><br>As a solo developer, this game is a work of passion on a limited budget

      goal has been to build a well rounded title for you. With this going live, my

    review: 'Way too little content for the price tag.  This game is not labeled as
      "early access" but the developer states in the credits for the game that he
      plans on adding content over time.


      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df7Gz0Vstco


      No progression except leveling up, which does nothing except make your spells
      stronger.  No classes to choose,  No races to choose.  You''re a wizard with
      five spells from the start to the end.  What is here on launch day can be completely
      beaten in under 30 minutes.  30 minutes with zero replay value is NOT worth
      $12.


      NOT RECOMMENDED as the value is way too low for what is offered.  If this game
      had 5 or 6 hours of content for the $12 asking price, I''d give it my thumbs
      up.  What is here is worth no more than $2 or $3 on launch day.


      I do like the game play and responsive controls however.  If the developer adds
      about 10x the current amount of content, I will come back and re-review this
      game and it would likely earn my thumbs up.  (Or dropping the price to about
      $1.99 would also earn my thumbs up)'
