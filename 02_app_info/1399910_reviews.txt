Strangely relaxing, but maybe that's just me!\nI enjoyed the different spells, levelling up process and the random generated maze like levels. \nA tad glitchy at times with monsters or my character getting stuck on walls. Personally that didn't bother me much, sometimes it helped me not die which is always a bonus.  \nLoved the legless wizard, I hope he gets his legs back in the future.","timestamp_created":1600634775,"timestamp_updated":1600634775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43YzR1vQCePGHowI="}
