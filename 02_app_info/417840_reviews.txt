Not very good gameplay design. None of the items you pick up have names, or description, and image of the items doesn't look like the item they represent.\nLevel/Room 9, have scrabble for some reason, cause that's something everyone played in medieval times, and that rainbow picture, it tells you all you need to know. NOT!\n\nLevel 9 scrabble solution is VIBGYOR, I don't know what language it is but it certainly isn't English. You'd think that with an intro, in English, a tutorial level, in English, that the solution word is English as well. Nope, it's Gibberish!","timestamp_created":1583182110,"timestamp_updated":1583182110,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470230013132095337","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw07vAzvACe4/h9QE="}
