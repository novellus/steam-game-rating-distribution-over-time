The game itself is relatively short and took me 6-7 hours to get through when trying to finish all the content. Although the story is dry and parts of the game is clunky and slightly unintuitive the meat of the game, the battle system, is fun and satisfying.\n\nThe battle system takes traditional tile based combat and puts a spin on it making timing as well as strategy matter. Removing the traditional turns, each move used by the player as well as enemies has a charge time as well as a cooldown, all visible on the map. This means that timing your actions allows you to and prevents enemies from dodging attacks. The game gives the player three categories to freely sort their actions (abilities, items, movement, defense) into, and only one action from each category can be performed at once. This means that you are able to bring a maximum of 12 different actions into a stage but only 3 can be used at the same time. A player may choose to attack with three different attacks at once but they will not be able to guard or evade while doing so. \n\nAll of these aspects gives the combat of Rage Quest surprising depth (as well as somewhat of a steep learning curve). The amount of unique abilities and items allow for a plethora of ways to approach each stage and good balancing helps this. Rage Quest's levels are quite difficult and do not pull any punches even at the beginning. Each encounter is tense but very rewarding to complete, especially when done by a strategy of your own devising (after perhaps failing a few times). \n\nWith almost 70 encounters throughout 4 worlds to fight through, Rage Quest provides a decent amount of content for its price.","timestamp_created":1510485233,"timestamp_updated":1510530611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481191337108612061","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48/6o2d8CcY+OiwE="}
