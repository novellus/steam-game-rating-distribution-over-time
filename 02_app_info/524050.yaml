    review: 'Honestly a pretty good game on paper, but for whatever reason it just
      wasn''t doing it for me. And I am a massive fan of this style of platformer.

      It looks great, and mechanically feels "solid".

      Has leaderboards and speedrun medals which is awesome.


      BUT


      No controller support is a big con for me, could have easily had controller
      support with right stick for aiming the grapple like "dandara".


      Also the game looks pretty nice and is well put together. But the level design,
      enemys, and bosses are incredibly generic and boring in terms of gameplay.


      This isn''t necessarily a downvote because it''s bad, it''s more that I would
      recommend probably 50+ other similiar games over this one at this price point,
      and honestly even at a heavy discount.'
