    about_the_game: We here at Ence Gaming present our first of many games we hope
      to bring to you, so why not kick it back to old school? Using the RPG Maker
      MV engine we made a turn based single-player roleplaying experience. We decided
      to use a mixture of stock images and custom imagines to make this game. Each
      boss was custom created to fit in the dungeons scattered across the in-game
      world. With the main boss created to have the big bad evil feel to it you find
      at the end of many major stories. Now as far as the music goes, we made sure
      almost all the music is custom created to fit each realm perfectly. The game
      itself features turn based combat as well, and focuses on strategy to get through
      some of the puzzle like mechanics you will find in the varied dungeons. However,
      we are not done with Elemental Echoes, and plan on releasing free downloadable
      content for the near future. Without further ado, please join Tyra, a War-Axe
      Wielding Spellslinging Half-Elf and her friends in the RPG world you grew up
      and fell in love with.<br><br><strong>Small description of story.</strong><br><br>Follow
      the story of Tyra, a War-Axe Wielding Spellslinging Half-Elf and her friends
      to discover the dark past of magic and the mysterious history of her parents.  <br><br><strong>What
      to Expect?</strong><br><br>All future DLC will be free for this game and introduce
      a continuation of the main story as well as introduce new party members for
      replay-ability of the main story and on. We will also likely be making more
      custom assets and improving the overall game with various patches and newer
      versions. We hope to also add in small back stories to some or most of the party
      members as time progresses. <br><br><br><br><strong>Feed back and about Ence
      Gaming</strong><br><br>We are a new company that is constantly working on games
      to bring to you. One thing that we could really use is constructive feedback
      for our future games. Thus we want to hear what you liked about the story, and
      what you did not like. We will never find the perfect balance between fighting
      and story, but we do want to try. Thus we will be taking a small break from
      Elemental Echoes to allow for our writer to have time in crafting more lore
      about the world and better DLC. <br><br>With that being said, we do have plans
      on making Elemental Echoes two in Unity. This time everything will be custom,
      and we will have much more freedom to bring in everything that we want to. Believe
      me, we had to leave some aspects out of Elemental Echoes out, but we plan on
      bringing much more in the future.

    review: The game seems good I am early in the game only a little over a half hour.  The
      time played showing is not the actual playing time as I left the game running
      while not playing.  During the first boss you get a loading error for audio
      that keeps popping up every few seconds and continues to do so after the battle.  After
      beating the boss it takes you to a cutscene that loads to a new town with two
      new characters, loading error still popping up and you are unable to leave the
      town to advance the game due to a glitch.  I would hold off buying the game
      till the glitches are fixed.  Too early in the game to encounter so many glitches.
