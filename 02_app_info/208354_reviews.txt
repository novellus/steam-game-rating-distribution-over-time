On lights up both the front and back sets, including ditches.\n- Horn and sander stick on if you use the in-cab controls instead of hotkeys.\n- Couplers are very stretchy. Hard braking can make multiple locos in a row clip into each other.\n\n+ Fairly nice models despite age, for both the loco and cars. Good as AI and helper engines.\n+ 90% off on sales. I would've refunded this but for $1 it's pretty okay for the cars.","timestamp_created":1584971748,"timestamp_updated":1607011912,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlPnXlPYCee2t+gE="}
