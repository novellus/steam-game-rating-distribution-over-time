The graphics are horrendous and look like 90's CGI. I bought this in 2016 and the graphics are easily beaten by every other card game here on Steam. \n2. The price is way too high as I payed $4.99 for it on sale and it was way too much. If this were .99 then I wouldn't be writing this but due to the fact they have the nerve to charge $9.99 for this is unreal\n3. The game is a lazy port of the mobile game. Spinning the crystal is proof in that of itself\n4. The game is buggy and gives no real understanding of the game as they would rather flashback to the 2 characters staring at each other and grunting during the battle.\n\nThe only positive I have for this is the fact that they tried to make something new instead of being a Hearthstone or MTG clone. Good on you guys for that!\n\nIf you all can fix those 4 things than I will remove my negative review and make it positive","timestamp_created":1483596593,"timestamp_updated":1483596593,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54051673412322998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49u7PttkCdqDdbg=="}
