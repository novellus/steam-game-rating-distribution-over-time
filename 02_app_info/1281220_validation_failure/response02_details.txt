As the overall commander, you are in charge of seeking the destruction of the enemy naval forces and preventing your opponent, the Japanese Navy, from accomplishing its objectives. To achieve your aims, you have at your disposal the most fearsome sea projection weapon known to Man in 1942: your carrier air groups and the task forces that support them.<br><br>As a carrier task force admiral in this pioneering age of air\/naval warfare, assume the mantle of retribution in this innovative interpretation of a classic topic, as the first title in a new series that will further explore and develop the genre. Forget about the limitations of the past, and let the best of wargaming and simulation blend and blossom together in this new take on command at sea! Re-live the great battles of the first year of the Pacific War as if you were there yourself. In here there is no dice roll, no artificial skill-tree, no arbitrary stats, selective fog of war or supernatural crystal-clear communications. It is real-time crisis management for you, realism and historicity without concession, as little abstraction as can be, and loads of action, suspense and refreshing gameplay packed in the same single computer software.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1281220\/extras\/CV5_plan_small.png?t=1605113682\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The thrill of carrier command in a full 3D environment<\/h2>Experience naval command from an innovative first-person perspective.
