    about_the_game: 'Have you always dreamed of joining Alice as she journeys in Wonderland
      and Through the Looking Glass? In this Hidden Objects game, your dream comes
      true! Help the heroine solve puzzles and find cleverly disguised clues so she
      can advance through this wondrous land.<br><br>Colorful 360 degree scenery,
      animation, and 3D visual effects will make your adventure vivid and fun. Those
      with a competitive streak can repeat the quest with new puzzles and have an
      opportunity to contend with other players.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong> Key features:</strong></h2><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li> Experience unusual 360-degree panoramas and 3D views!<br></li><li>
      Vibrant interiors<br></li><li> Diverse challenges: there is the classic hidden
      objects based on name or outlines, finding identical items, and search for pairs
      of items.</li></ul><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/839670/extras/PuzzlePicture_600.png?t=1549361656"

      once again, and if your child has not read the book yet, playing the game together
      will be a sure way to spark interest! Dive into the world of fantasy!'

    reviews: "\u201CAll the levels are made with a 360 degree panoramic view, which\
      \ is very cool. You must win each of the stages to unlock the next. As with\
      \ all Hidden Objects games, you\u2019ll have to scan the environment carefully\
      \ and memorise the positions of all the objects...Graphically, most of the scenes\
      \ are well done, and the items can be difficult to find. The soundtrack is very\
      \ good and suits the game superbly. In terms of the controls, you use your mouse,\
      \ and it works fine.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.zeepond.com/zeepond-reviews/alice-s-adventures-hidden-objects\"\

    review: Purtroppo questo gioco non va da nessuna parte, una storia inesistente,
      oggetti incollati in modo no sense ad uno scenario no sense. Gli oggetti per
      altro si amalgamano male con gli sfondi. Si c'e' qualche giochino per spezzare
      la solita ricerca degli oggetti ma assolutamente non all'altezza di altri titoli
      del genere.
