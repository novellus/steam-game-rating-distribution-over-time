The game definitely dragged during the first half, but got better during the event linking the halves and the second half. The characters look rather nice and the music is acceptable.\n\nMy biggest negatives are the complete lack of any CGs and... technical performance. Never thought I'd have to mention performance in terms of a VN, but the game appears unresponsive for seconds at a time whenever a large amount of characters appear and additionally when changing scenes with them. It also takes a considerable amount of time to even start up and save/load menu functionality breaks if you make the window fullscreen. I'm more bagging on TyranoBuilder at this point than the game, but it is easily the worst VN engine around. Supposedly it's the easiest to just start using, but it lacks so many QoL features that are default elsewhere.\n\nThat said, the ending is rather sweet, even if it's already stated on the store page. Voice acting is also a plus that wouldn't have expected to find here either.","timestamp_created":1606688898,"timestamp_updated":1606688898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvd+Hi/YCfMfAtQI="}
