    review: "Although anyone who owns this DLC most likely got it with the Hexoscope\u2019\
      s Collector\u2019s Edition version, some potential buyers may wonder what is\
      \ in it and is it worth it? The answer depends on whether you want to support\
      \ small indie developers or not.\nThe actual content of this DLC is a few image\
      \ files, including wallpapers and a T-shirt logo in vector format. Essentially\
      \ nothing substantial, but if you think about this DLC as a form of donation,\
      \ and the images as an appreciation gift, then suddenly its existence may serve\
      \ a very valid point.\nAnd if you want something worthwhile for your money,\
      \ then you can always buy the [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/511300/]soundtrack\
      \ DLC.[/url] It is awesome."
