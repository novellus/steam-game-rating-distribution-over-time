The game's interface is serviceable but often unclear and doesn't draw the player to important elements.  A handful of minor but significant bugs remain such as dice clipping into objects and becoming obscured from mouse control.  While these bugs can be worked around it makes the game feel unfinished.\n\nThe game play itself is rather enjoyable, the character builds a pouch of dice and draws them to create various effects by either dropping them into the player's bowl or their opponent's bowl, effectively targeting that character with their effects.  An interesting feature is that player's currency is also considered a die and is drawn from the die pool, making one have to balance their wealth acquisition for future dice with the need to have a consistent \"deck\".  The lack of polish with this system sadly quickly ruins the potential fun the game has to offer.\n\nThe player's opponents play by a different set of rules than the player, while there are tool tips that state this there is no explicit mention of this in the tutorial or the rules at large.  What this means is opponents don't have a deck and don't use energy like the player.  This is made worse by the fact that the players can acquire dice that negatively affect energy and decks, even though this can only be used to hurt them (with the exception of trying to clumsily deck thin yourself).  additionally many die effects are poorly balanced to make what would otherwise be an interesting die unplayable due to how random it's \"positive\" effect is (looking at you wolf die).  Even the Bonus modifiers one can get from defeating elite enemies are often useless or more harm than good, making one wonder why they even bother to collect rewards at all.\n\nIf the developer addresses these issues I think slash roll could be an excellent game but as it stands it's a fascinatingly frustrating mess to play.","timestamp_created":1609644311,"timestamp_updated":1609644311,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4neCR4/YCf/X4vwI="}
