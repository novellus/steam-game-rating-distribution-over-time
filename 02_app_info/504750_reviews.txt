If you have ever played stratego it is this in space. Fans of it will like it those who do not like it will not like this game. Anyway, for those who have no clue what stratego is...\n\ndoomstar is a bit like chess but all the pieces have different strength. Both you and your opponents pieces are hidden until combat starts at which point you can see who has one. There are also a few other things like minefields which can kill everything except minesweeper ships and light fighters. Some sort of nuke that annihalates anything it hits but cant go near blackholes (so guess where the enemy big ships always end up hiding) . Black holes can be used to increase your movement as you slingshot around them and so control of them can be key. or you can run up the flanks and try and take the king (or the command ship) with some fighters winning the game easily. \n\nThen the game comes down to placing your pieces strategically and bluffing too. Stroll up the middle acting like you are the shit and bluff you are using a doomstar, as the enemy fleets fall back, attack the non moving pieces. hurrah you had a minesweeper and mines cant move so job done! Or do you call the opponents bluff? Do you risk your anti matter bomb, could be a doom star...could be a unit of light fighters and that would be an absolute waste.\n\nFans of chess should enjoy it. Fans of bluff games like poker may also enjoy it. I got it on sale and have enjoyed it. Also online can be playable when your opponent isnt online. Asynchronous play is available. Lots of people complaining about the single player campaign. Single player is essentially a tutorial. Only buy this if you plan on playing online. I have been enjoying it so far and just started my first couple of online games.","timestamp_created":1583135133,"timestamp_updated":1583135133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41KGNzfACeN7T9QE="}
