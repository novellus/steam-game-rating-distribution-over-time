All these memories, I had missed this universe sooo much.\nThese games are my childhood.\n\nI literally cried when I heard that a new Drawn to life was coming out.\n\nI thought this story was over.\nSuddenly, 11 years later... BOOM! Here's the sequel! Hard to believe, but it's reality! Oh my..\nWilfre had been defeated, Mike had woken up, so it wasn't over yet?\n\nWell... like many, this game left me skeptical.\n\nThe gameplay isn't that bad. But...\nWe don't expect a puzzle game playing a Drawn to life so yes, it changes, why not, but I find that it does not fit well with the story.\nThe story is unfortunately not as good as in previous games.\nTravel the human world, the return of the shadows!\nThe plot looks interesting!\nBut the way we experience it is bad.\nIt's strange (I think) to face Aldark by doing puzzles...\nI find it sad that there is no boss fights.\nAnd that's why I'm not a huge fan of the gameplay.\nI had a lot of fun on some levels, the Mario Maker side is nice, the problem is that it does not work with the story...\n\nAlso, I like that they followed the original ending of \"The Next Chapter\"\nit adds drama that makes the story more interesting despite everything.\n\nLet's end with the music wich is very good, I don't regret buying the OSTs!\nThe music seems more modern but keep this orchestral aspect, I love it!\n\nThe end of the game suggests a sequel is planned!\n\"Two Realms\" will unfortunately not be appreciated too much...\nI really hope the dev team doesn't get demoralized by the feedback...\nAs I wrote at the beginning, [b]thank you[/b] for continuing Drawn to life and I am sure you will make a better game in the future!","timestamp_created":1607532521,"timestamp_updated":1609783782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp+Wl5/YCcNu2uAI="}
