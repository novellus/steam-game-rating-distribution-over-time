    review: i just got the game today and just beat it even though the skin-walkers
      Couldn't catch me it still was a terrifying feeling of just getting caught by
      one of these little monsters. i saw one get close to me and its a ugly little
      thing and i didn't want to be caught by the thing. the music and they way its
      feet when right on your ass was enough to give me an uncomfortable feeling.
      But i felt the game was lacking in story and the ending was a little anti climatic
      and could of used a little more story and intensity to it instead of "yay you
      got away!" if it had a little more it'll be awesome, But that's just my opinion.
