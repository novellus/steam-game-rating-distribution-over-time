    review: "Disappointing. Tried out all of the models/paints at Castle Rock, in\
      \ the rain, starting at Monument to challenge the 2.3% grade with the default\
      \ strings of 3 x locos + 70 bnsf hoppers. It was mixed at best. The V2 package\
      \ gives you M, M-2, Aces and MAC.\n\nSD70M + SD70M-2 + BNSF Aces + BNSF MAC:\n\
      \   No weather effects at all\n   Supreme traction at low speeds\n   Climbs\
      \ 2.3% grade in rain with ease\n   Weak top speed, seemed to slow even downhill\n\
      \   Nice model and sounds\n\nSD70MAC CSX Livery Add-on:\n   Weather effects\
      \ in full\n   Wheel spin at greater than 11% throttle\n   Had to use sander\
      \ to get out of 0% grade yard\n   Made no attempt at climbing 2.3% grade\n \
      \  Didn't reach 9 mph before aborting the Quick Drive\n\nCONCLUSION:\n   What\
      \ is there to say except that the CSX add-on livery somehow includes weather\
      \ effects despite using this very same package in which no other locos have\
      \ weather effects at all? Also, the tractive effort of the V2 locos, even in\
      \ wet, was monstrous while the CSX add-on was spinning wheels at every speed\
      \ and even spins wheels at 22% (notch 2) throttle while using sander but, if\
      \ given time, will slowly pick up speed. VERY SLOWLY.\n\n   Meanwhile, ALL locos,\
      \ including add-on, and the included string of 70 hoppers on default consist\
      \ packages, all suffered clipping and colliding with each other during dynamic\
      \ braking and/or train braking. If you brake hard enough it derails the train\
      \ every time. Just using low amounts of dynamic braking (below 30%) was enough\
      \ to make the cars and locos touch each other. Dynamic strongly, going above\
      \ 50% you'll see the cars/locos going into each other and, with a little more\
      \ dynamic braking, apparently go so far into each others model that it eventually\
      \ results in a derailment. Dynamic combined with train braking results in a\
      \ derailment literally as soon as the pressure gauge on train brakes shows an\
      \ increase. And speaking of the V2 packages supreme amounts of tractive effort...\
      \ you put those into dynamic braking and the camera moves so wildly that it\
      \ looks like you're being thrown out the windshield! And when you release the\
      \ dynamic breaking, you literally gain 5 mph increase in speed immediately while\
      \ looking like you're being thrown out the back door. It's crazy! How the train\
      \ doesn't derail outright during that is something that I'm sure has the ghost\
      \ of Einstein equally baffled as I am.\n\nUNACCEPTABLE. The package shouldn't\
      \ even be out of BETA stage. That the package is allowed to be sold in such\
      \ a state on Steam is baffling. Known, game-breaking (braking?) issues that\
      \ should be fixed at the very least. And why the add-on loco has full weather\
      \ effects but the V2 package locos have no effects at all is a real head scratcher.\
      \ It's literally like a team of employees all worked in separate rooms with\
      \ no communication or coordination between them and you end up with a hodge-podge\
      \ of wildly varying results from one loco to the next.\n\nI will update this\
      \ review as I further explore the mysteries of this odd package. I plan on running\
      \ these locos as helpers or pushers and mixed in with scores of other locos,\
      \ maybe do a mass power move and see how the locos behave with others. My guess,\
      \ the same results. We'll see.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nTried a lot of experimentation.\
      \ It's cons of the rubber banding couplers is a liability no matter if a single\
      \ train or part of a large power move. You can get from Point A to Point B but\
      \ it will require a lot of patience and attention to speed management. Due to\
      \ the coupler stretch and possibility of derailment from too heavy braking,\
      \ this will require you to both plan ahead and be patient in doing so. Don't\
      \ just take off at 100% throttle. Just use up to 2 notches to get it rolling\
      \ and let the coupler stretch some, after a few mph increase a notch and i'd\
      \ say above 10 mph you can probably go up to 50% throttle without too much coupler\
      \ stretch. From 20-22 mph onward then you can feel more at ease running the\
      \ power on up to full if needed.\n\nNow, the opposite will be required for braking\
      \ and not derailing. Don't just fly into the yard like you can do with some\
      \ of the basic locos and lock down the dynamic and train brakes together. You\
      \ need to coordinate and gradually increase the braking much like above in terms\
      \ of throttling up. Apply a bit at a time and as the train settles into braking\
      \ posture then you can start increasing and keep an eye on exterior view of\
      \ cars/couplers if you need. I'd probably say to practice on exterior view so\
      \ you can get an idea, a feel as it were, of what the train/couplers are doing\
      \ as you are braking. Once you see how it settles in, then you can better judge\
      \ what you can get away with from just the cab view. HOWEVER: Be careful with\
      \ the dynamic engine/trans braking as applying too much, too quickly, will literally\
      \ throw you out and destabilize the train and possibly lead to a derailment.\
      \ Again, only one or two notches when first applying the dynamic, then as the\
      \ train settles into braking posture you can slowly increase as needed. Same\
      \ with the train's brake, slowly increase over time and let the train settle\
      \ and increase as needed to bring it to a stop. \n\nI'm still not sure whether\
      \ to recommend. For the casual gamer or novice? NO. For an experienced player\
      \ who has patience to work with the flaws, maybe. I can overlook lack of weather\
      \ effects, or poor sounds, minor quirks, etc. But it's frustrating dealing with\
      \ rubber-banding couplers that make you feel unsafe at any speed.\n\nOne last\
      \ note, the Academy SD70M in the game can be used in both Quick Drive and scenarios.\
      \ It has all the weather effects visible, it's a great driving unit, cab is\
      \ flush with interactive controls, everything works, and most of all the couplers\
      \ are reliable and don't rubber-band all over the place. It's a solid work of\
      \ art. So why doesn't DTG base these other SD70 packages off of that model??\
      \ Also, the Sherman Hill has a UP SD70M that is a great driving package too.\
      \ If you can't bring this SD70 V2 package up to those standards, then why not\
      \ just release these liveries for the SD70M in the game that works perfectly?"
