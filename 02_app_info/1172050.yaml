    about_the_game: '- Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen! <br>  We have the developer
      of the COCKHEAD game here tonight. Hello, Qute<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172050/extras/T4V.gif?t=1601235104"
      />.<br><br>- Hi<br><br>- Since you''re not a regular on Hollywood''s red carpet
      and front page news, <br>  I think we should do without flash and cut to the
      chase. What''s your game about?<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172050/extras/Untitled-5.gif?t=1601235104"
      /><br><br>- &quot;COCKHEAD&quot; is a story about one of us. A story that could
      have happened to anyone. <br>  The story is that no one is born with balls of
      steel, but they can be gained by passing through numerous travails. <br>  Game
      does not have any sexual or erotic implication. <br>  Game have cartoon images
      of genitals, but they are used only as comic characters<br>  In our game, we
      do not hint, say or show any sexual acts, penetrations or other things with
      an erotic component.<br><br>- It''s intriguing, but as we said no more flash.
      <br>  So, what awaits the player buying your game?<br><br>- Awaiting??! Yes,
      the player will be served with the richest hand-drawn art along with a classic
      platformer sauce, <br>seasoned with gorgeous pieces in the Big Band style.<br><br>-
      Mmm, it makes my mouth water. Now let''s sketch out what are the main features
      of your game?<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172050/extras/Untitled-2.gif?t=1601235104"
      /><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> 1. Fully hand-drawn artwork<br></li><li>  2.
      Classic platformer in non-standard setting<br></li><li>  3. Jazz Big Band style
      accompaniment<br></li><li>  4. A new version of the story everybody knows</li></ul><br>-
      Thank you so much for that. Perhaps you''d like to say a few words on your own
      behalf?<br><br>- Surely. Anyone who doesn''t like or just doesn''t care about
      this story, please avoid buying or playing it. <br>All others are welcome, add
      the game to your wishlist and keep up with the latest news. Thank you!'

    review: 'The controls are terrible, and movement feels extremely awkward. Pausing
      the game will make you restart the level. Most of the game relies on being funny
      because penis. I only got it because it seemed like a silly concept with good
      gameplay, but the gameplay is mediocre at best. I really did think i would enjoy
      this but it felt difficult to continue, especially because the game is not rewarding
      at all.

      This review is based mostly off of first impressions, but I honestly don''t
      feel much of a reason to continue playing. If I ever do play this game again,
      which is kind of unlikely at this point, I may add to this review.

      The only really good part so far is the soundtrack.

      ETA: I decided to just refund the game. I feel like I''d get more enjoyment
      out of a bag of chips and a soda than I would from this game. I''m fairly upset,
      because I really did want to enjoy it, and I really wish it was good, but it
      just isn''t.'
