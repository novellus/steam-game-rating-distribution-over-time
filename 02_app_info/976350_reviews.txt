I was quite confused at first, as I did not realise that the files are stored in the DLC section in the spriter folder   - from where you need to run on  Construct - I thought they had forgotten to upload the capx file to steam- had to contact Mike from Spriter who was very quick to respond and point me in the right direction. Tested with Construct3 - no probs.","timestamp_created":1555017983,"timestamp_updated":1555017983,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593439579010009766","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4weySh+oCe5WHvwE="}
