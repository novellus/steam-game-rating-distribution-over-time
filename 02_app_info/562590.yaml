      /><br><strong>Galactic Junk League</strong> is a tactic sci-fi free-to-play
      shooter arena - a combat game mixed with almost infinite ship building possibilities.
      <br>Build anything. Fight anyone. In space.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/562590/extras/1story.png?t=1546622319"
      /><br>What used to be a prosperous universe is now a post-apocalyptic rusty
      dump full of galactic junk. Savage arenas became the only amusement we have.
      To fight and destroy, we use all necessary means from super advanced beam weapons
      to makeshift torpedoes made from a rusty fridge. The most valuable thing here?

    review: "[h1] A fun and more enjoyable alternative to Robocraft! [/h1]\n\nAfter\
      \ playing this game for a while, I discovered one thing:\n[u] This game is one\
      \ of the most addicting games I've played in a long time! [/u]\n\nLet's take\
      \ a look at some Pro's and Con's:\n\nPro's:\n[*] Very easy to use editor, but\
      \ sadly, the hotbar is very small.\n[*] You dont have to buy anything more than\
      \ once. You buy it for a sorta high price, and you can use it as much as you\
      \ want.\n[*] The crafts control feels very good, it doesn't feel like youre\
      \ sliding all over the place.\n[*] The Noob-Ship class doesn't feel underpowered\
      \ at all. Of course, the specialised classes are better, but you can easily\
      \ take down a shielded Battleship with a beginner ship.\n[*] No pay to win.\
      \ Most ingame purchases are for skins only. The rest is Premium and \"Space\
      \ Whiskey\" for more XP and Currency.\n[*] Class-specific abilities are surprisingly\
      \ well balanced for a 2 week-old game, which is something a lot of dev's struggle\
      \ with at first.\n\nCon's:\n[*] OMG the balancing is awful. Definetly something\
      \ that has to be improved.\n[*] As of right now, the Gauss Cannons are very\
      \ overpowered, especially using the Destroyer class.\n[*] The only gamemode\
      \ so far is TDM, which is kind of a bummer, but I'm certain that that will change\
      \ very quickly.\n[*] Leveling up in the higher levels feels very slow to me\
      \ personally, but in the end, it extends the fun, so it isn't necessarily that\
      \ bad.\n\nLong story short, this game hooked me really quickly and i cant wait\
      \ to see it take off, 'cause it has a lot of potential. I can't wait to see\
      \ it develop and get more fun after every update! It's definetly more fun if\
      \ you play it with friends though, cause you can attack more efficiently. It's\
      \ also very addicting. I keep telling myself: \"just one more game and I'm done!\"\
      , but that mostly just ends in me playing through a whole night (which totally\
