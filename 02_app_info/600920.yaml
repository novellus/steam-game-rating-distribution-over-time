      a letter. Its sender is herself from ten years in the future. Naho thinks it's
      a prank at first, but when the things written in the letter start to come true
      one by one, she realizes that the letter is telling her events that will happen
      in her future. It tells her that she'll fall in love with Kakeru, a new student
      who transfers to her school, and that he'll die in the winter of his 17th year.
