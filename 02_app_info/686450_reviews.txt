Anyway, I loved those and had always wanted a video game version of that, but had never really found it.  The Super Monkey Ball games were decent, but never quite got there for me.  The big issue was they tended toward \"micro-levels\" (which is a mechanic I generally dislike in any game.)  There was no feeling of exploration or \"labyrinth,\" just 1 or 2 obvious challenges per level.  Also the monkeys somehow detracted from the zen purity of rolling a marble for me.\n\nMarble Madness was probably the closest I'd played to what I was looking for, but it was too arcade-y and also super dated.\nSo I decided to trawl Steam for such a game.  And nearly all of them had a major issue.  Either the physics was too off, they were too ugly, they were doing the \"micro level\" thing, levels were boring, etc.\n\nBut I finally found the game I was looking for in The Little Ball That Could!  It had the mix I was looking for:\n\n1) A general chill vibe.\n2) Sufficient-but-pleasing visuals\n3) Levels I felt like I got to really explore in a labyrinth-but-not-frustrating kind of way.\n4) Exactly the kind of additions I'd expect to the idea in a video game format- contraptions (pushers, spikes, speed boosters, etc.) and optional collectables to encourage exploration.\n5) Sometimes makes you think about how to beat a level, but never in a frustrating way.  It's a good feeling.\n\nMinor gripes:\n1) They introduce new gizmos / mechanics a bit too slowly, so the content ends up feeling a bit stretched.  But it also doesn't require you to beat every level to keep moving forward.  There's a readily-available \"skip level\" option.\n2) Would have liked to see levels properly reset when restarting from a checkpoint.  (i.e. various lifts, pushers, etc. reset to the same point in their cycle.)\n3) The glass-shattering sound of an impact \"death\" disrupts the general vibe.","timestamp_created":1589656997,"timestamp_updated":1589656997,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yJm8j/ICeoSaiAI="}
