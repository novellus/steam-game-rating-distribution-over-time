I do enjoy the game, and now that i have a (somewhat stable) monthly income, i bought the game to support the developer.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThings you should know:\n1. Read the guide book on the table whenever you get confused. and if the guidebook doesn't have what you're looking for, there will be a note on the wall near the confusing crafting stations.\n2. THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT: at your front door, there is a do not disturb sign. if you are like me, you will want to have this down at all times, as the knocking of people wanting your attention can be infuriating when you are busy. you get better deals by actually answering the door, but that's your choice. \n3. selling your swords adds skillpoints. with 15 skillpoints you get a level. add at least your first two levels into mining. thank me later.\n4. tempering the sword is finicky, it's not your fault. it is also optional, and improves the selling price. if you get it wrong, there's no punishment.\n5. also important: press T to check what the item you're holding is. sometimes you might not know for sure.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPros: \n1. the game is quite enjoyable once you get into it.\n2. the guide book on the table is a great addition.\n3. the swords, despite the strange graphics, aren't bad to look at, and the general basics of crafting are solid and satisfying.\n4. the mining is quite fun once you upgrade your mining speed.\n5. the sheer amount of variety in materials, parts, and crafting techniques is quite nice.\n6. the feeling of satisfaction when you make a beautiful sword is always enjoyable.\n7. you can make some extremely derpy swords, given some creativity.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCons:\n1. if you don't enjoy repetitive gameplay, this isn't for you.\n2. if you want to get anywhere, you have to upgrade mining speed first and foremost.\n3. the physics aren't great, leading to some oddities when moving things around.\n4. the mining sounds are grating, and some relics are much too common. (looking at you, ancient amphora.)\n5. some mechanics can be quite confusing, especially the damascus plating.\n6. THE MUSIC. turn it off.\n7. the randomly-generated anime characters when you get requests. they have a habit of changing into a different character when you greet them a second time.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion:\n\nAll in all, if you enjoy a nice, relaxing timewaster with a bit of routine, this is for you. i personally love this game, so i recommend it.\n\nTL;DR: good game, a bit wonky. 8/10","timestamp_created":1609916151,"timestamp_updated":1609916151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zd6e6/YCeN72wAI="}
