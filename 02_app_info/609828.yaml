    about_the_game: "In August 1946, Convair was awarded the contract to build the\
      \ XP5Y-1 maritime patrol aircraft as a replacement for the troublesome PB4Y\
      \ Coronado and outdated Martin Mars. Convair had ample seaplane experience with\
      \ the Catalina and Coronado, as well as access to the development data from\
      \ the German BV-222 'Wiking'. <br><br>Originally developed to fulfil the long-range\
      \ maritime reconnaissance role, the Convair XP5Y-1 was celebrated for its high-speed\
      \ blended-hull design, intended to overcome the aerodynamic drag associated\
      \ with flying boat hulls. Powered by four 5250 hp Allison XT-40-A-4 turboprops,\
      \ it flew for the first time on April 18, 1950. <br>At the end of WWII, the\
      \ Tradewind's patrol/ASW mission was scrapped, however with the onset of the\
      \ Korean War came new transport and 'mobile base' roles for the R3Y. Thus, 11\
      \ re-designated R3Y Tradewinds were built. Several modifications were incorporated\
      \ into the new R3Y-1 including increased horsepower T-40-A-10 engines, new nacelles,\
      \ shorter airscrew driveshafts and tailpipes, and V-shaped float struts. Convair\
      \ later re-designed the nose and added a large hinged door at the bow. This\
      \ new version was designated R3Y-2 and flew on October 22, 1954. A last attempt\
      \ at salvaging the project resulted in a refuelling tanker conversion, but this\
      \ was not enough to save the Tradewind. All were scrapped in 1959.<h2 class=\"\
