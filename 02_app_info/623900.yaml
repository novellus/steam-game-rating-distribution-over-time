    review: 'Graphics are decent. Gameplay is.. pretty basic..


      It''s as simple as it can get. I guess it''s trying to bring a ''realism'' factor
      as far as Table Football is in real life.


      If you''re totally in the lowest depths of boredom and have no other game to
      play... perhaps consider this.'
