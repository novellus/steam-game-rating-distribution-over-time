    review: 'Cool game a nun and corruption of officials. So starting off with usual
      targets, visual goes first.

      There''s a few names that comes to mind vivid, striking, profound, and stylish.

      What on offer is clear cut and has little fluff and keeps things on point.  To
      enhance the experience get the patch. It''s available on the publisher website.
      Next  it''s all royalty free stuff but besides that what used does so to effect
      .

      Next gameflow topping this off at the start is investigating before you get
      started with any area this is what you will be doing.  Following that is expedition  which
      lead to  exploration  that blends in to combat or evasion and rinse and repeat.
      Be warned as expedition should be carefully decided on as there''s little hand
      holding and exploration can often lead to long-term engagement with multiple
      bosses if you choose to not end a expedition  prepare accordingly.  Combat  without
      the patch is classic  turn based affairs with crush item mechanisms to mix up
      tedium. Changes drastically with the patch applied as new mechanics are featured
      that alter the experience greatly a small example is with the character herself
      Anna  as actions  experienced in combat will affect her for the rest of the
      game and alter whole entire sequences that occur later. I will not go any more
      than this into combat as discussion father than this will lead to spoiler territory
      but know what happens when in combat affect a lot of what happens in game when
      the patch is applied.  So now for a overview of the story you are anna a battle
      nun struggling with the past while trying to atone with a personal grevious
      and complete a mission task  as things goe from worse to horrible. I''m not
      gonna say no more than this regarding the story I don''t rate guys so I will
      leave you with this for the price of admission I recommend playing this as it''s
      enjoyable and with the patch applied there''s no censorship at all you can see
      everything that happens to this I assume female Christian nun and the corruption
      that follows that is  cool as I enjoy my perspective uncensored and raw.  Without
      the patch you get a cool jesus loving adventure about anna and her love for
      god  so check out Seed of evil also tell me if I suck at reviews and punish
      me in my comments section  hit that like  subscribe for and share the review
      make memes and all the cool stuff  I forgot how much this cost so check out
      the store page.'
