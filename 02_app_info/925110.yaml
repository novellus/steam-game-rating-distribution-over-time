    review: At the end of this level you can encounter an optional giant spider boss.
      The problem is - unless you're prepared you absolutely can not kill him no matter
      how you try and, of course, the game does not warn you in any way. And this
      shitty game won't allow you to exit the room. So thank you for more than an
      hour of my life wasted.
