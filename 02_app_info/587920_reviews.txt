There isn't much a story at play; there's a campaign, but it mostly just exists to give you purpose and ease you into new challenges. The characters are cleverly written stereortpes (eg. The Jock, The Nerd, etc.) with a handful of funny dialogue. The environments, while a bit repetitive, are very well designed and haven't ever gotten old to me. Lastly, the enemy design is also well made, and from a gameplay perspective they're all pretty interesting. Edit: I forgot to mention the music; the soundtrack is great! There aren't many tracks on it, and they aren't too detailed, but they set the tone very well and they're very easy on the ears.\n\nIt's not the most challenging game out there, and it doesn't have incredible depth to its gameplay loop, but it still has a lot to offer and it's an easy game to play in short bursts, if that's what floats your boat. All-in-all it's a great game, especially if you're a fan of campy horror.","timestamp_created":1587578730,"timestamp_updated":1587579513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ip3H0fECeKngggI="}
