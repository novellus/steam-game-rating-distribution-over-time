Players can drop 5 balls, and there are 5 rounds.\nGolf [16 players] - Players play as the ball, with everyone scrambling to collect as many coins as possible in a bird's eye view mini golf area. The hole appears wherever the last coin was, and whomever lands in it catches a coin bonus. There are 5 different levels.\nCar-Ball [8 players] - A team-based mode where players control a car, accelerating automatically and holding their button to turn left or right. The car turns in the opposite direction each press, and turning also works as the car's brakes. You can ram into the side or back of an enemy car to temporarily knock them out. When the ball falls in a team's goal, the other team scores a point. One player can ride into the side of the goal to become a goalie, sliding up or down like in Blasterball to bounce the ball away. Score 5 goals to win.\nMatch3 [8 players] - This puzzle game works similar to Puyo Puyo, where the player is given groups of 3 blocks at the top of their board. These blocks shift from left to right to choose where to place them, and you can rotate them as well. Match3 with the same block type either horizontally, vertically or diagonally to clear them from the board. (I think you can also send grey blocks to other players, which encourages fast play). Whomever survives the longest wins.\n\nYou may notice that all four of these game modes are very different from the main Joust mode. The Joust mode is quite chaotic in that players can be knocked out at any time during a round, without warning. Arguably, the fact that the animals are so fragile is the most fun part of the game, and once you are out, you are out until the next round. None of the other game modes do this quite the same way. Bagatelle more or less has you in control of how often and when you use your balls, and each round lasts until every ball is used. While Match3 does have a knockout system like Joust, it is much more strategic in gameplay, and the fact that each player has their own field can cause a bit of a disconnect between the players, removing that fragility aspect. In Car-Ball, you respawn shortly after being knocked out, making it more of a hindrance than anything, and in Golf your ball can be stunned, but never destroyed. \nThe reason why I point out that Joust's quick knockout gameplay is unique to the game mode is that the other game modes feel a little dull in comparison. Playing the other game modes with your friends is tough to do when they are used to the swift deaths and epic plays that happen only in Joust mode.\n\nPersonally, I think more game modes should be added that lean into the fast knockout gameplay seen in the Joust mode. The Car-Ball mode could be transformed into an aggressive Demolition Derby type mode, having the same one-hit KO and driving mechanics of Car-Ball, but in a dirty and dangerous arena. Or how about removing the walls from Golf for a game mode where players try to knock each other off of a swiftly shrinking platform? What I think this game needs is more modes like Joust, where players directly attack each other in a battle for the Party Jousting crown.\n\nCurrently, I would not recommend this DLC if you are expecting more stuff like the main Joust mode. This DLC includes more strategic modes that are much less deadly, but a lot fairer to less skilled players thanks to allowing them to participate throughout the entire round. As such, if you feel like Jousting is a bit too hardcore or unfair, I would recommend this DLC, particularly for the Bagatelle mode, which is probably the friendliest mode of them all.\n\nSomething to note though, one of the Beta game modes is a Super Smash Bros. spoof, where players move left or right automatically and can do jumps and various attacks. The current moveset is really cool to mess around with, and it would be cool to see the game mode developed further, and possibly become more fun than any other mode.","timestamp_created":1596811730,"timestamp_updated":1596940502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv8jE6PMCeo/9mQI="}
