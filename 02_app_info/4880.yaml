    about_the_game: "Cossacks: European Wars is a historical real-time strategy based\
      \ on events of the 16th through the 18th centuries in Europe, when nations and\
      \ states were created and demolished, and wars shed seas of blood. There are\
      \ 16 nations or regions in Cossacks: Algeria, Austria, England, France, the\
      \ Netherlands, Piemonte, Poland, Portugal, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, Spain, Sweden,\
      \ Turkey, Ukraine, and Venice. Each has its own original graphics, economic\
      \ and technical development peculiarities, military advantages and drawbacks,\
      \ and unique units and technologies, providing vast choices of tactics and strategy\
      \ in war against any enemy. Thus, England is the mightiest sea power, Austria\
      \ has powerful light and heavy cavalry, and Cossacks are the pride of the Ukrainian\
      \ army.<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBattles of up to\
      \ 8,000 units may be conducted on single or network game maps. One can carry\
      \ out lingering city sieges, wage guerilla wars, capture commanding heights\
      \ and arrange ambushes, deploy landing forces on enemy shores, and conduct sea\
      \ battles. The game system is arranged to reduce per-unit control and resource\
      \ micromanagement, and to turn to global goals of powerful economy formation,\
      \ science development, the capturing of new lands, and defending borders."
