      \ who\u2019s Phoebe, you ask? She's a talented inventor and programmer with\

      s where I come in! Phoebe created me, her bionic arm and best friend, to help\
      \ her achieve her goals. Not only am I brilliant, handsome, and funny, but I\u2019\
      ve also got a neat trick up my sleeve - I can take regular old floppy disks\
      \ and turn them into these handy-dandy projections we call \u201CFloppy Knights!\u201D\
      \ They\u2019re super useful for just about any task\u2026 especially when it\u2019\
      s time to throw down on the battlefield.<br><br>With the help of our new buddies,\
      \ the occasional odd job has turned into a steady side hustle\u2026 but things\
      \ are getting a bit more intense than we bargained for! Bigger and badder monsters\
      \ keep popping up and now Phoebe\u2019s not so sure about this whole \u201C\
      hero\u201D role\u2026 but I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Let\u2019s chat\
