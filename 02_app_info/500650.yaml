      \ to tragic consequences. You're John Bishop, a swamped-with-work detective\
      \ who tirelessly carries out your investigations late into the night.  But tonight\
      \ you are pulled from your precious few hours of rest ,and a strange dream,\
      \ by a mysterious call from an old \u201Cfriend.\u201D Turning your fight to\
      \ find the truth into a fight to survive the night.<br>Your police department\
      \ is left without electricity. The security system has been hacked.  All exits\
      \ are locked.  But that is not the real problem.<br>Someone\u2026 something\
