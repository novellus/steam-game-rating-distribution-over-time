Despite only being four hours long, there are some really great puzzles throughout the game's 100 levels. The music is mellow and isn't distracting, and the new ideas introduced throughout the game make the experience feel fresh. The final boss is a true test of everything throughout the game. I am friends with the developer of this game as well, and I'm happy for his newfound success at the launch of Mimicry. I can't wait to see what else Anxiety Monster has in store, godspeed!","timestamp_created":1599930609,"timestamp_updated":1599930609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41vXSwfQCeMexoQI="}
