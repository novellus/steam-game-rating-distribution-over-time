    review: 'Pretty great expansion, but very flawed.


      + Storyline is great.

      + Tons of content, dozens and dozens of quests and areas to explore. Took me
      50 hours to complete everything.

      + Even more detailed level design than in the first expansion which had more
      detailed level design than base game''s already. Most of the stuff have better
      textures too.

      + A whole new soundtrack which is very beautiful and epic.

      + Much less glitchy and more stable than DLC version of this expansion.


      - Half of the cutscenes do not have any sound.

      - Very glitchy. Two side quests were glitched and I had to use cheat codes to
      complete them. In one quest the item wouldn''t spawn, in another the dead body
      which had a quest item did not spawn. Glad you can bypass these issues with
      the right cheat codes.

      - It''s very long, but it''s quantity over quality kind of thing. Some of the
      areas are clearly stretched out. There are some areas and dungeons which are
      huge and very samey looking the whole way, they are very repetitive and it feels.

      - With this expansion Microtransactions were added to the game. Game''s very
      easy so there''s no way you''d ever need to buy any. They also removed some
      cheat codes which were for material item spawns, because of material item microtransactions.
