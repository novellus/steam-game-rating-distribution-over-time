Thereâ€™re only 3 levels, and there's alot of jank. For example, I've died twice so far just from jumping. No nearby explosions, full health, not falling out of the map or off of a ledge, immediate death on landing from a normal jump. If you don't mind this kind of thing, read on. Otherwise, wait for polish.\n\nVortex of Pain is a side-scrolling beat-em-up with alot of unpolished physics interactions. Sometimes the interactions are hilarious, as when everything or your enemies are blowing up and flying everywhere. Other times, as mentioned above, you're dying for either no apparent reason or for reasons that seem outside your control. There are mundane annoying moments, like when a random enemy headbutts you out of nowhere and you're forced to wait for your character to just get back up already before being knocked down again, and there are awesome moments like when you find yourself bouncing enemies in the air and against walls repeatedly.\n\nThe worst moments haven't been bad enough to offset the fun ones. The environments are visually distinct, if odd due to lower-end assets, and the enemy types feel different from each other. There are standard large and small enemies, backflipping ninja enemies, enemies that try to act like cars, mimes that grapple you... there's at least 1 other indie beat-em-up I can think of (but won't mention) that looks better but somehow lacks even this much enemy variety.\n\nPlayer abilities feel fairly standard, and have been improved from when I first tried the game. You can now automatically grab enemies when you walk into them, which makes grappling far easier and useful over needing to rely on a grapple button. The grappling button is still present, but I've always found it hard to use.\n\nOverall, still fun if a little frustrating for the weird deaths. Even if you don't buy today, I'd recommend keeping an eye on Vortex of Pain.","timestamp_created":1605507648,"timestamp_updated":1609135786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1607099881,"developer_response":"Thank you for your feedback! We just released an update which addresses some of your critiques.\n\n\"It's a bit like rolling a die to determine if you'll randomly explode while playing Streets of Rage.\"\n\nWe'd like to hear from players if there are some places that are too chaotic for their own good. We are trying to find a balance between having funny unexpected situations, but also giving the player a chance to react to them and use them for his/her advantage. In this update, we reduced the bounciness of the ball props to give the player a better chance to react to them, and removed some of them from the mall level's sport shop.\n\n\"Another janky aspect of Vortex is how you don't collide with enemies. At all. In several other beatemup titles, walking into enemies automatically triggers a grab state without using a button. In Vortex, you and the enemy can simply pass through each other. This can make it harder to determine when you can actually grab the enemies, and I generally found it to be far more effective to not even try.\"\n\nWe added a traditional grappling mode where the player starts grappling when walking into enemies. We forgot to mention in the tutorial section that it's easier to succeed in grappling if the enemy is staggered first by punching him. We added that hint to the tutorial, and worked on the gameplay guidance in general. We added small video screens which demonstrate the most complex moves to the first level, and loading screen and game over tips about undocumented features, moves and strategies.\n\n\"Your general abilites are fairly standard. You can run, jump, execute an attack string, and utilize a heavy attack, in addition to the previously mentioned grab. All feel fine in execution, although I often found myself wishing it was a bit easier to juggle enemies and thereby kill them faster. Everyone (you and your foes) spend so much time lying on the ground that it can get tedious waiting for everyone to get back up.\"\n\nWe reduced the time enemies and players spend lying on ground and slightly sped up the rising animations. We also slightly reduced health from some of the weakest enemies. On the hard difficulty levels, enemies' health is balanced in a way that it is supposed to encourage the player to use and mix diverse moves, like strong attacks, air attacks, grapples and air grapples instead of relying on the basic combo strikes to beat them faster.\n\n\"At the moment, Vortex of Pain has only 3 levels. However, the levels are not overly short, and there're significant opportunities to test your skills in each one. If I have any complaints regarding their structure (unrelated to how bland looking they are), \nit's that each level feels fairly similar to me. Each starts kinda easy, then gets hard up to about the same level of difficulty. If more levels are added down the road, I hope the developers go back and adjust the difficulty accordingly.\"\n\nWe are working on new levels, and we plan to adjust the overall difficulty of the game throughout the project. The difficulty was slightly adjusted in the new update\n(mostly by adding a few more enemies and making some enemy types stronger) to make overall level of difficulty higher as the game progresses. We'd love to hear more difficulty feedback from players on the discussion board.\n\nFull patch notes: https://store.steampowered.com/newshub/app/887170/view/2896341257764404011"}],"cursor":"AoJwgfH90/YCcZ7WrgI="}
