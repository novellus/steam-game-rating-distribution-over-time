    about_the_game: "Go Outside simulator lets you enjoy the great outdoors without\
      \ having to go outdoors! No time limits, no bad guys, no puzzles. Simple outdoor\
      \ exploration. The point of the game is to just get lost in the different environments.\
      \ If just walking around doesn't do it for you each environment has multiple\
      \ hidden things to find. This game is currently very early in development and\
      \ will be improved upon and added too as time goes on. This started out as a\
      \ joke project but turned into a jumping off point to practice making environments\
      \ and limited interactivity for therapeutic VR simulations I want to make to\
      \ help people like myself who suffer from environmental based mental illnesses\
      \ like agoraphobia. It's very basic and simple, think of it as a joke or relaxation\
      \ aid if nothing else. All money made off Go Outside Simulator will be used\
      \ to help the production of therapeutic simulations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you\
      \ want to explore different environments and look for hidden secrets, or simply\
      \ play something to calm yourself down and just exists without goals, deadlines,\
