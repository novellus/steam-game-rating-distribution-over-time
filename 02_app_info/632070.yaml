    review: " Fidelio Incident is a single-player, first-person walking simulator\
      \ set off the coast of Iceland.  After plane crash Stanley try to find her wife\
      \ and fight against hypothermia.\n\n+ Beautiful graphics \n+ Okey story\n+ Good\
      \ music\n\n- Game guides you so there is no challenge.\n- Puzzles are too easy\
      \ and repetitive.\n- There is no replay value.\n- Boring\n\nSo another walking\
      \ simulator.. Very linear, boring and no challenge makes this average-bad game.\
      \ But... These beautiful graphics, music and okey story is reason why i ll give\
      \ it positive review and guess its worth to try.., but only with heavy discount!\n\
