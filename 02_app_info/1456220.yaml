      /></a><br><br>After a house party goes wrong and shatters your gang, leave your
      room to get your best friends back together, avoiding basic human interaction
      from overly friendly strangers in the most realistic horror game to date! Face
      your fears as you learn about theirs, with each friend having their own struggles,
      just like the ones you have in real life that you keep forgetting to text!<br><br>Don''t

      /><br>Meet a hilariously bizarre cast of extroverts, and spend every second
      avoiding them!<br><br>Feel your heart race as the extroverts approach in force,
      and make your dreams come true by unleashing a flurry of parkour to avoid basic
      conversation! By making - and breaking - eye contact, compel the extroverts
      in your way to trigger their abilities, and lead them like a pied piper to have
      conversations between each other instead.<br><br>The extroverts won''t give
      up easy, giving chase using everything from laser beams to teleportation to
      trap you.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1456220/extras/FourFriends.gif?t=1607438285"
