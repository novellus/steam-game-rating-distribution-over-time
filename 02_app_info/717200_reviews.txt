If anything this game only sets the bar lower for other new games.","timestamp_created":1593943726,"timestamp_updated":1594297719,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jZPjmfMCeKL8kgI="}
