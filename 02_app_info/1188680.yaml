      s voters and take the 2020 presidential election by storm in this exciting political\
      \ strategy game. Choose from a large roster of candidates, from Democrats Joe\
      \ Biden and Bernie Sanders to Republicans Donald Trump and Mitt Romney, as well\
      \ as other well-known politicians like former senator John McCain, Alexandria\
      \ Ocasio-Cortez, Mitch McConnell, Barack Obama, and more.<br><br>Want to shake\
      \ things up a little? No problem! Use the Candidate Workshop to create your\
      \ own frontrunner, complete with customized statistics, ideologies, and design.\
      \ If you believe everything is going to hell in a handbasket, you can play as\
      \ one of the wild card candidates like the Giant Meteor and adopt some truly\
      \ crazy ideologies (ban all video games - they\u2019ll rot your brain!). <br><br>The\
      \ Political Machine 2020 features unique ideology trees for each of the candidates\
      \ that allow them to play very differently from each other. Throughout the game,\
      \ you\u2019ll visit Town Halls or take on Campaign Events to gain ideology points\
      \ that you can spend to own certain issues. For instance, Bernie Sanders has\
      \ \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 as an issue he can own, while Donald Trump can\
      \ use points to purchase the \u2018Build the Wall\u2019 issue.<br><br>Each issue\
      \ is modded on a per-state basis with their voter support based on data in order\
      \ to allow for an accurate simulation of how those issues will play out in different\
      \ states. It\u2019s important to win 270 votes in the electoral college, so\
      \ you\u2019ll need to pay attention to what issues voters care about in the\
      \ swing states. What plays well in Texas or California might hurt you in Ohio\
      \ or Florida.<br><br>The Political Machine 2020 is a complete rewrite of the\
      \ original versions of the game with vastly improved graphics and a more sophisticated\
      \ simulation that combines polling data, voter enthusiasm, and the most recent\
      \ US census results to deliver a game that is both fun to play for casual players,\
      \ and realistic enough for political wonks.<br><br>Do you think you have what\
      \ it takes? Take to the campaign trail and show the nation why you should be\
      \ the next President of the United States of America!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Core\
