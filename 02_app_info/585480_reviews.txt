[list][/list] But before I get into it, I want to mention once again some key factors that will be present throughout the whole game, that concern graphics and soundtrack! For a 2018 game the graphics are pretty OK, I can notice a glimpse of a very peculiar art style, given a caricaturist look to the characters and highlighting a lot of facial traces and details. In regard to the soundtrack, it is quite immersive and it fits like a glove in the game and contributes to this atmosphere of mystery, suspense and occultism.[list][/list] But let's get back to the episode! And so far so good, like the last one, the Episode 2 did not disappoint. [list][/list] I get the feeling that the second episode is a bit smaller, but the puzzles available are much more challenging. The game is getting far more darker, and honestly I do not know what to expect anymore.[list][/list] Like I did on episode 1, I replayed this one twice on different save files. The plan is to understand the different outcomes that I can get, and even save resources for the really important choices.[list][/list] My only complaint is that episode 2 not only seems shorter but also more repetitive. I am saying that because on Episode 1 the exploration was incredibly fun, everything was new, and on this one you keep running the corridor from room to room at some point. Yes you get access to amazing new areas, but they don't seem enough. [list][/list] To get an idea, you cannot even access your own room (where I have a lot of resources that I couldn’t grab before) and honestly, where the hell is the toilet on this mansion? I know that we are at the ending of the XVIII century but there were already toilets back there. Maybe Richet's mother is hiding there all along…[list][/list] But so far so good, a really nice second episode that I quite enjoyed! Fully recommend it! (Don't forget to check my review of the other episodes on the Steam page of each one of them).","timestamp_created":1600261409,"timestamp_updated":1600285531,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543859660625457764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t+uczPQCdI+WogI="}
