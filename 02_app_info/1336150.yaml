    review: "This a simple run and jump game with decent environment and lovely music,\
      \ but it doesn't offer much more than that.\n\nPros:\n+ Simple\n+ Music matches\
      \ the theme\n+ Has a nice environment\n+ Can mostly use with controller (more\
      \ on that later)\n+ Option to play with friends who also have the game\n\nCons:\n\
      - Story seemed pointless\n- Platforms didn't always make sense\n   * at one\
      \ point, you could be floating in air\n   * at another point, you could land\
      \ over the right area then plop gracefully to your death\n- Not much more to\
      \ it than running and jumping\n   * there was a slight exploration component\
      \ to it\n\nI agree with others who have said this game holds potential, but\
      \ it has a long way to go. The initial story behind it is intriguing but doesn't\
      \ have any effect on the gameplay and could be completely omitted. The dialogue\
      \ could also use a writer's stylistic touch, if the creator wishes to keep it\
      \ in there.\n\nFor controls, the mouse was too sensitive to me and there were\
      \ no options to change that. I figured this out at the same time I discovered\
      \ there was no save option (though there are checkpoints\u2014once you click\
      \ out to the main menu, you start back at the beginning). Still, the arrow keys\
      \ were find for the most part, as long as I remembered <> were for camera and\
      \ ^v were for movement. The controller was a lot easier to work with. \n\nHowever,\
      \ I only got a couple achievements where I should have had more. I saw where\
      \ someone commented that they got achievements through the mouse/keyboard combo\
      \ only.\n\nWith all that said, I'll be happy to see how the game progresses\
      \ if the creator continues to work on it and hope to update this to a more positive\
      \ review later!"
