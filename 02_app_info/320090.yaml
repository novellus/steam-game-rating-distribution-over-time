      \ Follow me to see more reviews like this [/url]\n\nThis is one of my favourite\
      \ games.\n\nIt seems like it is nothing special and first glance and it is pretty\
      \ short, but nevertheless I really love it.\n\nYou are playing as Hamomoru Tachibana,\
      \ who meets with a scientist called Chuuya Shingoh in Kyoto at a festival. Both\
      \ didn\u2019t know each other prior to this event, but find themselves fascinated\
      \ by a pond in the middle of the forest. If you throw pebbles in this pond,\
      \ you are able to grow stars. Actually, these stars have a meaning as well,\
      \ because different combinations of stars influence the fate of the people living\
      \ in Kyoto differently. Shingoh wants to experiment with the pond and invites\
      \ Hamomoru to be his assistant. She can\u2019t decline his offer because she\
      \ had lost her wallet at some point before coming to the pond and has no means\
      \ to go back home or stay somewhere else. And so both of them start to combine\
      \ the stars in the pond every night and meet with some people in the daytime\
      \ to see, whose fate has changed and how.  \n\nAs mentioned before,\n\nHamomoru\
      \ Tachibana is the main character and Shingo\u2019s current assistant.\nChuuya\
      \ Shingoh is a scientist, who is curious about the magical powers of the pond\
      \ and wants to test, how it works. He is basically telling Hamomoru, what to\
      \ do.\n\nThe other characters are Nagare Toshika, Ingetsu Mashiba, Yi Xinghua\
      \ and Sorata Aetama. These four characters have all different circumstances\
      \ and your job is to combine a lot of stars so that their wishes come true.\
      \ You want the best outcome for all of them. Since talking about their background\
      \ stories is somehow a spoiler, I won\u2019t mention it here.\n\nNext, about\
      \ the gameplay: You will combine stars and that\u2019s it. There are no choices\
      \ regarding the story, but the story isn\u2019t boring itself to begin with.\
      \ You actually wouldn\u2019t need the choices in the first place. The reason\
      \ for that is that, when you start combining stars, you\u2019re able to change\
      \ the life of the four characters bit by bit. Because every combination only\
      \ changes the life of the character slightly, it\u2019s the same as, if you\
      \ had chosen something. \n\nHowever, the gameplay can become tedious. Moreover,\
      \ it\u2019s definitively very tedious towards the end, when you have to combine\
      \ many stars just to get a specific cluster and, if one star is wrong, everything\
      \ just stops working. I\u2019d recommend you use a guide at that point.\n\n\
      In my opinion, this game is still very underrated.\n\nIt is story-wise a short\
      \ game (but you are going to have a lot of trial-error regarding the stars),\
      \ but the story and the characters are very lovable. \n\nThe story doesn\u2019\
      t tire you out and I really like it that they split the story into short scenes\
      \ that are influenced by the stars. The star combinations you need for a story\
      \ are not random as well since every cluster you will be making does have a\
      \ meaning or is a metaphor for something. Those meanings become the reality\
      \ for the characters.\n\nIn addition, every story is unique and you will feel\
      \ sympathetic towards every character. You will want to help them as much as\
      \ Hamomoru does and you will feel truly glad, when you reach their best ending.\n\
      \nI think this game is very special because of that. Even though, it has no\
      \ romance involved whatsoever, it manages to tell the stories of people so well\
      \ that you don\u2019t want to stop playing until you have finished the whole\
      \ game.\n\nThe only negative aspect this game has is that it\u2019s very grindy\
      \ towards the end. You will need to look up a guide, if you want to finish the\
      \ journal. But, hey, I think we all can overlook this aspect because the rest\
      \ of the game is simply amazing.\n\nSo, buy this game, if you have time for\
      \ a puzzle game right now. \n\nIt\u2019s a very good story. Adorable characters.\
      \ \n\nThe story is even deeper than it looks like at first glance (because of\
      \ the true story at the end). This game made me actually think about what fate\
      \ is and question, how I\u2019d act, if I were in the same situation as the\
      \ protagonist.\n\nAll in all, one of my favourites and I still remember it,\
      \ although I played it years ago.\n\n[url=https://xiaoran-revs.tumblr.com/post/634066887779762176/this-starry-midnight-we-make]\
