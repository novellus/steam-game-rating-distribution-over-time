It seems like they're setting up for a sequel and I definitely intend to play it if/when it comes out.\n\nNote though that this seems more like a single story than a choose-your-own-adventure style visual novel. I only played through a couple sets of different choices, but from what I saw, the story is kind of linear and there aren't many different endings. There are a couple key choices that really only have one option. However, the quality of the story makes up for it. \n\nOne playthrough seems to take around 2.5 hours, but I could easily see myself spending another couple hours playing through different choices, so I feel like $5 is worth it.","timestamp_created":1602495653,"timestamp_updated":1602495653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yOSLjvUCdMq0pwI="}
