This is not as awesome as the third or fourth one of those in particular but nonetheless. Its still worth buying for the low price if you really love that memorabilia as opposed to this one being Ancient Rome and its second instalment and that being with an exception thats if that is the case if but apart from that its accurately speaking probably not worth the amount of 8 dollars unless of course the price has been reduced over time in which case it should be ok. Far out stuff totally.","timestamp_created":1604567708,"timestamp_updated":1604567708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlobsy/UCc+K1rAI="}
