So what do we have here?\n\n- Coop mini games from Boss 101\n- New maps and rotation\n- Highscores\n- Global Highscores (From Steam)\n- New Mini-games that doesn't show on Boss 101 like Rob's Adventure (my favorite)\n- Support to Remote Play from Steam\n\nNow these mini-games are pretty basic and it drains your fun very quickly (if playing coop). But the only thing that is completely broken are the achievements. Until the devs return to development of this I WOULD CALL THIS GAME IS NOT A FULL RELEASE, BUT INSTEAD NEED TO BE IN EARLY ACCESS. (It makes more sense that way)\n\nI'm final note is... Buy this only if you don't care about achievements and want to pass the time playing some coop or versus mini-games from Boss 101 for about 1 hour until you move to something else. Btw! If you like Retro games, this is a good call.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/380920/Boss_101/","timestamp_created":1604932097,"timestamp_updated":1604932179,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w7La1vUCcqetrQI="}
