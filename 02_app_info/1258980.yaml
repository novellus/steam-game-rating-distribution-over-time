      As VR games go, this one\u2019s pretty unique. Spellpunk VR gives players the\
      \ ability to virtually \u2018cast\u2019 spells by actually drawing them out\
      \ in space. Yes, that sounds a little bit Dr. Strange-y.\u201D<br><a href=\"\

      Once I learned a few spells, I immediately felt the intensity settle in upon\
      \ starting my first duel. SpellPunk makes me feel like a toddler trying to remember\
      \ how to draw certain shapes. The main difference is I\u2019m under pressure\
      \ to draw a circle for a shield or a triangle to shoot a fireball. This is where\
      \ the action comes together and feels exhilarating.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.slythergames.com/2020/05/08/5-thoughts-about-spellpunk-vr/\"\

    review: "To be honest with you SpellPunk is much more fun than I imagined it would\
      \ be. Since I have this game I am playing it with a friend of mine. We are speaking\
      \ on Discord while dueling and we can\u2019t stop laughing and yelling at each\
      \ other. SpellPunk is super fun and is one of those games that are easy to learn\
      \ but hard to master. Since my first hour in the game I am pretty confident\
      \ that I can draw all of the spells. Drawing spells is super intuitive as you\
      \ are making it with your hands and there is no need to smash some unnecessary\
      \ buttons. I also enjoy the music and think that it corresponds great with Spellpunk\u2019\
      s visuals"
