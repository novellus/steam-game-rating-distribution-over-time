I found the playful banter forced.\n\nTo be fair, I've only played the Cain storyline, so I'll give that a chance before I decide to refund it and let you guys know how it goes.\n\nUpdate: I forgot that I refunded it before writing a review for the product. I genuinely meant to give this game a fair shake because it was obvious the developer worked hard on it.","timestamp_created":1528432059,"timestamp_updated":1528474811,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458333343267440796","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p9eM8OMCeYGyogE="}
