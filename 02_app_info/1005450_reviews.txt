The story wasn't anything special and there were a few gameplay annoyances but nothing that would ruin the experience. I was excited that this could really be a super obscure hidden gem that I could recommend to friends. But then after the first boss everything went downhill fast.\n\nExtremely obtuse progression routes, like a hidden path on the other side of a killing laser or a rock that grows and blocks the way if you don't reach it in time, and of which there is no indication. The game's controls are not exactly tight in general, but the wall running ability is especially finicky and that becomes a major part of the game later on. Oh and many of the areas start to become water levels where you control even worse. Why do developers keep including water levels, doesn't everyone hate those?","timestamp_created":1609244295,"timestamp_updated":1609244537,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4it6c1/YCeqa2vgI="}
