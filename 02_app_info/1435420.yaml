      a small first-person single-player indie adventure game in which you look for
      unique and bizarre boss opponents. Usually one hit on the weak spot of your
      opponent is enough to defeat him, but be careful - they will be able to defeat
      you just as easily with one hit.<h2 class="bb_tag">Unique experience:</h2>You
      find yourself only armed with your bow in a mysterious world in which you have
      to face unique boss opponents. You will die a lot as you learn how to defeat
      your enemies, but once you know how, you will be able to finish each of them
      in only a few seconds.<h2 class="bb_tag">Replayablity:</h2>As soon as you have
      finished the game, you can start it again and try to minimize your deaths and
      defeat your bosses even faster!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1435420/extras/Godslayertextpic.jpg?t=1603209802"

    review: 'Huge swathes of empty terrain, a very slow and un-fun gameplay mechanic,
      and interesting but largley boring bosses, combine to make an extremely uninspired
      game.

      The only nice bit is the dash mechanic but honestly, there is no point to this
      game.

      Pick something else for your $3.
