      less time playing video games I wouldn''t be making indie games as a means to
      pay off insane amounts of student debt. But hey, its 2020 and maybe this can

      a cannonball''s trajectory which players must account for. Its simple arcade-simulation-action,
      fun for all ages, with completely hand drawn game art running at a gorgeous
