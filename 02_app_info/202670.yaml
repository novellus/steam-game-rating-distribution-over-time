      \ mysterious note that leads her into the Town Hall of her home town River Heights.\

      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >USA TODAY</a><br><br>\u201CThe positive\

      It\u2019s an impressive milestone to reach, especially considering that the\
      \ quality of games in the series has remained fairly consistent throughout.\
      \ Alibi in Ashes shakes up the usual formula, not just by sending Nancy to a\
      \ different location, but by actually placing her in jail for most of the game\
      \ while her long-time friends \u2013 Bess, Ned, and George \u2013 do most of\
      \ the sleuthing on her behalf.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamezebo.com/games/nancy-drew-alibi-ashes/review\"\

    review: Loved playing as other characters. Story was good, puzzles were good.
      If I was going to complain, it would be how you have to switch between characters.
      If you are Bess, and need to be George, you can't just call George and ask her
      to do something, etc., and switch that way. You have to call Nancy and have
      her take over the case and then Nancy can call George and have her take the
      lead. It's by no means a reason to judge the game harshly, but it becomes a
      bit tedious in a single play-through. I don't remember how long the other games
      took me, but I was able to complete it in 7.5 hours. Also, be wary of relationships
      because you might get stuck all because it appears as if no one has new information
      while really you just need to be someone else. Great game overall!!
