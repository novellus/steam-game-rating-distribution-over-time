    about_the_game: Din's Legacy is an action RPG with mutating characters, set in
      a dynamic, evolving, fantasy world for Windows, Mac, and Linux.<br><br>During
      the Orc Schism, the entire Orc race was violently split into Dark Orcs, Zombielords,
      and the Mutated. The Mutated are tainted with Orc blood, a zombie parasite,
      and necromancer magic. This makes people seriously mistrust and even fear them.
      The fact that they slowly mutate over time makes it even worse. Who is going
      to trust you when you grow horns overnight?<br><br>Despite all of this, the
      Mutated are actually more closely related to the Elves, both their behavior
      and physically. They want to prove this to the world, but they are facing a
      tremendous uphill battle.<br><br>The trickster god Din was intrigued by their
      chaotic mutations and burning desire to prove themselves to the world. Always
      in need of champions, he made a pact with the Mutated. Each volunteer would
      become one of his champions trying to save the world wherever Din sends them.
      In return, each time they die in his service he resurrects them to continue
      their service.<br><br>Din's Legacy, as well as the Mutated's and yours, are
      all in your hands! Can you be the Champion that is needed?<br><br>Features:<br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Experience your character mutating over time for good and
      bad<br></li><li>Guide your character's evolution (choosing/improving skills,
      suppressing unwanted mutations, etc)<br></li><li>Use mutation points to mutate
      your character towards another character or sub-class<br></li><li>Uniquely created
      worlds for every game, with different scenario, win/lose conditions, areas,
      monsters, items, and quests, give the player a new experience every time<br></li><li>Explore
      a dynamic, evolving, living world<br></li><li>Your choices truly impact the
