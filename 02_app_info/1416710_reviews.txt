Win enough money to strip the girl and that's pretty much it if you hadn't already guessed by the title. I got bored of betting high and relying on luck and and uninstalled pretty early. There's bound to be similar and better games on Steam. Ones that maybe have a correct spelling of achievement perhaps?","timestamp_created":1609523154,"timestamp_updated":1609523154,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxcnD3/YCe7a7vwI="}
