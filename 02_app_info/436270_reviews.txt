First of all, comparing it to a real time strategy game is apples and oranges. Ultimate General may just be a great game, but rts isn't for everyone, or doesn't have to be every time you want to play a game. I like turn based hex games!\n\nOther games of this style and genre may be more historically accurate and more complex, but again, it's apples and oranges. This game is a little on the casual side, and it definitely isn't a real battle simulator. But sometimes I just want to charge those cannons or outflank that line, without feeling like I need a Ph.D. in military history just to play a game. Every tree may not be in the right place, but that's OK with me.\n\nI sunk over 50 hours into this game and I enjoyed every bit of it. I only played the game on medium (of 3 levels) difficulty, and I only played as the Union, so the game offers future replay ability. I definitely feel like I got my money's worth.\n\nI also own and played Civil War: 1861 - no idea why i skipped 1862, but I will go back for it. I also recently took advantage of a big sale here on steam to buy 2 more Hexwar Games titles - Civil War: Bull Run 1861 and Civil War: Gettysburg. Rebs be warned, I am a battle hardened Hexwar veteran, and I'm coming to run you off the map.\n\nIn a nut shell, whatever this game isn't, it is a lot of casual fun and I recommend it for those looking for this particular brand of apple.","timestamp_created":1593241184,"timestamp_updated":1593241184,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8OSk+vICeZ3PkAI="}
