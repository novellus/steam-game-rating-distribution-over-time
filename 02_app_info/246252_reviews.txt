The courses themselves are really good (and challenging), but the fact that each course only includes the 5 minutes Score Attack and a Time Trial means they don't end up adding a lot of content.\n\nI recommend it, but only as part of the bundle. Then again, I recommend all DLCs as part of the bundle, and not by themselves.","timestamp_created":1592371599,"timestamp_updated":1592371599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556213021278381348","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46cqv4PICcJfEjgI="}
