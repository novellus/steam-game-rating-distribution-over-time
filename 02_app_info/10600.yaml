      \ This pack also includes three more exclusive Elite Units, previously unavailable\
      \ for sale. <br>\t\t\t\t\tEach elite unit brings with it the potential to open\
      \ up dramatic new strategies and turn the tide of your campaign. A cornerstone\
      \ of your Empire's land or naval forces, each has the potential to be used to\
      \ decisive and devastating effect. <br>\t\t\t\t\tEmpire: Total War Special Forces\
      \ Units &amp; Bonus Content consists of the following premium content for aficionados\
      \ of the Total War series. This content is for use with Empire: Total War. Once\

      \ single player game under the conditions stated below. <br>\t\t\t\t\t<br>\t\
      \t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>HMS Victory \x97 </strong>The Royal\
      \ Navy's most distinguished and formidable first rate ship of the line; Lord\
      \ Nelson's 104 gun flagship is one of the most heavily armed ships of the 18th\
      \ Century. This unit is available when playing as the British faction and your\
      \ technology has sufficiently advanced. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Rogers'\
      \ Rangers \x97 </strong>Major Robert Rogers' company of rangers are highly trained\
      \ elite light infantry, specializing in reconnaissance and special operations.\
      \ They are extremely mobile in even the most challenging environments. This\
      \ unit is available when playing as the British faction and your technology\
      \ has sufficiently advanced. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Ottoman Organ Gun\
      \ \x97 </strong>A viciously powerful field gun, able to inflict incredible damage\
      \ on the opposing army. Emphatic proof of the Ottoman Empire's advanced knowledge\
      \ of gunpowder and firearms technology. This unit is available when playing\
      \ as the Ottoman faction and your technology has sufficiently advanced. <br>\t\
      \t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Ghoorkas \x97 </strong>&quot;Better to die than be\
      \ a coward&quot; has been the motto of these elite Nepalese soldiers for centuries.\
      \ Disciplined, tough and courageous, they carry a deadly 18-inch long, curved\
      \ knife known as the kukri. This unit is available when controlling the Kashmir\
      \ territory. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Corso Terrestre Guerillas \x97 </strong>An\
      \ independent light infantry guerrilla regiment, experienced in skirmish and\
      \ stealth tactics. Surprise raids and ambushes are the guerillas' favored tactics,\
      \ a way to compensate for their limited number and light armor. This unit is\
      \ available when playing as the Spanish faction and your technology has sufficiently\
      \ advanced. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Bulkeley's Regiment \x97 </strong>A\
      \ French unit of Irish mercenaries with a fearsome reputation for hardiness.\
      \ Exceptionally tough and resilient, they make for a highly flexible and dependable\
      \ regiment. This unit is available when playing as the French faction and your\
      \ technology has sufficiently advanced. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li></ul>As of October\

      \ sale:<br>\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Death's Head Hussars \x97\
      \ </strong>The Prussian army's bravest and fiercest cavalry is trained to deliver\
      \ devastating volleys of musket fire while closing on the enemy. These daring\
      \ charges strike fear into even the most stalwart of opponents. This unit is\
      \ available when playing as Prussia and your technology has sufficiently advanced.\
      \ <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>The USS Constitution \x97 </strong>The legendary\
      \ heavy frigate of the United States Navy, used to great effect in capturing\
      \ enemy ships and running down fleeing opponents. Fast and heavily-armed, the\
      \ pinnacle of 18th Century US Navy power. This unit is available when playing\
      \ as the USA and your technology has sufficiently advanced. It may also be captured\
      \ by opposing factions. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>The Dahomey Amazons \x97\
      \ </strong>An elite female-only military regiment from West Africa. Disciplined\
      \ both in rifle drills and close combat, they are rightly feared for their incredible\
      \ courage and their practice of decapitating their captives. This unit is available\
      \ when holding territory in North Africa. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li></ul>"
