    review: "I'm a fan of the games this one is trying to be like but it's pretty\
      \ bland tbh. The music didn't help like you need to be pumped up but it just\
      \ felt like some royalty free midi \"creepy town\" music or whatever. Not saying\
      \ it was but that's what it felt like.\n\nI've been playing a lot of doom recently\
      \ so one thing that really stands out is how sluggish and clunky the movement\
      \ is. \nAlso I'm not sure if it's a sprite issue or what but I noticed enemies\
      \ would get stuck together and be unable to move. The enemies in general at\
      \ least as far as I could be bothered to play didn't have a ranged attack so\
      \ it was just kinda dull kiting them and either killing them or just walking\
      \ past. Like there were a couple of pumpkin men with guns but mostly just not.\n\
      \nLike it's not total garbage or anything but it's just kinda a worse version\
      \ of games from like 30 years ago and I don't really see any reason to play\
      \ it unless the idea of a pumpkin in a toilet is your idea of peak humour or\
      \ something."
