Only for masochist who like to play the same levels over and over. Spend your money on another good solitaire game, and ignore this one.","timestamp_created":1603467795,"timestamp_updated":1603467795,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o5uIq/UCfv7QqQI="}
