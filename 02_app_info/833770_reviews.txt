The second and other crucial point is that it's geared towards split-screen multiplayer, which sadly, almost seems like a distant past-time activity nowadays. If you were to approach this game with these two things in mind, then you're more likely to get some enjoyment out of it.\n\nThe game supports up to four players, all on one screen; thus, external controllers are almost a must, but workarounds can be made for mouse or keyboard players. An older controller such as a jury-rigged PS3 one worked, eventually. You choose the amount of players, the map, and a few adjustments of the in-game options. There's a small amount of different weapons, ranging from a few replicas of real guns to laser tag pistols, and more. Each one basically has the same purpose, and besides its rate-of-fire and visual or audio representation, they will all do the same damage. There's also an option to manually aim and zoom for each one, too. The screens, split into two or three or four ways, is cut up just right. It's a bit discouraging that each player spawns in the same spot after death, though.\n\nIn regards to the graphics, they have a certain consistency. Anyone expecting a mind-blowing AAA style should look elsewhere, as that's not the type of game this is being worked into. The maps are slightly varied, each one being set in the outdoors, with a suburbia atmosphere on all of them. The placements of hills, abandoned buildings, lookout towers, and other objects mixes it up a bit. It's also of note that the aftereffects of the weapons are nicely done. For example, seeing a stream of explosions coming towards you is a bit unsettling, and seeing the insides of buildings light up at night with gunfire at a distance looks great.\n\nFor the most part, the sound effects are minimal. The best sounding weapon are the retro lasers, which gives off a satisfying explosion sound upon impact. There doesn't seem to be any music, but it's better to have nothing than something half-done. Since this game is a physical split-screen experience, music would just be drowned out in the background, anyway.\n\nAs previously mentioned, split-screen gaming (especially four players) is at an all time low, since when it comes to split-screen shooters, maybe console games such as Playstation 2's [b]Red Faction II[/b] or [b]Quake III Arena[/b] and Nintendo 64's [b]Hexen[/b] or [b]Goldeneye 007[/b] would come to mind. Not only are games phasing it out in the modern era, they are phasing out local play completely. The fact that a newer game exists for the sole purpose of filling that void is a surprise to see. Despite the minimalism and random flaws, Couch Party Game Night is a solid split-screen experience, as it harks back to the older days with no regrets.\n\n[i]6.5/10[/i]\n\n[u]Top 3 Pros:[/u]\n\n-Four people can play locally via split-screen.\n-Some cool graphical effects.\n-A decent amount of small updates from the developer.\n\n[u]Top 3 Cons:[/u]\n\n-The maps all have a bit too much in common with each other.\n-Minimal sounds throughout the game.\n-Spawn locations are not shuffled around.","timestamp_created":1604138684,"timestamp_updated":1604177165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4rJ+awPUCcp2iqwI="}
