Other buildings turning black when selecting a building is a feature, see link above. However, black font on dark background seems to be an individual technical problem, for me the font is yellow-white and well readable.\n\nThis game is inspired by Transport Tycoon, but [i]it isn't Transport Tycoon[/i]. It's more of a puzzle game than an economy simulation. There are predesigned levels with increasing size and complexity and a specific profit target. You have to create a road network consisting of different road types to connect the industry. Then you redistribute the limited workforce to optimize production. Houses need to be supplied with various goods, so they can get bigger and have place for more workers. This part works similar to the Anno series. The products not needed by houses have to be brought to export stations to make money. You don't have to buy anything, all that matters is the difference between income per second and upkeep per second.\n\nThe music is surprisingly good for that price range. Apropos price, it seems a bit too high compared to similar games on Steam, but the devs need to eat. If this game won't pay off they can't make any more games, so I see the money more as backing of a startup dev team.","timestamp_created":1452016376,"timestamp_updated":1452016376,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568120062351226807","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjPO6idICdJ/GTQ=="}
