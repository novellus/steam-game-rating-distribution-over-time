    review: 'Interesting little game.  Rough around the edges and not translated very
      well (some text toward the end wasn''t translated at all), but the ending justified
      the playthrough.  I''m a bit slow with puzzles so it took me a while to collect
      all of the dates, but someone could potentially play through this game pretty
      quickly if they knew what they were doing, and probably in under 5 minutes if
      it wasn''t their first playthrough.  Just a tip for the English version since
      I wasn''t sure at first: dates are in MM/DD/YYYY format as opposed to DD/MM/YYYY.'
