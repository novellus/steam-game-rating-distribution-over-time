    review: "Spooky Station is a solid and cheap 9-1 game pack. I'll be briefly analysing\
      \ each game from best to worst and I'll give a score out of 10 for each of them\
      \ (based on the other games and their quality)\n\n[b] 1 -  Spookids (10/10)\
      \ [/b]\nGreat shoot'em up overall, the pixel art is gorgeous and the gameplay\
      \ is incredibly fun. It has 4 playable characters, at the moment I'm writing\
      \ this I've only played with one of them but I'll definitely will play again\
      \ to test the other three. It has a wide variety of weapons which are very well\
      \ balanced, they all are consistent while being pretty different gameplay wise,\
      \ and that's a pretty incredible feat for a game to pull.\n\n[b] 2 - Wishing\
      \ Sarah (10/10) [/b]\nWishing Sarah is the sequel to Dreaming Sarah, a great\
      \ puzzle/adventure/horror game that you should definitely check out if you haven't\
      \ yet, it's available in the Steam store for a extremely cheap price. Wishing\
      \ Sarah is a short adventure game with some easy puzzles and an extremely unsettling\
      \ atmosphere that doesn't rely on cheap jumpscares to make the player feel a\
      \ false sense of horror. The pixel art is pretty and the gameplay feels good.\n\
      \n[b] 3 - Thursday the 12th (9/10) [/b]\nExtremely unsettling first person exploration\
      \ game, doesn't need to pull of cheap jumpscares in order to make you feel uncomfortable\
      \ or scared. You play as a murderer trough his daily routine and find some unsettling\
      \ stuff about his \"job\" while at it. The only downside of this game is that\
      \ it is pretty short, I would love to have this as a completed game with a fully\
      \ fleshed out story. The controls are simple as they should be and the kinda\
      \ drawn graphics just accentuate the horror aspect of this game, as if the graphics\
      \ are trying to lure you into this false sense of security with the cartoonish\
      \ aspect.\n\n[b] 4 - Tower of 100 Floors (8/10) [/b]\nSolid and challenging\
      \ rogue-like with great pixel-art and good gameplay. This is one of the games\
      \ with highest replayability in this pack, you'll probably be stuck with it\
      \ for a long time before you can complete it (hell I didn't even complete it\
      \ yet). I just think there are some issues with balancing, there are 5 guns\
      \ in the game and definitely the SMG is the best one, dual-wielding it just\
      \ makes it even more powerful. There is a remote controlled RPG which is also\
      \ pretty powerful, but things start to look kinda odd when the RPG (which drops\
      \ from chests) are weaker than the dual wielding SMGs (you can get one SMG right\
      \ when you start a run, also they drop from enemies and chests kinda frequently).\
      \ There is a katana which is basically a long range knife, it's pretty useful\
      \ for deflecting bombs, for example, and decently powerful overall, so you'll\
      \ feel like using it along your runs. The pistols are weak to use solo but decent\
      \ when dual wielding and the shotguns are just underwhelming, I honestly feel\
      \ no motivation to use them, solo or dual-wield. Also the pit mechanic is pretty\
      \ infuriating.\n\n[b] 5 - Spooky Cooking (6/10)[/b]\nA game where you have to\
      \ tap a pumpkin to throw it into a cauldron while avoiding some obstacles. You\
      \ can collect 2 powerups, one that makes your pumpkins invincible for a while\
      \ and one that lets you throw pumpkins faster also for a while. The art is good\
      \ and there's nothing wrong with the gameplay, but is a pretty bland game, it\
      \ brings nothing new to the table nor it attempts to, it's not bad but it isn't\
      \ good either. It ends up being the game with the most replayability value out\
      \ of the pack for the number of achievements this game has. Again, it's not\
      \ a bad game, so getting these achievements might get you hooked for a while.\n\
      \n[b] 6 - Killing Moon (6/10) [/b]\nA pixel art puzzle game that I would've\
      \ given at least an 8 if it wasn't for the awful controls. The pixel art of\
      \ this game is pretty good, the plot is interesting enough but the person who\
      \ made the controls (at least for keyboard + mouse) really dropped the ball.\
      \ The controls are confusing, moving your character with the mouse doesn't feels\
      \ good and it would just not work randomly at some times and interacting with\
      \ objects or people is pretty infuriating. An easy fix for this game would be\
      \ to just put movement in the WASD or arrow keys and polishing more the interactions\
      \ with the mouse or, even better, tying interactions to a key in the keyboard.\n\
      \n[b] 7 - Worship the Demon Lord (5/10) [/b]\nCute game that is probably fun\
      \ to play with a friend but not really that interesting playing alone. You play\
      \ trough some simple minigames, most of them you collect things to gain points.\
      \ There are 3 minigames that catched my attention, one being the invisible maze\
      \ one which is the most interesting (at least for me), the other 2 being one\
      \ in which you have to collect candles (and if you die you just get spawnkilled\
      \ because the respawn system sucks) and other that is a really awful rhythm\
      \ game that really doesn't sync to the music or anything at all. \n\n[b] 8 -\
      \ Cosmic Rain (4/10) [/b]\nA game about putting blobs in a certain order into\
      \ a cauldron. The controls are pretty clunky, the powers are kinda weird and\
      \ the music is a 5 second loop that will drain 1% of your sanity each minute\
      \ you play. I kinda dig the graphics but they also need some polish. The game\
      \ is not randomly generated, so once you finish it you won't feel like playing\
      \ it anymore, I honestly think the random generation factor would be a huge\
      \ thing to improve the game, instead of playing the same levels over and over.\n\
      \n[b] 9 - Curse Bringer (0/0) [/b]\nIt's a text based game that takes about\
      \ 5 minutes to complete if you're a fast reader. It's boring, there are around\
      \ 4 choices in the game but I don't think they even matter that much, there\
      \ are about 2 soundtracks that are used kinda randomly, the main character or\
      \ any of the characters she interacts with aren't interesting at all, I zoned\
      \ out at a point and that while playing a text game is saying something. When\
      \ you complete this game you are awarded with an incredible black screen and\
      \ nothing more. Honestly, playing trough anything with just text and a black\
      \ background is pretty boring for me, but when the thing I'm playing is so short\
      \ that the characters aren't even introduced properly or the plot isn't interesting\
      \ nor goes nowhere... Like, come on, it could at least be a VN with images or\
      \ something, I don't know, but it could be something at least, I feel like I\
      \ just played nothing.\n\nAs you can see, it's kind of a mixed bag, however\
      \ the low price of the game makes it worth your buck, the top 4 games alone\
      \ are worth the value of the pack. Also I think it's important to support these\
      \ devs, I'm sure they all have potential and the ones who kinda let me down\
      \ in this pack just didn't have their moment of glory yet, so give them all\
      \ a chance, I'm sure if you play this you'll have opinions that are different\
      \ than mine."
