As someone who hasn't played any games like this (I've watched people play them), it really helped me understand the mechanics. I think that if this game was fleshed out more (more clues before going in the building, more notes, more spaces, opening locked doors, etc) it would add to the suspense and pull you into the story more. All-in-all, a decent little walking simulator.","timestamp_created":1609569953,"timestamp_updated":1609569953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zoz24PYCcITSvwI="}
