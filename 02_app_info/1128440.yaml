      [i](note: since the game is pretty much identical to the developer''s other
      solitaire games, my reviews are also very similar.)[/i]


      the usual +1/-1 solitaire with two gameplay modes, one lets you replay individual
      levels (my preference), the other only entire sets of 10 levels, and you can
      only start pro mode after playing a bit on newbie.


      there are 120 levels and completion depends on removing the gold cards, so much
      so that when you click on the last one, the round ends with a perfect rating,
      no matter how many cards are left. it''s kind of weird because you might miss
      out on some extra money, but there''s a lot of it anyway and you only need it
      for power-ups, so it''s not a huge deal.


      there are 3 helpers (undo, joker and shuffle), and undo is ''universal'' instead
      of per level, which I''m not a fan of, it makes levels a lot more difficult
      (or frustrating), but there''s something to spend money on, at least, and since
      you can do so anytime while playing, it can also trivialize levels. as usual,
      it''s a matter of self-control and patience (or impatience), though a more balanced
      and less power-up-reliant game would''ve worked too.


      the music is fine, if not as good as in some other solitaire games by the same
      developer, but the sound effect for removing a card is just as annoying. luckily,
      there are separate volume sliders, but it''s still not a widescreen game. spelling
      is inconsistent (profis/professional) and the multiplier keeps going down even
      if you alt-tab, as always.


      another peculiar thing is cards instantly disappearing when you click them,
      no animation, but I got used to it and actually appreciated the game not wasting
      my time. it took about 5 hours to complete on newbie mode, but it''d last a
      lot longer without any power-ups and if you wanted to perfect every level on
      professional mode.


      all in all, it''s an average solitaire, many better ones around, but when you
      start running out of them, like myself, it''s not a bad deal on sale.'
