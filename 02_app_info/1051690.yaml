    review: "I'll be perfectly honest, I'm in my mid-20s and never really had a childhood\
      \ that involved old-school shooter classics like Doom and Hexen and Wolfenstein.\
      \ Because of this, I feel like I never really get sucked into games that rely\
      \ on the Nostalgia factor like Dusk or Amid Evil. I enjoyed both of those games,\
      \ but the entire time I felt as if I was supposed to be reliving the \"glory\
      \ days\" of gaming which I never experienced in the first place. \n\nSo with\
      \ this in mind, let me tell you in no uncertain terms that nightmare reaper\
      \ KICKS ASS. It has that retro run and gun high-speed chaos that you find in\
      \ these throwback games but thats just the base of this delicious cake. The\
      \ wild variety of weapons, upgrades, maps, secrets and enemies all add to this\
      \ incredibly addictive experience thats not quite a roguelite and not quite\
      \ a retro shooter. I really cannot put into words why this game gives me so\
      \ much joy. Maybe its the feeling that naturally arises when the game offers\
      \ a weapon thats essentailly a pokeball so you can capture enemies and summon\
      \ them later to do your bidding. Maybe its the explosions of pixel blood and\
      \ money that happen when you blast a zombie in the head with a super shotgun.\
      \ Or maybe its just the fact that there are no real flaws in this game expect\
      \ for its \"unfinished\" nature. I put that in quotes becasue while this game\
      \ is still in early access, theres a solid 20-30 hours of awesome gameplay already\
      \ packed in here.\n\nBut this game. If you are unsure, put it on your wishlist\
      \ and grab it next time it goes 25% off. I cant think of any demographic who\
      \ wouldnt have a BLAST playing this unless you are wholly against shooting games.\
      \ The dev team raised the bar on this one."
