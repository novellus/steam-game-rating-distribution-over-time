    about_the_game: "Dee-6: Dice Defenders is a tactical board game in which you will\
      \ feel like the commander of a spaceship with a crew of 6 dice. Each die has\
      \ its own role, depending on the value rolled on it (for example: shooting ship\
      \ lasers, restoring shields, repairing the hull, healing wounded dice, etc.).\
      \ You need to hold out under the onslaught of constantly arriving threats in\
      \ order to successfully complete the flight. These threats can be external (pirate\
      \ ships, asteroid fields, nebulae) and internal (boarding, spatial anomalies\
      \ and even alien parasites!). You'll collect coins completing missions, which\
      \ will allow to pay mercenary services to correct critical situations in your\
      \ favor. At the end of each mission, you will have a fight with bosses with\
      \ unique features.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Complete\
      \ missions and discover new threats. Over 200 types of threats!<br />\r\n* Unlock\
      \ all 6 ships, each with their own unique play style.<br />\r\n* Play 5 different\
      \ game modes, including campaign and random battle.<br />\r\n* Complete achievements\
      \ and get coins for it. 63 achievements!<br />\r\n* Win battles and improve\
      \ your statistics. Career growth will give you more coins and points!<br />\r\
      \n* Easy to modify. You can easily create your own threats and missions, as\
      \ well as translations into your own language.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game\
      \ does not have any official relations to board card game Deep Space D-6, its\
      \ creators TauLeaderGames and Tony Go (but it's certainly inspired by it)."
