If you like auto chess and roguelikes, this is a must buy. If you like roguelikes but aren't keen on the auto battler gameplay, I'd at least encourage you to read further, as perhaps this game could succeed in swaying you more favorably to the genre, as it is a single-player experience and allows you to play auto chess at your own pace, while keeping its roguelike elements intact. I rarely post reviews, but this game is so good I feel compelled to write a review on its current progress. This game is absolutely amazing. I cannot give it enough praise. The amount of effort turning an Auto Chess battler into a single player roguelike must be daunting, and they've pulled it off well.\n\n     The auto battle portion is as you'd expect if you've played other auto chess games. The roguelike aspect though is what keeps me playing this game over the long term. Affix modifiers that increase difficulty don't feel brutal, the difficulty is largely up to you, and the rewards you unlock after each run all make this a silky smooth progression curve. This game makes you want to keep pushing the edge of your limits and there is a ton of build experimentation here. I realize these are emotional appeals rather than technical praises, but to me that just means they're making the game correctly. \n\n     That said, this is not a finished product. The English isn't perfect, but it passes and is easy to discern. Here are my critiques of the current progress:\n     - Summoners are currently not fleshed out as much as most others. You can't even build a full team of them yet, so I hope they have big plans for this game's future. They can still be a nice pick in other ways as there are multiple ways to synergize a team comp, but the same could be said for any character class.\n\n     - I would like to see (small) character portraits on either side of the board which allow you to target the unit when moused over, rather than having to accurately cast a single-target spell during the battle chaos. This game can have matches that are neck and neck, and players should not be punished if they can't quite click on the desired unit correctly or on time. Portraits would solve this and I believe it a necessary improvement, as close fights are inevitable.\n     For now, this game is fantastic and I hope it does well; it deserves it.","timestamp_created":1609829432,"timestamp_updated":1609829916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw1uPV6PYCcNvPwAI="}
