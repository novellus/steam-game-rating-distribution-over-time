    review: "[b][i] The title confuses me [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Who [/h1]\n\nThe game was\
      \ developed by 2D Heroes and Ursa Games and published by 2D Heroes. The only\
      \ other game on their resume on this platform is Recursion Deluxe.\n\n[h1] What\
      \ [/h1]\n\nYou play as a female or male cat and the purpose, according to the\
      \ description, is to get back home to your loved ones. Apparently, God, life,\
      \ the atmosphere, the universe are completely against this because everything\
      \ and anything is trying to kill you. What did you do to tick so many off? It's\
      \ an old-schooled hard as all get out RNG platformer...do what you will with\
      \ that.\n\n[h1] Where [/h1]\n\ndoes this go wrong, exactly? First of all, by\
      \ creating a game like this, you're alienating a very large audience. You're\
      \ only hope is for the masses to love this, for some reason, or a Youtuber to\
      \ play this and it seem like it's better than it actually is; causing a stampede\
      \ of purchases. if you're in it to make games, then, I can't touch ya but if\
      \ you're in tis to make money.....eeeeennnnnhhhh you may be going about this\
      \ the wrong way. The other game on the resume, Recursion Deluxe, is exactly\
      \ the same thing. The only difference here is that the main character is an\
      \ anthro cat which comes off as \"baity\" rather than original. Also, some stages\
      \ are a one-shot and that sucks. You'll be forced to start over due to beginner\
      \ traps as well as bad RNG, the falling fireballs being hidden the scoreboard,\
      \ inconsistent hit boxes on the fireballs (On the bridge stage, you can pass\
      \ right through them sometimes but if you touch even a pixel behind them its\
      \ instant death). \n\n[h1] Why [/h1]\n\nshould you play this? Another notch\
      \ on the belt to prove how hardcore you are, I suppose. This goes to veteran\
      \ masochists and people who complain about people like me but secretly play\
      \ anyway just to see if they stack up...you know who you are...\n\n[h1] How\
      \ [/h1]\n\ndoes it stack up? It doesn't stand out in any particular way. You\
      \ move and you jump. That's it. You're opinion of how this game stacks up is\
      \ completely dependent on your kaizo resume. In my opinion, it's in the middle\
      \ in terms of difficulty. Replays are obviously a must for games like this but\
      \ once I got the hang of it; I was able to breeze pretty quickly after about\
      \ three tries or so.\n\n[h1] Is [/h1]\n\nIts a buck and it's not long. To be\
      \ honest; I'm getting kinda tired of these games but it was serviceable enough.\
      \ I didn't have a bad time playing; it's just becoming a bit too \"samey\" for\
      \ me. \n\nYeah, thumbs up from me, here. Again, no \"meh' button but it does\
      \ lean more to the positives than toward the negatives as the things that I\
      \ complained about are easily worked around unless you're just poor at reaction\
      \ or just plain unlucky. The only reason why I can see or understand passing\
      \ this up is because you have some kind of 'standards\". I would classify this\
      \ as baby's first kaizo. The presentation, controls, and music are okay enough\
      \ and the price seems reasonable to me. if you're looking to try the more \"\
      gut-punchy\" games; this might not be a bad start."
