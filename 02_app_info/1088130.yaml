    about_the_game: The late 90s and early 2000s were an incredible time for games,
      creating both titanic franchises and floods of shovelware. Out of this endless
      morass of awful games, Sextris emerged as a true legend. Or, actually, several
      games called Sextris emerged. There are at least 3 versions of the bootleg drop
      puzzle, with the best known simply displaying tasteful nudes on successfully
      clearing lines. This was not the apex of Sextris, however. The most compelling
      flavor instead drops puzzle pieces designed to look like naked people in the
      throes of ecstasy, their bodies embracing and tangling into a mass of naked
      flesh as the game continues.<br><br>Perhaps you too had the experience of downloading

    review: 'The game is a tongue in cheek but fun (unofficial) take on the latest
      popular instalment of the Tetris franchise Tetris Effect and it would be good
      for a quick game every now and then if it wasn''t for the fact after a minute
      or two the blocks stop falling, very disappointed and yes it is cheap but that
      don''t mean you should get something broken and buggy.

      Had potential but due to a major flaw will be uninstalled and hidden in my library...'
