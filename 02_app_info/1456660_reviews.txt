I can assure you that the times posted on the LiveWire leaderboards are 100% genuine runs and we validate these runs every single day. The thing is that some users have become very experienced and they have discovered ways in which to save time during their runs-- if you'd like you should join us on the Ball at Work discord (link inside the game's Speedrun menu) and you can discover a lot of new tricks for yourself and improve your time :)\n\nAs for the leaderboards of the individual levels, it is possible that some users may have posted incorrect times during beta testing (we have ensure that they can't do that any more) but I will certainly have a look at all the leaderboards again and clean them up"}],"cursor":"AoJwqaS9z/YCes6uvQI="}
