    review: "Mage\u2019s Initiation: Reign of the Elements is a fabulous revival of\
      \ the classic point and click adventure genre. \n\nWith witty dialogue, challenging\
      \ puzzles and beautiful artwork, it is one of the best point and click games\
      \ since the Sierra golden age of the 90s. I would recommend it to any lover\
      \ of this classic genre. \n\nHowever, it is not without some flaws. The three\
      \ that stuck out most would be the combat, the 2D animated cutscenes, and (some\
      \ of) the voice acting. \n\nFirstly, the combat. Personally, I don\u2019t feel\
      \ that point and click games mesh very well with any kind of combat system.\
      \ In my mind, it should be about using your brain, not your reflexes. To put\
      \ it lightly, combat felt very clunky and unresponsive. I ended up actively\
      \ running from any combat that wasn\u2019t scripted, unless I was grinding materials\
      \ for the merchants. Even then, when there was any more than two or three enemies\
      \ on screen it felt very hectic and I found myself constantly taking damage\
      \ and draining my reserves of potions. This kind of active combat system just\
      \ seems out of place in a point and click adventure. Going back to the \u201C\
      brains over reflexes\u201D philosophy behind point and click games, if there\
      \ had to be any kind of combat, I would\u2019ve preferred some kind of turn\
      \ based encounter system akin to classic RPGs.\n \nSecondly, the 2D animated\
      \ cutscenes. These were very unappealing. The artistic incongruity between the\
      \ cutscenes and the beautifully crafted portraits, backgrounds and sprites was\
      \ jarring to say the least. The first time one played I thought I had accidently\
      \ alt+tab\u2019d out of the game and some horrible youtube animation had started\
      \ playing. The characters were unrecognizable. I didn\u2019t know what character\
      \ had been bribed by the mage until I later entered the tavern and got some\
      \ complimentary dialogue. I said out loud, \u201COhhh, THAT was supposed to\
      \ be Pug? Really?\u201D They reminded me a lot of the Zelda CDI animations,\
      \ meaning rushed and done without care. It would\u2019ve been far better and\
      \ probably far cheaper to just use the portraits and dialogue boxes for those\
      \ plot points as opposed to these awful animations.\n\nThirdly, (some of) the\
      \ voice acting. This one is mostly a nitpick. The overwhelming majority of the\
      \ voice work was great. There were just a few voices that seemed subpar or annoying.\
      \ However, if it was just some minor characters, I wouldn\u2019t be including\
      \ this point. The biggest offender in this category is the initiate himself,\
      \ D\u2019arc. I don\u2019t want to blame the voice actor for this. I\u2019d\
      \ rather blame whoever was directing him. I feel that he wasn\u2019t given much\
      \ context or direction in the booth. Many times the reads feel out of place,\
      \ with a complete disregard for the mood of the situation in his inflections\
      \ and tone of voice. Most of this could\u2019ve been fixed with some better\
      \ direction and more takes. A lot of the lines feel like they were the first\
      \ take, like the actor had just read the line for the first time. This wouldn\u2019\
      t have been a problem at all if he hadn\u2019t been the protagonist, being that\
      \ the player hears his voice in every interaction with the world or other characters.\
      \ But I\u2019d like to reiterate, the vast majority of the voice work was great.\n\
      \nNow with the negativity out of the way, I\u2019d like to talk about the many\
      \ positive aspects of this game. First off is the art. It is absolutely stunning.\
      \ All of the environments feel alive and unique. The forests feel brimming with\
      \ life, the town is wonderfully lived-in and the various rooms of the Mage\u2019\
      s Tower are each pieces of art on their own. The portraits, as stated before,\
      \ are stellar. Especially when compared to ADG Interactive\u2019s past portraits\
      \ (I\u2019m mostly familiar with the King\u2019s Quest remakes), the vast improvements\
      \ are evident. Every character has a unique design and it always lends greatly\
      \ to their characterization. Although, I still think D\u2019arc looks suspiciously\
      \ like Adam Driver.\n\nNow on to the puzzles. There is nothing better in my\
      \ mind than roaming around a densely themed world and searching for the answers\
      \ to roadblocks. Most of the puzzling was satisfying to figure out. My favorite\
      \ \u201CAh-ha!\u201D moment in the whole game was how to acquire strong liquor.\
      \ The use of magic was also a great layer to add and widen the scope of puzzle\
      \ solving. The more tools in your arsenal the better. However, one nitpick I\
      \ had (sorry to get back to a negative) was the difficulty of distinguishing\
      \ certain interactable items and the background. One was a drain, one was a\
      \ fence and another was a helmet. Those caused me a decent amount of frustration.\
      \ But overall, this aspect of the game was sterling. \n\nThe story. Oh, the\
      \ story. I thought I had it all figured out. Get three mcguffins, a story as\
      \ old as King\u2019s Quest 1, I thought to myself. I even thought I saw the\
      \ twist coming, but it had me totally surprised. I fell for it hook line and\
      \ sinker, and I had never been so happy to have been wrong. I could say much\
      \ more, but I\u2019ll restrain myself.\n\nI suppose I\u2019ve prattled on about\
      \ this long enough. In summary, although the game has some glaring flaws it\
      \ proves to be a satisfying revival to a genre so often overlooked. I hope that\
      \ the developers will listen to the compliments as well as the criticisms of\
      \ all the lovely reviewers here and take them into consideration for the much\
      \ anticipated sequel to this marvelous work of art.\nThank you Himalaya Studios."
