It's also 'funny' how the start of the game has quite a bit of story and then it just stops. The elements added (skills that you can improve, individual characters that you can use in certain levels to your advantage) make for a really interesting game, but adding levels that require you to make 16 (or more) specific matches in sequence just kill any fun playing this game.","timestamp_created":1609487955,"timestamp_updated":1609502640,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568181812763214111","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+Kj13vYCf9qqvwI="}
