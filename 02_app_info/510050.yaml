    review: 'This is hardcore parkour, insane, ragey game. if you rage or are triggered
      easily I suggest you dont play this game. you might break your monitor if you
      do. Besides that though 10 seconds is where you pretty much parkour your way
      through 4 arenas each with, correct me if im wrong, 10 levels. The art style
      is very unique, very pixelated and, in my opinion, just a very sort of fun style
      like flappy bird. Theres happiness and then theres rage. controls are pretty
      simple and its just another one of those addicting ragey parkour games. Me personally,
      I had to stop at arena 2 because if I did''nt I would not be typing this, I
      would be looking for a new not broken part of my computer. There are also some
      pretty cool/pretty weird ideas and unique gameplay. For example, you only have
      10 seconds to beat a level like it says in the title of the game. Theres also
      magnets and reversed gravity I thought were pretty cool. So besides the rage,
      overall I reccommend this game.


      I will rate this game a 10 out of 10, it was a good time waster that I would
      NOT play again because god knows what could happen :D'
