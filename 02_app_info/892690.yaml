    about_the_game: "Morgan Shane has disappeared, leaving a bloody trail of mayhem\
      \ in her wake. But is she a monster or a victim of something far more sinister\
      \ than the authorities are imagining? And the biggest question of all: Can you\
      \ unravel the mystery before the same dark force that targeted Morgan finds\
      \ you?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDaemon_9 is not a movie... it's not a game... it's\
      \ both. It's like a horror movie inside an escape room that puts YOU in the\
      \ heart of the story. Full-motion video, graphic images and challenging brain\
      \ teasers intertwine to spin a deeply layered story of supernatural terror and\
      \ mystery.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGAMEPLAY:<br />\r\nWhen you first launch Daemon_9\
      \ you are greeted by a message from an anonymous friend of Morgan's who is on\
      \ a mission to find and save her -- and uncover the truth of what happened to\
      \ her. Desperate for help, he is asking for your help. Your only tool is a backup\
      \ of his hard drive. And that's where your journey begins -- sifting through\
      \ the material he's unearthed in his quest for the truth. But the real challenge\
      \ is to keep from falling victim to the same dark forces that claimed his friends,\
      \ and by &quot;getting involved&quot; you may have made yourself vulnerable.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe trail will eventually lead you out onto the web and into\
      \ a different kind of web -- one woven with international conspiracy and supernatural\
      \ forces. You will need wits, patience, and nerve to unravel the mystery, save\
      \ Morgan, and save yourself."

    review: 'It''s a well-made game and the acting and effects are passable, albeit
      not amazing.

      Comparable to games like WTTG with 4th wall breaking similar to, say, Pony Island.


      It is fairly short and easy, took me about 1.5 hours to complete with no guides
      or googling.


      Keep in mind that if you are streaming this or are sensitive to certain things,
      the game has references to sexual violence, graphic violent scenes and one of
      the fake sites, "AKOS", has some highly racist and homophobic language.

      The latter seems completely unnecessary as it does not add to the story in the
      slightest and is a confusingly bad addition to an otherwise well-crafted game.'
