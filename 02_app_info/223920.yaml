    about_the_game: 'Unity of Command is an innovative and refreshing operational-level
      wargame that covers  the entire 1942/43 Stalingrad Campaign on the Eastern Front.
      Playable from both the Axis and Soviet perspective, it strives to recreate the
      strategy, the forces involved and the general tension of that crucial period
      in World War II.<br />

      <br />

      Experience the highly fluid, enormously large battles of maneuver in a turn-based
      strategy setting. Take command in this mobile, back-and-forth sort of war where
      logistics and poor weather are often the decider, and defeat and victory are
      sometimes just a mile, or a day, apart.'
