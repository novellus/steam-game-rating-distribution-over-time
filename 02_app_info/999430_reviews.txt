Always liked the one from NORAD, so this one was a must-buy for me, especially since it's not expensive. \n\nBut unlike the NORAD tracker, which tells you to come back on 1. December, this one is active all through the year. Just click on \"Where is Santa\", and you can see him flying around the world, looking for items and good children, and then flies back home to read some letters, and then goes off again. \n\nIt's so much more fun to be able to see something all year round, especially for someone, like me, who loves everything Christmas, and loves it all year round. :)","timestamp_created":1598866435,"timestamp_updated":1598866435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u7X3ofQCfsn0ngI="}
