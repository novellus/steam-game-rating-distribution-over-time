    review: "You're a captain who loses his ship due to mutiny, left only with a raft,\
      \ one cannon and his lieutenant. I don't know why you and him are Ferrets or\
      \ why the game puts so much emphasis on this, but I honestly do not care. It's\
      \ a straight up pirate game and nothing less.\n\nThe map is procedurally generated\
      \ and split into grids. The further a grid is from origin, the stronger the\
      \ ships roaming in it become. The grids are small enough to traverse them in\
      \ a few minutes, but large enough to not see any land sometimes.\n\nWithin each\
      \ grid you start with a blank map and have to discover islands on your own,\
      \ or you can buy map data from a cartographer (if you find one). Islands have\
      \ various houses at which you can dock, like Fishermen, Farmers, Shipwrights,\
      \ Merchants, Artists, Bankers, etc. You interact with these exclusively through\
      \ the UI, you never actually leave your ship.\n\nIn the early game, you'll want\
      \ to do some trading so you can buy a new ship. Or if you're feeling lucky you\
      \ can try to board a bigger ship and take it over, however this has a low rate\
      \ of success. After you have a decently large ship, you'll probably want to\
      \ upgrade it further.\n\nThere is an NPC on islands who sells upgrades, but\
      \ they always only sell one kind, out of speed, maneuverability, cannon power\
      \ and storage capacity. So you will be busy exploring and finding multiple Shipwrights\
      \ who can satisfy your upgrading needs.\n\nIf your ship gets destroyed, you\
      \ lose it, as well as your unbanked money (or half of it in softcore) and it's\
      \ back to raft business. However there is also some permanent progression with\
      \ the three existing factions. You constantly gain and lose reputation with\
      \ factions according to your actions and under which flag you sail. This way\
      \ you can rank up and gain a number of perks, most of which require you to sail\
      \ under a specific flag. Your flags are basically your skills, depending on\
      \ what you want to do, you raise a different flag that gives you different bonuses.\n\
      \n[h3]Bottom Line[/h3]\nIt's a neat roguelite pirating experience. The sailing\
      \ feels weighty and your ship accurately floats with the volumetric waves. The\
      \ world is endless and you can go wherever you want. It has the trinity of exploration,\
      \ trade and combat and while neither of those are exceptional, they are all\
      \ decent, and most importantly, not annoying. I like the lack of flashy telegraphs\
      \ for cannons and wind, it makes the game surprisingly immersive for what it\
      \ is.\nCompared to Sea of Thieves I like that this is a singleplayer game, with\
      \ progress beyond visuals. Compared to Atlas I like its simplicity, at least\
      \ when it comes to stripping away everything that is not sailing related, and\
      \ compared to Salt, it's actually a game and looks better too.\n\n[h3]My Suggestions[/h3]\n\
      What this game needs most in my opinion is in-depth ship customization, to enable\
      \ greatly different playstyles (even within combat itself). I would take a look\
      \ at the battle royale pirate game \"Maelstrom\" for some inspiration on how\
      \ to do satisfying functional customization that goes beyond just upgrading\
      \ 4 numbers straight-forwardly.\nAlso perhaps some \"mysterious\" grids that\
      \ have undead ships roaming around, that are high risk / high reward in some\
      \ way.\nA first person view and ability to walk around on your ship would be\
      \ awesome too.\n\n[h3]Meta[/h3]\nThe dev is putting out huge content updates,\
      \ bugfixes and performance improvements left and right, even in the short time\
      \ since I started playing. In this light I'm perfectly happy with the price\
      \ tag. If you only care about the immediate bang for the buck I would place\
      \ this at around 10\u20AC (Yes you can play this potentially infinitely, but\
      \ so far the content/systems aren't thrilling enough to make that happen yet)\n\
      \nAhoy\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2231563888"
