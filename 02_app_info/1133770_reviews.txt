Read previous tip notes in your monster journel if you miss them.\n[*]Movement speed is torturously slow. There is no run option. Seems like an attempt to artificially stretch out the game's length.\n[*]Animation could not even exist at all during sex scenes and there'd be very little difference.\n[*]Point-and-click style options are very obvious.\n[*]You can get the best parts of the game from the screenshot section of the community hub.","timestamp_created":1609589614,"timestamp_updated":1609716765,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lJKm5fYCcrTavwI="}
