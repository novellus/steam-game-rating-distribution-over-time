    review: One of my least favorite card games coming games like Hearthstone, Magic,
      Slay the Spire, Gwent, etc etc. Very low impact on deck building. Fun concept
      of having dueling players build decks to play specifically against one other
      person in a draft duel but the mechanics of the game make 90% of matches a rock
      paper scissors match of do you get to play your cards or does your opponent
      get to play theirs. No matter how cool of a deck you can build, either you win
      because you just did damage and the other player didn't get to do anything to
      make the match interesting or your that player who doesn't get to play. The
      only "close matches" I've played were mirror-like matches where both players
      just punched each other until the one with initiative gets the killing blow.
      I believe the game is still being developed while I'm writing this review so
      I'm sure they're still tweaking and I hope the experience gets better but unfortunately
      for me that would require completely abandoning several key mechanics that I
      believe they want to define the game.
