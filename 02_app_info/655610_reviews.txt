I didn't look at the description carefully enough and assumed that if this was a VR game on the Rift, it would have to be a VR game on Steam too, right? Welcome to yet another Steam VR title to drop/not include VR. And in pancake, this game is just awful. It's awful in VR too, but even the full game is a joke. The controls are just mashing A repeatedly, and whipping your poor horse as you steer. The horse is either wild and fast, or sluggish like a tank mired in mud. Even when it goes on sale, and I got it for .99 cents USD, it's not worth the price. I'll likely tinker around with it a bit more, but as it's pancake, there are surely better racing titles out there.","timestamp_created":1596480774,"timestamp_updated":1596480774,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9+vq2vMCcKmZmQI="}
