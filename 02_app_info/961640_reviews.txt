By this I mean that the story has little deviation connected to each female that you want to marry, and tends to stick with one main path that leads to a different ending. It seems more a kinetic novel, yet your choices do actually matter since you need to build up affection points with your target.\n\nWhile I did say that the sexual content was tasteful and not as overbearing as some other Visual Novels out there, I do not always need to have full sexual scenes in my stories for them to be considered good. Others may find that there is probably too much for how short the Visual Novel is and part of me would agree, however there will be readers who enjoy this kind of content and would not be bothered by the scenes. It is not a huge issue really, just a personal thing more than a problem with the story.\n\nPros:\nKemonomini and Maids. What more could you ask for. In all seriousness though, they have a diverse set of characters with different personalities that help with the teamwork structure of all the other characters. The creators put some time and thought into their characters to allow a variety of fans to pick which character(s) they may prefer over others. While some characters get more attention than others, you can still choose different choices that allow you to learn more about each character and how they fit in with the story.\n\nThe artwork is very well done and it very enjoyable to look at. The artist did a decent job with creating animal/human hybrids that actually fit both organisms to a very good degree. Usually it can be hard to make these kinds of characters and have them look good for the media they are associated with. There are not many different background locations since it is a single location the story plays out in, yet the detail is very good. The bathroom almost looks like a place of heaven for female who love giant bubble baths and cute decor.\n\nFor a Visual Novel by a small team this is a very enjoyable Yuri experience. It can have some minor issues, but with some more experience and more finances the team could come up with some very enjoyable work. I would like to see more work from them and will keep an eye on what they choose to work on. If you might want to give this short little gem a glance then I would say go ahead and give it a shot. Otherwise, you may want to hold back and see what other projects are out there that might give more interest to you.","timestamp_created":1596917740,"timestamp_updated":1596917740,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540389955043792725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnt7t5/MCeoyhmgI="}
