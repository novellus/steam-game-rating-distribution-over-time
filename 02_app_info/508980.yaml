      ><strong>THE STORY OF CRASHDAY</strong></h2><br>Starting as a hobby project\
      \ of two 14-year-olds in 1998, Robert Clemens and Jan Bodenstein developed a\
      \ vision for their game of dreams: Crashday \u2013 a game that would combine\
      \ elements of their back-then favourites Carmageddon (1996) and Stunts (1990).\
      \ In a time long before indie games became a normal thing, the duo taught themselves\
      \ about programming and creating game art to make their vision come true. Developer\
      \ Moonbyte Studios was born.<br><br>Fast-forward eight years, the PC racing\
      \ game actually hit the shelves in early 2006 \u2013 completed with the help\
      \ of development partner Replay Studios, and distributed by then-publisher Atari.\
      \ Long overdue and far more complex than in the developers' wildest dreams,\
      \ the game saw a positive reception amongst players worldwide. Crashday quickly\
      \ built up a community of passionate online players, track builders, and enthusiastic\
      \ modders. Last but not least due to extensive modding capabilities, the game\
      \ had eventually survived far longer than anyone had expected.<br><br>2017.\
      \ Already past its tenth anniversary and driven by tremendous support from a\
      \ few still-active Crashday players and fans, Moonbyte decided to bring their\
      \ \u201Cbaby\u201D back to Steam. Nowadays, in a fully digital landscape, the\
      \ way community-driven online games are played and shared has changed \u2013\
      \ perfect conditions for a game like Crashday, and surely the ideal opportunity\
      \ to pay tribute to the fans by making use of new technology and distribution\
      \ channels while staying true to its roots. This is Crashday: Redline Edition."
