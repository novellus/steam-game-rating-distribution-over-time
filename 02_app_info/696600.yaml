    about_the_game: "&quot;Between Planets&quot; is a survival-based sandbox game\
      \ based on exploration. Players need to explore on the planet constantly, collect\
      \ materials on the planet and build their own base to survive.<br><br>\_\_The\
      \ background of the game is that the protagonist encountered an unidentified\
      \ attack on the way back to the mission. When he woke up, he found himself trapped\
      \ on a planet and found that people who had experienced the same experience\
      \ had been trapped here for a long time.<br><br>\_\_You can explore on the planet,\
      \ find logs that others have left on the planet, and scan to get data on the\
      \ production of various items or buildings. There are land and sea on the planet,\
      \ you can explore underwater, or you can find other civilized buildings on land.<br><br>\_\
      \_<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Future update:</h2>\_\_Because the current scene of the\
      \ game is a complete planet, the map is relatively large, and there are several\
      \ large oceans that have not yet been laid out. Later, the buildings and vegetation\
      \ that can be explored on the planet will be slowly improved. I can promise\
      \ that the game will be updated regularly after it is released. The features\
      \ that can be guaranteed will be satellite systems, vehicle systems, rocket\
      \ launch systems, and smarter AI. Some of these features are already in production\
      \ and I believe they will be available soon. The game currently has several\
      \ celestial satellites that have already been installed, but it may not be able\
      \ to land on it for the time being, because the game story has not yet developed\
      \ into outer space."
