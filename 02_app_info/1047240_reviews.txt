Otherwise, save your money for something that saves your progress.","timestamp_created":1602666166,"timestamp_updated":1602666166,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw756Wk/UCdKHkpwI="}
