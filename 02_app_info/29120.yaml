    review: 'this game. there is something wrong with this game. and i mean that in
      a really, really terrifying way. i originally played this as a small innocent
      child, i believe maybe it was even the first yumsters. i was obsessed with it,
      id play it for hours a day. i lost access to the game after i downloaded something
      off limewire and it fucked my computer up. flash forward to 2016, i sudden remember
      this name in my head about little colored worms: yumsters. i looked it up and
      bought it right away. its hypnotising.. the music, the gameplay, the creepy
      little dildo worm things, everything about it is just so entrancing. its.. evil.
      i cant describe this game in any other way. its such a good game, ive been in
      love with it for so long. but thats probably because ive Literally Been Fucking
      Hypnotized bY This Fucking Game Or Something SEND HELP'
