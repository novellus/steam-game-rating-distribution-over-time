[/h1]\n\n[h1]Game overall:[/h1]\n- My only critique is the music, wich becomes boring after some loops. \n- CS were good but i would have hoped for more (or i'm used to get more of them in other VN/Otome).\n\n+ Other that that the game is unusually polished\n+ i personally enjoyed a more western/realistic artstyle for once \n+ and the writing was good (both in grammar AND storytelling)\n+ the maincharacter is normal, in a GOOD way. She reacts grumpy when someone is rude, shes flustered if its the situation but shes not overly anything. The writing conveyed a fully fleshed charcter wich you shape with your reaktions one by one. I really enjoyed seeing this instead of one blunt character!\n\n[h1]This particular Route:[/h1]\n+ over all probably the best / most charming execution i've seen of the \"cold harded / jerk to soft hearted / passionate guy\"\n+ his jerkness is not overplayed and pretty understandable, i was never annoyed by although it sometimes seems rude etc (but in a \"normal\" or \"realistic\" way)\n+ Tatsuya is smart but has flaws, over all a good mix. He seems unexperianced in emotional matters and is so far (i did Shinji and Shou before) ironicaly the strongest \"teen\" feeling - even though he also seems to be the most mature one of the bunch. Its interessting and very well written.\n++ i really liked the buisseness aspect of things. It was really unexpected to actually see something coming out of the buisness club and the family / backstory of the Protagonist. I was really happily suprised and am stoked to play takus route to put the puzzle together, before starting hikaru!\n+/- i kinda liked that one of the \"bad\" ends isnt actually a bad end but that you end up with the rival. I would have liked that it would have been called something else (i mean okay, yeah i failed to get to tatsuya but that doesnt mean the decisions were wrong no...?) anyhow i would like to see more of this in the future!\n-/+ idk why but while it wasnt bad at all, the story seemed to drag sometimes. There were twists and tention but even tho i was invested in the characters, i observed this. I cant tell why tho, so it might just have been a bad day for me personally!\n\n[h1]in short:[/h1] this route was absolutely solid. It was a bit trope-y but really balanced so nothing stood out negatively (and i am usually very strict with this, so this ia a big positive). If you like a lil rough (but not too rough) start that turns into deep feelings, this is absolutely it.","timestamp_created":1548146318,"timestamp_updated":1548254857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48sjLvegCfIz6uAE="}
