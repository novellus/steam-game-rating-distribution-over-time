    review: 'An enjoyable second chapter in the Spirits of Mystery series.  This is
      an older HOPA: like the first game, there is no widescreen option and no map.  Despite
      the less than stellar graphics, this is a very solid HOPA game, with plenty
      of HO scenes and puzzles.  The art is very nice if you can look past the lower
      resolution.


      Pros:

      - nice fantasy setting and art

      - competent protagonist

      - occasional re-use of items

      - right number of HO scenes; interactive HO scenes are interesting (there are
      regular word lists as well)

      - variety in puzzles, some are challenging

      - areas are rarely closed off, but backtracking is reasonable

      - voice acting is infrequent, but competent

      - bonus chapter

      - nice, relaxing traditional HOPA game without bugs [running Windows 10]


      Cons:

      - no map at all, and there is some back-tracking required

      - the music seems fine at first, but becomes noticeably repetitive especially
      during HO scenes

      - no achievements (for Steam or within the game)

      [Note: lack of achievements also means less stress if you decide to use a Hint
      or Skip!]


      [b]Overall:[/b]  Despite the dated feel and lack of map or achievements, I enjoyed
      the game and I''m looking forward to the next one in the series. Recommended,
      but get it on sale. There is a bundle for the series.'
