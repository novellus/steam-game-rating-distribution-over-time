    review: "[h1]Welcome to another review of [b][i]Steel Division 2: Tribute to D-Day[/i][/b]\
      \ (Paid DLC).[/h1]\n[b]This relatively short and precise review will briefly\
      \ inform you that, this DLC only includes six (6) divisions, three (3) for the\
      \ Allies and three (3) for the Axis, which are part of [i]Steel Division: Normandy\
      \ 44[/i]'s game content, [u]\"ported\"[/u] into [i]Steel Division 2[/i].[/b]\n\
      \n[h1]Phase A.\nCost of the DLC.[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*]Considering the DLC's full\
      \ price, each division would cost approximately 2.85 $/\u20AC, a fee/division\
      \ ratio almost the same as paying for a [i]Company of Heroes 2[/i] commander,\
      \ if not in price then in principle (for those familiar with the comparison).\
      \ \n[*]In my opinion it's just the continuation of a horrible DLC marketing\
      \ policy in which [i]Eugen Systems[/i] has been willingly indoctrinated into\
      \ by [i]Paradox Interactive[/i], following their partnership towards releasing\
      \ [i]Steel division: Normandy 44[/i]. Readily evident from the initial release\
      \ of [i]Steel Division 2[/i] in three (3) different price/content offers and\
      \ the announced plans to compartmentalise future content in a multitude of paid\
      \ DLCs, which as it can already be seen so far, are also fairly overpriced for\
      \ their price/content ratio.\n[*]Sympathetic arguments towards the developer/publisher\
      \ (which are both [i]Eugen Systems[/i]) have been made, stating their \"need\
      \ to make money (profit)\" and that this DLC was put together after \"the community's\
      \ popular demand for divisions from the previous game\". Since the release of\
      \ [i]Steel Division: Normandy 44[/i], there is the constant impression that\
      \ [i]Eugen Systems[/i] are facing unrecoverable financial difficulties, for\
      \ which the community has shown incredible amounts of sensitivity, by buying\
      \ their products just for the incentive to support their development efforts.\
      \ Personally, I have surpassed that foolish impulse and can verily state that;\n\
      [/olist]\n\n[b]I have never managed to justify the full price of [i]Eugen Systems[/i]'s\
      \ products, to the actual quality/content ratio they objectively do deliver[/b].\n\
      \n[h1]Phase B.\nThe agenda behind the DLCs.[/h1]\n[u]The release of a \"community's\
      \ popular demand\" DLC would actually mean that;[/u]\n\n[olist]\n[*]There is\
      \ a certain knowledge, that enough of the people who asked for the DLC's content\
      \ would actually buy it, preferably at whichever \"reasonable\" price they are\
      \ offered (obviously aiming for the maximum profit deriving from a \"on demand/\
      \ custom-tailored\" product).\n[*]This marketing approach obviously leaves no\
      \ room for owners of [i]Steel Division Normandy 44[/i], whether they have invested\
      \ money into its DLCs or not, to receive this \"rehashed\" content for free,\
      \ unlike the [i]Steel Division 2: Back to War[/i] DLC, which requires you to\
      \ own only the [i]Steel Division: Normandy 44[/i] base game. Not even at a symbolic\
      \ price, honouring their loyalty and continued commitment for buying [i]Steel\
      \ Division Normandy 44[/i] as well as taking a leap of faith and buying even\
      \ [i]Steel Division 2[/i]. \n[*]As far as it is known [i]Eugen Systems[/i] did\
      \ not announce any donation to a WW2 related organisation, making all the more\
      \ obvious the marketing trick of the \"Tribute to D-Day\" listing of the DLC,\
      \ mudding the purpose of its development. Was it the need for a little extra\
      \ income, deriving from the satisfaction of a \"popular demand\" or paying their\
      \ respects to the fallen soldiers? Because, at the bottom line, both motives\
      \ seem to be horrendously irrelevant.\n[*]Yet again, their horrible marketing\
      \ is evident, since handing out the [i]Steel Division 2: Back to War[/i] DLC\
      \ for free to [i]Steel Division Normandy 44[/i] base game owners was aiming\
      \ to lower the risk/satisfaction ratio of buying [i]Steel Division 2[/i] in\
      \ its \"under development\" state after its official release, by offering a\
      \ familiar point of game-play and the illusion of being able to play part of\
      \ the new game \"for free\" (you have to buy [i]Steel Division 2[/i] to play\
      \ with the \"old\" divisions after all).\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]Phase C.\nConclusion.[/h1]\n\
      [olist]\n[*]About the DLC itself? Well nothing more or better than you would\
      \ play in [i]Steel Division Normandy 44, by itself[/i]. \n\n[b]The most interesting\
      \ benefits are that you get to relive content of the previous game, with updated\
      \ graphics and most worryingly, mechanics.[/b]\n[list]\n\n[*]Mechanics that\
      \ should have been patched in [i]Steel Division Normandy 44[/i], like the range\
      \ finding tool in heightened terrain. \n[*]As for the graphics, while just a\
      \ notch above, compared to those of the previous game, the in-game settings\
      \ lack variety and flexibility, hampering the users' ability to customise them\
      \ in-depth, as they please, offering only generic settings, befitting of a console\
      \ release.\n[/list]\n\n[*]Is this game/DLC bad? Not really. It just falls flat.\n\
      \n[*]Is it not worth its price-tag? Not really. Wait for at least a 75%+ discount.\n\
      \n[*]Is the publisher bad/evil though? Not really. Just compromised.\n[/olist]\n\
      \n[b][u]Interestingly enough, I am unable to say that it is good or that it\
      \ would be worth it, at any rate. Horrible and exploitative marketing policies\
      \ tend to overstate their presence in this one.[/u][/b]\n\n[i]And hence I have\
      \ paid the price of admittance, to publish my opinion in this review.\nStill\
      \ wondering how some people received this DLC for free and why all of their\
      \ reviews are positive....[/i]\n\n[b]For me it's a 2/10, due to lack of innovative,\
      \ new and rich content, compared to the inflated price.[/b]\n\n[h1]Critical\
      \ Update[/h1]\n\n[i]On top of that, the community is an abusive and toxic mix\
      \ of underage kids and fanatical and addicted zealots, while the developers\
      \ represent a wall of immoral and ungrateful hypocrites, incapable of accepting\
      \ criticism and improving meaningfully on their beta program, harbouring personal\
      \ attacks and abusive practises on the forums, as long as they come from their\
      \ loyal subjects and projected towards \"deviants\". On top of that they abuse\
      \ their moderator privileges to shut down any opposition and conflicting opinion\
      \ to their predatory corporate interests (masked by low quality content marketing).\
      \ Disgusting and horrible mentalities no decent customer would consider being\
      \ related with or wasting their time and money on their BETA-quality products,\
      \ instead staying away from supporting their predatory and discriminating practises,\
      \ by avoiding the funding of their survival as corporate and physical entities.[/i]\n\
      \n[h1]Good luck and have fun.[/h1]\n\n[b]Thank you all for supporting this review.\
      \ I really appreciate the special content awards![/b]\n[i]We are consumers with\
      \ rights and decency, demanding fair prices for the content we are sold and\
      \ not silly cash cows to be milked and taken advantage of our interest for WW2.\
      \ I hope this review made it evident to all potential buyers, valuing their\
      \ money, at the sacrifice of my wallet, so that they don't have to be exploited\
      \ due to their potential lack of seasoned experience on the matter, based on\
      \ which this timely review was published or due to their unconditional love\
      \ for WW2 content. This is a wake up call, in which I cannot find anything funnier\
      \ than the zealots unwilling to accept it, because it would mean their (merciful)\
      \ immediate and ultimate demise, as opposed to slow and painful mental decay.\
      \ Avoid.[/i]\n\n[u][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwFZ-UCEzow]\n[b]\"\
