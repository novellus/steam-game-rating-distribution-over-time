It is not a match 3 in the traditional sense, where you swap adjacent tiles, but where you drag tiles from the sides to fill the inner grid. The colours, that get ushered in gradually, are bright and very well-chosen. \n\nThe game-play is a step-up from the automatic and (sometimes) brainless moves required in a normal Match 3 and actually requires a bit of thought. It's quite a nice companion piece to the also neglected T-Kara Puzzles which offers another innovative twist to this (sub) genre.","timestamp_created":1603379022,"timestamp_updated":1603379119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ufi1qPUCcpO4qQI="}
