It starts out sweet but be warned it gets darker, and have the tissues ready :) Really interesting story and I enjoyed the world building. Music was good and atmospheric. I liked the art style as well, especially the colour schemes.\n\nChoices depend on whether the two main characters are friendly/protective towards the other or fearful/violent, with chapters switching between Yoyo and Bibi. Although once you've achieved the very good and very bad endings, it's constant skipping to get the other ones with no change in text at all (and had a few crashes along the way, but only when having to skip large chunks).\n\nI would definitely recommend.","timestamp_created":1609801812,"timestamp_updated":1609801812,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgsnq5/YCcfLEwAI="}
