    about_the_game: "One of Germany\u2019s oldest railway lines comes to life in the\
      \ beautiful and picturesque Munich \u2013 Garmisch-Partenkirchen route for Train\
      \ Simulator.<br><br>Set in the southern part of the German state of Bavaria,\
      \ the 100km (62 mile) route is mainly single track throughout and runs from\
      \ the country\u2019s expansive capital city to the mountainous resorts of Bavaria,\
      \ on the border with Austria. The first section of the line from Munich to Pasing,\
      \ and on to Planegg, was opened on 21 May 1854, and throughout the same year\
      \ further work continued to extend the railway to Gauting, M\xFChlthal and Starnberg.<br><br>Over\
      \ subsequent years, more sections of the route were independently built to service\
      \ local industries in and around the towns of Weilheim, Tutzing, Murnau and\
      \ Partenkirchen; these sections were upgraded and merged in the early 1900s,\
      \ and on 20 February 1925, an electric hauled train completed the first full\
      \ run from Munich Main Station to Garmisch-Partenkirchen.<br><br>Munich S-Bahn\
      \ Line S6 services serve the route, running south from Munich to Tutzing, where\
      \ they terminate. Additionally, Intercity-Express (ICE) trains can be seen on\
      \ the line, running from Munich to Innsbruck.<br><br>The Regionalbahn BR 426\
      \ is a popular train-set on the S6 Line, a train-set that is included with this\
      \ route. Built by a consortium of Siemens, Bombardier and DWA, the BR 426 is\
      \ almost identical to the BR 425, bar the BR 426 being a two-car unit rather\
      \ than a four-car unit. The high powered, lightweight vehicles were designed\
      \ for short to medium distance services, making them ideal units for the S6\
      \ Line. Features of the model include SIFA, PZB and LZB in-cab signalling and\
      \ driver safety devices, in-cab indicators, cab controls and cab lighting.<br><br>The\
      \ Munich \u2013 Garmisch-Partenkirchen route is highly detailed and feature-rich,\
      \ and incorporates night lighting, therefore will benefit from a higher PC specification\
      \ than other Train Simulator add-ons.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2><br>Seven\
