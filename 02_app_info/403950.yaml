      \ ingredients to summon creatures of the woods with no practical need to conquer\
      \ mines. Perhaps you're a dwarf, who's only concern are mines and produce units\
      \ at a set rate every turn, focused almost entirely on upgrading those units\
      \ to survive as long as possible since they are so difficult to replace. With\

      \ destroy a demon lord by storming inferno and slaying it on that plane. Although\

      \ will ensure that no two games are the same. More rituals and spells can be\
      \ learned during the game if you have the right resources and find the right\
      \ locations. In addition to the aggressive wildlife of Elysium there's also\

      -Very fun

      -Lots to do and try

      -Can suck you in for hours

      -MODS

      -Somewhat of a learning curve that can cause you to quit but if passed then
      you will quickly find it to be fun (reading the manual located under additional
