    review: "The combat is awkward and difficult, with enemies dealing ridiculous\
      \ damage the moment they touch you. This isn't helped by the issues with the\
      \ upgrade system. Some of the upgrades don't seem to work quite right, and you\
      \ lose them as soon as you die anyway. Overall, this feels like a jam game.\
      \ \n\nThis would be inoffensive if it were hanging around on itch, but to charge\
      \ money for it is more than a little arrogant."
