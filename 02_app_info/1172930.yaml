      defects and start the Resistance against the kafkaesque government. Fight the

    short_description: The almighty Robo-Government of Lawtvia hereby forbids the
      game of Silicomrades to be played, as it portraits our beloved regime in an
      unflattering and often even mocking fashion. Taking effect immediately, everyone
      playing this rebellious piece of software will be considered an enemy of the
      State.
