Now I can't use any flights at all, as the program shows the initial cockpit screen before giving an error message and crashing to desktop. The manual does warn you that the code used does \"mess about\" with the basic FSX programming, but surely that should be a warning BEFORE you buy it! Also, before I realised that this add-on was going to trash the existing FSX parameters, I'd already begun to suspect that it was just TOO complex. The \"must read\" manual goes on and on...and on...and on... and on..., and when I'd spent three evenings going through the \"sample flight\" and not even getting as far as starting the engines, I began to realise that this was going to be a real chore rather than a bit of escapist fun. For example, you apparently can't use the \"time compression\" utility to speed up flights, so if you want to fly from Manchester to Turkey, be prepared to spend four hours staring at your screen! This is clearly only for the \"hard core\" FSX enthusiasts who really think they COULD fly an airliner and have unlimited leisure time at their disposal. I'll be ditching it and re-installing FSX asap!","timestamp_created":1609441042,"timestamp_updated":1609441042,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5auK3fYCcLmXvwI="}
