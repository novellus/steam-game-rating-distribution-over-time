Sadly Level 17 is functionally impassable, and since levels above that are locked until lower levels are completed, almost half of the 30 levels cannot be played at all. ----\n\n[added on 2019-07-13]\nMajor issues:\n-- Level 17 is pretty much broken as a pea can easily get permanently lodged in the spring just by landed on the board attached to it.  It is random and frequent and extremely difficult to avoid for all 3 peas in that level.  In fact once I got 2 peas lodged there at once, and one time a pea lodged there disappeared and a 2nd pea took its place.\n...on top of that, getting the peas where they need to go is quite difficult (I got 1 out of the 3 peas into position in 1 out of about 15 plays of the level, and 0 out of 3 into position in 14 out of 15 plays.), but might be doable if the spring capture problem is fixed.\n...and of course I can't speak for levels 18 through 30 since they are locked until finishing lower levels (including 17!).\n\nNitpicks:\n\nIt takes around 3 seconds for the game to recognize a win condition, which is pretty long and could be annoying if you succeeded on a level with less than 3 seconds left but then weren't given the win.\n\nThe (random?) motion of peas sitting on a flat surface is hard to understand.  On the ground it's not a problem, but I once shot a pea onto a small flat platform by itself, and it moved slightly back a forth a few times, making me think it would never come down...except after a while it did.\n\nIt seems like no shot angle or amount of force can dislodge a pea once it has nestled into the groove above two adjacent peas.  Maybe the physics can't be faulted, but this fact can make a level next to impossible to finish if a platform that can only be shot at from one side gets peas stacked on the side nearest the cannon first.","timestamp_created":1555897838,"timestamp_updated":1563069556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0pSN9+sCeLHdvwE="}
