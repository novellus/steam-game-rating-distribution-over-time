For recommending i guess if u like WW2 tanks, planes and boats as waifu's it's got the thumbs up for that and some fun game play which at some points can become annoying if your not good at planning ahead of turns (got rekt a few times) but apart from that the stability of the game is nice and very enjoyable hope the rest of the series makes it to steam as well.","timestamp_created":1583789275,"timestamp_updated":1583789275,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4987M4PACdMKP9wE="}
