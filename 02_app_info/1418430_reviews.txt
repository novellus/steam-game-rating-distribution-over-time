Passably, yes.\n\nHorror Bar VR is not my favorite cooking game. It's not my favorite VR cooking game. But it is my favorite VR cooking game that asks me to serve human fingers deep-fried in oil.\n\nI'll be honest - there's a bit of jank here. Even with Index controllers, I found myself a bit frustrated trying to get an action just right so that it would count. It's not constant or even frequent, but it happens.\n\nThat said, Horror Bar VR is a lot of fun if you like this sort of game. The mechanics are familiar enough, and the novelty of the campy horror theme is unique and fun. It's a bit silly and even forced at times, but on the whole it works.\n\nThere's not a lot more to say - this is a game that will appeal to the people it appeals to, and they're likely to enjoy it. If you look at the screenshots and think, \"That might be kinda fun,\" well, it probably will be.\n\nSummary:\nGraphics: 3/5\nImmersion: 4/5\nFun: 4/5\nComfort: 4/5\nFitness: 3/5\nBrain Burgers Lost to Glitchy Controls: 412","timestamp_created":1609607249,"timestamp_updated":1609607249,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4xq+E4vYCdtLkvwI="}
