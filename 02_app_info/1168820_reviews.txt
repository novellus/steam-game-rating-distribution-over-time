Other than the lack of Steam cards/achievements, this one has most of what I look for in one of these games.  The story is very basic - save the land from the powerful Dragon King - but the mythology is nice.\n\nPros:\n- wide variety of puzzles, some challenging\n- HO scenes that include word lists, outlines, and even riddles\n- lovely art\n- beautiful setting\n- accents in voice acting generally very consistent\n- extras menu lets you replay scenes and HO puzzles to locate collectables and get missed (in-game) achievements\n- the right amount of \"looking around\" (backtracking), supported by a fully interactive map\n\nCons:\n- linear story (complete tasks as directed to defeat Dragon King)\n- very 2D protagonist and characters (but the dragons are so well drawn I didn't mind XD\n\nOverall: a very nice addition to this series of HOPA games; keeps up the high standards of previous entries; I'd wait for a sale, but if you enjoy the HOPA genre, this one is good","timestamp_created":1604325757,"timestamp_updated":1604325894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.608163237571716309","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw98zRxPUCdd3mqwI="}
