    review: 'The ball moves on set 45 degree paths, and does not change according
      to where it hits the paddle, aside from reversing or continuing along the 45
      degree path. This makes the game an absolute chore to play, where you''re praying
      for the Shot power-up in order to hit that last block that''s minutes away on
      the Screen-saver-esque pathing the ball takes.

      Feels like and plays like a quick cash grab from someone utilizing the UE4 game
      maker.'
