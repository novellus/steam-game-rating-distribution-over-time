    review: This game is great. It's so fun and wholesome and has gay, lesbian, pansexual,
      and non-binary representation. It's pretty short and the replay value is fairly
      limited because even though there are different endings, the story doesn't change
      all that much based on your choices. But it's so good that I don't mind. I got
      it for 50% off, but in my opinion, it's worth full price even though it's short.
