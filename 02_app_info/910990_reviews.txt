Not thumbs up, not thumbs down just kinda eh, if you got 5 bucks and its on sale and you want to waste an afternoon ... you could certainly do worse. I got stuck later on in the game where it gives you the opportunity to play a game in the game. You play a space alien with a ray gun attacking Zombies. Anyways, somehow I got stuck in the arcade, Couldn't leave the screen even though there was a hand pointing the way. IDK. I was kinda burnt out by that point anyways.","timestamp_created":1566742092,"timestamp_updated":1566742092,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1596868356,"developer_response":"https://youtu.be/utqx9tp_7O8 shows you how to walk over exit and leave arcade....\n\nThe games story takes a couple twists and spices things up in upcoming levels and also has unique unlockable game modes upon completion of game. Don't give up and keep playing !\n\nHopefully you can change your review also once you finish the game"}],"cursor":"AoJwjuPG5OwCcveE0QE="}
