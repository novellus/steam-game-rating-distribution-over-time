    review: "When I first saw the style I thought, \"Hey, Sam & Max.\"\n\nBut it's\
      \ not really like Sam & Max. Sam & Max got along, despite their differences.\
      \ In this, we have two characters constantly opposed to each other in largely\
      \ bland or trite dialogue. When it wasn't puerile, it was just \"meh.\"\n\n\
      It's a shame, really - clearly these people worked on/have some inspiration\
      \ from the old Sam & Max games (there's a Max sticker on their car), but it\
      \ falls flat. \n\nPretty bland and lackluster. Slow gameplay.  As a head up,\
      \ it has more adult themes than the old Sam & Max games, so you may want to\
      \ steer clear of this for a kid. \n\nPlus points - good background music & good\
      \ graphics. Voice acting was overall good, but the two main chaarcters sorta\
      \ grated on my ears. The sidekick has a particular lower-class English accent\
      \ which gets irritating after a while.\n\nI'd take a quick pass."
