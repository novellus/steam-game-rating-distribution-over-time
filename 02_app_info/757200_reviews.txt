For under $10 you'll get several hours of entertainment, as I say, was more hours of fun for less cost than a movie.","timestamp_created":1609118758,"timestamp_updated":1609118758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx/a80/YCeqT5vQI="}
