You get to jet set around Italy, talk with many characters, puzzles are nice & easy to the storyline progresses nicely.. and the story is excellent. Not your typical fairytale, it actually makes sense. It's a pretty good length too and I never wanted to stop playing because I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. The audio and visual devices are a super cool addition to the game play, as is the cozy little \"cards\" pocket in which to use various cards that you obtain during the game. Wish there were a couple of more assemble and/or paint the pictures and maybe if you could actually \"DO\" something more with the photos you collect, but that's just me. Excellent job Eipix. Good quality graphics and decent voice acting too. Loved it! Can't wait for more!","timestamp_created":1586306025,"timestamp_updated":1586306025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44qDNq/ECfamE/wE="}
