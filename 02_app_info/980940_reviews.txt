This game isn't bad, it just minor game that doing it's job trying be fun still funny hit NPC with a axe or either weapon that is a tool pretty much still laugh that they try run fast they could for felt like I am being the police from payday 2 with about the cloaker beating the snot out of players but now I am beating the snot out of NPC instead.  I still do it for my $##! and giggles if I get sick of tired selling stuff for I still go off beat the daylight out the NPC because it is funny and $##!.\n\nThis bring conclusion is the game worth it?  To work your fusteration for good in some point of that good stress yes keep that mental mind good stress, and funny to hit npc who probably didn't pay enough for you so basically give a wack or 2 for the fun of it.  Do not put hope and dreams into this game but there is up and down and when the game is buggy the colusion object item like a handle on top another handle may fling out like a cannon fired out for good gosh who know where it will landed for you'll be struggling for days trying to look for it.  The game is still under work and has massive bugs but still funny watch the stuff being fired at the random as you see it bounce around your shop really dang fast.","timestamp_created":1610146356,"timestamp_updated":1610146356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwsvOM8vYCfqPUwQI="}
