Not inherently bad, since it have some cool ideas and concepts, but definitely done way too quick. I can't recommend a game like this because, for me at least, it quickly became boring, repetitive and difficult (in the bad way, the one that makes you feel the game is unfair). In the other hand, with very little tweaks here and there, I think the game could improve MASSIVELY, specially by polishing the character control. I don't know if the developers will update the game in the future, but if they do, I'll probably have to change my recommendation.\n\nBe careful IF YOU HAVE MOTION SICKNESS because this game will most surely trigger it!\n_________________________________________________\n\n\nBAD STUFF\nWeird mouse input lag, probably caused by V-Sync?\nContinuous strong camera shake when firing. (they have a slider now, thank god)\nBad movement control and feeling.\nNot relevant sprites drawn in front of main character.\nWeird main character collision box.\nThe checkpoint spiraling sprite is the most seen and the less prety.\nNo minimap or way to know where to go or where have you been.\nHard to differentiate enemies with the background.\nEnrage mode is not achievable outside bossfights, at least in low levels.\nGravity is extremely high for a platformer, it makes very difficult to control the character when falling.\n\nBAD STUFF: LEVEL 1\nI found the secondary shooting mode by chance, didn't even see it.\nDoor that regenerates self is not explained, you have to figure out how to break it.\nNearly imposible jumps whitout hurting yourself, not a good jump to make in the first level.\nThere are weird purple and red circles around that appear to do nothing.\nThe first boss doesn't give you a wide enough timeframe to be able to evade his attacks, specially when camera shake doesn't even let you focus your eyes on it.\n\nBAD STUFF: LEVEL 2\nNow the controlled missile mechanic is getting old and difficult at the same time.\nEnemies can get stuck just under the floor tile you are standing on and quickly hit you when peeking.\nA turret hit me just as a puzzle locked door was opening, not even a second given to evade the hit.\nA turret hit me before even appearing on the screen.\nThe spring system apply the upward force waaaaaay to quick.\nThere is a zone where it seems you can't go further because an impossible jump. Turns out that there are green buttons (which until now means they are OK) that when shoot turn red again, and place floor tiles to make the jump. 100% intuitive!\n\n(Writting date until this point:  3 Aug 2018)\n\nBAD SUFF: LEVEL 3\nOnce you have dealt with this game controls for 2 hours or more, it starts to look like it might be playeable.\nThis level have some weird missile puzzle that are actually not that difficult to do, but hard to spot and understand.Sometimes, you have to take your time and scratch your head until you realize what you have todo. Others, the buttons you have to hit are just waaaay out of your normal sight, so you are gonna spend some time looking for them.\n\nBAD STUFF: LEVEL 4\nI got the enrage mode out of a boss fight!\nThere is a puzzle where the clue is written with the same material as the floor. I don't know if people will see it, but I just shoot the buttons until it opened (took me 20 seconds) and then realize the solution was just below me.\nThe boss is cool! There are some mobs that spawn weirdly because they are been spawned out of the screen, so they fall when you jump... and there is a non explained \"rule\" in fase 3 which consist in climbing to the side platforms when the boss is attacking with the laser because it is the only way of dodge it.aaaaaaa\n\nBAD STUFF: LEVEL 5\nThe level layout is bonkers. You kinda can find your way around by following the cables but let me tell you something, there are LOTS of cables and aaaaaall of them >yellow<. Please, use different colors, it's not that hard :c\nAlso, there is a black hole behind a box, close to a turret. If you dont figure it out quickly, Mr.Turret is gonna kill you because his bullets are not affected by it, but yours do.\nI just figured out turrets can AND WILL shoot you through regenerative doors.\n\n(Writting date until this point:  5 Aug 2018)\n\nBAD STUFF: LEVEL 6\nThe level is splited in two zones, right and left. I have been wandering the right part over and over, for more or less 40 minutes and I am unable to reach the other half of the leve. I have followed the wires, the walls, I have reloaded the level and the game, etc...\nI think I have had enough of this game for now, so I'm gonna wait for some month and see if they fix it.\n\n(Writting date until this point:  6 Aug 2018)\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n\nGOOD STUFF\nEnrage mode is cool.\nI found what looks like a secret zone and rescued a marine.\nThere are abundant lives spaced around.\n_________________________________________________","timestamp_created":1533250565,"timestamp_updated":1533500287,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458333343267440796","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ga3vheUCf8O7pwE="}
