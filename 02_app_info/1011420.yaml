    review: "A good way to waste a few hours. The technical aspect is good, however,\
      \ the frustrating thing is not being able to carry more than one item during\
      \ the normal mode. Also the time it takes to level up hasn't been explained\
      \ fully. \n\nIf you're interested in Engines/Mechanics, then this game is for\
      \ you."
