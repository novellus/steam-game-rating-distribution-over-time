    about_the_game: <strong>Keep the Balance! is a fast-paced puzzle game requiring
      basic math skills. </strong><br><br>An evil joker has invaded our world and
      tries to disturb The Magic Scales that balance our world, in order to unleash
      the forces of Chaos. Each level has a monkey standing on top of the scales.
      You have to keep the equilibrium by launching objects, passing below on a conveyor,
      onto the scales. All locations have unique sets of objects to which weight,
      shown as a number, has been assigned. As the objects appear from both sides
      of the screen at the same time, you move the cursor below an object and press
      a key to launch it. At the top of each scale, the current weight is shown. If
      there is a big gap in weight, the monkey will slowly slide to the heaviest side.
      <br><br>When it falls down, the game is over...
