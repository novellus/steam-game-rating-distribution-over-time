    about_the_game: "Slam door multiple units were a much loved and classic sight\
      \ on the UK capital\u2019s rail network from the 1950s onwards, and now one\
      \ such unit \u2013 the Class 415 \u20184EPB\u2019 \u2013 comes to Train Simulator,\
      \ perfect for the South London Network route.<br><br>Introduced in 1951, the\
      \ \u20184EPB\u2019 (4-car, Electro-Pneumatic Brakes) was a classic southern\
      \ \u2018slam-door\u2019 third-rail EMU which had a career spanning 44 years,\
      \ and became the most numerous class on the region after the withdrawal of Class\
      \ 405 \u20184SUBS\u2019. Each four-car set was comprised of two powered driving\
      \ cars and two trailers, originally with compartment seating but later refurbished\
      \ with open seating.<br><br>The units were designed for a mixture of inner-city\
      \ and suburban operations on third third-rail DC lines out of south London,\
      \ and a top speed of 75mph (121km/h) was enough for runs further out of town.<br><br>In\
      \ 1960, the first British Rail designed units were introduced, based on then\
      \ current Mk1 Suburban stock. A refurbishment of the Class in the late 1970s\
      \ and early 1980s saw compartment stock converted to open saloons, and both\
      \ seating and luggage racks replaced with standard Mk2 fittings.<br><br>Despite\
      \ their numerous numbers, the 4EPBs were withdrawn from service by 1995, with\
      \ one four-car unit preserved.<br><br>The Class 415 \u20184EPB\u2019 for Train\
      \ Simulator is available in Network SouthEast livery as a Class 415/6 variant,\
      \ indicating refurbished stock of BR design. Features of the model include passenger\
      \ view, slam-door sound effects, guard\u2019s whistle when setting off, and\
      \ high intensity headlamp.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible,\
