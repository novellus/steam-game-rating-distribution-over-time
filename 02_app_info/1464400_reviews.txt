There's no options to change the gameplay window size, no options to save where you're at (I wish this was made clearer in the beginning) so you're always starting fresh, and the 'detailed stats' don't actually seem to line up with the previous round. Sometimes it will say 'I made all my orders' on a game where I botched three, and then it will say I botched three on a game where I did fine and fulfilled everything. This seemed especially true around Month 25+ \n\nI feel like this is a game that would actually suit Steam Achievements, given the gameplay is extraordinarily repetitive.\n\nThat being said, for anyone who likes these sorts of games, I can see it being one that you could mindlessly play and I think the strategy tree is interesting. This game feels like it will do better with improvement.","timestamp_created":1606490270,"timestamp_updated":1606490270,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.594594597816467285","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk4WShfYCeJfTswI="}
