Tho you have a nice but simple character creator at the beginning of each round. But then the gameplay is boring and repetive (just 1 level). Dodging with slingshot moves. Each wall is eletrocuted and you have to \"survive\". There's no depth in game, no purpose to play at all.","timestamp_created":1587505459,"timestamp_updated":1587505481,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.588687539100646973","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40uisz/ECfp/IggI="}
