But it's still not worth the full price, and it will make less sense than usual if you didn't play the previous games. I might be a bit too harsh on this one, as it was less reliant on HOs and had more puzzling, and features like a map and lockable inventory bar, but given my lack of enjoyment of the rest of the series, I can't say I would recommend it. (And in case you were wondering, yes, I played them all to the end, but I was too late for the refund (yes, I tried), and I just personally couldn't justify not playing games I spent money on, so judge as you will. :-) )","timestamp_created":1547340976,"timestamp_updated":1547340976,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+LGtougCc7CcuAE="}
