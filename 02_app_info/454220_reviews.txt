Sure, the scenario and the writing come straight out from the worst Z movies, but I started appreciating them. There's an honesty and a self-awareness in these tin-foiled-hat-level conspiracy theories, you can't help yourself but to love them.\n\nThe puzzles quickly started getting repetitive, and felt more like busy work than meaningful riddles. But still, some were quite inventive, and there was often that \"HAHA, GOTCHA\" moment, and that's enough to keep me engaged.\n\nHonestly, if the game we had was just the first third of what we actually got, my review would have been positive. But the quality and inventivity of the puzzles and the story quickly dropped, and there are way too many bad design occurences in this game: for example, I spent one hour on a puzzle of the second part... only to realize that puzzles of the second part are \"just\" clues, and the answer you need to enter is entirely somethings else: at no point this change in the way the game works is made clear, and I had to look at the forums to be aware of what should have been clear in-game.\n\nI'm really sad to leave a negative review for this game, but there are just too many infuriating things that prevent me to recommand playing past the first three chapters. I hope the dev's next game will fix these issues. :(","timestamp_created":1608679439,"timestamp_updated":1608679439,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qYexxvYCfYmmvAI="}
