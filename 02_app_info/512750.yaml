    review: 'For just four bucks this is really great fun. Movement and controls are
      awesome, the graphics are cool, you really feel like you are on the moon (I
      can tell this, because I know, of course :-) )


      The shooting is not yet perfect, though: When you move, the rockets drift away,
      because the dev forgot to add the vectors of your movement and the movement
      of the rockets themselves (as they are shot by a moving ''ship''), so it feels
      like they are drifted by strong wind. Maybe a laser gun woud be better to simply
      avoid this issue.


      But anyway, once you are in this game, you really understand what VR is for.
      This on a flat screen would not make sense.


      We played it with the whole family and the kids (6 and 8) still struggle with
      the controls but everyone enjoys hoovering arround. And of course I am hunting
      best times, which is quite challenging.


      So compliments to the dev and a clear recommendation to buy. It is a lot of
      fun per dollar.
