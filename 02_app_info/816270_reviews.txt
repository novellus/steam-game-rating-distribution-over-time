I don't care if they're demons! Lemme talk smack or slap em!!\n\nBut coming back after a bit, I enjoyed the routes, it wasn't overly deep or had enough to time/length anyways in the lore or characters aside from what's going on, but the multiple endings from the boys were nice. The deaths in the first half were a bit silly, but that's fine. I just have to ignore the struggles she gets cos that'll annoy me again, and I enjoyed (?) it I guess! I didn't finish the game with anger, so that's a plus.","timestamp_created":1609508305,"timestamp_updated":1609508305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hveK3/YCc5mzvwI="}
