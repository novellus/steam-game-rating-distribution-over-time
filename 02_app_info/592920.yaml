    review: 'hmm so this isnt a game, its a youtube of sorts for VR, i clicked the
      download button on a video and it said 3Gb, i am not willing to have my pc stuck
      in VR mode for however long that may take to download, add in an option that
      lets you download the movies as if it was an update, or atleast not while in
      VR being a power drain on the rest of the system, other than that i cant say
      more because i stopped  instantly when i realised i would be stuck waiting for
      the file


      yes i understand VR "movies" are big files, but find a way to download them
      before we get into Vr mode


      update 7 march 2017


      i managed to stream one of the "clips" and i must say it is of low quality

      a clip of me in a room with some "thugs" the size of the room from my view felt
      completely out of proportion, ive seen better adult films'
