    review: 'The only upside really is the story.


      The graphics have not aged well and the one thing that is exceptionally terrible
      in this game are the controls.


      Would only recommend to die-hard whodunit fans and avid Conan Doyle lovers.


      The puzzles are hard, you have to find all the objects you can interact with
      using the mousepointer (no help function), there is no autosave and the performance
      is sometimes extremely sluggish and terrible, despite using a 2014 system (intel
      4core with HT and a GTX 970).'
