      adventure.<br>Combining traditional Metroidvania mechanics with a dynamic branching
      narrative system, Recompile challenges players to explore, fight, hack and survive.
      Discover the many secrets beneath the ancient digital landscape, and prepare
      for system-wide reconfiguration.<br><br>The game''s entire narrative takes place

      a range of traversal abilities to help you on your journey towards attaining
      true sapience.<br><br>Recompile aims to be the first ever Metroidvania-style
      game to include multiple, highly dynamic critical paths. Your play style and
      choices matter, weaving together a narrative unique to you as the true nature
      of the mysterious virtual world is revealed.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/986310/extras/FIGHT.gif?t=1609185599"

      transforming the Mainframe''s vast repository of code into a race of half-sentient,
      half-deterministic subroutines. They exist in a state of flux, as if trapped
      by their programming in a kind of twisted digital purgatory.<br><br>You, The
      Program, must decide on whether to help or hinder the denizens of the Mainframe.
      The inhabitants are strange and diverse, and many are found to be inherently
      hostile. A full complement of powerful weapons and abilities are available to
      help you survive, defend and destroy.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/986310/extras/HACK.gif?t=1609185599"

      or disabled entirely, allowing puzzles or other threatening obstacles to be
