There is no mention on the store page whether the next episodes are included in the price or not.\n\nIf the price was a tenth of what it is I would have kept it.\n\nAsked for a refund, but It'll stay on my wishlist and I'll re-purchase it when and if all episodes are released and a bundle is on offer.","timestamp_created":1502137993,"timestamp_updated":1502137993,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578797280788421631","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48tiZ390CeYqFggE="}
