    review: 'Will It VR? Passably, yes.


      Horror Bar VR is not my favorite cooking game. It''s not my favorite VR cooking
      game. But it is my favorite VR cooking game that asks me to serve human fingers
      deep-fried in oil.


      I''ll be honest - there''s a bit of jank here. Even with Index controllers,
      I found myself a bit frustrated trying to get an action just right so that it
      would count. It''s not constant or even frequent, but it happens.


      That said, Horror Bar VR is a lot of fun if you like this sort of game. The
      mechanics are familiar enough, and the novelty of the campy horror theme is
      unique and fun. It''s a bit silly and even forced at times, but on the whole
      it works.


      There''s not a lot more to say - this is a game that will appeal to the people
      it appeals to, and they''re likely to enjoy it. If you look at the screenshots
      and think, "That might be kinda fun," well, it probably will be.
