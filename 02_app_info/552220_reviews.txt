Its fun to play for a while but gets boring after sometime. The game is simple like the origanal. move and shoot the invaders, move and block when theres fire coming you way. Would love it if they added harder enimies. Great cheap VR game for anyone getting into VR or just looking for a new twist on an old classic!","timestamp_created":1479420108,"timestamp_updated":1479420108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560418486595153809","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzuuTutgCcNLVZQ=="}
