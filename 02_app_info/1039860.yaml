    about_the_game: 'An unknown hostile force has been identified by our spy satellites,
      their jump signatures are locked on our planet. We have no defenses. If they
      get here, we are doomed.<br><br>There is, however, one last chance for us: the
      top-secret Vanguard prototype she stole from us. That silver-haired she-devil
      should be hanged for treason, but we have no time for that now. We have given
      her temporary access to our network of satellites, she will hack their warp
      drives and trap them in a little yellow box, you will pilot the Vanguard, lure
      enough of them in and try to take down their mothership. You are our only hope.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Become an Unstoppable Destruction Machine!</h2>The only way to
      have a fighting chance against the mothership is to destroy enemy spaceships
      and steal their energy shards. This will upgrade your weapon systems and make
      you stronger. Be careful not to get hit, every damage you take reduces the energy
      charge of your weapon systems.<h2 class="bb_tag">Take Down Their Capital Ships</h2>We
      have identified two capital ships accompanying the main force. You must take
      them down to attract the attention of the mothership. Be careful, these capital
      ships are not like regular enemies, they use bullet patterns to confuse their
      opponents, I hope your dodging skills are on par with your shooting abilities.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Train, Get Stronger, Give Them Hell!</h2>We have systems in place
      to reset the current timeline in case something goes wrong. Don''t be afraid
      to try again and again. The enemy moves and shoots in specific patterns, you
      can learn their tricks, and predict their next move.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul

    developer_response: 'We''re glad you''re enjoying the game, we love Shmups too,
      the difficulty becomes meditative at some point, that''s what''s most intoxicating
      about these games. We tried to make Lifeless Vanguard as fair as possible in
      this regard.


      Thank you for taking the time to write this.

    review: 'This game is as straightforward as twin-stick shooters get.  Serviceable
      graphics and soundtrack.  Minimalist menus.  Rock-solid controls.  Clever enemy
      design.  Unforgiving difficulty.


      Exactly the kind of shmup I look for to appreciate.  Great game, looking forward
      to whatever''s next down the pipeline.
