    review: SoH is fantastic story and one of my favorites from CoG/HG. While some
      people will say that choices don't effect much to the story, and they will be
      right about that, the choices are flavour to the story. Devon (author) has already
      stated this issue, and i am completely fine with this. Not every game has to
      be multiple branch. and SoH would not be the same. The story itself is great
      alongside MC and supporting cast. One warning, do not mistake this story as
      "hero always wins". It doesn't (yet). The story has mature themes, and can get
      dark (Book 3), but do try it out. You will enjoy it.
