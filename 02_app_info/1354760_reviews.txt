There are many juicy scenes in this game. One of the downsides is that all of the endings are pretty tragic, some more than others. \n\nI personally enjoyed it but I wouldn't say that I would recommend it to EVERYONE. Do your research and make the decision yourself. I will say that if you have a strong tolerance against disturbing content, go for it.","timestamp_created":1609864093,"timestamp_updated":1609864093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41JPY6fYCcL/fwAI="}
