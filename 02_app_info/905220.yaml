    about_the_game: '<strong>OMG, look at the Earth ... it''s Grim!</strong><br><br>5000
      years from now, a series of apocalyptic events have shaped our once beautiful
      home into an entirely different world.<br><br>It''s not all bad news though.
      Countless alien invasions mean it''s a vibrant place to live and biodiversity
      is at an all time high, although most of it is not too friendly and should be
      avoided. Humans 2.0 are very friendly however, existing in peaceful harmony
      with all, thanks partly to the kind programming their AI fathers have bestowed
      upon them.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/905220/extras/divider01.png?t=1578920574"
      /><br>Grim Earth is a 2D platform game inspired by SNES/Amiga era gameplay,
      featuring a blend of action, exploration and some puzzle solving. The game tells
      an on-going story as you meet new characters, battle alien hostiles and jump,
      climb, swim, slide and float (zero-g) your way through a variety of locations.<br><br>The
      game is designed to be nice and light, featuring a hand drawn graphical style,
      a dry sense of humour, frequent save points and it''s free of bloody gore ...
      although there are plenty of explosions, alien splats and flying robot parts!<br><br>So
      grab your spacesuit, customise it, and go on a retro-platform-game adventure.<br><br><strong>Coming
      soon to Steam Early Access ... hope you''ll look out for it! : )</strong><br><img

    short_description: The Earth's looking a bit Grim, but so would you after 5000
      years and countless alien invasions! Grab your spacesuit (the air's not so great
      any more) and go for an adventure in what is still a beautiful world.
