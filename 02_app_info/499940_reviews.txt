Only includes two sets - the original and War of Shadows - and the interface is not any better than playing the 2D version via Bigscreen or Virtual Desktop, except with some layering errors (where items behind other items are rendered to occlude them anyway). Disables Chaperone for the duration, because it is strictly seated/standing only; your own \"body\" gets horribly confused if you move around.\n\nAscension is fine, but this is a terrible rendition of it. Buy the 2D version instead.","timestamp_created":1566065397,"timestamp_updated":1566065397,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40LGx0OwCfrXF0AE="}
