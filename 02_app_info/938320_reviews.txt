There's no visual feedback if a villager is gathering or not. Generally there are not enough animations in the game to tell me what's happening. It feels like an Early Access title even though it isn't, Maps are extremely small too. The graphics are functional but not pretty.\nThere's no skirmish as far as I can see. Just some kind of wave mode.\n\nJust play some better RTS titles which are on the market now like the Age of Empires franchise. Age of Empires 4 will come soon enough ;)","timestamp_created":1597001308,"timestamp_updated":1597001308,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.610442280769348145","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9sKs6vMCd+26mgI="}
