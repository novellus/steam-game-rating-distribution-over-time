    review: "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Shaq. Only Shaq. No one else. [/i]\n\n\
      [b] Summary: [/b]  \nAn abomination of beat em ups, Shaq-Fu: A Legend Reborn\
      \ quickly wears you down with attempts of humor that hit the mark once in a\
      \ blue moon, and then make you wonder what the hell the writers were attempting\
      \ to joke about in the next breathe. Granted, you'll get shock value out of\
      \ the reveals in the game here and there, but a lot of the dialogue is cringeworthy\
      \ in a bad way: the type where you feel sorry for the game and can't even laugh\
      \ at it. But despite a presentation that's passable in the gameplay side of\
      \ things and cutscenes that are actually well done from an art perspective,\
      \ Shaq-Fu truly fails when it comes to gameplay.\n\nThe simple beat em up runs\
      \ out of tricks quickly despite some early enemy variety. The game's simple\
      \ combo system can't keep you entertained because it's just beating up the same\
      \ types of enemies, despite minor differences, over and over again. Sure, you'll\
      \ run into an enemy that you can't dash into for example, but he won't feel\
      \ like he's much different from any other enemy that you face. It doesn't help\
      \ that the combos are too simple and don't have any complex interactions with\
      \ them, other then, beat the shit out of opponent. Even when the game tries\
      \ to mix things up with a dance off section or suit gameplay, it feels hollow\
      \ as it's the most boring versions of those elements and sometimes don't even\
      \ match to the actions that you are doing.\n\nThe worst part about Shaq-Fu is\
      \ that it wastes your time by repeating sections over and over again, especially\
      \ in the last two levels of the game. Hell, the game knows this and tries to\
      \ make fun of it, but ultimately proves the point when it immediately goes back\
      \ to not even trying to keep things fresh. It drags and drags and drags. Yes,\
      \ some people don't want a short game, even those this game can be beaten in\
      \ two and a half hours. But when getting through the last hour is like getting\
      \ through a CSPAN senate hearing, somethings terribly terribly wrong.\n\nThis\
      \ is the kind of game where it's not even worth looking at. Sure, there's a\
      \ shock factor at times and there are elements to the game that do work, but\
      \ the sheer lack of fun kills the game before it can even get off the ground.\
      \ There's tons of much better Beat Em Ups out there, and Shaq-Fu pulled a J.R.\
      \ Smith. It didn't even show up when it was game time. \n\n[b]Video Review:\
      \ [/b]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJTYePUKq4M\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n\
      [list]\n[*] Once in a while, a clever reference finds its way into the game,\
      \ such as the China's overpopulation joke at the start of the game. A lot of\
      \ them are hidden in the environment, definitely making it worth searching them\
      \ out.\n[*] The art in the cutscenes in particular is rather well done and stands\
      \ out a bit compared to other games in the genre.\n[*] Shaq's voice is iconic\
      \ and does at least add something to the game.\n[*] The game definitely has\
      \ a WTF element to it for those wanting that.\n[*] It has controller support?\
      \ I mean, I really digging for positives here.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n\
      [list]\n[*] Too simple gameplay for the length of the game here. Within 15 minutes,\
      \ you get almost 95% of what the game has to show you.\n[*] The suits (Diesel,\
      \ Cactus) turn the game into a mindless bore, and don't make the game more fun.\n\
      [*] The repetition. The repetition. The repetition. Did I get the point across\
      \ about repetition? When the game makes a meta joke about the gameplay getting\
      \ stale from a repetitive standpoint....and then does the same thing over again,\
      \ you know something's wrong.\n[*] There seems to be missing sound assets during\
      \ specific attacks, and once in a while the music seemingly just dropped off\
      \ the face of the earth. \n[*] Some of the interactions with characters are\
      \ off, leaving weird animations and being awkward for all.\t\n[*] The game feels\
      \ slow in a lot of cases, and while the enemies match your speed for the most\
      \ part, I wish the game didn't match Shaq's speed in real life. Because it's\
      \ painfully slow at times.\n[*] Level Length is way too long, and drags out\
      \ the game to try to get 2 and a half hours. Hm, just more then the length of\
      \ refunds on Steam. I wonder why that could be. \n[*] Boss design is lazy most\
      \ of the time, barely going over one or two attacks that are easy to dodge most\
      \ of the time.\n[*] Reused models for \u201Cnew\u201D enemies has RUSHED written\
      \ all over it\n[*] The whole last two levels and everything about them, but\
      \ their attempts at meta humor in particular. They feel so......off.\n[*] Random\
      \ \u201Cinsta-kill\u201D moments that your character gets actually hurts the\
      \ strategy portion as like I said, it's completely random. It could put you\
      \ into a dangerous situation not of your own doing, and without you feeling\
      \ like you were the reason they happened, don't give any satisifaction.\n[*]\
      \ The skill element of the game doesn't exist, even at hard difficulty. Or barely\
      \ does, compared to fighting games of the past.\n[*] You sit there asking why\
      \ a lot of the time. Why are these bodies so misshappened? Why did that insta-kill\
      \ me? Why am I still playing. These are not the questions the game should be\
      \ getting you to ask.\n[*] Shaq's sponsorships with things like Gold-Bond attempt\
      \ to get plugged in cleverly in the game, but fall flat and make you feel like\
      \ it's more interested in getting you to buy them then entertain you. \n[*]\
      \ Some of the sound design gets overshadowed very quickly by the music. They\
      \ don't work well together.\n[*] There are some bad textures, especially in\
      \ the background.\n[*] Voice acting at times absolutely does not match the body/character\
      \ that's being portrayed. Like not even in a parody way: it's downright cringe\
      \ at times. \n[*] Pricing questions, but this is a less of a PC problem. Why\
      \ does the game cost twice as much on the Switch for the physical version? I\
      \ have no idea. \n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding\
