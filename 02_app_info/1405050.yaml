    short_description: This is different from the general ninja game, because you
      will play a &quot;ninegg&quot;, a novice ninja. There are so few skills that
      you can't even attack the enemy!? Take advantage of everything around you, avoid
      a lot of killing, collect broken scrolls, and challenge the final BOSS.
