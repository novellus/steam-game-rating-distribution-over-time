    review: "[h1] Experienced on Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]\n\n[i] Note\
      \ for Oculus users: it's an armswinger where you have to press grab and forward\
      \ (and down?) on your joystick so you can move around. You only move in the\
      \ hub though so it doesn't really matter. [/i]\n\nThe good news is that the\
      \ game does indeed work on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers. The bad news\
      \ is that it works on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers. Yeah .... this\
      \ is a bad game. It is not worth $4. I got it on sale for .99 cents and it's\
      \ not even worth that. This should be free to play. Even then, I would give\
      \ it a nuetral recommendation. There's just so many things wrong with this game.\
      \ The idea is simple. Drawing guns and battle against AI or onine against other\
      \ players. Okay, good luck finding anyone to gun duel with. \n\nSo you're stuck\
      \ with the AI which isn't bad. Except everything else about the game. The simple\
      \ act of grabbing your gun is quite the ordeal. You basically have to be looking\
      \ at it to guarantee you can grab it. I just learned to blind shoot my opponent\
      \ and anticipate the countdown to zero & draw. \n\nHow about it's an arm swinger\
      \ where you can walk through any object? How about there's no interactions other\
      \ than grabbing a few things. Well grabbing the beer is nice but guess what,\
      \ the liquid stays inside the glass. You can grab some NPCs but not others.\
      \ \n\nThere's a zombie horde mini-game after killing one of the wanted bandits\
      \ in a duel. It's horrible. It seemed like an endless wave where you eventually\
      \ run out of bullets. I was actually happy when it happened because I wanted\
      \ to quit playing, uninstall the game, and never play it again. The duels are\
      \ quickies. That leaves the rest of the mess to deal with and it's just not\
      \ worth it. If this were free to play, I would give it a 5/10. \n\nRate 4/10.\
      \ And my steam cards didn't drop either."
