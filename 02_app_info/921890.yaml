      together as one of the Retronauts and try to survive while re-activating the
      security system or play as murderous Destructo and hunt down the Retronauts
      one by one. Action survival gameplay with a touch of retro!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Teamwork
      is key</strong></h2>Retronaut players will have to work together to complete
      their objectives. Watch each other's back and make good use of the gadgets that
      can be found throughout the level. A Retronaut left alone is a Retronaut with
      a slim chance of survival.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Stay in the game</strong></h2>In
      Retro Rockets you get to keep playing if you were killed by Destructo. Killed
      Retronaut players will return as the mighty Securobot and will be able to take
      on Destructo! Causing Destructo having to adapt and change playstyle.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Head-on
      or Ambush</strong></h2>Playing as Destructo you will have to adapt to the situation.
      After having killed your first Retronaut you will have to start worrying about
      Securobots. Be sure to lay the perfect ambush and kill a Retronaut without the
      Securobots even knowing of it.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Gadgets, your tools
      for success</strong></h2>Throughout the levels, Retronaut players can find a
      variety of gadgets and weapons. Rarely will you be able to take Destructo head-on.
      However, using these gadgets wisely will help you in fending Destructo off and
      surviving a little bit longer.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Together or alone</strong></h2>You
      can play together with friends through the lobby system or take on strangers
      via matchmaking. Besides that, you can also explore the maps and improve your
      skills playing offline against computer-controlled opponents.

    review: "Retro Rockets possesses an aesthetic appeal that is fantastic. The concept\
      \ for the game is interesting and looking at all the information for the lore\
      \ behind the game is comical and intriguing. While the concept and the art for\
      \ the game is very good, the game play could be optimized better to balance\
      \ the game for both the destructo and the retronauts. I would give this game\
      \ a 7-8 out of 10.\n\nPositives:\nPlaying with your friends makes the game optimal\
      \ and hella fun. I would recommend having the retronauts be in a discord channel\
      \ while you play to communicate with your friends. \nOverall art and feel of\
      \ the game is fantastic.\nI like the fact that the humans can still keep going\
      \ if they die by becoming a securobot.\nPlaying as the destructo is fun and\
      \ difficult as you try to come up with \"big brain\" plays to win.\n\nNegatives:\n\
      Although this game is designed well, it is nearly impossible to win as the destructo.\
      \ Once the destructo has killed one person, that person then becomes a securobot\
      \ which has limited mobility and a lot of fire power. Almost too much fire power...\
      \ Even though the limited mobility creates some balance to the securobot, the\
      \ amount of firepower makes it incredibly difficult for the destructo. The problem\
      \ for the destructo though isn't killing all the humans (this happens almost\
      \ every game I've played.) The problem for the destructo is that you have to\
      \ go to the control room and have the ship self destruct. Because the destructo\
      \ has killed all the humans that means there are now 3 securobots all in the\
      \ control room waiting for the destructo to get there. The control room for\
      \ the map HQ is actually poorly designed because it is soo open. This means\
      \ that it is very easy for the securobots to shoot and kill the destructo without\
      \ moving or anything. I don't know if it would be best to make the securobot\
      \ have a slower buildup speed or what, but it can be very difficult to get away\
      \ from the securobots even with their lack of mobility.\nI suggest having 4\
      \ people play is best because it seems the ai programming isn't very strong.\n\
      \nHope for the game: \nI really hope they add more maps and different destructo\
      \ bots with different abilities. I also hope they add more weapons and tools\
      \ to the game because I love how each of them work. It would be nice if they\
      \ addressed the balancing issue sooner rather than later because I probably\
      \ won't want to play too much more otherwise.\n\nOverall really good game besides\
      \ the balancing issue. 7-8 out of 10"
