    about_the_game: Skylight is a turn-based tactics game of colossal space battles.
      Comes with VR (Vive/Rift) and non-VR versions!<br><br>On the bridge of your
      flagship, a holographic projector shows your fleet floating in space, facing
      the enemy and awaiting your orders. Command nimble squadrons of fighters, specialized
      frigates, and giant capital ships as you orchestrate your forces toward victory.
      <br><br>The new Deluxe Edition includes new missions and ships, for a total
      of 15 unique ship types. Play through 36 Campaign missions, create your own
      in Skirmish mode, or play a Multiplayer match against your friends or a stranger.

    review: "So you get into the game, do the tutorial, and then a match of campaign\
      \ and youre done. Thats all the content in this WHOLE 14,99\u20AC game.\nIts\
      \ just playing long, boring and easy matches with ONLY 15 different units over\
      \ and over again versus some dumb A.I\nThere is multiplayer, but noone playing\
      \ the game (of course)\nGameplay (from the units to actually playing a match):\
      \ Boring as all floopin hell\nVisuals: Ive seen better.\nPrice: Should be a\
      \ free game.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME NOR THE 4 TERRIBLE VR STRATEGY GAMES BUNDLE!\
      \ NONE OF EM ARE WORTH IT!\nI hate that i didnt refund this before it was too\
      \ late.\nI warn you. You will regret buying this game later."
