I can't recommend this one shot to anybody if I am honest with you. \n\nAs a keeper I was shocked with the little amount of information that I had to work with, there were so many scenarios that I could not possibly describe to the players without making up things on a whim. Usually, that is a standard in any roleplaying game; however, this was such a frequent theme with this scenario that it was just so apparent that I had little to no information.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the creature in this scenario does not feel like it belongs in the Lovecraft universe. It feels so out of place with its frost bow or whatever it was now again. It felt like the person was writing a Dungeons and Dragons campaign and just happened to be inspired by Cthulhu mythos all of a sudden. \n\nI did not have fun working with this one-shot and my players found it to be completely off the rails when it came to the Cthulhu mythos.\n\nI can't recommend this one shot at all. What I can suggest is \"Camp Sunny\" which is a free one shot that you can find on Chaosium's website. It is a great one-shot that gives you so much more information to use for the adventure.","timestamp_created":1578312651,"timestamp_updated":1578312716,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7pmxve8Ce5ej6gE="}
