“Clusters”, there are 2 clusters in each sector, and each sector containing 2 subjects, the two most dangerous ones are safely located in the central Sector 5, buried within the station, safely isolated from everything and everyone.<br><br>Some of the nodes are off limits and are the containment location for a subject, a place that has been prepared just for that subject in both environment

90’s and early 2000’s, the final version of the game will eventually contain 4 main game modes:<br>- Single Player Campaign<br>- Multiplayer<br>- Survival Mode<br>- Shoot ‘Em All<br><br><strong>The initial soon-to-come release however, will just have Survival Mode with experimental, replaceable maps, one gun, and enemies that are part of Subject [REDACTED]<\/strong><br><br>Once multiplayer mode
