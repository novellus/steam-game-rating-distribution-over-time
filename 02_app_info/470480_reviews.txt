The gameplay overall functions and is fun, but it's very easy to lose momentum, which is not helped by multiple unpredictable dead-ends. Of course you can get past them if you have a boost, keyword being if. And to beat the story you have to go through it at least 7 times, starting from the same stage every single time. A single playthrough till one ending doesn't take very long, and when revisiting a stage you are able to play only one of two to continue, but it does get tiresome to go through the same stages over and over. The stage builder is a fun diversion, but online capabilities are limited so don't expect to get too much use out if. Not to mention how buggy the game is when it comes to completion/achievements. I won't deny that I had my fun with this game, but I doubt I'll revisit it any time soon.\n\n[h1]Join our growing Gaming Community![/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Nepsgamingparadise]Nep's Gaming Paradise[/url] is not just my community; it's [i]our[/i] community.
