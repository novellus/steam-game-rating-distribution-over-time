The game died a long time ago, not long after I wrote this (initially) so I feel 100% vindicated and stand by this review.\n\nStats on reveiw as of this edit:\n2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful\n1 person found this review funny\n\nThe last laugh is mine.\n\n---begin review----\n\nCan't even get into a game for matchmaking.... Idk what's up with that, but if there are no players for a multiplayer only game this game is unplayable. So that sucks..\n\nI did play a \"try hero\" match where you go against an AI hero, and I have to say it wasn't very fun. I tried playing different heroes and that didn't improve the game at all. I guess this game just isn't for me. Coincidentally, this concept to the game isn't much to rave home about. It's basically a League of Legends clone without anyone to play with.\n\nidk what else I can put on this game cause for all intents and purposes, without players this is a high graphics card usage screen saver.","timestamp_created":1424569496,"timestamp_updated":1480259068,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497947603464126587","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwhpyU09gCfbjSNw=="}
