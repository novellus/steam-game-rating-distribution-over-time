I would say it really depens on if the character art does something for you.\n","timestamp_created":1595756691,"timestamp_updated":1595756691,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ449egxfMCc6zQlwI="}
