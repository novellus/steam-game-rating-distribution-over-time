    review: I played the original Adventureland alongs with many other Scott Adams's
      Interactive Fiction games back in the late 70s and loved them.  As soon as I
      heard  I could play Adventureland again with my kids and grandkids I purchased
      it right away on Steam.  It brought back so many good memories for me and the
      new version is even better now using the Conversational parsing engine!
