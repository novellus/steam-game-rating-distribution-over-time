However, we live in islamophobic era and this DLC is far from historical accuracy as it shows Salah El Din as un mercyful and barbarian. the truth is \"According to Jonathan Riley-Smith, Scott's portrayal of Saladin was that of a \"modern [19th-century] liberal European gentlemen, beside whom medieval Westerners would always have made a poor showing\". Despite the Crusaders' slaughter when they originally conquered Jerusalem in 1099, Saladin granted amnesty and free passage to all common Catholics and even to the defeated Christian army, as long as they were able to pay the aforementioned ransom (the Greek Orthodox Christians were treated even better, because they often opposed the western Crusaders).\n\nNotwithstanding the differences in beliefs, the Muslim Saladin was respected by Christian lords, Richard especially. Richard once praised Saladin as a great prince, saying that he was without doubt the greatest and most powerful leader in the Islamic world. Saladin in turn stated that there was not a more honorable Christian lord than Richard. After the treaty, Saladin and Richard sent each other many gifts as tokens of respect but never met face to face. In April 1191, a Frankish woman's three-month-old baby had been stolen from her camp and sold on the market. The Franks urged her to approach Saladin herself with her grievance. According to Bahā' al-Dīn, Saladin used his own money to buy the child back:\n\nHe gave it to the mother and she took it; with tears streaming down her face, and hugged the baby to her chest. The people were watching her and weeping and I (Ibn Shaddad) was standing amongst them. She suckled it for some time and then Saladin ordered a horse to be fetched for her and she went back to camp.\" I do not mind if you want to add some drama to make the game more exciting but changing the character completely is un acceptable and shame on developers.","timestamp_created":1609366704,"timestamp_updated":1609366704,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.445020735263824463","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+OHu2vYCfbL1vgI="}
