    review: "I'm not an avid fighting-game player but I still enjoy this game for\
      \ what it currently has to offer. The characters being based on national Filipino\
      \ heroes is definitely an interesting take! I already can't wait to hear the\
      \ lore of individual characters and I hope they will find their inspiration\
      \ from their true stories in some way. There are a lot of things I can nitpick\
      \ of course, especially with its current UI, but it is admittedly in its early\
      \ stages so I expect the developers have those issues in mind already and under\
      \ a schedule hopefully.\n\nI play with my keyboard and one of the most notable\
      \ issues I've come across so far has to do with guessing which keys do which.\
      \ I don't mean the move list (although the chart explaining them could look\
      \ more organized and explained more) but there are at least three buttons I've\
      \ found so far that all mean \"confirm\". And I found them by clicking every\
      \ key in my keyboard, checking if one works. I've yet to figure out what \"\
      return\" key is. And navigating through the UI switches between using the mouse\
      \ and using the keyboard, it was a li'l frustrating at first. I hope they'll\
      \ be able to add those \"Press Esc to return\" instructions somewhere in the\
      \ screen so it's easier to navigate through the menu and options. (^\u25BD^;)\
      \ Then again, it might just be because it's my first fighting game played on\
      \ a keyboard and those keys are considered the \"standard\" keys fighting-gamers\
      \ would know by hand but if that's the case, I hope they work on also making\
      \ it more user friendly to players new to the genre. \n\nOverall, as expected\
      \ from a game in early access, it's definitely still rough around the edges.\
      \ But the concept and idea is definitely one I haven't seen before and I'm really\
      \ excited to find a game that sheds light on the Philippine's rich culture.\
      \ I hope those behind storybuilding will continue to develop a unique story\
      \ line, one that takes a lot of inspiration from real Filipino stories, that\
      \ we haven't seen in other fighting games before. Best of luck to the dev team\
      \ and keep up the good work!"
