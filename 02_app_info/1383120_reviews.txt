Even the pieces look similar. But I'd consider that a positive, the thumbs down is just because it's a very very low content game right now with no single player offerings unless you count opening an online lobby and playing with bots. The UI is also very abstract as to cause confusion. Everything else is your-mileage-may-vary and probably comes off much better in a party environment that I can't really test with no one to play it with, like the car physics and narrow roads causing a lot of crazy bumbling.\n\nWhat's here isn't done bad for its purpose but we'll see if updates make it a fuller game.","timestamp_created":1604005043,"timestamp_updated":1604005043,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s9OJu/UCfp/2qgI="}
