I'm much prefer less-decent but much alive graphic over much-decent but less alive one,\n and I suspect many people who want this style of game might have a similar taste. I suggest one of reason to this is it's\n poor present of elevation. Many parts of map giving very flat image, which is not good.\n\n Bad thing > Some actual character sprite(By saying some, I mean one out of three featured in demo) show off bad sign.\n One supposed to have a spider-maiden apperance, but instead it has a skeleton riding on skeletal spider.\n This is very strange thing and highly out of place, I suspect it's not exclusively designed asset for this game but\n just kinda-appropriate image brought by dev from elsewhere. It's quite silly compare to it's granduer scenery.\n\n Many of dialogue from NPC is awkward and feels like dragging off unneccesarily.\n Also they really need to get proof reading. I know this because I'm bad english user myself.\n\n And finally, I think that transformation of protagonist is just bad presentation.\n From apperance to it's mouse using control.\n\n Maybe this 'appearance' part is just my personal taste,\n But celestial being in full armored figure is just not that looks good I think.\n\n\n - - -\n\n Although I'm not content with it's demo, still it's very tiny piece of main game obviously\n\n so maybe I'm wrong in some regard. Atleast I'll check out again whence full game come out.","timestamp_created":1487163288,"timestamp_updated":1487163288,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540028095245361328","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnN31oNoCeM6bcg=="}
