    about_the_game: "Tens of thousands of children die every day worldwide; when 6\
      \ year old Helena was hit by a city bus in the streets of Lima, she should have\
      \ been one of them. She was in fact pronounced dead on the operating table,\
      \ but suddenly sprang back to life exactly three minutes later. She spoke adamantly\
      \ of visions of heaven and claimed that God had sent her back for a purpose\
      \ beyond her understanding. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYears later, she stumbled upon\
      \ an ancient cache of Templar arms and armor. With a determination bordering\
      \ on fanaticism, she trained herself in the use of it. After a year of solitary\
      \ prayer, It was time for her to fulfill her purpose: to purge the world of\
      \ evil.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some realities of the Multiverse, Fanatic joined\
      \ the costumed Sentinels of the world and became a Prime Warden. In this disparate\
      \ reality, she seeks out and destroys evil within the darkest dungeons!<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nThis DLC includes the Fanatic hero card for One Deck Dungeon."
