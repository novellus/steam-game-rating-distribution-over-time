    review: "I picked this up in the Lunar New Year sale at 80% off, and for that\
      \ price, Simple Railroad is good value. \n\nThe goal is to lay tracks and direct\
      \ a given number of trains or carriages to their destinations, usually within\
      \ a (so far) generous time period. The challenge comes from various environments\
      \ that limit your track placement, and the difficulty of avoiding other trains.\
      \ If you do crash, you can send out a special train to clear the wreck, but\
      \ that train also must be directed back to a station. It can get quite hectic,\
      \ but there are buttons to slow down the gameplay which helps a lot. \n\nLaying\
      \ track costs money, but I haven't been short of cash yet. You also get to spend\
      \ your earnings on restoring old trains which is actually quite motivating and\
      \ the 3D models look pretty good. I've not finished one yet, but there are achievements\
      \ for doing so.\n\nI played the first seven levels before writing this review,\
      \ and enjoyed the challenge. Sure, the graphics look a bit cheap and the English\
      \ isn't perfect, but the gameplay is good enough to warrant a positive review.\
      \ \n"
