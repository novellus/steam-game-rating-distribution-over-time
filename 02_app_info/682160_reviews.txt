Players get to nurture their 'eggs' and watch them develop into caterpillars and eventually fully grown Butterbies. Each Butterbie has a different character and I know that players (young and not so young) will have great fun collecting them all. The game looks beautiful, which makes it appealing to play, but it is also fun and educational. The mini-games have different levels of difficulty and strengthen different skill sets, from hand-eye coordination to planning, concentration and strategizing. This game is not just for the kids lol.  I thoroughly enjoyed playing the  mini-games and challenging myself to  beat my previous scores. It is well worth the money. It keeps the kids entertained whilst teaching them valuable life skills like identifying basic needs for survival (food/water/hygiene/play) and taking responsibility for a pet- albeit a virtual one!!","timestamp_created":1550413864,"timestamp_updated":1550413864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxMP3/egCco6QuwE="}
