    review: I stumbled upon this game about a month ago on tik tok and I thought it
      was pretty cool so I kept coming back to watch the videos of this game being
      created. I was pretty exited as theres currently no "super speed" game on PC
      nor console. One day I was scrolling through tik tok and saw a video from the
      creator saying he decided to release the game on steam I was so exited, even
      though I wanted to get it the day it released I didn't have time until today.
      The game is pretty much what I was hoping for, It's still rough and is very
      much an early access. I'm not going to bother listing things I think should
      be implemented because im sure the developers heard the same requests too many
      times to count. I can't wait to see what this game turns into, if done right
      you could have one of the most unique games out there. Good luck and thank you
      for listening to the fans.
