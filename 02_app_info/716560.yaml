    review: This game won't teach you a second language. But if you're already learning
      a second language through other means, you can make vocabulary lists for words
      you need to practice, upload them into this game, and it becomes a neat little
      arcade game for practicing vocabulary recall. I personally recommend getting
      it on sale.
