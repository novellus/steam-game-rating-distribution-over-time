    review: 'L''Hermione is quite decent 5th rate frigate

      but there are better ships at this rate.

      She can be used as support ship

      or quick hard punching carronade ship.


      She looks quite nice (even better with painter dlc)

      her hull have quite decent angles, for sure help

      new player lern to bounce cannon balls.


      If you have an Trincomale dlc you can forget about her

      unless you hate Trincos like me hehehe
