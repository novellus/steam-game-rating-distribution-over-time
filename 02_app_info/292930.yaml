    review: "The storyline for this game is very good and interesting, but the gameplay\
      \ is very tedious and slow (perhaps due to its age). You walk slow, everyone\
      \ talks slow, and a lot of the game advancement involves doing one thing, then\
      \ walking all the way back (slowly) across the map to do one single thing, then\
      \ walking all the way back to where you were. \n\nI'm just over halfway through,\
      \ and I doubt I will finish the game. Just don't have the patience for it."
