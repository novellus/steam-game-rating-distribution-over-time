    about_the_game: <strong>Welcome to Whiskey Island!</strong><br>You have reached
      the shores of Whiskey island - a distant echo in the mist of time and memory.  Will
      you stay to build a more colourful life, of leave it behind in search of greener
      pastures?<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1433240/extras/Custom_-_cargo.png?t=1608247451"
      /><br><br><strong> Game Play </strong><br><i>Whiskey Island</i> is a 3D immersive
      environment with a first-person point of view.  Explore the island on foot,
      drive trucks, or operate locomotives to assemble trains and switch tracks.  The
      basic idea is to use trains and trucks to transport cargo.  Pick up resource
      cargos from various locations around the island and deliver them to factories
      and mills for processing.  The finished goods can then be transported to other
      factories or to the Seaport for final delivery.<br><br>Transporting cargo will
      keep the wheels of industry turning, and <i>Whiskey Island</i> can be a busy
      place when the lumber mill, fruit factory, smelter, metal works, and distillery
      are operating at full capacity. Factories and mills require resources including
      logs, ore, grain, fruit, boxes, barrels, and general supplies, to produce products,
      and the finished goods must be removed from the loading docks in a timely manner
      or production stops.  Be careful to maintain your equipment - the trucks and
      trains need fuel and maintenance to operate efficiently. Thankfully the Island
      Garage and the Railway Workshops are there to help.  <br><br><i>Whiskey Island</i>
      can also be a relaxing and casual escape if you'd rather just drive trucks and
      trains, explore beaches, and hike in the mountains without worrying about cargo.  Building
      production may stop for a while - it can always be restarted by transporting
      cargo when you're ready.  <br>  <br>Gold is earned for each cargo unit delivered,
      and <i>Whiskey Island</i> becomes a more colourful place as your Happiness level
      increases.  But beware!  If you leave on the next tramp steamer, you will leave
      the Island behind as a distant and fading memory.<br><br><i>With Trucks, Trains,
      and Transport, places to go and things to do, <strong>Whiskey Island</strong>
      is waiting for you!</i>

    review: 'WOW!! this game is, even regarding it is EA, so bad!!!!! WhenI I finaly
      managed to get in a truck or train, I am walking in it. I mean while driving
      the truck, I hear footsteps and the screen is moving like I am walking and it
      does not res[pond like as if I am driving.

      I got a refund'
