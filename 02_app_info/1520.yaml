      \ an underground bunker. Your mission is to successfully exterminate your enemy's\
      \ civilian population whilst saving your own. Points are awarded or lost depending\
      \ on both the efficacy and thoroughness of your nuclear vendetta and the number\
      \ of your own civilian deaths.  In order to win you must wipe out the enemy\
      \ population and simultaneously disable the enemy's ability to retaliate against\
      \ you. This is an extremely difficult task since launching an attack on the\
      \ enemy exposes the positions of your own Ground Silos, Subs and Bombers the\
      \ moment they launch nuclear weapons, making you extremely vulnerable and exposed\
      \ to a crushing counter-attack. <br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDesperate attempts must\
      \ be made to form fast, tactical alliances, alliances that may at any moment\
      \ break-down to become the treacherous and most deadly of betrayals. Everyone\
      \ looks to each other in a state of nervous suspense and paranoid accusation.\
