    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">Side-Scrolling Tactical Action</h2><br>Magic
      Scroll Tactics is a side-scrolling, turn-based tactical RPG where elevation
      is the key to victory. Gain the high ground and rain devastating blows down
      upon your hapless foes, or watch with consternation as your summons have trouble
      hitting the well-protected enemies menacing them from above...<br><br>But never
      fear! Even if you''re in a bind, you have a wide variety of options at your
      disposal to turn the tides of battle. Use quick and agile warriors to seize
      the high ground, flying units to dominate the battlefield from the air, or magic
      that can roast, freeze, or zap foes, whatever their position!<h2 class="bb_tag">Detailed
      Ability Trees</h2><br>Use the points characters gain each time they level up
      to learn and improve different abilities. Every class has its own abilities
      to master, and characters can switch jobs to open up a whole new set of abilities.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Wizards and Pirates and Summoners, Oh My!</h2>Nash is a feisty
      summoner with a job to do: namely, stopping a group of evil magi from resurrecting
      an ancient witch and destroying the world!<br><br>Along the way, she''ll befriend
      a young priestess from an ancient and noble lineage, duel an extremely persistent
      pirate obsessed with loot, and fight hordes of deadly monsters!'
