The controls are fairly coarse, with your character moving and falling really quickly, with a dash that gives iframes that occasionally can't clear attacks. Your hitbox is pretty big, and your attack range is short, so you have to get really close to enemies, but not too close because they do contact damage, and that becomes even more difficult with twitchy controls and enemies that move really fast. You have a very short invincibility window after taking hits, so your four hit points can get drained in seconds. Implementation flaws occasionally cause you to take damage through no fault of your own when terrain doesn't spawn in ways you can move to it. This all comes to a head with the final boss fight, which combines these issues with pure RNG attacks that regularly wall you completely in and force you to take damage, and a survival section that wastes 75 seconds of your time every attempt you make. The jank was too much: I've spent 14 hours with this game, at least nine of those were just trying to beat the final boss, and I think I've given up.\n\nThe pixel art and soundtrack are both good and set a calm and melancholy sort of atmosphere for a story that uses one of the many vague areas of Touhou's canon to good effect. Unfortunately other decisions undercut the mood of the game (ah yes, everyone's favorite Touhou characters, the cave gorillas?) and the times the gameplay takes front seat the beautiful animation just ends up getting lost amid the other issues. \n\nAdditionally the use of a Sanae portrait from Ten Desires and the iconic 'Pichuun' death sound is probably a violation of Touhou's fan work policy.\n","timestamp_created":1609891742,"timestamp_updated":1609891742,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk9DB6vYCdvvtwAI="}
