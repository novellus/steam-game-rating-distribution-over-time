    review: "[Editing after build 0.1.1.7]\n[u]Yoga in VR?[/u]\nThe foremost issue\
      \ worth addressing is whether yoga itself is a good fit for VR. Standing poses\
      \ could be tracked with controllers, but that wouldn't work so well for poses\
      \ like downward-dog. VR provides immersion and escapism, which sounds wonderful,\
      \ but the obvious tradeoff is a cumbersome headset (especially with current\
      \ wired ones). You can't see yourself or hand and foot placement; this can be\
      \ problematic for some poses. \n\n[u]Namaste Virtual Yoga Retreat in Summary[/u]\n\
      While still in early development, it shows some promise but, so far, it's a\
      \ prototype. The challenges introduced by VR need to be overcome by the depth\
      \ of immersion and/or interaction and this application doesn't quite live up\
      \ to that (yet?). The Dev has, so far, been very responsive to criticism. At\
      \ it's current price-point ($6.99) I can recommend it with the caveat that while\
      \ it's doing what it needs to, it's still up in the air whether yoga seems a\
      \ good fit for VR and you should know what you're getting into with any early\
      \ access software. If you're new to yoga, you're probably better off with a\
      \ live class or videos. If you're experienced, you'll find the navigation and\
      \ lack of variety frustrating but my hope is that they'll follow through and\
      \ continue building up the app. \n\n[b]The Basics[/b]\nThe basic elements are\
      \ in place. Pick an environment and you're greeted with fairly standard mellow\
      \ music and generally soothing environments. From there, you can load up videos\
      \ (short, medium, long) in a fixed-position video player. The instructor is\
      \ good and video straightforward. \n\n[b]Environments[/b]\nThe environments\
      \ are well-chosen, though of middling quality and not much variety. Yoga on\
      \ the beach is great but what about in a forest or on the roof of a skyscraper?\
      \ Those, especially the latter, might not be your ideals, but VR is all about\
      \ creating unique experiences - not necessarily duplicating existing ones. The\
      \ sets are mostly low-poly and the textures could use some detail - those nearest\
      \ you, in particular, since you'll be staring at the ground a lot. The lack\
      \ of detail removes some of the organic feel you'd want from these environments.\
      \ \n\nOnly one environment had a yoga mat and its detail is also lacking. After\
      \ using my Rift's reset view function repeatedly, I was able to roughly line\
      \ up the mat with a physical one, which helped with immersion and also to establish\
      \ boundaries. \n\nThe environments are also fairly static. The water has waves\
      \ and the clouds slowly move across the sky but everything else feels lifeless.\
      \ There's vegetation but no breeze blowing its branches.  \n\n[b]Audio[/b]\n\
      The music's a passable new-agey backdrop but there's no variety. From the initial\
      \ release, they've adjusted the video volume so it's much easier to hear but\
      \ I'd still recommend keeping the music level at the lowest setting.\n\n[b]Instructor\
      \ Video[/b]\nThe instructor obviously knows what she's doing. There are times,\
      \ though, when poses are done well before instructions are given, causing one\
      \ to fall out of sync with the class, especially when you're not looking at\
      \ the video (which will, likely, be 3/4 of the class). Instructor variety would\
      \ be nice since everyone brings their own style but I'd rather have this one\
      \ good instructor than a half-dozen unskilled ones. The video (as of recent\
      \ updates) is moveable, though, and they've added a small video window to your\
      \ headset view so you can always follow along (though it's pretty tiny).\n\n\
      The video itself could also be more dynamic, with varying angles or close ups\
      \ for pose tips. I can see the justification for a fixed camera (apart from\
      \ the ease of recording) since it's easier to track visually but with grainy\
      \ video at a distance it can be hard to see with current VR resolution. \n\n\
      [b]Interaction[/b]\nMotion-tracked controllers are nearly useless. The menu\
      \ interaction is frustratingly unintuitive. Even though I've navigated a couple\
      \ dozen other VR experiences, I was initially unable to figure out how to change\
      \ your position (i.e. teleport) and using the menus requires an odd combination.\
      \ It's as though the developer hadn't tried many VR experiences to see how others\
      \ are doing it. The sliders are either unlabeled or their labels are unintuitive\
      \ - what does this one do and which way's louder? They've added the ability\
      \ to move the main video window but it took me a couple of minutes to figure\
      \ out how. There is a user guide in the install directory but it'd be nice to\
      \ have it displayed or linked in the application itself. \n\nA standard controller\
      \ or keyboard would be easier to navigate the functions with. Since the touch\
      \ controllers serve no purpose during class, I placed them at the corners of\
      \ my play space as visual indicators of my boundaries. \n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\n\
      I sincerely hope to see this application develop. The features the developers\
      \ are considering sound great and they've already made several improvements\
      \ addressing some of my concerns. Currently, if you want a VR yoga experience,\
      \ this is your best all-in-one option. Alternatively, you could load up your\
      \ favorite home/environmental app and listen to an audio class but that juggling\
      \ that sounds tedious. I look forward to doing more classes in Namaste after\
      \ it's come a little further. \n\nA bit about me and my setup: I'd consider\
      \ myself intermediate in yoga, having done somewhere around 100 classes with\
      \ various instructors and a few video and audio classes. I use an Oculus Rift\
      \ CV1 in a moderate play space (roughly a 4'x5' area). Running a GTX 1080 on\
      \ an i7 6850 w/ 16G DDR4, though feel this app would run quite well at much\
      \ lower specs."
