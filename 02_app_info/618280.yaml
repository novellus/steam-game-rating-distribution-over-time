    review: 'I was blown away with this game! I thought finally a real game in VR...
      then it ended right when it was getting interesting?!


      2hrs and I''m not the quickest player out there by any means. Luckily I bought
      the package with part 2. I''m downloading it now and expect it to be good to
      but theres no way these should be sold separately imo!


      I''ll update after I play part 2.


      BTW steam needs another option besides thumbs up or down!'
