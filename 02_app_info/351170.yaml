    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><br>We live in an amazing time.\
      \ Computers are becoming smarter and more powerful, and more tangible items\
      \ are being turned into digital data. Science predicts that within the next\
      \ hundred years artificial intelligence (AI) will be as smart as humans. Imagine\
      \ the possibilities if this trend continues for thousands of years. <br><br>In\
      \ the distant future, AI will be so common in technology that even a single\
      \ pixel in an image file may be controlled by one. Pixel: ru\xB2 is a tale of\
      \ a sentient pixel that is tasked with eliminating a virus and restoring corrupted\
      \ image files. Being a pixel isn\u2019t easy; you\u2019ll face infected pixels,\
      \ puzzles that require color and gravity manipulation, and precision platforming\
      \ challenges. You can complete your mission as efficiently as possible, or you\
      \ can let your curiosity lead you to bits of information that may reveal the\
      \ bigger picture.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About</h2><br>Pixel: ru\xB2 (are you squared)\
      \ is a game that is a combination of a platformer, a shooter, and a puzzle game.\
      \ The gameplay features color theory based puzzle and combat mechanics and gravity\
      \ manipulation based puzzle and platforming mechanics. There are a lot of simple\
      \ systems stacked on top of each other which makes it easy to learn, but difficult\
      \ to master.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Early Access</h2><br>Since Pixel: ru\xB2 was\
      \ first conceived, we've been deigning it for be a competitive game.  You don't\
      \ need to compete to enjoy the game, but we built the score system around players\
      \ competing with each other on global leaderboards.  To help make sure everything\
      \ is balanced, we're providing access to the game early.  This will allow us\
      \ to see what needs to be adjusted to help make the game better overall.  We\
      \ do plan on <strong>raising the price as we add more content</strong> to the\
      \ game.  If you'd like to purchase the game at a discount, buy it now before\
      \ it goes up in price.  Doing so will also help you shape some of the game's\
      \ mechanics.  If you're not willing to take the risk on an Early Access title,"

      \ should a 2D game be designed for 1080p at 60 frames per second or even worse,\
      \ 720p at 30 frames per second?  We designed Pixel: ru\xB2 with modern computer\
      \ technology in mind.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">120 Hz</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/351170/extras/store-120hz.png?t=1498155650\"\
      \ /><br>Pixel: ru\xB2 is designed to be run at <strong>120 frames per second</strong>.\
      \  If needed, it can be rendered at a lower framerate through the video settings\
      \ to reduce GPU load, but it will still internally be running at a smooth 120\
      \ Hz.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">4K</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/351170/extras/store-4k.png?t=1498155650\"\
      \ /><br>Pixel: ru\xB2 may look like a low resolution game, but it's actually\
      \ designed for a <strong>4K display</strong>.  Anything smaller results in the\
      \ graphics being scaled down to fit correctly.  This means that instead of the\
      \ graphics being stretched or duplicated for scaling up, they are blended together\
      \ smoothly for scale down.  This results in a much nicer looking experience\
      \ for all resolutions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FLAC (requires DLC)</h2><img src=\"\
      https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/351170/extras/store-lossless.png?t=1498155650\"\
      \ /><br>If you purchase the soundtrack DLC you will be provided with <strong>lossless\
      \ versions of the in-game music</strong>.  Having the soundtrack installed will\
      \ allow Pixel: ru\xB2 to play lossless tracks instead of the Ogg Vorbis files\
      \ it comes with.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">RGB</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/351170/extras/store-keyboard.png?t=1498155650\"\
      \ /><br>Have a keyboard with RGB LED's in it?  We designed Pixel: ru\xB2 to\
      \ take advantage of them by doing <strong>colorful effects on your keyboard</strong>\

    review: "Pixel: ru\xB2 has several neat ideas with color based platforming and\
      \ puzzle solving that I feel are well implemented. It's music is solid and it's\
      \ sound design is competent. But I feel it's making a few mis-steps that are\
      \ preventing it from becoming an excellent game. \n\nFirstly, the controls feel\
      \ a little twitchy. There are times when I would try to nudge myself along and\
      \ found myself careening off of a platform to my death. As death is cheap and\
      \ there are frequent save points throughout most levels, this is not a huge\
      \ loss. But I feel if the pace of the PC, platforms, and the like were slowed\
      \ by 25% it would feel as though the player had better control over their character.\n\
      \nSecond, I feel the weapon options are too plentiful as to be overwhelming.\
      \ Throughout the course of the tutorial, you're given access to six different\
      \ weapons, and told you can rotate between them at any time. Additionally, you\
      \ can change the color of the particles you shoot, which will change the damage\
      \ the particle deals to the enemy based on it's color. You're instructed on\
      \ how to use them and some neat tricks you can do with them (like rocket jumping).\
      \ Unfortunately, when given the option you'll likely only use two or three of\
      \ the weapon types. On a more frustrating note, there is a later level which\
      \ restricts your ability to use alternate weapons. I believe this could be improved\
      \ by restricting weapons to power-ups found in the level themselves, and potentially\
      \ having blocks that modify your weapon's color in addition to your own color.\
      \ \n\nFinally, from my play time of the game, the time I spent on the final\
      \ level was nearly equal to the time I spent on all the levels previous to it.\
      \ I don't mind an increasing difficulty curve in a game, but that was much more\
      \ of a spike than a curve. I feel it could be improved by slowing the pace of\
      \ the auto-scrolling wall so as to give the player a little bit of lee-way.\n\
      \nUnfortunately, with it's abruptness and control issues, I do not feel I can\
      \ currently recommend this game. As this is early access, I do not consider\
      \ this a final state of affairs. I look forward to seeing how the game is refined\
      \ and hope to change my recommendation later in development / upon release."
