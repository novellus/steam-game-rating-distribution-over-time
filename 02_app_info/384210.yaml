      A brand new arcade puzzler from Gamesare Studios, Invoking the memory of classic
      arcade cabinet games but adding a new twist. Jump on the blocks as the titular
      character Quadle, changing the block colors till they are red. Once red they
      fall away. Eliminate all blocks on the screen to go to the next level. Be careful
      not to corner yourself into a situation where you can jump to the next block.
      <br><br>With three worlds and a initial offering of 96 levels there is plenty
      of arcade puzzle action to frustrate I mean to enjoy. Of course just when you
      think  you get the hang of it, Quadle is introduced to new suprises, like switch
      panels, spring beams, drop blocks and more. Can you get through all 96 levels?
