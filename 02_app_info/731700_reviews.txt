I picked up a baseball bat and got flung into the wall, which made me feel pretty sick.\nI couldn't drive the car, for whatever reason. The steering on the bikes is horrendous, and for some reason being on a vehicle blocks all your bullets from doing anything.\n\nAlso there's no actual goal to anything, you just drive around for a bit, killing people. It's basically a Mass Shooting Simulator.","timestamp_created":1514908494,"timestamp_updated":1514908494,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.631195962429046631","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwi6Xl2+ACcZ3YlAE="}
