I usually love that kind of minimalistic games even tho they have a ton of flaws, but this one's literally unplayable for me. \n\nGame doesn't even have a menu to change the horrid mouse sensitivity.\n\nRefrain from buying this game if you don't like:\n\n-forced mouse acceleration\n-massive headbob\n-clunky movement\n-30-40 FOV range. trying to move inside a building with this fov is a good way to puke at your screen. Ive played a lot of games with forced low fov like offpeak and norwood suite and you get used to it, but this game's fov is atrocious. it's like you're playing trough a telescope.\n\nStay away.\n\nFps are around 20-30 with a gtx 1070 and 4790k at 2k...\n\nedit/ game runs at a locked 20 fps.","timestamp_created":1592426246,"timestamp_updated":1608750639,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.457614392042160034","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+dTAyPYCfZjUjgI="}
