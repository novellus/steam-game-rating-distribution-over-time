    review: 'Really good representation of the actual board game so far. The only
      thing I wish they would change is incorporating Twilight Struggle''s action
      round tabs instead of that awful log (it''s better than nothing, I guess), and
      maybe adding an option to pause and confirm after every opponent play. The later
      would especially be useful to newer players who aren''t familiar with all the
      cards, instead of having to go through the discard and removed to read the cards.


      Another couple items if you''re thinking of buying this:

      1. There aren''t that many people playing this game right now, so don''t expect
      to play a quick (45 mins) real-time match with randoms - there''s no games in
      the lobby. I''m hoping this changes as more people buy the game.

      2. The only AI option at the moment is a bot that uses the cards'' operations
      points, but doesn''t trigger its opponent''s event, so it''s not like playing
      with actual rules. That being said, maybe it''s because I''m new to the game,
      but because of this, I find it more challenging than the Twilight Struggle AI
      - which isn''t saying much.


      So yeah, almost no complaints. Solid Purchase. Good job Playdek!


      PS When are those COIN and Imperial Struggle games coming? :)'
