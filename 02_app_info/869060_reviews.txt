Fails to explain a lot of things and is more confusing than helpful. Spent 45 minutes going through the tutorial because I couldn't do so many things that should just work (rotate rooms, seating etc for the buildings). Spent ages making an awesome clubhouse, tried to place it, and was clearly way too big and had to get rid of it. Playing your course isn't explained well at all, I still have no idea. \n\n Hoped to be something like Sid Meiers Sim Golf, but fails on so many levels. Haven't played enough to give a real recommendation, but just need a break after dealing with the tutorial.","timestamp_created":1609581219,"timestamp_updated":1609581219,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y4mh4fYCc87WvwI="}
