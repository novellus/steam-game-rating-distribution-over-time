      is a Top Down third person shooting game(TPS) with role playing game(RPG) elements.
      Hope to bring you different wonderful game experience.<br>     In a remote village
      in the north of a country, as a meteor streaked across the night sky, a UFO
      crashed into the valley. The escape of an unnamed creature triggered an official
      action and the surrounding villagers were evacuated. A female police officer
      who was arresting the murderer and a male special combat team member who was
      carrying out the exercise were unintentionally involved in the accident. With
      a loud noise, it seems that there is a black hole isolated from the world. There
      are also innocent villagers on the road who can be evacuated in the future.
      Can our protagonist escape from this black hole like barrier and alien monster?
      It seems that there is only one blood way out.<br>     The story background
      of this game comes from an unfinished science fiction suspense novel that the
      author is creating. This is first adapted into game works. Please look forward
      to the end of the novel.<br><br>     <strong><i><h2 class="bb_tag">What are
