    about_the_game: "Enjoy contemporary and challenging railroading in the spacious\
      \ prairies of Alberta, Canada as the remarkable Canadian National Peace River\
      \ route comes to Train Simulator!<br><br>Created by Milepost Simulations, the\
      \ Canadian National Peace River route delivers the experiences of hauling lumber\
      \ products, timber, grain, and mixed commodities across 40 route miles of demanding,\
      \ scenic Canadian National trackage located in Northern Alberta, Canada.<br><br>Train\
      \ Simulator\u2019s Canadian National Peace River route is centered upon the\
      \ town of Peace River, Alberta, and includes portions of the Canadian National\
      \ Railway\u2019s Peace River, Manning, and Daishowa Subdivisions. The southern\
      \ end of the Train Simulator Canadian National Peace River route is at Judah,\
      \ located high on the Alberta prairie. From Judah to Grimshaw, via Peace River\
      \ and Roma Junction, the route re-creates much of the CN Peace River Subdivision.\
      \ From Roma Junction to nearby Roma Yard, the route replicates a key element\
      \ of the CN Manning Sub, and from Michaud (on the west bank of the Peace River),\
      \ the route fully re-creates the modern and rugged 10-mile Daishowa Subdivision\
      \ to Peace Valley. <br><br>The included rail lines provide the Canadian National\
      \ Peace River route with both main line tonnage and robust lineside tonnage\
      \ sources, including grain elevators and loading facilities at Grimshaw, and\
      \ a modern and expansive lumber mill at Peace Valley. Handling main line tonnage\
      \ on the Canadian National Peace River route is a guarantee of challenging railroading.\
      \ The line between Judah and Peace River involves a tortuous 2.4 percent grade\
      \ linking the river valley and high prairie. The work west of the river is demanding,\
      \ too; climbing from Michaud to Roma involves a gradient of over 2 percent and\
      \ use of a double-horseshoe to gain elevation. <br><br>The Canadian National\
      \ Peace River route includes locomotives and rolling stock ideally suited to\
      \ serve on the line. The featured locomotive is Canadian National\u2019s six-axle,\
      \ 3,000-horsepower SD40-2W. Based on Electro-Motive\u2019s standard SD40-2,\
      \ the SD40-2W features the Canadian \u201Ccomfort cab,\u201D a design which\
      \ includes a full-width and strengthened nose, more spacious crew cab, and distinctive\
      \ four-piece windshield. The SD40-2W is provided in two CN liveries, the railway\u2019\
      s current livery and CN\u2019s earlier \u201Czebra stripe\u201D livery. Featured\
      \ freight equipment includes Canada\u2019s classic cylindrical-design covered\
      \ grain hoppers in two well-known liveries; boxcars in two liveries; center-beam\
      \ and bulkhead lumber flats; and a Canadian National-design steel cupola caboose.\
      \ And to put you right to work hauling tonnage and handling switching duties,\
      \ the route also features a selection of six career scenarios which provide\
      \ realistic operating experiences across the entire 40-mile route. <br> <br>Explore\
      \ the great prairie and river country of Canada and master a range of locomotive\
      \ skills with the Canadian National Peace River route!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included\
