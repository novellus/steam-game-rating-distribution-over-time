As a fan of Order of Battle, I stumbled upon this game, and it is as close as we'll get to an Order of Battle-style game for WWI.  By that, I mean it's a deep and functional wargame, but on lower difficulties it's a fun 'watch my territory expand and stuff go boom' game.\n\nIt may be more fun than it is deep, but that's not a bad thing.  I suggest giving this one a shot. You'll know if you like it or not around 1.5 hours.\n\nUpdated review: ok, won the war as both Central and Entente.  Remember to check troop promotions and promote your own regularly.  It also helps replentish troops.  Really fun game.\n\nIf you're not sure which to get, this or Strategic Command, get both.","timestamp_created":1572710297,"timestamp_updated":1609772704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574284374713897705","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkMT75vYCe9vf1gE="}
