    about_the_game: The Dark Weaver is a customized droppod you're able to use in
      Awesomenauts. By purchasing the Dark Weaver directly from the Steam Store, you
      can bypass any other requirements that might be necessary for unlocking it with
      in-game currency.<br><br><i>The Dark Weaver started out as a secret project
      to create a time travelling pod, and was meant to weave the strings of time.
      In the end, it only managed to create loud, pulsing soundwaves instead of actually
      travelling through time. Nevertheless, the craft is now being used as a functional
      and fairly comfortable droppod, where passengers are able to listen to the latest
      hits as they resonate through the embryonic chamber that keeps them safe.</i>
