It's not a mission for mission remake, and that's nice, the graphics are excellent for a game with some years on.  I'm an aircraft arcade game nut and this sits happily in my collection and gets played often, I am not a big online multi person on games like this so I have not checked that out and likely won't.  Still a fun story and great game play.","timestamp_created":1592877774,"timestamp_updated":1592877774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy7667/ICeIvPjwI="}
