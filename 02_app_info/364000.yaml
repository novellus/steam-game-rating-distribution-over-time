      will be able to see the fruits of your labor and if your plans are profitable.<br><br>You
      can also spend time with co-workers and friends in the city. Having friends
      has a number of benefits, such as getting discounts on recipes, unlocking new

    review: 'This game is, quite frankly, impossible. It is unbalanced, and dull to
      boot.


      Even if you start off with the moneybags code, you will still lose more than
      you make. Ingredients cost an arm and a leg, and your parents take so much money
      from you after that that you may as well start selling your kidneys too.


      It really prevents you from enjoying the recipe creation at all, since you have
      to sweat over the cost of every single ingredient and usually have to default
      to the cheapest options possible. Which still isn''t enough to help you scrape
      up enough to keep your head above water.


      There''s a dating sim aspect to the game, but you have no time to enjoy it in
      the struggle to just survive.


      I like cooking in games. I like dating sims. But this game fails at both.'
