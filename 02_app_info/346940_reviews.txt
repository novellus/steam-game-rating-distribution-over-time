Yes I would recommend it. If you liked previous games, the fallout 1 and 2, as well as the Planescape torment series. Decent character stat options and combat function. Story and combat might be okay. I would call the character design a 8. Gameplay is a 9 as it is very noob friendly and combat is turn basebut , but maybe it can go rts for some more challenge? Story is about a 7 to me. It is over all about a 6.5 to me. Very enjoyable but a few things can get repetitive. the characters you can run into made it worth it to me. \n\n\n\nThe LONG PART\nIt is basically a distopian futuristic scifi fantasy....yes it has all of that. You have magic mixed with technology so some fun game combat options, from guns and swords, robot enhance body parts and personal death bots, to blowing magic balls of fire. D&D in the future? Your basically a shadowrunner, a merc of sorts. Story is alright, nothing too complicated, you got in a no win win situation that  has yuo running around trying to fix something that as just kinda thrust upon you and your team. Combat is same thing over and over, but there is a few sneak quests.","timestamp_created":1609996722,"timestamp_updated":1609996722,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9YvS7fYCeP2YwQI="}
