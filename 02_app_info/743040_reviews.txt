The music was good and there were some nice artistic scenes, it was visually interesting. Well-directed going from one scene to the next. It had a nice atmosphere throughout. However, the 360 video quality was not the best, even in the best quality available using the Steam 360 video player. Streaming quality will vary depending on download speeds and there's no option to download. The runtime is listed as 4 minutes, but it's less than that at 3:30. \n\nI only recommend this for 360 video enthusiasts. The 3D doesn't pop like in true VR, probably because of parallax. \n\nRate 6/10. Since you can get this free elsewhere, why can't we download it for the $2 we're spending on it to show our appreciation to QubaVr? I obviously don't mind paying, but at least give us options to truly appreciate your art project.\n\n","timestamp_created":1524198008,"timestamp_updated":1524198008,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555375874042510986","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1524343899,"developer_response":"Hey, thanks for the review.
