      one would think a simple puzzle game with 37 levels (7 got added after release)
      sold for 4 euros would have basic functionality, like undo (if not infinite,
      just the last step), separate volume sliders, properly working windowed mode
      and steam overlay, and a tutorial screen that doesn''t just flash for 2 seconds,
      even if the controls are not very complicated. well, in this case one would
      be terribly wrong.


      differently colored cubes paint the squares to their respective colors, but
      they can''t step on them again, unless another cube repaints them first. the
      goal is for all of them to reach the exit, basically by piggybacking on each
      other.  as a concept, it''s fine, the problem is with the execution and the
      occasional timing element, where cubes have to avoid getting shattered by tiny
      moving balls. they can also get impaled on sticks emerging from the ground,
      which are triggered by stepping on their switch, but instead of the switch not
      doing anything since a cube is standing on the stick, the cube gets destroyed,
      time to start over.


      controls aren''t ideal either, though your mileage may vary. I''d prefer them
      rotated by 90 degrees, but ideally both would be available to choose. all things
      considered, even at 75% off I regret my purchase after playing about a dozen
      levels.'
