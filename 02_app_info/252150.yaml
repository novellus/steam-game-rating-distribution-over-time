    review: "I had so much fun playing Grimm and all the down load content! Grimm\
      \ is crude & rude and not for little kids, so Momma's don't put your kids in\
      \ front of the CPU for some GRIMM Entertainment until you've screened it yourself\
      \ - he's bloody fearsome sometimes and just plain hilarious and nasty the rest\
      \ of the time!  This is a side reel type game and hand drawn, based on the GRIMM\
      \ Story Books but put into video game style.  The tasks aren't as easy as they\
      \ look. I used the mouse/keyboard.  If they allow a controller now that would\
      \ be easier. Sometimes it may seem abit repetitive at times but just wait a\
      \ tic and that will change!  Have a good time, I did for over 300 hours! \u2665\
      \ Mom"
