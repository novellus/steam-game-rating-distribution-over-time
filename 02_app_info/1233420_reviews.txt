If you are ok with the idea of a visual novel that is mainly about two rather tiresome characters squabbling against the backdrop of a train ride then maybe go ahead.  In the first half there is almost nothing about the landscape passing by or any other detail of the country, besides the brothers' in law and their inability to agree on anything.  The main character seems to be lost in a self-indulgent fog where they expect to 'get something' out of travelling while seeming to resent every minute of it.  The side adventure to Lake Baikal was interesting, but again, the brothers seem to be completely self-indulgent and quite rude to the locals.  The main character hitchhikes without paying his drivers, behaves as though the whole trip is an imposition, and basically makes it all about himself any chance he gets.   Aside from making flat out stupid and dangerous decisions purely for the sake of sulking, which is also irritating.\n\nIt isn't all bad. The story is well-written, the music is cool, and the parts that actually mention Russia and Siberia are cool.  The interface works well and the visuals are good.  But if you actually want to see and learn about Siberia, look elsewhere.","timestamp_created":1609643906,"timestamp_updated":1609643906,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529914498329162598","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvZqQ4/YCdN/4vwI="}
