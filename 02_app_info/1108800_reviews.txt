As the game is okay, nothing to write home about, but you can have some fun with it.\n\nI managed to play the game on a powerful PC capable of running the game smoothly. Don't try to play this game with an integrated graphics card. If you're not playing this on some sort of gaming rig, you're in for a bad time. Even with all the settings down low, it will not play right. If you can't get access to a machine with it's own graphics card, avoid it, you won't really be able to play it. The graphics seem to be intensive.\n\nNow For a review  with is fully playable at normal speed. it's okay, but not $20 okay. If I were to put a realistic price on it, I'd say it's a solid $10 game. The devs are improving the game, actively, with nearly daily updates. So if you're interested, keep your eye on it, maybe wait for a sale, and see what the updates are. \n\n[Controls]\n\nthe game when running correctly is very fast. the sense of speed is pretty good. Air dashing is a bit OP as you can pretty much circumvent most everything in this game by just dashing across the stage. wall jumping works okay, not great. in boss rooms, wall jumping can be unreliable at times. and trying to wall jump off bottom edge of a wall is kinda janky. you might just conclude that you cant do it, but it is possible. \n\nThe game does little to nothing to explain anything to you and hopes that you just know what you're doing. special weapons can be charged, and the ice weapon is your utility weapon. charging it up gives you a wall that you can climb up and jump off of, allowing you to skip even more of the level.\n\n[Camera]\n\nThe camera has been greatly improved since the game's first release. It's at a fairly comfortable distance now. Good Job Devs. Now if only the camera wouldn't let you see past the boundries at the start of the stage, or any other boundries. There are a couple spots that just have invisible walls.\n\n[Challenge]\n\nI spent most of the game dashing and spamming the basic buster. that gets your through most of the levels, with the occasional platforming. like 60% of the game is a zig zagging downward drop, where you go from left to right, with occasional enemies or obstacles. it makes the levels feel very samey. you generally run forward and shoot, or air dash from small platform surrounded by spikes to the next getting hit by whatever flying enemy is to close to respond to, or you're going down a zig zag drop. there are sometimes different parts that were kind of fun, but the rest was the same thing with no real difference, even the same enemies most of the time which you can mostly ignore.\n\nYou won't die in the stage unless you slip up and touch an insta-kill hazard. Enemies respawn almost the instant you turn your back, and health drops are plentiful, so you can farm health super easily.\n\nThe bosses have been improved since release. Most bosses will attack you in the corner, but I found that the fire boss can still be cheesed by staying in the bottom left corner, and the mosquito boss can be cheesed in the upper right corner.\n\nyou have special attacks, but all they ever did for me was make the game jankier. I used a rage attack against a boss and it not only did no damage to them, but I was stuck facing one direction until I took some damage.\n\n[Cutscenes]\n\nThere are three skippable cutscenes in the game. All boss dialogues and cinematics must be viewed over and over again. When you make a short replayable game akin to the mega man series, you make every single cutscene skippable. sometimes players don't care about the story, sometimes they die and have to re-enter the fight. Having to watch all the cutscenes over and over again every time you play is a major hassle and hurts replayability.\n\n Allow us to skip all cutscenes and boss dialogues. You can't even speed up the dialogue, nor slow it down, it goes at it's pace.\n\n[Graphics]\n\nThe art is okay, models are fine, Things are decently easy enough to distinguish from each other. The art in the dialogue boxes aren't too great though. it would be better to replace it with a 3D model, as your assistant looks pretty terrible in them, and those dialog boxes are opaque and take up half the screen while you're playing. These dialogue boxes should be transparent, and maybe optional with the use of the \"select\" button.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty sloppy. it feels like a beta product. There's some good stuff, and some boss fights are enjoyable. the stages are mostly boring though with like 2 interesting ones. it's getting better, but feels like I'm playing early access.\n\nThe game can use some improvement, but it has potential, and if the series were to continue, it might become a true successor to the Maverick Hunter X games.  I can't recommend this game for $20. That's a steep price for what the game is. There are many way better for that price, like Azure Striker Gunvolt 2. Gunvolt 1 is a much more solid game than this, and the asking price for that is $15.","timestamp_created":1606432205,"timestamp_updated":1608280213,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.607338964939117432","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44JC+uvYCf/+AswI="}
