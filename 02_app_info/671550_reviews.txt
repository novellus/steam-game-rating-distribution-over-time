It's a definite echo of that original classic, but with some twists that make it more exciting and even better. For one thing, ball and paddle effects now \"stack\" so you can collect an expansion, lasers, and a sticky paddle without losing the previous effects. On the downside you also get negative powerups which, if your paddle touches them, can shrink it, or even destroy it if you are unlucky. All in all very fun and definitely worth getting it any time a sale's on!","timestamp_created":1608871226,"timestamp_updated":1608871226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqdWMzPYCeJ/6vAI="}
