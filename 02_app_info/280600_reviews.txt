Highly recommend this for RPG fans and those who enjoy to explore a well-thought out and designed game .\n\nI do have to say that after playing more of the game I am disappointed with the fact that you have to go into the dungeon for EVERYTHING!!!  It just too much time spent fighting through monsters and I have spent well over 5 - 10 Hours trying to accomplish just the first two tasks from Minka and Lorac.  I am very frustrated with that and I have to recommend this game with that Caveat.  If you play it on hard difficulty, plan on spending a LOT of time dying and replaying levels and a lot of time in dungeons..hours.","timestamp_created":1530940627,"timestamp_updated":1609825878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/6/G6PYCdeG3pQE="}
