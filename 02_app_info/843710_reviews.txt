It starts with a basic tutorial that reinforces the basics of any puzzle game: Movement, Levers, Switches, Lasers, Blocks, etc. All of this is seamlessly integrated into different levels that reinforce each concept. \n\nAs you get accustom to the flow, it introduces its three main mechanics one by one: \n1. Time Clones: This is the core concept of the game and is well executed here. You are forced to imagine where your clones may go when doors open in a future that hasn't happened yet. \n2. Spatial Clones: You can think of this as the perceived twin effect (whatever happens to one twin happens to the other). You have 2 blocks and you control both at the same time. Using walls to your advantage, you arrange your blocks to solve most of these puzzles. \n3. Death: Death can sometimes be just fine. Upon death, the clone becomes gray and you can even drag your past lifeless block to its rightful resting place (usually a switch).  As long as one of your clones reaches the finish line, you beat the level. \n\nThe game gets really interesting once you have to combine these mechanics. When you time your clones just right, it feels quite gratifying. Imagine your original clone pulling a switch, letting your future clone through, waiting for your future clones to pull a switch, and then the original clone pushes against a door your future clone will open. These are the kinds of decisions you have to think about and they are delightful. A few times, I found myself overthinking solutions to a puzzle and then finding a much easier way to accomplish what I set out to do. This is exactly what I want from my puzzle games! \n\nPuzzle games are notoriously known for their lack of replay value. The one downside is it feels too short. I kept wanting more and more puzzles. I finished the game in about 2 hours. The average puzzles were solvable in at most 5 minutes. This is confusing because, later on in the game, you are introduced to a new mechanic: NPCs. This felt like it would be another section of the game that would incorporate the rest of the mechanics above. However, it turns out that is about where it ends. I was looking forward to adding that concept to my repertoire to solve more puzzles in more unique and interesting ways. \n\nPros:\nSimple, Calming\nInteresting, Challenging, and Unique Solutions\nYearning for More\n\nCons: \nShort\nCost","timestamp_created":1597595180,"timestamp_updated":1597595180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508101820945739746","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvvuF/PMCc/HtmwI="}
