The fishing 'tutor' you can meet just walks you down a few squares and says \"Fish here\"... but you're at the wrong square and can't control your character. Then when you fish, you aren't shown how it works.\n\n3/10, would not recommend unless you like figuring out how to play a poorly-designed game with no help.","timestamp_created":1587058820,"timestamp_updated":1587058820,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.630239427089691162","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuviEwvECeaqkgQI="}
