    review: 'Many speak of it, but rarely have human mouths ever tasted it: the pinnacle
      of culinary perfectionthe Super Dish. Few shinobi have ever been able to prepare
      a dish so exquisite, but legendary shinobi and sushi chef Hanzo thinks that
      perhaps his students and their rivals are up to the task. He holds a contest
      to see which of the girls can hone her Ninja Arts best for cooking as opposed
      to combat. The competition is fierce; the one who presents the old shinobi master
      with the Super Dish will obtain a Secret Ninja Art Scroll that will make real
      her most fervent desire. Whosoever can prove her knife to be as suitable for
      cooking as for combat will emerge the victor, while all her friends and rivals
      wind up as mere dessert...


      A rhythm spin-off of the ninja busty brawler series, SENRAN KAGURA, Bon Appetit!
      features cooking battles rather than shinobi showdowns, with emphasis on outrageous
      humor, delicious food, and gratuitous images of the series lovely ladies. This
      culinary warfare is carried out through an array of rhythm battles, where tapping
      the correct buttons in time with the beat will rack up combos and determine
      the size and quality of the resulting dish. The soundtrack consists of a variety
      of catchy tunes encompassing all genres from jazz to classical, with special
      Japanese vocal tracks sung by the leader of each faction. This Full Course edition
      includes all DLC and 22 buxom ninja between the two original PlayStation Vita
      releases, rewarding players who can overcome the challenge of creating the ultimate
      Super Dish with a special feast for the eyes as well.


      KEY FEATURES:


      * Rhythm spin-off of the popular SENRAN KAGURA series

      The infamous, voluptuous ninja series ventures into a new genre as all of the
      bouncy babes from SENRAN KAGURA Burst and SENRAN KAGURA SHINOVI VERSUS return,
      taking a break from physical combat to make culinary war instead in this tasty
      yet truly tasteless adventure.


      * The Dressing Room returns with even more stylish options

      Like other SENRAN KAGURA titles, the Dressing Room makes another appearance
      with multiple ways to customize characters outfitsbut be careful! Peep too much
      and you risk the wrath of a full-fledged shinobi


      * Three different modes of play plus online leaderboards

      Story Mode progresses through the main game, Free Mode allows for customized
      cooking showdowns, and Arcade Mode includes comprehensive online leaderboards
      to see how you stack up against your already pretty stacked competition.


      * Includes original Hanzo x Crimson Squad, additional Gessen x Hebijo pack,
      and all additional DLC

      Includes both games which were released separately on PlayStation(r)Vita, as
      well as all DLC in between, now in 1080p resolution and running at 60fps. Collapse
