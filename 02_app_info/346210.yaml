    review: 'I have played over 3,000 hours of this game; 1300 on steam alone. The
      characters are fun / funny. The levels are interesting and really require strategy.
      I would say that the weapons are well balanced, great selection and the enemies
      are well balanced and thought out as well.


      Only a couple things I wish for. First; another Garden Defense game. More levels
      and perhaps smaller graphics to allow for longer maps.


      Aside from these (wants) the game is great. I have played many times making
      up my own challenges. For example I can not finish all levels with a single
      weapon (THE CACTUS). This weapon shoots both ground and air targets but is not
      as strong as those intended for just ground or just air. With careful placement
      and upgrades (and it''s not easy) you can play levels using JUST this weapon.
