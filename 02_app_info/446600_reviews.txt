The story was mightily uninteresting to me, with a generic fantasy setting and the classic 'ohnoez, I swapped bodies' storyline. These days, I'm sure people consider body-swapping genders transphobic or something (which, I suppose you could see it that way, but if you do, maybe you need to find a more positive outlook on the world)\n\nAnyway, that's beside the point. The game isn't particularly interesting - I'm not really a fan of visual novels in general, so there needs to be an insanely good story or something more happening. This has neither, so I consulted a guide and skipped through the game for achievements. Anyway, if you like visual novels, you might like it, but it's pretty generic even then (from what little dialogue I admittedly read)","timestamp_created":1608673179,"timestamp_updated":1609534381,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vLPu3/YCcKWjvAI="}
