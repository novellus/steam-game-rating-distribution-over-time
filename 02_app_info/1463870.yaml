    review: 'The game was fun while it lasted, literally, i went from start to finish
      in just 51 minutes, and that includes one crash after playing for 15 minutes
      that made me go back to the first level. This game obviously draws some of its
      inspiration from The End Is Neigh.

      I won''t go as far as to give it a thumbs down, but the game is so short that
      even the 50% off sale is too expensive.'
