    review: if you're like me and enjoy a horror RPG like mad father or corpse party,
      this wont particularly fix that itch, but it does provide one with a healthy
      mindset of what to work with. granite, finding the DLC itself was a little hard
      to find, but i mostly blame that on myself for lack of game building and programming
      understanding. overall, its good for those who want to add a little spooky to
      the game, but not necessary.
