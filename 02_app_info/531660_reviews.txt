Asset flaws/missing, animal AI is still not improved yet and jumping can be tricky so getting stuck in terrain going places maybe you shouldn't is easy to do. Not much different from the original in that at the moment but I am assured those are being worked on. EA. 'Nuff said.\n\nI recommend trying it out. If you enjoyed the original you will really like the new one. It's definitely missing features from the original but not so much that you will miss them. They have said for a long time they were not happy with the way the original game started and I sort of see what they mean but I was never that unhappy with it. \nIf they redo the original as well as the beta then it's going to be awesome.\n\nHopefully more content will come out for it soon. I am a bit tired of the whole EA thing and how many unfinished games are still for sale after years and years in EA (My games library is full of them) but this is one I will still follow even after almost 4 years. (3yrs 11m 7d)\n\nSo it's a thumbs up for the beta version and also a thumbs up for the original even with it's flaws. I enjoy them both.\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1605575728,"timestamp_updated":1605575728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504160881042480469","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwuKvx6fUCcI3urgI="}
