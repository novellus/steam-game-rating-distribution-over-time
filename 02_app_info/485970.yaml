    review: "[h1]TR;DR Simple (but not too easy) programming game at a reasonable\
      \ price[/h1]\nThis is an interesting twist on programming games (The first video\
      \ on the store page is a good gameplay example). You start with a cube (representing\
      \ a hacking probe) that can move around a series of rooms like a maze (representing\
      \ some sort of cyberspace architecture that you are trying to hack). You need\
      \ to get the cube to move various locations in the maze (representing data file\
      \ locations) to complete each level. However all movement is pre-programmed,\
      \ and you have a limited way to get the cube to do what you want.\n\nYou write\
      \ programs by putting \"nodes\" of one of five commands together (move Left,\
      \ Right, Up, Down, and wait), and setting up different colored tiles within\
      \ the maze. These colored tiles are branch points for your program, and how\
      \ you get the cubes to change direction. For example, \"move left until land\
      \ on blue tile, then move down\".\n\nThere are about 45 levels and the difficulty\
      \ varies. It takes anywhere from a few minutes to solve most levels to a handful\
      \ that I've had to put aside for a few days cause I just wasn't seeing how to\
      \ solve it. Since you're not limited by the length of programs, you can \"brute-force\"\
      \ levels by having lots of nodes and colored tiles (but where's the fun in that?)\n\
      \nI should mention that the layout of chapter 2 level 6 is a bad idea by the\
      \ design team IMHO. There are slight changes that they could have made to keep\
      \ the challenge of the level without having the layout looking exactly like\
      \ a \"good luck cross\" (google \"fylfot\" or play the game if you don't know\
      \ what I'm talking about). I understand the various historical and non-offensive\
      \ usages of this particular symbol (various religions, Finnish Air Force, etc)\
      \ but I still think there there are enough people that might be offended that\
      \ the designers will lose potential sales by having this level in the game.\
      \ Again, there is no reason to have something controversial in such a good game.\n\
      \nWhen you solve a level, you get between 1 and 3 \"multipasses\" depending\
      \ on how well written your code is. So one challenge after you solve a level\
      \ is to optimize your solution. Also the January update added a global stats\
      \ board that tells you how well you did compared with everyone else.\n\nThere\
      \ is a level editor and community mazes (I have yet to try these), so you're\
      \ not going to run out of challenges. As far as I can tell, this game does not\
      \ do Steam Sync, which is annoying (but alright for the relatively cheap price).\
      \ \n\nThe graphics are somewhat flashy for a programming game, but still very\
      \ functional. There's something very pleasing about sitting back and seeing\
      \ your cube move through the maze. I'd recommend turning off the bloom effects\
      \ and the TV-screen effect. Each chapter of the game starts with a brief graphic-novel\
      \ narration setting up the backstory (another interesting bonus).\n\nOverall\
      \ this game is an 8/10 (10/10 if the designers change Chapter 2, level 6). Ten\
      \ bucks is maybe pushing the price to value ratio, but if you find it at even\
      \ a slight discount then I'd definitely get it. 45 levels multiplied by about\
      \ 5 minutes per level, plus community levels and you can figure out how much\
      \ game value you are getting."
