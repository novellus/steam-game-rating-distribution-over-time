Though the screen is dark through much of the game, the soundtrack and writing kept me going.  Add some more visuals and the game would have been on my list of top stories until I reached the end.  The ending was awful.  I don't know what the devs were thinking having this as an ending.  There were so many directions they could have taken that would have been great.","timestamp_created":1597978186,"timestamp_updated":1597978186,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1598007695,"developer_response":"Hi there! Thank you for leaving a review, but I'm sorry to hear you were disappointed. I have just opened a discussion about the ending and would be very interested to hear more of your thoughts on it if you'd like to share them :)"}],"cursor":"AoJwkYK7h/QCcJXgnAI="}
