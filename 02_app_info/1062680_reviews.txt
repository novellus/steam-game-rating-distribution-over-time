If the guards catch you using one, its 1 week solitary for being a console using peasant. So I had to get initiated into the PCMasterRacists in Cell block C, in order to beat this game using keyboard and touchpad controls. It was easily the hardest thing I've ever done. Upon reaching the final area using touchpad and \"wasd\" controls I was immediately granted parole.\n\nThis game changed my life 10/10.\nI can't wait to get arrested again so I can play the sequel.","timestamp_created":1564174215,"timestamp_updated":1564174215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49YyDmOwCdviWzwE="}
