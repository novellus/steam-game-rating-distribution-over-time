The gameplay itself is decent enough for a simple cheap game like this, and I took the liberty of the Steam Summer Sale to buy it very cheap. It is still hardly worth it. The content however is far less than advertized.\n\nThere are two zones, both very small and simple.\n\nThere are a total of three weapons, at least for the warrior class, not counting bare fists.\n\nThere are two, three if you count the boss, types of enemies: Zombies and spitter zombies. The boss is just a slightly tougher regular zombie.\n\nThe quests come in two varieties: Gather potions and kill zombies. They are infiitely repeatable from the same questgivers. When you gather the potions, you give them to the questgiver.\n\nThe potions and the gold is hardly worth bothering with though, as 60g is enough to buy the best gear: one sword and a helmet, and the quests give you so much exp, that it is easy to kill the enemies by simply leveling up and dumping all your points into str.\n\nNone of the other abilities do anything. Using skills is hardly necessary.\n\nDespite all this, I liked the grinding. It was fun in a sort of brain-dead repetitive way. The controls were a bit wonky, but ultimately not an issue. I was seriously disappointed when the game ended abruptly as I entered the second stage and realized that I couldn't continue any further, because the game just isn't there. I was awaiting more challenging types of zombies, and maybe some lame plot hidden in the backgrounds I play through, such as saving a village or something, but there was nothing. Just a pile of rubble after the boss, sparking some confusion and frustration, as the game didn't even say it was over.","timestamp_created":1609169794,"timestamp_updated":1609169794,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.337837874889373779","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvc7/1PYCda2RvgI="}
