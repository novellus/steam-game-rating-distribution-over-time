It picks up right after where the bonus chapter of the previous game ended.\n\nAs is usual for games in this genre, and especially this series, the artwork shines through with lovely, detailed backgrounds and colorful characters. The music is soft and relaxing and compliments the pace of the game. The puzzles aren't very difficult, though there are some that elicit a little bit of thought.\n\nI had to restart in the last half of the game, however. This was caused in chapter 4 in the galley cabinet by clicking while the hidden object puzzle was going through its ending animations. The click exited from the zoomed-in screen, and I was unable to get back into the puzzle again to pick up some crucial items. It's possible that there was a specific area that needed to be clicked as some of the interaction points in other areas were not exactly on the item, but all of the clicking that was done did not bring me back into the area where the items were located. Thankfully, it didn't take long to get back to the troublesome area.\n\nRecommended overall, but with the caveat to look out for that troublesome area.","timestamp_created":1607743012,"timestamp_updated":1607743012,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyu+8qvYCdtepuQI="}
