Nevermind these lamers in the other reviews. It's a DOSBox game, which means it's perfectly compatible with Windows 10, and even Linux if you want (you'll need to use a native DOSBox app, not Wine).\n\nIf you happen to have some issue, install a DOSBox separately, maybe try changing some of the few options in it. Or maybe check the forums. Get used to these things if you're into old games.\n\nI'm very glad they've included the PS1 version too.","timestamp_created":1586270821,"timestamp_updated":1586271422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542997956275939941","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw46DJqvECdYv2/gE="}
