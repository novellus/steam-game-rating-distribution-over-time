    short_description: Earth is under attack and the &quot;Nazdu&quot; are devouring
      everyone they can get their hands on. Mike isn't the hero anyone asked for,
      but he's the one you got. He's hiding in a hole, in his basement, and wants
      to see this through and survive, so he can go get some fried chicken.

    review: "When I looked at the trailer it reminded me of  our old \"video\" games\
      \ we played as children. I thought about looking for that console to play those\
      \ games again but decided to just buy this game. Old school mindless fun right.\
      \ WRONG. It's addictive but you can't say why and it's not as easy as it looks.\
      \ I want all my friends to buy it so that I can challenge them to do better\
      \ than me. \n :)  I find it funny that I kept thinking \"flippen run Mike\"\
      \ while playing the game."
