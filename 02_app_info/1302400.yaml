    review: "I like the stylised graphics of this game; the graphics are clean and\
      \ the colours bright and vibrant. It has a nice feel to it. Also being low res,\
      \ helps keep the frame rate at a decent level for smooth gameplay. \nThe game\
      \ play reminds me of an old, Commandos (yes, I have been playing games for decades)\
      \ but it still looks fresh today. I like that you can play different ways to\
      \ suit your style or mood, all stealthy and quite or fast and furious taken\
      \ out all you see in front of you. \nThe game is well balanced but it\u2019\
      s not as easy as it looks, and there is also the timer to keep the pressure\
      \ on. When you complete it there is a definite sense of achievement, however\
      \ you\u2019ll want to go again to get a better time or try to complete it a\
      \ different way. There are a good variety of mobs with various difficulties\
      \ to keep you on your toes.\nAlthough it\u2019s only an early access game it\
      \ plays well, and it feels like it\u2019s longer than the four levels. I hope\
      \ more people get to play it to encourage more development moving forward and\
      \ I think to enhance the stealth style play it would be great to have a non-lethal\
      \ take down."
