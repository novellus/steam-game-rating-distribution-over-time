      \ the enemy, who are also capable of the same. Combat in this game relies heavily\
      \ on player's fast reaction and strategy. Also worth noting, most of the combat\

      \ may feel that the enemy is hiding behind him. Sometimes he can't distinguish\
      \ between the good guys and the bad guys, and sometimes he is involved in plots\
      \ and lies. Sometimes, he is touched by some sincere hearts. The protagonist\
      \ is not a hero to save the world, but he dare to do what he thinks is right,\
      \ not for fame and gain, nor for justice, nor for love, but for the beauty he\
      \ has been searching for."

      notes: Witch Sword features fantasy blood and light violence. The hit effect
        looks like a magic flare, not real blood.
