I found out about Interpol through Rocksmith and realized it's like the rebirth of Joy Division, only with even more fun bass lines. The one from Evil was so catchy that I had to play it again on the next day, right after 6 hours of sleep, and then it was still stuck in my head all day. Highly recommended to people obsessed with Joy Division and prominent, very rhythmic bass lines.","timestamp_created":1543005759,"timestamp_updated":1543007136,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.66944587230682373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkI2ZoecCcNaAsgE="}
