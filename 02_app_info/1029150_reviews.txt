Uh... I feel like this one is misunderstood. And I say that based on the other few reviews I'm seeing so far on steam. First, I will guess that people who reviewed didn't like (or don't like anymore now that they're adults) so much power rangers or super sentai series. That's not my case. I still enjoy them from time to time and just to be clear... this whole title is one BIG reference to those series that includes a LOT of fans-services. \n\nSo of course the writing is childish, of course it is cliche and of course it goes a little everywhere in order to make enough references (teenagers with attitude and stuff) to the whole genre. So yes in this way it DOES indeed fulfill its job admirably.\n\nThe thing I will criticize is the pacing. It kinds of slow down every chapter due to the episodic format and it does break the immersion a bit. Some passage do fill a litlle rushed or blank but the vast majority of the work is a proof of love to the super sentai hero genre.\n\nIf you're searching something logic or mature here you're just missing the whole point (the whole point being you're a chosen one even though that part is actually explained \"scientifically\" lol) ! But then, the story HAS its own amount of plot twists and progressively become more mature and dark near the end.\n\nI had a blast with it even though there are some flaws obviously. But please just don't go and misjudge the thing just because you didn't understood it was based on a very specific genre. The description of the work does not hide it and nothing justify criticizing the genre here.","timestamp_created":1559142395,"timestamp_updated":1587439300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.590766012668609619","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2q2wzfECfpukwgE="}
