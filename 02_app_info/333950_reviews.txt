You will be lucky to get 1 hour of good play out of this waste of dollars.\n\nSadly, I did not try it when I bought it due to business in life, so I am stuck with a useless title in my inventory, one that I can never get a refund for.  They even cut the price in half AFTER I wasted $20 on it.  No, I would not pay $2 for it!\n\nI tried contacting the developers but got NO RESPONSE in 6 months.  \n\nRecently, I learned, that I never will get a response bc the developers JUST QUIT.\n\nThey collect money from people who do not read feedback.  Sadly, I failed to research the game fully before I bought it.\n\nDo NOT DO WHAT I DID.\nDO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS BROKEN GAME!","timestamp_created":1610098627,"timestamp_updated":1610098981,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iJfY8PYCdNS/wQI="}
