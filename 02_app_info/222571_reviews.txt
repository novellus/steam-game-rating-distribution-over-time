It is one of the, if not the best diesel on the train simulator market. It has so many awesome features including a realistiic cold start procedure. There are even working engine fans and heaters to control the temperature of the engine, and you can overheat it, so be careful! It has a prototypical horn (Nathan P3) for SP. \n\nPROS:\n-Amazing sounds, awesome horn and bell, nothing recycled\n-Full start up procedure\n-So many working switches in the cab\n-Bell has air sounds turning on and off like a real one does\n-Incredible amount of detail on the outside\n-Other touches like the opening cabinet which even sways as the loco drives when you leave it open!\n-If you set the weather to foggy and leave the loco sitting for a while, the windows get blurry with fog!\n-Working marker lights \n\nCONS:\n-No working windows or doors\n-No conductorâ€™s side view\n\nI give it 9/10. Overall this is one incredible loco. \n","timestamp_created":1529633576,"timestamp_updated":1529633576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxILRkuQCee3aowE="}
