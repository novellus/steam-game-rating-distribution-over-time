    about_the_game: '<i>&quot;There are submarines, and then there are targets...&quot;</i><br><br>They
      are out there, in the vast expanse of the sea. You don''t see them, and you''re
      not supposed to; they reveal themselves only reluctantly, when in port or transiting
      a shallow passage. They''ve grown from an unsuccessful, almost laughable nuisance,
      to a practical weapon in fleet battles, to the scourge of seaborne transport
      lines, and ultimately to mobile undersea fortresses that can end life on the
      planet in less than 10 minutes. A junior branch compared to their centuries-old
      naval surface warfare counterparts, submarines have nevertheless seen and done
      it all, both in peacetime and wartime. And it takes a special kind of people
      to handle and operate them - for one, claustrophobics and fragile nerves need
      not apply. These people often share more in common with their direct adversaries
      from foreign, even hostile nations than with their comrades in the other services.
      Like their boats, they are discreet, persistent and deadly. They are submariners.

      missiles, silencing measures and advanced sonars, computers and torpedoes have

      most highly decorated vessel in the US Navy. Sturgeon-, Los Angeles- and Seawolf-class,
      frontline of the US sub force from the 1960s to the late-00s. Soviet/Russian
      conventional and nuclear-powered attack subs, worthy adversaries of NATO during

      attacks against defended land targets. Creep up to surface vessels close enough
      that you can take underwater hull and screw photos - and remain undetected.

      communications cables in the worst moment of the Cold War. Covertly deliver
      special-operations teams ashore, or deploy swimmer delivery vehicles (SDVs)
      against capital ships to eliminate them out of the blue. And of course hunt
      down anything on the sea surface or underneath it, from miniscule patrol boats
