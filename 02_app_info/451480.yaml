    review: "I enjoy the Bleach franchise. \n\nThis movie was garbage. \nIt's not\
      \ even worth explaining why - it seems like it was thrown together in an afternoon.\
      \ \nIt's trying to appeal to nostalgia  but not trying very hard. Some old music\
      \ and cliche tag lines are thrown in there to mask the criminally lazy production.\
      \ \nA peice of junk made  to steal from the suckers like me who are bored on\
      \ a sunday.\nMy advice, don't buy this even if you are bored. It's worst than\
      \ the worst filler. It will make you feel dumb for the purchase.\n"
