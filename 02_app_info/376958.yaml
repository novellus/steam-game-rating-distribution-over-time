    about_the_game: "General Electric established itself as an independent builder\
      \ of mainline diesel locomotives in 1959 with its 2,500-horsepower U25B, and\
      \ throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, GE produced an ever-expanding \u2013\
      \ and more powerful \u2013 line of \u201CUniversal\u201D-series diesels, which\
      \ came to be widely nicknamed as \u201CU-boats.\u201D<br><br>From the debut\
      \ of the U25B until GE introduced its \u201CDash 7\u201D series in the late\
      \ 1970s, approximately 3,500 U-Boats of various designations were constructed,\
      \ and the best seller of GE\u2019s U-boat line was the 3,000-horsepower, six-axle\
      \ (C-C) U30C. First delivered in 1967 and produced through 1976, 600 U30Cs were\
      \ constructed by GE for 22 original buyers.<br><br>Almost universally, the husky\
      \ U30C was put to work hauling heavy tonnage and, often as not, coal. In 1967-68,\
      \ the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio purchased 13 U30Cs which saw use throughout the\
      \ railroad\u2019s system. With the introduction of the \u201CChessie System\u201D\

    review: "Got this in the 2020 Christmas sale.  Nice looking, lots of \"advanced\"\
      \ features to click and switch, some truly nice sounds, but ultimately ruined\
      \ because in 64-bit mode (which I thought just about everyone had switched to)\
      \ you can't move the power handle at all; not by keyboard, not by mouse.  It\
      \ does work fine in 32-bit mode, but then you're back to all the hassle that\
      \ comes with running in what is, effectively, restricted mode.\n\nIt also seems\
      \ that Virtual Rail Creations have disappeared along the way, which is sad because\
      \ they have the basis for a very good product here and I was hoping to get my\
      \ hands on a BN liveried example to run over the backdated Marias Pass route,\
      \ but no, denied...\n\nWill recommend for now as I'm optimistic it'll get fixed,\
      \ but this is pending a response from DTG whose record for revisiting and fixing\
      \ stuff is... questionable.\n\nEdit: I saw Kooth Odok's remarks on how to fix\
      \ the 64-bit mode and can confirm this does work, however, it's a bit much that\
      \ DTG havent't fixed it themselves.  Oh, and the dynamic brakes don't work (yes,\
      \ I moved the selector \U0001F644)."
