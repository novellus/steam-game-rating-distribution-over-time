Not easy to fly (set full realism) and takes getting familiar with the aircraft. nice variety of liveries and after my first 1 hour long flight i had no issues like some have described. It is possible for there to be issues with the visuals loading improperly, but this can happen with any HD model and is easily remedied by simply restarting FSX if it happens. Its always a good idea to restart FSX after any flight and before starting a new flight to avoid such issues.  Totally worth having.","timestamp_created":1574822366,"timestamp_updated":1575075211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ474zz3O4Cff+23QE="}
