The setting is set on a stage and it's really surprising the first time when you see the buildings and environment being built right in front of your very own eyes. You as the player have some control over the three main characters of the play. I say some because I felt as though some of the selections that were given felt forced on me. \n\nAnyways, there are choices you can make (in a form of news reports that you can send to your editor/boss), that will determine how other non-playable actors will react to you.  Now, since there’s only one act, I am not sure how much of an impact my decisions will have on future acts so that is to be determined. I will update as more acts are added.\n\nThe characters are quirky, albeit strange at times but they all have unique personalities that set them apart from each other. I mean it’s not every day someone asks you to feed a raw chicken wearing a diaper to an alligator. (However, if this is an everyday occurrence to you, please call me.) Some of the dialogues are funny and the story is engaging. I believe it took me about 3.5 hours to complete the first act so it’s not too long. \n\nI would recommend this game, especially since the price dropped to $9.99. The developers are pretty responsive to their players. \n\nI’m not much for scoring but I suppose I would rate the first act a 7/10.\n\nFor your viewing pleasure, I uploaded my playthrough of this game on YouTube. \n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI0KAbZpUbEGliZlaTbNcUoY2x6tY0F2s] Knee Deep Playlist [/url]","timestamp_created":1437168764,"timestamp_updated":1608229731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":36,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.758637905120849609","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4q8f9uPYCes2cQQ=="}
