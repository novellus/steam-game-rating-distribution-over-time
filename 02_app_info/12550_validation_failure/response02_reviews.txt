Well thanks to the amazing people at THQ (which shut down shortly after making this abomination) we finally can know where we stand in the ultimate hierarchy. Running on the top-notch \"playground engine\" with some of the most amazing next gen graphics I've seen in decades, this game is hands-down a classic that will stand the test of time. Now besides the graphics, let's discuss the story becuase I consider the story to be the most amazing part. You play as a nameless man who has just survived a plane crash that landed him on an abandoned island. After searching for help, your character is graphically raped and then beaten to near death by the satanic girl \"Amanda\" (also, Amanda FUCKING SUCKS at geography). Afterwards you are held captive and tied up in a fake studio forced to play the game of these childrens malicious leader \"Jeff Foxworthy\". Everytime you win you get 1 million dollars in monopoly money and should you manage to amass 10 billion dollars in 100 hours, you'll be spared and allowed to leave the island (after the rapes of course). It's a truly dark story line for its time and one that has given me nightmares for months now. There are over TWO multiple endings including: Winning, Losing, Dropping out with \"X\" amount of monopoly cash, and losing but walking \"home\" to your torture cage with 25,000 dollars in monopoly money. With so many endings, a deep and dark story line, and some of the best graphics I've ever seen, this game hands down deserves an 11/10 and is a game that will continue to haunt the dreams of grown men for years to come.","timestamp_created":1403836410,"timestamp_updated":1445839019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.633506715297698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v5Ou0dACcOe0KQ=="}
