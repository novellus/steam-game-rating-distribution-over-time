It is free, just try it and you won't be disapoited, period.\n\nTotally enjoyable for free, it is still possible to pay for a premium account to gain access to new vehicles faster or buy premium vehicles, that are only vehicles with all upgrades installed, they are equivalent to non-premium vehicles once you unlocked the upgrades for them.\nIt make the game well balanced for everybody and only afect the amount of hours to spend for progressing.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1507084681,"timestamp_updated":1533736421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.630695879459381104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46JD0jOUCdoajhwE="}
