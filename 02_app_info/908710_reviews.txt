Good to show off VR to newcomers, but won't hold your interest for long. I found the learning curve quite easy, but it's a pretty hard game to master. Waves are full of enemies if you don't hit them in one or two shots you will get overwhelmed quickly. That said, pick it up for one or two euros as it does not feel like it's worth more than that in the current state.","timestamp_created":1578430659,"timestamp_updated":1578430659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4m4/zwO8CcPfI6gE="}
