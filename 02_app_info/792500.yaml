    review: "I finished the entire game in 20 minutes. The gameplay was very clunky\
      \ and unsatisfying. The graphics are good and it looks promising, but still\
      \ needs a lot of work. A pre-alpha demo you can buy on Steam, seemingly abandoned\
      \ by the developers (released in 2018). \n\nThere are much better Streets of\
      \ Rage inspired beat \xB4em ups worth playing in my opinion. \nDisappointed,\
      \ I can only recommend against buying Streets Ablaze in its current state. \n\
      \nIf however they were to significantly improve it in future, I do see potential\
      \ for a good game. At the time of this writing the gameplay is unfortunately\
      \ just too awkward and unpolished to call it that."
