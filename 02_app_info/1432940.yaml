    review: It would've been better off free instead of paying the full game to get
      it. The missions are just stupidly hard and repetitive as is. I don't understand
      why you'd have to pay for an upgrade pack to play the full game, but its a no
      for me. I mean I did enjoy the first 3 levels in the demo, but the full game
      is just no, just no.
