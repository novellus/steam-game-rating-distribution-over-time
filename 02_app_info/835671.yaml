      /><br><br>Lokhir Fellheart, the Krakenlord of Karond Kar, is loosed upon the
      world! The latest and most notorious of his line, he plies the coastlines and
      seaways of the world, plundering ports and settlements for their riches and
      enslaving their inhabitants.<br><br>The Dark Elf sea-scourge leads his own faction,
      The Blessed Dread, will be playable in Mortal Empires and Eye of the Vortex
      campaigns (in which he follows the Vortex storyline). He begins play with ownership
      of the island of Chupayotl, just south of the Star Tower in Lustria.<br><br>The
      Krakenlord does not need to perform Rites in order to raise Black Arks. He can
      recruit one for each major port settlement he captures, ultimately amassing
      a fleet of them with which to terrorise the Lustrian coastline and beyond. In
      addition, he gains a 50% income boost from Slave Pens and Slave Markets, and
      his armies enjoy a 50% upkeep cost-reduction for any Black Ark Corsairs they
      recruit. <br><br>In place of the usual Dark Elf Black Ark rite, he can perform
      a sacrifice to Anath Raema, granting Black Ark Corsairs the Cause Fear and Stalk
      traits plus bonus AP missile damage, and conferring bonus armour for Kharibdysses.
