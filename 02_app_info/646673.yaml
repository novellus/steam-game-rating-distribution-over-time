    review: 'Great Tables. They tend to drop below 50% fairly often too, so definitely
      worth picking up. Let me break down each table individually to see whats in
      store.


      Secrets of the Deep:

      Themed around a deep sea expedition. Great table. Feels almost like two tables
      in one, as your ball tends to spend the same amount of time in each playfield.
      It''s quite a slow paced table with some satisfying shots. My only gripe is
      that it can feel like it takes a while before the interesting stuff kicks in.
      Multiball is frequent and frantic. Which is nice. Definitely a long session
      table, be sure that you have at least 30 mins free before you start playing.


      Rome:

      Themed around a Roman batallion conquering/defending Rome. This table gets a
      lot of hate and tends to be overlooked, which I think is unfair. Yes, it''s
      low scoring, but the gameplay is there. It''s a long, thin table with lots of
      shots that has you scoring through chaining combos. Some are particularly difficult
      off the upper left flipper, which makes it all the more satisfying. Multiball
      is fun. The individual modes can be a bit hit and miss, as it''s mostly the
      usual things like "hit these shots, don''t make too many mistakes, or shooting
      every ramp on the playfield." Probably the most difficult table in the pack.


      Biolab:

      In this table you create cute little critters, which eventually want to escape
      from the lab. Pretty fun. Wizard mode seems a little anti-climactic given everything
      that builds to actually triggering it. Some of the modes are particularly frustrating
      (the one where you have to get a 3 consecutive skill shots being the most infuriating,
      pro tip, you can nudge the table to your hearts content in this mode after plunging
      the ball, so that makes it a bit easier). Music is fun, theme is interesting,
      shots are satisfying, but the playfield seems a little busy which makes seeing
      certain shots a bit difficult. Probably the weakest table in this pack, but
      definitely one I''ve still had a lot of fun with.


      Pasha:

      Arabian Nights style table. This table is my favourite one here. Reaching the
      wizard mode is simple, and requires you to use all the gadgets on the table.
      These include a magnetic funnell where you have to keep the ball circling for
      a certain amount of time, a tilt table where you have to pass the ball over
      the lit circles and a hidden mini-playfield under the genies lamp, where you
      have to defeat "guards". Multiball is exciting, it''s just a shame that when
      you lock all the balls again at the end, the multiball ends. I must say the
      level of craftmanship put into the art on the playfield is quite simply astonishing
      here. It just looks so good. The music is unique as well, kind of like a middle
      eastern techno tune.


      All in all, if you like pinball and you want some tables to keep you occupied,
      I''d say this is even worth the full price. People seem more interested in the
      Williams Tables, and rightly so as they''re extremely good. However, you should
      never ever scoff at any of Zen''s original works. They clearly have a love for
      pinball and are very talented at making their own unlicensed tables. I thoroughly
      recommend.'
