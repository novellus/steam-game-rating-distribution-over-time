I don't really understand why this got mostly negative responses. It's a pretty good VN. I never liked voice acting in VNs so I always turn the voices off so I can't comment on that, but the art is nice, love the soundtrack and the story makes me want to play the full version, however I'm still contemplating whether to get it or not. It's unique, a bit confusing but easy to understand and I'm sure it progresses in the full version of course. Cyrus looks like a chick, I really thought he was a girl at first, but hey nothing wrong with a feminine looking guy!","timestamp_created":1485781278,"timestamp_updated":1485781278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0+Pd99kCcNXtcA=="}
