Unfortunately, locomotion is via teleportation and you can't even choose the direction you're facing. So you will have to play at the very least standing up so you can look all around 360. \n\nThe first maze is the only one that I would call easy. The rest just get harder as you progress. I'm currently stuck on the 5th maze which is quite a doozy. The graphics are just okay, at least they are going for realism. The looping sounds can get annoying. The mazes, however, are well-crafted and will challenge your eyesight (when you have an overhead view) and your sense of direction.\n\nRate 6/10. I think the game is a good deal at the current price of $1.63 USD in the Steam Fall Sale.","timestamp_created":1543031654,"timestamp_updated":1543031654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572649598121643066","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw59D2oecCcpWWsgE="}
