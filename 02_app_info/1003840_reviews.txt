That's why I recommend this \"game\". I don't think this thing can be called a \"point-and-click puzzle game\". Because the goal flags are too straightforward and easy to get. You won't get what you'd expect from a ШП. Nevertheless, this pseudo-website has some contents. So buy this if you need a detailed guide on how to build a ШП-like game, the list of ШП releases, or a bunch of crude 100% Russian comics.","timestamp_created":1606595073,"timestamp_updated":1606595073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vuqhiPYCfPjdtAI="}
