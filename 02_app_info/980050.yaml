    review: "Playtime: 5625 Hours\n\nI only upvote with a precautionary.\n\nLike all\
      \ the other DLC and microtransactions for this game, you're only buying a little\
      \ time.\nI also feel the pricing is too high for what your getting.\n\nWith\
      \ that said, the taskmasters can provide some convenience in the form of 1 extra\
      \ utility auto clicker.  There are free scripts such as NIAutoclicker that do\
      \ much the same thing.\nThe extra consumables are not worth paying for since\
      \ you get them frequently in-game.\nYou can get 2 of 3 in-game taskmasters fairly\
      \ easily by saving Rubies in the game and just playing over time.\n\nThe taskmasters\
      \ will mostly appeal to idle players.\nAqua The Dragon is currently priced at\
      \ $10 and for \"Limited Time\" until November 21st, the net proceeds to go to\
      \ the Extra Life charity drive to support Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.\n\
      \n\nIf your goal is to:\n- Support the Devs and the CMNH charity, then I vote\
      \ YES. \n- If your goal is to get Phat Loot or make significant progress, then\
      \ I vote NO."
