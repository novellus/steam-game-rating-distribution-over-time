    review: Best game I have ever played. I wish the people would move/interrupt the
      speech. The clones are kinda anoying, but that one dude in the front row is
      a tough NPC, he makes me angry even thinking about him. Love this game, way
      to play is to have player two upload a random PDF from the internet, and player
      one gives the speech. 10/10 would present again
