Next to impossible to pick up anything. If you find that you finally do, it's clunky.  Fix the controls and I I'll try again.\n\nReview Update - 22-2-2019:\n\nSo I gave this game another try after the developer posted an update.  \n\nPROS:  \n\n1) The update definitely improved game play for the Oculus Rift.  The game seems far more stable now.\n2) I found picking up items FAR easier to do.  \n3) Interacting with the world was really nice.  More interaction with the world would be nice.\n\nCONS:\n\n1) I'm still not sure why it's called \"Bully Store\".  It doesn't quite translate.  It's just a cooking sim.  Should rename it to something more appropriate.  The name just doesn't fit, in my opinion.  It's actually a bit misleading.\n2) Not a lot of interaction with the world & not a lot of food combinations.  Which, in turn, makes the game fun for about 20 minutes and it's over.\n\nWishes:\n\n1) More interaction with the world with more food ingredient combos.\n2) Add the ability for a 2nd player to help.\n\nI have to say that I am quite happy with the update.  Well done.  Keep up w/ the updates.","timestamp_created":1528349400,"timestamp_updated":1550878089,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1541572778,"developer_response":"Hello, this is BullyStore development team !!\n\nThank you for leaving us a valuable discussion in BullyStore !!\n\nOur development team has completed the work to 'Oculus Lift'\n\nWe have also completed the \"Bully Store\" update.\n\nThe following is the update content.\n\n- Difficulty Balance\nCustomers wait time\n[Easy 120 seconds, Normal 90 seconds, Hard 60 seconds]\n- Balance additional score according to difficulty.\n- Balance bad customer spawn time according to difficulty.\n- Fixed hotdog rotation\n- While playing game, if you turn back you can reference the recipe.\n- Vibration of controller in interaction\n- After finishing the game, it's easier to check your score more easily.\n- Change the difficulty level to increase sequentially.\n- Order UI of character\n\nAlso added a setting useful for game play.\n\n[Setting]\n- BGM : Can control BGM sound.\n- Height Setting : Can set height to play comfortably.\n- Use Current Location : Set position according to current location.
