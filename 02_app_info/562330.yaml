    about_the_game: 'Lemmings meets Lost Vikings. Dwarflings is a hardcore classic
      which will be a challenge for the brain and fingers. In the game, you will take
      control of up to five characters, each one with a unique ability. The control
      is indirect: while dwarves are moving in real time, you control their speed
      and manage their abilities to help as many as possible to escape. On your road
      to freedom, you will meet not only hordes of enemies, but also some friendly
      and helpful characters.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/562330/extras/dwarflings_store1_2.png?t=1572997888"
      /><br><br>The game is dedicated to the adventures of resilient dwarflings in
      miner''s helmets, mashing clay in the grim corridors of the gold mine which
      never saw the light of the sun. The hardworking dwarves are not sitting idle.
      One dwarf is climbing the mountain and risking breaking into the abyss. Another
      has dug a pit. A third has fallen into it and cannot get out. Someone has even
      dropped a stone on a huge cave troll''s toe! You are the one who has to watch
      over all this mess. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/562330/extras/dwarflings_store2.png?t=1572997888"
      /><br><br>Mind boggling puzzles and indirect control over up to five unique
      beardies will make you suffer, cry, break your keyboard and call Mommy  until
      and unless you finish the final level in order to stop this nightmare. Escaping
      an orc prison is not easy, especially if your most threatening weapon is a shovel...'
