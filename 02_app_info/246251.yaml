    review: 'Just like the Mountain Course DLC, this is another DLC that adds an extra
      course. The "twist" in this course is that there''s a lot more ghosts than in
      any other course, and not just in those long chains that usually show up after
      a power pellet; in a sense, you''ll have to really think which path to take
      during super mode so as not to waste your time, while also making sure to get
      extra pellets.


      A pretty interesting course, but again, I''d recommend buying the whole bundle
      on sale.'
