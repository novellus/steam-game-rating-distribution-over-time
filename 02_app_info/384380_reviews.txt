I would love to know how this story ends! I can only recommend if you go into this knowing that you will never get the full story, but given the price point of both parts, you should definitely experience what this game has to offer. It is a great game and it's such a same that the developers couldn't finish, as you can tell this was a labour of love. Great game play, great look to the game and most importantly, GREAT voice acting (from Geralt of Rivira), but it's incomplete and will never be finished.","timestamp_created":1577898142,"timestamp_updated":1577898142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk92Dse8Cd4n86AE="}
