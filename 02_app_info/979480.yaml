      Today, a quaint island in the Baltic Sea. In 2155, a sprawling metropolis able
      to compete with major world powers. Thanks to the Space Elevator, a technological
      marvel built by Bornholm''s corporate consortium, The Conglomerate, few nations

      /><br><br>In Born Punk, the player slips into the role of three people (well,
      two people, depending on your stance on artificial lifeforms) living on the
      island: <strong>Eevi</strong>, a corporate combat hacker turned bartender down
      on her luck; <strong>Mariposa</strong>, the CEO of Bornholm''s biggest corporation;
      and a malfunctioning android who calls himself <strong>Grandmaster Flashdrive</strong>.<br><br>The
      three characters have one thing in common: they all, one after another, get
      possessed by strange entities of unknown origin and even less known intentions.
      They must work together - and sometimes against each other - to find out of
      the nature of those beings, what they want, and why they seem to think that
      their ''mission'' is of vital importance for the future of humanity.<br><br><img

      notes: Born Punk contains occasional swear words and flirtatious language, rare
        use of blood, characters talking about drug and alcohol abuse in a comedic
        manner, as well as characters firing hand guns at objects and other characters
        and getting hit by the same.
