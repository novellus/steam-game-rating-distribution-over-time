    review: "A clever concept, but the game only has 1 map and the challenge gets\
      \ easy/repetitive pretty quick. Once you work out the formula each play is roughly\
      \ the same (score really only depends on how fast you can click)\n\nSome issues\
      \ to note/be improved : \n\n- You cant drag roads, each tile has to be placed\
      \ 1 by 1\n- Scanline are enabled by default, not sure what this adds\n- The\
      \ game needs a random map generator\n- There is no reason to build any park\
      \ except the biggest one\n- It is unclear how far workers will travel to work\n\
      - The UI is garbage, the game needs hotkeys/a better build menu\n- Please add\
      \ some sort of data overlay/graph feature\n\nFor the price its a good hour of\
      \ fun, but without some updates/extra content it isn't a game you would play\
      \ twice\n\nHopefully in a few months and a few updates I can change this to\
      \ a positive review!"
