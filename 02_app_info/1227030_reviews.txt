Although it does not feature any bonus stories, and the personalities of the Sunrider girls are not written quite as lively as the main Starnova girls, It's still a fun little bonus to add to any gameplay expirience, particularly in free mode, generations mode, and battle mode. These characters have their own unique strengths and nova skills that can completely change the way the game plays when used correctly.","timestamp_created":1586649183,"timestamp_updated":1586649183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516666650772094727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sabqtfECfvyIgAI="}
