    review: 'Language Worm


      Well, the Steam videogame has some speed bugs, and between some, mainly the
      most annoying one would be: when sometimes one eats any walmore/carrot and quickly
      the videogame crashes.


      Such an old gameplay couldn''t be, although low and sticky, more funny and likeable.
      The older, the better, and the name of the videogame edmind/remind us, seeming
      as something careless by some, the videogame first steps, when Peter Trefonas
      thought the videogame and CLOAD freed the videogame in 1978 thanks to Peter''s
      TRS-80.


      Ich put forward the videogame, hopefully the worm were going trough new thoroughfares/gameplays,
      new tongues, and new words.


      Buy it!'
