    review: "Depois de ver todos os cap\xEDtulos do jogo, hora da an\xE1lise.\n\n\
      Diferentemente do primeiro jogo da franquia, que era uma esp\xE9cie de simulador\
      \ de vida di\xE1ria com tempo para fazer as intera\xE7\xF5es, essa continua\xE7\
      \xE3o \xE9 simplesmente uma visual novel linear sem intera\xE7\xE3o nenhuma.\n\
      \nNa verdade, nem d\xE1 para dizer que realmente uma visual novel, pois o jogo\
      \ \xE9 simplesmente v\xE1rios cap\xEDtulos de hist\xF3ria que v\xE3o abrindo\
      \ um ap\xF3s o outro para voc\xEA ler.\nSeguem os pontos positivos (+) e negativos\
      \ (-):\n\n+ Arte simples, mas agrad\xE1vel;\n+ Tem meninas fofas fazendo coisas\
      \ fofas\n\n- A hist\xF3ria \xE9 simpl\xF3ria e nem sequer tem uma conclus\xE3\
      o;\n- N\xE3o tem NADA de voice acting... \xE9 pura leitura mesmo;\n- Os personagens\
      \ t\xEAm no m\xE1ximo 4 sprites cada;\n- Era para ser super engra\xE7ado, mas\
      \ se eu consegui rir 5 vezes foi muito...\n- Poucas m\xFAsicas de fundo, o que\
      \ faz com que voc\xEA enjoe de todas elas;\n- \xC9 muito pior que o anterior;\n\
      - Eu quitei umas 4 vezes antes de terminar tudo, n\xE3o conseguiu me prender\
      \ de jeito nenhum;\n\nSinceramente, infelizmente n\xE3o consegui gostar desse\
      \ jogo.\n\nN\xC3O RECOMENDO."
