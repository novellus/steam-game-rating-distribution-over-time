    review: "I First saw this game with coreupted was streaming it, and it caught\
      \ my interest and i bought it to 1.help support you and 2. try it out myself.\
      \ \n\nIm going to recommend this game because its an experience to try and you\
      \ can see a lot of effort went in. \n\nbut im not going to lie and say its an\
      \ amazing game.  I'll be honest. the controls are clunky and stiff. the physics\
      \ feels all over the place and the difficulty of some stuff feels extremly unfair.\
      \ \n\nThat said. if you're willing to stick with it to get used to the controls\
      \ and get used to the physics theres a suprising amount of fun to be had and\
      \ a good laugh to have along the way"
