Some scenes depict animated sequences of characters in shameless acts: confusing people with hexamba, eating poisonous mushrooms, and involved in gambling. Victory scenes are graphically depicted with extensive self-harming and large amounts of beer. Winners are frequently depicted with happiness and sometimes sincere frustration, arrogant smiles, or laying on floor. The game also contains references, in animated sequences and text; references to other games. Animated sequences also depict partially exposed hobgoblin female's breasts and buttocks. The words \"т*го\", \"л*душки\" and \"к*нфетка\" appear in dialogue."}}}}
