    review: "[h1]So, I defend Warsaw just to please my waifu[/h1]\n\nOk, to be honest,\
      \ the game is quiet easy on regular level. I manage to win the game on my first\
      \ run without any character dying. The mechanic is pretty basic, I like the\
      \ movement on the map, but there is nothing else to mention much. However, I\
      \ really love WW2 theme and the art style is very nice, every character look\
      \ very lovely, so that is probably the main point they got me.\n\nNow. for the\
      \ things I don't like. \nOne, the permanent stacking minus district morale system.\
      \ Every round, you are force to choose 1 of 3 random district missions to do,\
      \ the 2 that you won't do will keep stacking and minus district morale everyday,\
      \ and there is no way to remove it later, which is very annoying. \nTwo, equipment\
      \ is very hard to get one, and it is random. That's not all, you have to pay\
      \ supply to identify it first, so if your luck is really bad you will just waste\
      \ supply to repair the equipment that you already have, or lower tier than the\
      \ one you got. \nThree, supply can be used to raise district morale, but wait,\
      \ they are random. The game will random the district that will ask for supply\
      \ and random the amount of morale they will raise, so yeah if you got a low\
      \ morale district that never ask for your help. Yep, you are doom.\n\nBut I\
      \ like the game anyway,\njust don't expect the AAA game, and you will have some\
      \ enjoyment time as mine."
