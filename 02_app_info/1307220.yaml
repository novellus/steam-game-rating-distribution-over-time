    review: Lots of bugs.  Ball is hard to throw, since it seems to stick in place
      sometimes when you throw/release grip.  Uses plenty of apparently stock assets
      and music.  I'd be more interested in this game if it had multiplayer and if
      it were more developed. Concept is cool, but the game needs more work.
