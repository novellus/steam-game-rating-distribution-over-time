To reiterate other comments, it is a shame that it doesn't extend slightly further south, or in the 5 years since this was released there hasn't been an extension pack covering the bit from St Pancras Intl to London Bridge / Elephant & Castle.\n\nAlso, I do think the basic scenarios included are a bit lazy. It would be nice if the routes from Bedford to St Pancras followed the usual service of the real life operation, ie running fast from St Albans on the fast lines, overtaking the stopping service etc on the slower lines. Equally, there is no standard scenario of a service into the main St Pancras station. This could have easily been included under a 'Sunday Maintenance service' scenario.\n\nUltimately, great route, great scenery but the standard scenarios are lacking and you need a lot of money to get the DLC to take advantage of the excellent workshop scenarios out there.","timestamp_created":1591867434,"timestamp_updated":1591867434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwways0fICcNiyjQI="}
