I managed to get at stage 4 in this modality, but i was already very frustrated, and i'll explain why:\n1) Consumables drops randombly and NEVER the right one when you need it: you almost never get HP recovery when you have 1 heart left.\n2) Enemies shoot more than you, a LOT more. And fast. Almost all the time you'll find yourself unable to dodge every bullet (yeah like if you are inside a bullet hell game).\n3) Your weapong can JAM. Yes, you're reading well, you'll find yourself unable to shoot for a period like 4-5 seconds and this happens more than one time in the same level (i think randomly). Obviously in this range of time you'll be already surrounded and enjoying a GangBang from the enemies.\n\nThen, following the game tips, you can switch difficulty to something like \"crybaby\" and the game gets playbale at least, but still unbalanced in some moments. BUT bosses become way too weak, there's no amusement in facing them. You should switch back to Normal Mode at every boss stage, but this is boring....\n\nAnd the game is short. 4 levels only plus the final boss :(","timestamp_created":1608410838,"timestamp_updated":1608410838,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv7awvvYCfq7DuwI="}
