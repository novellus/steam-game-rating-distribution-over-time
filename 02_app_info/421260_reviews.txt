It's like chess, but with innovative movement and attack rules that can be combined in complex and interesting ways. A typical match can be played in less than ten minutes, making it perfect for taking short breaks from work (which can easily become long breaks if you lose track of time). One of the few games I am proud to have completed 100%.","timestamp_created":1609830800,"timestamp_updated":1609830800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqJPZ6PYCdZPQwAI="}
