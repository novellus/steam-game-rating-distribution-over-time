    review: "I love total war as a series. this has great graphics and game play,\
      \ nice cut scenes. But two problems that kill this for me. \n\n1. its a old\
      \ ass game yet it has an interface bug that is very annoying. sometimes after\
      \ a battle the entire interface just disappears and i have to exit the game\
      \ and come back into it to fix it. \n\n2. the campaigns have no option to do\
      \ short or long. they are all just long AF. People should have the OPTION because\
      \ there are going to be factions that bore you. so by the time you get to the\
      \ DLC ether A you decided not to try every faction or B you are bored and the\
      \ game has gotten tedious. It does not matter how good you are its a very long\
      \ grind if your achievement hunting. which is not something i am into. \n\n\
      there are some other things to mention. but they are small things that are going\
      \ to just come with total war things. like certain units being very OP and some\
      \ being way to weak for what they historically are. some menu and information\
      \ preferences. \n\nBut if it was not for those two numbered things i listed\
      \ above. this would have gotten a thumbs up. i still am a loyal total war fan."
