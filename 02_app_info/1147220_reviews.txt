Or should I say, will be in trouble. See, some time in the future, a plague ravages your family, leaving only one survivor: your fifteen-year-old daughter. Since you haven’t even found love in your time… this is indeed interesting. More so, that she inherited your ability to visit the past. Which is why she came to you. Since she can’t CHANGE the past like you can. Now, can you save your family, including yourself?\n\nHO scenes are fun, minigames challenging, and the plot engaging. Fully recommend, though get in the bundle.","timestamp_created":1569096262,"timestamp_updated":1569096262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581502318382263184","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl5zbqu0CdprT0gE="}
