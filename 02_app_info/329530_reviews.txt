Two new factions, with their unique twists in gameplay. One new class, which really changes all factions' style and dozens of new things. Also, a new gameplay mechanic in the random events that are called Cosmic Happenings which have a variety of effects from ending your current research, making your buildings finish more quickly or even summon powerful roaming armies (I hate this last one).\nI would recommend it, even though it might be better if you get it on sale.","timestamp_created":1586084315,"timestamp_updated":1608472202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwscGawPYCdNKm/gE="}
