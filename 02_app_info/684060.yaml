    review: 'What would you do if you''d discover out your identical twin

      1. is secretly the towns biggest masked vigilante

      2. has been kidnapped, with people thinking it''s you?


      [i]The Hero Unmasked![/i] asks the player exactly these questions.

      You play as the host of the city''s highest rated TV show and are just weeks
      away from marrying none other than the mayor when disaster strikes. It''s all
      over the news:

      [i]You''ve been kidnapped.[/i]

      But... you are right here and very much not-kidnapped. There''s just one, very
      horrifying explanation:

      The person in the ransom video is your identical twin. Worse yet, there''s a
      great chance they are the city''s very own masked vigilante: The Swashbuckler.

      If you want to save your twin before the kidnappers find out that they do not
      have you, but the Swashbuckler in their clutches, and might act accordingly
      (aka likely killing your twin), the only chance you have is to take up the mask
      and cape yourself, find and rescue your twin, discover how they got kidnapped...
      and all of that before the wedding.


      The plot, world and characters are wonderfully crafted, and with a lot of Aha!-
      and Oh!-moments. Every new play-through can easily provide information and scenes
      not witnessed in one before, like the backstories of the NPCs, villains included.


      Thus, one of the best (superhero) stories in the library, great replay value.'
