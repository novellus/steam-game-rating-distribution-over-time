A cheery tune as you play and a lot of meowing when you solve a puzzle. It kept me entertained. Every machine has a solution and more than a few were a conundrum. The cats are cute. If you enjoy logic puzzles, you'll like this game.","timestamp_created":1594882415,"timestamp_updated":1594882415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mcuZq/MCdJ/NlQI="}
