The upholstery, panel, sound, flight characteristics and systems replicate the original aircraft with great accuracy. The interior lights can now be dimmed (this was the one criticism I saw on an early review) and work well  for night flying. This is an excellent aircraft for pilots wanting to move on from fixed-pitch trainers to a more advanced aircraft with retractable gear and constant-speed prop, for instrument and night rating training with its functional ADF, VOR and GPS, for local and regional fun flying, or for longer cross countries if you have time and appreciate the journey. \n\nThe more I fly this aircraft, the more impressed I am by the detail. For example, not only does it use fuel at a realistic rate, but as fuel is used from one of the wing tanks, the lateral CG changes, and you have to adjust the rudder trim to compensate.\n\nTwo minor issues: max cruise speed is only 144 kts TAS at 10,000 ft (full throttle, 1900-2000 rpm), short of the POH figure of 151 kts; the roll command knob on the autopilot does not appear to have any effect; and the DME does not show time until the VOR. Those are the only slight negatives I can think of. \n\nPretty much perfect. Highly recommended.","timestamp_created":1588145339,"timestamp_updated":1593615108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+pi3hfMCcrKghAI="}
