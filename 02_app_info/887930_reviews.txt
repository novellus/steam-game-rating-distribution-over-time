I still recommend this, but this one had some cons.\n\nPro: Overall a good Hidden Object game. Fun puzzles, some back and forth, but not too much. Logical flow for the most part. A big plus was that none of the mini-games that I recall were just the same tired old mini-games developers use over and over in newer games. Unlike the older games in this series, it has an interactive map and full hints.\n\nCons: Some of the mini-games didn't even make sense to me as to how to play, let along how to solve (but I'm not that good at them, so might be a fun challenge for smarter people). The other cons are really quite minor. There is a tram that you can't bypass using the map, but the travel is short. There was very little story (which doesn't matter to me personally). There was some really very minor glitches in some hidden object scenes: things misnamed, things marked as requiring extra action but didn't, and multiple items of the same type but only one listed (for example, two bows in a scene, but only one bow listed).","timestamp_created":1599431195,"timestamp_updated":1599431195,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l+fhsvQCcP+hoAI="}
