    review: "In the present state I cannot recommend this game to anyone. It has some\
      \ serious glitches that seem to be related the disappearance of the sfx after\
      \ even brief playing periods. There was already another reviewer here that pointed\
      \ out a glitch preventing the opening of walls and passages. (Edit note) I am\
      \ in contact with the game developer and they are attempting to resolve this\
      \ nasty game breaking issue now. Once the bug/s are squashed I will likely be\
      \ revising my review and even reversing my recommendation. My only cause for\
      \ a downvote is the fact that the game is unplayable in this present state.\
      \ I can't even get it to progress far enough to find the first save point which\
      \ would be enough to frustrate any player, especially when you can see the means\
      \ of progression but you can't progress further due to the glitches.\n\nFrom\
      \ what little I was able to play in between the glitches, it would seem to remind\
      \ me of a Zelda-esqe title. However, it took several restarts to get to the\
      \ second area where there were npcs to talk to. Then when I went a little further\
      \ I hit another game stopping glitch where I couldn't progress into the passage\
      \ because some key background processes are failing and it prevents the game\
      \ from opening up to the next area. There are no saves yet so it's a crap shoot\
      \ where you start up and pray that you make it through all of this and to the\
      \ first save point. If the game just offered an ability to save anywhere I might\
      \ be able to force my way through by playing until it glitches while saving\
      \ frequently. Then closing the game and relaunching it to continue. But that's\
      \ not an option. \n\nWhat perplexes me even more is the one review that had\
      \ a lot of details on it. It's actually the reason I was willing to give the\
      \ game a try. But I don't see how they could have played through this game without\
      \ experiencing the sound effect glitch where all sfx from combat just stop working\
      \ or the glitch that prevents you from opening passages right from the very\
      \ beginning of the game.  Unless they played an earlier build that wasn't glitched\
      \ that is. But the version you get as of now is unplayable. I've restarted the\
      \ game about 20 times now and only made it through the  wall with the sword\
      \ in two of those plays now. At first I though the sfx glitch was related to\
      \ whatever was going wrong but it apparently is just something else that went\
      \ wrong."
