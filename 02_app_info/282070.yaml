      \ Cut</strong> marks an end of an era for 11 bit studios, so let\u2019s hear\
      \ what the art director Przemyslaw Marszal, the person who created the unique\
      \ style of This War of Mine, has to say: \u201CWe wanted to put the last touch\
      \ to this phenomenon. The phenomenon, which made us who we are today as a team,\
      \ equally in terms of creative fearlessness and business direction, and helped\
      \ us pave our further way. Fantastic support from the gaming community was a\
      \ huge part of that success, so it was without any doubt that this update must\
      \ be free. We think of the Final Cut as a closing episode to the one-of-a-kind\
      \ series This War of Mine has been. It will remain precious to our hearts and\
      \ I don\u2019t know what ideas the future will bring but Final Cut is final\
      \ by no means. The creative minds in our studio, who were with the game up to\
      \ this point, started to pursue new challenges. So we're excited about what's\
      \ coming.\u201D</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Recently\

    short_description: In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather
      a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack
      of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The
      game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.
