      determined by your level of power (And speed). Avoid referees and manager''s

      goals as you can inside the allotted time!<br><br><strong>Buffs and Debuffs</strong><br>Your
      ability to run quickly and kick the ball hard can be affected both for better
      and worse by the NPCs who''ll spawn more frequently the more goals you''ve scored:<br><ul

      5% of their initial value. They''ll get you fitter, then put you in your place.<br></li><li>Agent:
