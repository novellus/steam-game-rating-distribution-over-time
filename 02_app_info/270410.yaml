    review: the game's visuals and artstyle is amazing (I can tell that the artist
      was inspired by Jhonen Vasquez, Creator of Invader Zim) gameplay could use some
      work. aiming while moving feels very off and it's sometimes hard to hit enemies.
      the soundtrack NEEDS TO GET RELEASED. it's the best part about this game. and
      the main characters don't even have names, there's little to no voice acting,
      and the game is poorly optimized on pc. keyboard inputs are broken so the only
      way you'll be able to play this, is on a xbox controller. i'm sorry but do yourself
      a favor and save your $3 until these issues get fixed.
