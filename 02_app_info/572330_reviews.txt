Maybe it's different than the usual character experience.  I was curious to see how this will end.  For the most part, the game does play out linear, but there a couple or a few \"big\" moments where there is choice in how this will end.  For me, I was satisfied in how I ended the game as the goody two-shoes that I am.\n\nThe gameplay is a point and click.  Most items that are clickable doesn't mean much.  It is just only a viewable item.  Thankfully, with items already highlighted, you don't have to be frustrated in 'pixel finding' so you stay within the story.  There a couple of problems with the layout, however.  Sometimes if you move ahead a 'picture location', you would need to turn around because there is another picture location where you can search stuff.  The map layout doesn't make it easy for you to check what is around you.  Then again, it most areas aren't important in moving forward in the game.\n\nAnother small issue is that I wished this FMV game will have at least video clips or audio dialogue in the game just like the intro and another hidden video (check a laptop) within the game.  But I give that a pass.  I can feel the developer put a lot of work into this despite being a short game.  Also, I think this is his first game to make, so I don't expect much.  It was still an intriguing point of view as well as some choices in the game.  Great work.","timestamp_created":1609496559,"timestamp_updated":1609496559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42Y/e3vYCfvOtvwI="}
