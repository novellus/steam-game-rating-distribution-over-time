For $4.99 it is what it is.  You basically run around finding 75 crystals before the 16th day runs out.  If you dont find all 75 you die.  Good news is the game saves each day so if you do die via zombie hand you can go back and reload.  The zombie graphics are OK at best, its fun for a bit but does get tedious.  But since its only $4.99 its worth it.","timestamp_created":1524011590,"timestamp_updated":1524011590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483278572559356689","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl+yK6+ICcvW+ngE="}
