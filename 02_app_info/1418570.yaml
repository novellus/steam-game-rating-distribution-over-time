    about_the_game: "Zen Trails is a relaxing, simple sand box in which you can do\
      \ only one thing: draw lines. When you press play, the lines rotate to create\
      \ beautiful designs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are no puzzles, no objectives.\
      \ It's simply an environment in which you can create beautiful spirographs,\
      \ set to the most zen-inducing music and visuals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nZen Trails\
      \ is very effective at relaxing and inspiring, as well as reducing anxiety.\
      \ It gives the mind something to focus on which is low pressure yet still stimulating\
      \ with a small amount of gentle math and a very satisfying payoff when seeing\
      \ your designs come to life. And for those players who lived through the 90's,\
      \ perhaps a little nostalgia if they ever played with a spirograph maker. <br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nI'm a solo dev and I really hope you enjoy this little project\
      \ of mine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n- Intuitive click and drag\
      \ design process<br />\r\n- Robust tutorial, including tips for making designs\
      \ beautiful<br />\r\n- Copy-paste<br />\r\n- Unlimited undo steps<br />\r\n\
      - All possible colors<br />\r\n- Unlimited line thickness<br />\r\n- Save and\
      \ load designs<br />\r\n- 10 autosave slots, saves every 3 minutes.<br />\r\n\
