I had great hopes from the team as Chivalry was truly an innovative and exciting game at the time of its release.Chivalry with fantasy classes? Sign me up.\n\nUnfortunately, that's exactly what I got, but with significantly less effort put into it. The core of Chivalry combat is here, but it just feels like a more toned down version with half-assed class design.\n\nWhen I played this game, I was kind of hoping for something akin to TF2/Overwatch, but with more involved melee combat. In adition to having fun classes and engaging gameplay, those games brought in strong objective modes and competitive matchmaking. None of that here.\n\nInstead we've got a really uninspired Chivalry re-skin that seems to try and add hero abilities without understanding just how to make them interesting or balanced, and a few half-baked objectives sprinkled on top.\n\nThe color pallet used across all the art is really bland and distracting, too. It's just so hard to tell what's going on and who is on which team at any given moment. \n\nCombine all this with the fact that the game is just straight up _not fun_ you've got a recipe for disaster. Skip this one, it'll be dead soon enough.","timestamp_created":1494572564,"timestamp_updated":1563069423,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557086706161499023","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42dOM9+sCe/n0eA=="}
