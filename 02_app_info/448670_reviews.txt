It has the makings of a reasonable budget pinball game but unfortunately it is pretty bug ridden (the ball or plunger can get often stuck or lost) and there's no option for rebinding keys (the default is to use the arrow keys). Some of the tables are relatively fun (e.g. the race car one) or novel (e.g. the retro game one). Others are boring or too hard (e.g. the viking one where nobody seems to get a reasonable score). The sound and visuals are generally fine but overall there's a fairly cheap and nasty feel to it which makes it hard to recommend above the more polished pinball games on Steam.","timestamp_created":1610024220,"timestamp_updated":1610024220,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1v667vYCeIOiwQI="}
