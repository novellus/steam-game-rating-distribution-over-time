    review: "I've looked a long time for a good cooking game. I finally thought I\
      \ found it when I discovered Overcooked. But I soon realised OC is primarily\
      \ based on a good 'fun with friends' coop title. Which is fine n dandy dandy\
      \ n fine but missin certain aspects I wanted to play in a cooking game.\n\n\
      The description on the Store page of HP convinced me that some (not all) of\
      \ my desired missin aspects were fulfilled. So I purchased this ridiculously\
      \ cheap title.\n\nATM HP is buggy. Graphical glitches here n there, equipment\
      \ appearin, disappearin & lackin optimisation. But in sayin that its very playable.\
      \ \n\nThe time aspect is good. You first av freetime - Use this as preperation\
      \ time. A few things are involved in prepin. Then openin/closin time (automatic)\
      \ - business as usual. Followed by more freetime. Again use for prepin, orderin,\
      \ cleanin, etc. You can cut the day short after closin time but that can glitch\
      \ the game. So ATM let it run its end.\n\nThe managerial aspects challenging.\
      \ Buyin, sellin, upgradin. Serving everyone is too. Lackin meats or veggies?\
      \ Then cook only the most expensive dishes with wot ya got. You can even prepare\
      \ ingrediants for the day comin & store them in the fridge boxes. The machines\
      \ are good. They could use a little more animations here n there but still good.\
      \ \n\nWrappin it up. \nFor the price its well worth it. The playabilitys good.\
      \ Managements good. Just needs bug splattin."
