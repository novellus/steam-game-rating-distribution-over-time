I am the former. I probably could have negotiated some free steam keys with the too nice for their own good developers, but I genuinely want to give them money. I bought the entire game with all the expansions for about 11 dollars in the sale, this will be my platform of choice going forward. Unfortunately, my brain is too weak to make use of these levels, I will go back to Gunthro. I'll find the easiest one and try that at another time. Every bit as devious as the core games, intended for advanced players.","timestamp_created":1498978128,"timestamp_updated":1498978128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.659620881080627441","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiOKDgd0Cc/Oqfg=="}
