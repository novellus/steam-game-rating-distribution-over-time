      class="bb_tag"><strong>About the Team and our Goals:</strong></h2>Back in September
      a post on r/vive was made asking if people were interested in making VR content.
      Within hours we had several people respond to it and we further organized ourselves
      in a discord channel. We had people from all skill levels present but we all
      shared the same goal, to create content for VR in order to further support the
      VR community. We organized into smaller teams with each team pursuing a small
      project. Whack a Vote is the first title to reach completion. We quickly realized
      that releasing a game as a group would require a legal entity backing us which
      meant we had to start a company. With that said we hope that this title will
      provide us with enough funding to establish ourselves as a legitimate company
      that will be solely VR focused. We understand that this title is small in scope
      and quirky but we did put our heart into it. If anything the project is providing
      us with a stepping stone for bigger and better projects to come.

    review: The developer released this game for a dollar, then retracted the price
      a day or so later, and offered refunds. Honestly it's worth a buck. You can
      hit the candidates, as well as pepe with a rubber chicken and stuff. I'm game.
      I found out if you put the coins on the top of the dolls, they can do a little
      hat dance. This game reminds us of a simpler time, when we had a choice. Many
      of us choose incorrectly, and they will have to own their mistake. [spoiler]According
      to the detailed, thoughtful analysis developed by a career intelligence professional
      from MI5, Donald Trump pees on people, and it owes alot of money to Russian
      oligarchs. Fusssssss. The only reason why Tillerson is secretary of state is
      to remove the sanctions. Puppet.[/spoiler] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEpj-f1GuL8
