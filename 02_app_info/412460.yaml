    review: 'I was on mission 4 or 5 and the last task was to build a tavern so I
      did but then it says mission failed I have no idea why and it expects me to
      do it all again having spent over an hour trying to get the basics done.

      I have encountered numerous times issues where I build houses and hunters posts
      but the progress doesnt move on without these the villagers would die so I have
      to restart and usually it will continue the mission story.'
