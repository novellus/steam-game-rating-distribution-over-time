    review: Haunting.   It's a good follow-up to the original game.  I love this universe
      so damn much.  (And yes, I did finish this game in 7 hours, if that's a factor
      for you.  I didn't 100% it but I came close.  Still worth the price, if you
      ask me, especially if you liked the first one.)  It runs a little janky and
      I had to force quit a couple of times when it didn't load correctly, but nothing
      permanently game ruining.
