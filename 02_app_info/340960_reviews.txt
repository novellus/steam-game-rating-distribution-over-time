Lots of songs, lots of difficulty levels, lost of customizability. Good for working out or playing for high score. The music is very video gamey, featuring a lot of dance tracks that sound like they were inspired by NES game style music, which is fine by me. Good songs to dance to.","timestamp_created":1609542772,"timestamp_updated":1609542772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw0rSO4PYCd/vFvwI="}
