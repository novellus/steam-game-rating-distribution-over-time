Need quick reflexes and good timing to beat the game. Interesting story, great music, cool artwork. You’ve got a time limit to beat each level, and the level re-generates differently each time you play. There’s a mystery and I NEED to know how it ends. Thanks to coronavirus lockdown I’ve got plenty of time and will keep working my way through. RECOMMEND!!","timestamp_created":1585840884,"timestamp_updated":1585840884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473791986703872681","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkvHenfECc+m0/QE="}
