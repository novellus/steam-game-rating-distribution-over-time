    review: "Quite fun game with pumping folk music soundtrack.\nThere is only one\
      \ issue IMO - writing runes with a touchscreen would be much more comfortable\
      \ (you\u2019re lucky if your laptop got touchscreen).\n\nThe price is low, It\
      \ has achievements and trading cards. What else does a man need? A woman apparently...\
      \ Well, there is none. But You should still get it. ;)\n"
