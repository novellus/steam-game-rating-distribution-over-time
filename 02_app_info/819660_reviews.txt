If you are interested in donating to charity, your money's better spent just donating to charity, rather than buying this turd of a game. \n\nThis game is a total scam asset flip unity garbage. The graphics, sounds, and music of the game are actually quite good, but the gameplay is total crap, a pile of donkey dung. Games need more than good graphics, sound and music, they need also gameplay. That is why they are called \"games\". \n\nThe controls and camera is horrible, no inversion options, gameplay is mediocre randomly generated crap, with only 1 level in the game. I don't think there is a finish line on the end of the level, just the same turrets over and over with randomized rocks and tree locations, trying to get a \"high score\", as if it matters. There are supposed to be 3 levels but the other two levels say they are \"coming soon\" (which means never.) Honestly this game is an insult to cancer patients, if you're going to make a game to help a charity, at least put some effort into the d**n game, this is embarrassing. I don't even know why people put this kind of crap on steam, it just clutters up the library. Second I'd look into holistic healing for cancer instead of relying on the scammy and corrupt medical system that overcharges patients, I've heard of people being half a million dollars in debt after getting cancer treatment, it isn't morally right and its a form of systemic oppression. And also there is no such foundation called \"the American Cancer Research\", the closest thing I could find is \"American Association for Cancer Research\" so I'm not even sure if any of this money is even going to any charity and its probably a scam. If you want to cure cancer it starts by not uploading games like this to the steam library in the first place.","timestamp_created":1583296686,"timestamp_updated":1583296780,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":30,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.73899233341217041","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1587070634,"developer_response":"In case you didn't know, the project was lost to a ransomware, we couldn't update the game any further because of it, I also lost my team as a consequence, read here:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/819660/eventcomments/2146469724192182189\n\nNext time read before you jump to conclusions, there are posts from even last year about it.\n\nRegards"}],"cursor":"AoJw7vL10fACc+b+9QE="}
