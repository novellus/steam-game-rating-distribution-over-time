Although it seems like there's one dialogue option at the start when you first talk to the escape artist; that seems to stick and not advance properly unless you just click on all three dialogue options.\n\nThe story is pretty generic but is still genuine in its intentions, the writing is strong but is not brought to its full potential due to how short the game is. The whole story is very abrupt and feels like an abridged version of a relatively typical animated movie. The plot just doesn't fit well into this small a time frame. The entire sequence about logic and fallacy doesn't make much sense considering it doesn't truly have anything to do with the story, it seems to be artificially injected in for the sake of trying to teach the player some kind of lesson.\n\n\nOverall while it was a nice little experience, it definitely is rough around the edges in the way it tells a generic magician story in a half hour; with this strange inclusion of a lesson on critical thinking. Would of much rather paid for a larger scale story that has been fully fleshed out and fits into itself, then this very confined and uncertain short story. Still interesting though to be sure, just this same concept would have been much more interesting and more natural in a larger format.","timestamp_created":1553325189,"timestamp_updated":1603127598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53586500883102417","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu7v2oPUCc/DPvQE="}
