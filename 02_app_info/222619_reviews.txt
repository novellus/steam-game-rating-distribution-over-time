However, the only disappointment I have is the fuel capacity being set at 2664 gallons, much less then an ES44AC with 5000 gallons and an SD40-2 with 4000 gallons whereas the prototype real life DDA40X only has a much bigger fuel capacity of 8280 gallons. Because of that, I will unfortunately be taking a mark off for the very low fuel capacity as it is not exactly prototypical for a huge locomotive this big and powerful, especially considering the size of the fuel tank. Other than that, the loco is definitely up to the task of pulling long trains on Sherman Hill, a good 9/10 rating from me.","timestamp_created":1596476697,"timestamp_updated":1596476697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mqXb2vMCf4SYmQI="}
