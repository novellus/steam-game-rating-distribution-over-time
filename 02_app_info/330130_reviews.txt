Fantastic idea, online demos look cool, but it just doesn't bloody work. For example, I can't connect to activate usage of mp4. I can't connect to their magix.com website, but I can to their subdomains. Looks like they've banned my country?\n\nIf you click refresh to update the folder view (was trying different filetypes) the program crashes. Can't use MP4, some forum posts from 3 years ago showing people having the same issue and never resolved. Other forum posts saying you must still purchase rights to use it? No response from support.\n\nDon't bother with this. The idea is awesome, I'd love to use it, but its just far too buggy. I edit with multiple other softwares, my PC is pretty beefy, and all my drivers are up to date. And yes I tried fresh installs, run as administrator and everything else I could find on the forums.\n\nThis program is just shit.","timestamp_created":1595717317,"timestamp_updated":1595717317,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mL6KxPMCebHGlwI="}
