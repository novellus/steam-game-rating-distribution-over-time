    about_the_game: "Fight on the front lines of the war between humanity and the\
      \ hideous Blobs. (Not that anyone has actually seen a Blob up close, but everyone\
      \ knows they have tentacles. Surely they\u2019re hideous!) Go on stealth missions,\
      \ run alien blockades, and investigate mysterious planets, &quot;aided&quot;\
      \ by Lloyd, your insufferably obnoxious shipboard computer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nChoice of the Star Captain is the hilarious interactive science-fiction novel\
      \ where your choices determine how the story proceeds. The game is entirely\
      \ text-based--without graphics or sound effects--but powered by the vast, unstoppable\
      \ power of your imagination.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor example, suppose Lloyd has\
      \ just informed you that your ship will crash land on the jungle moon of Cygnus\
      \ Delta in 93 seconds. What will you do?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA) Call upon your\
      \ elite piloting skills to escape the moon\u2019s gravity well.<br />\r\nB)\
      \ Invite Lloyd to land the ship himself, if he\u2019s so smart.<br />\r\nC)\
      \ Make the prudent choice, and try landing on the moon\u2019s surface instead\
      \ of attempting a risky escape.<br />\r\nD) Spend the last 93 seconds of your\
      \ life gleefully smashing Lloyd\u2019s screen with a torque wrench.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nHumanity needs you, Star Captain! Will you defeat the Blobs and come\
      \ home as a war hero? Will you uncover the secret that sparked the Blob invasion?\
      \ Will you serve as ambassador and convince the Blobs to spare the human race?\
      \ The choice is yours."
