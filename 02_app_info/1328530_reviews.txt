Unique and balanced mix of mechanics with a bit of randomization mixed in. Beautiful anime style and design, high level of quality in all aspects. Nice complementing story segments with a hacking/programming motif presented in a visual novel style.\nMore details on different aspects of the game below.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The mechanics are vast in this game, so I'll focus on what makes this game unique in my eyes. First, you don't play multiple cards per turn, playing a card [i]is[/i] a turn. So is most other manual action. There is no opponent player per se, enemy cards come in waves and act on their own. They have a countdown timer and act according to that turn count. The game revolves heavily around card abilities and effects, the resolution order and placement on the field plus turn timing. Additionally, there is a very interesting sacrifice mechanic for single cards or entire rows for additional effects or attacks.\nThere are a lot of different decks and archetypes to chose from with various strategies and synergies (heck, there's even chess). Also you acquire temporary cards (randomized loot) during matches that allow you to tune and extend your deck mid-battle. All in all, the core gameplay is a very solid and pretty addicting experience.\n\nDIFFICULTY: Despite its inherently hard difficulty I find the game to be very beginner-friendly, judging from personal experience as a non-competitive casual TCG player. Throughout the beginning of the story you are introduced to the mechanics and slowly ramping up difficulty in a comfortable pace. New battle stages will always present a challenge and might seem impossible at first but after getting used to and working out the mechanics of both your deck and the enemies, beating them is a very rewarding experience.\n\nPROGRESSION: You progressively unlock more and more characters and their decks as you progress. The beauty here is, although each character and deck plays different, you are supposed to be able to beat all major battles with any of the available characters and decks as they are balanced pretty well. There are also mini battle stages that are more like puzzles and are restricted to specific characters, where you have to use one of their decks and the game's mechanics in a specific way to solve them.\n\nDESIGN: The character and background art is top-notch, making the visual novel story segments a treat for the eyes. \nThe cards use stylized pixel art matching the whole programming/hacking theme of the game. Special effects and card movement are very smooth and well designed. Menu and UI design is refined and subtle, not getting in the way and fitting into the whole Scifi atmosphere.\n\nSOUND: The background music tracks dip into the chiptune realm and match the atmosphere pretty well, usually flavored around the respective stage's overall theme. The sound effects for the game are really well chosen and feel natural to the game.\n\nSTORY: Scifi story incorporating hacking and programming resembled by the card game. It introduces you to the characters and establishes the lore of the game. Cute and funny at times without being too cringy overall. However, story is not the core of the game as this is not a typical full-fledged visual novel in terms of story content and length. Nonetheless the story is well written and doesn't feel artificial. It does what it does very well: setting up the atmosphere of the game and giving personality to the characters and the world while bridging the paths between the battles.","timestamp_created":1610135383,"timestamp_updated":1610135383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vYXj8fYCerHPwQI="}
