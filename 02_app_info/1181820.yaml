    developer_response: "Hello mbigler13, thank you for trying out Colossal Saga!\
      \ \nWe apologize for the poor experience you had with the local co-op part of\
      \ the game. As the game is in Early Access, we've been working tirelessly to\
      \ finish the new features we've implemented into the game as well as polishing\
      \ existing material. Since we're implementing rapid changes very often, we have\
      \ not updated the Early Access game with the massive new patch. That being said,\
      \ we don't want you to feel like you've made a mistake by supporting up and\
      \ comers so we'd like to make it up to you by deploying the latest version of\
      \ the build shortly, which includes a fully revamped controller system (for\
      \ both solo and local co-op). \n\nWe are very close to finalizing this new build;\
      \ we can safely say it will be available by the end of next week. We apologize\
      \ for the poor experience and we hope the update will provide a much more enjoyable\
      \ time."

    review: I wish I could get a refund on this game, but I don't know how.  I haven't
      got to play the local co-op, the reason I bought it, because one controller
      controls both characters.  I've tried Xinput and Dinput, neither work.  Every
      other game I play in Steam, Gog or Epic that uses a controller, works.  This
      sucks, this has actually dissuaded me from supporting up and comers.
