Rogue Summoner is a clever easy to pick up, hard to master indie game that reminds me of Into the Breach with its deterministic approach to combat.  You know exactly how the enemy will behave and its up to you to figure out how to best use that to your advantage.  A very clever presentation of interesting mechanics.","timestamp_created":1603681943,"timestamp_updated":1603681943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505424380302429199","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43Y+5sfUCfeaWqgI="}
