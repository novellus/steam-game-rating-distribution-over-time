      /><br><br>Unlike the other dragons, which do nothing but have their heads in
      the clouds all the time, Reigal is quite down to earth. He knows that the thing
      that should matter most to a dragon is his tower, where he'd keep the abducted
      princesses. If only the accursed knights wouldn't come here to free the prisoners,
      destroying the tower. That's why Reigal decided to play it safe and get more
      solid stones to make the tower completely unapproachable. But first he has to
      get a lot of gold to later exchange it for building materials. And to do so,
      one needs to come down to earth... and then go even deeper.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/983890/extras/promo_2.png?t=1593664723"
      /><br><br>Digging Dragon is a game where you have to go underground for treasure
      hunting. Explore dungeons and dig up earth cells that hide not only fabulous
      treasures, but also dangerous traps. By the way, traps are not the only thing
      you need to worry about. The cunning wizards who built these dungeons opened
      many portals down here, and Dragon God only knows where they lead.<br><br><img

    review: 'Pointlessly easy and tedious game, all of the screencaps other than the
      first will never occur during actual gameplay.


      You can easily complete almost every room layout - and there aren''t all that
      many - without ever getting hit. Not that getting hit hurts enough that you
      care, since you''ll be teleporting back to town every so often to keep building
      the tower, and you get a free heal every time. The movement controls are also
      awkward, but it''s not as though that ends up mattering much.


      Nothing threatens you from the start and the game never gets harder, so it''s
      probably fine that you don''t improve until the end of the game, but... well,
      my point is it''s trash and there''s nothing to this game.


      Not recommended for anyone, not even if you already own it for some reason.'
