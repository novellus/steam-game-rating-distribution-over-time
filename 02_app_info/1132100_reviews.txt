In fact, I had to take a break in order to preserve my sanity. However, the pay off and character development that arises from the pain and torment, was incredible.  SOH4 is not content with simply describing the struggle of its characters, it forces the reader to experience them. \n\nThe fact that SOH4 so effectively captured the pain of its characters and shared it with the audience, similar to that of The Last Of Us Part II, is an astonishing achievement for a text-based game. I would liken playing SOH4 to my experience during The Last Of Us Part II, where the emotional toll is suffocating and the violence is unforgiving and endless. Some may not find that to be enjoyable (which is fair enough), but when a game can make me feel such strong emotions like anger, hate, sadness, longing and happiness then that is an achievement that must be noted.\n\n\nHowever,  SOH4 does have a couple issues. \n\nThe smaller issue:\n\nSOH4, admirably, has a very large scope which, sometimes leads to pacing issues. \n\nThe more notable issue:\n\nAdditionally, much like the previous 2 installments, SOH4 is quite liberal in its definition of 'choice'. What I mean is that it clearly guides the reader to making certain choices and these choices have very little variety. That can be a massive turn off for many readers and usually it would be for me too. However, I adore SOH4's the story and the characters, so the lack of choice becomes less of an issue for me. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned as SOH4 doesn't really offer much in terms of choices.\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nWarnings: Violence & Sex & Sexual Violence\n\nOk, so it should be clear that SOH4 is extremely violent but it's also extremely sexual. They did (sometimes) break my immersion because of the way they were written but that wasnt always the case. Also, please keep in mind that SOH4 is beyond fucked. It's 100% the darkest COG/HG I have ever played.","timestamp_created":1604185478,"timestamp_updated":1607796771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i/mJrPYCdvq1qwI="}
