      /><br><br>AegisM is a competitive tower defence game with a twist. It combines
      tower defence with a wave survival/top down action shooter and then adds more
      new and exciting elements to the mix. Work alone or team up with others to work
      out the best strategy to achieve the highest scores on the never ending survival
      leaderboards. Once you're ready to prove yourself even more, you can take to
      the Player vs Player mode with competitive matchmaking and ELO ratings. AegisM
      is unlike other tower defence games; there are no waves of enemies, it's never
      ending, gradually getting harder and harder until you can't survive anymore
      and your strategy fails you.<h2 class="bb_tag">Build towers your way</h2>As
      of 10th July 2019, you can now change all of the stats on each of your projectile
      based towers. Upgrade range, damage, rate, critical chance and critical damage
      at every tower level to expand massively on the amount of strategies available
      to you! Note this feature is only live on the beta branch currently but is expected
      to hit the public branch soon.<h2 class="bb_tag">Evolve Towers</h2>Not only
      are there 33 towers in the game, but you can now evolve your towers into something
      different. Convert rocket towers into nuke towers, sacrifice coin generators
      to heal your base, make your towers resistant to certain enemy types and much
      more! This increases the total tower count to 66 and increases the available
      tactics to you!<h2 class="bb_tag">Unique Bosses</h2>As the game progresses and
      you last longer, you get introduced to new bosses. Each boss has a unique ability
      such as speed boosting, protecting, skull distracting and much more. Did we
      mention you don't just have to worry about land? There's also various types
      of air units to beat!<h2 class="bb_tag">Skill Points</h2>At the start of every
      game you get to spend a skill point on making your character unique. Every 1000
      kills you gain another point to place into movement speed, reduced reload speed,
      build cost reduction or magazine size! Build a character around your style of
      play.<h2 class="bb_tag">Achievements and Unlockables</h2>Earn experience, gain
      levels, unlock new characters, magical powers and abilities that help you defeat
      the never ending horde of enemies! Achievement progress is displayed in game
      so you can see how far off you are from unlocking the character you want.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Multiple Towers, each with 3 levels</h2>There's currently 11
      different types of tower, each with 3 levels. See the stats for every tower,
      which player owns it, what the range of the tower is and what will happen if
      you upgrade it, simply by clicking it. You can also configure shortcut keys
      to speed build, upgrade and evolve.<h2 class="bb_tag">Character Abilities</h2>Once
      unlocked through experience, you can select from various abilities that help
      aid your fight. These include slow dome, teleporter, dash, barriers, critical
      chance and a coin collector.<h2 class="bb_tag">Magical Powers</h2>Once unlocked
      through experience, you can select from various magical powers that compliment
      abilities and your character customisation. These include golem smash, ice block,
      heal base, character rage and a tower damage boost.<h2 class="bb_tag">Multiple
      Environments with Dynamic Weather</h2>Fight it out in the Forest, Desert or
      even indoors in the crypts! There's a full day and night cycle (this only affects
      the game visually), along with rain and snow - the world you're fighting in
      feels alive! There's also interactive elements such as lifts, dynamically changing
      levels and flame walls to add yet more variety.<h2 class="bb_tag">Vendor with
      a huge selection of weapons</h2>Don't like tower defence, want a hybrid strategy,
      or just simply enjoy shooting? Use your coins to buy weapons instead of towers
      and do the shooting yourself! There's a pistol, rifle, shotgun, laser, railgun,
      flame thrower and a sword to use. Lets not forget to mention the grenades, mines
      and air strikes that you can purchase!<h2 class="bb_tag">Incredible replay-ability
      and a huge range of strategies</h2>We have players who have put 100's (yes,
      100's) of hours into working out the best strategies so don't be put off if
      you don't score top 10 on your first go. AegisM is incredibly competitive with
      worldwide leaderboards. As you play more and more, you start working out what
      you need to do to survive longer. Will you build towers only or go hybrid with
      guns? Will you shoot guns only? When will you upgrade or evolve that tower?
      Will you upgrade the stats or upgrade the base level of a tower? Look at the
      average play time of our Steam reviews and you'll see what we mean!<h2 class="bb_tag">Mini
      Games</h2>There is an ever growing list of competitive mini games that range
      from shooters to maze and timed type of games. Each mini game has a competitive
      leaderboard, so you can even show the world you're the fastest builder or runner
      out there.<h2 class="bb_tag">Streamer vs Twitch mode</h2>Are you a streamer?
      Well start interacting with your viewers with the Streamer vs Twitch mode! Every
      3 minutes your chat gets to vote on what enemy they would like to send you.
      If you defeat it you score a point but if the enemy they have sent you reaches
      your base, the chat scores a point! Who will win? Please note this mode is not
      competitive but more of a fun mode for streamers.<h2 class="bb_tag">Completely
      Balanced</h2>The game has been in development for over 5.5 years with around
      150 beta testers. We have spent years perfecting the balance, how things scale
      over time and changing costs to ensure that there are no silly strategies such
      as only placing one tower or only buying one gun. You can only last so long
      with that arrow tower or rifle!
