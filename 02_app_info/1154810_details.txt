But there’s something about indie game “Going Under” that feels personal.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/video-games\/reviews\/going-under-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Washington Post<\/a><br><br>“It’s one of the most honest investigations of existential digitisation and corporate greed ever made in videogame form. It addresses the farce of employment with creativity and humour, two things no malignant narcissist with a modest cash injection could ever take from us. It also has one of the most anarchic, diverse combat systems of any roguelike, which rewards experimentation yet almost never thrusts you into runs that feel unfair due to bad weapon drops.”<br>9\/10 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.indiegamewebsite.com\/2020\/09\/22\/going-under-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Indie Game Website<\/a><br><br>“In all, Going Under is the type of game to go above and beyond in its quirky mannerisms, being unafraid to poke fun at both the real world it parodies and even itself.
