After playing it enough, I see some issues that I just cannot ignore.  \n\nFirst off, it will require you to collect special items, like 13 cheesecakes with strawberries OR 18 chests with locks.  However, it does NOT generate enough of them during the level to meet that goal.  While you can spend gold for an extra 20 moves, I do this frequently as many levels have this issue.  \n\nWith other games if you finish with moves left, it converts those moves to power-ups, and sets them all off.  Those points count toward your star points (to get three stars).  This does all of that EXCEPT none of the cascading matches from the added power-ups count towards your 3 star points.  It generates gold tiles, but you don't even get that.  In fact, not all of the power-ups are triggered!  What is the point of all of that if spending the effort to have remaining moves doesn't count for anything.\n\nIt's very tough on certain levels to get three stars because of all of this.  \n\nAlso, I don't see any responses from the Devs on the forums.\n\nIn light of all of this, I have to change my score to \"Not Recommended\" UNTIL these things are fixed.\n\n\n----- Original Review -----\nIt's an enjoyable match three game.  It uses bright colors, adorable characters, and lots of different tiles for matching.  Also, getting all three stars for a level is very challenging.\n\nWhile there is nothing new here, it will still scratch the match 3 itch.","timestamp_created":1570547230,"timestamp_updated":1570928233,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530201315879821777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4otGn4e0Cd4fh0wE="}
