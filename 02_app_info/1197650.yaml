      is a collection of bonus content for those who want to dive deeper into the
      world of Europa. Like Barotrauma, it will grow in scope during our Early Access
      period.<h2 class="bb_tag">What do I get today?</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>The
      first two available issues of &quot;The Europan&quot;, Europa's most esteemed
      and only newspaper! The editorial staff brings you the latest rumors, stories
      both hilarious and gruesome, and rare glimpses into the history of Europa.<br></li><li>The
      official Barotrauma soundtrack. Immerse yourself into the hums, clicks and foreboding
      ambient sounds of Europa's ocean. Is it just darkly reverberant electronic music,
      or is it the sounds of a deep sea creature lurking in the distance?<br></li><li>12
      wallpapers made from Barotrauma's concept art, with 3 new pieces exclusive to
      this pack.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">What will I get in the future?</h2><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>More about the history and secrets of Europa, with at least
      one further issue of &quot;The Europan&quot; planned. Look forward to peeks
      behind the scenes, exclusive snippets of lore, with knowledge and jokes in equal
      measure.<br></li><li>More music! The soundtrack will expand as the game world
      does.</li></ul><br><br><strong>Praise the Honkmother, and praise you for your
      support!</strong>
