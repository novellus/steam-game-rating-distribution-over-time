    reviews: "\u201CDespite its flaws and unpolished nature, Into the Radius is still\
      \ a good VR game worth playing if you\u2019re a fan of the setting or looking\
      \ for something dense to dig into. You can easily get upwards of 15 hours of\
      \ content out of this game and the developers seem eager to continue working\
      \ on it. Janky controls and some odd design decisions do not nullify the quality\
      \ of the setting or the game\u2019s underlying ideas. At its core, Into the\
      \ Radius is an immersive and ambitious survival shooter on the fringe of humanity\
      \ that pushes you to your limits.\u201D<br>GOOD \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://uploadvr.com/into-the-radius-review/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >UploadVR</a><br><br>\u201CInto the Radius\
      \ covers a very large open world map made up of areas that are quite different\
      \ from each others.  However, all of the areas are dangerous and a player must\
      \ proceed slowly to avoid artifacts or attracting the attention of the numerous\
      \ entities from the Radius.  Audio clues are positional and valuable and you\
      \ must pay attention to them.  The environment is well-rendered, capturing the\
      \ desolation and atmosphere of the spooky zone, and the NPC sounds are disturbing,\
      \ adding a distinct element of horror.  A player will feel the tension increase,\
      \ and a sense of dread is palpable when progressing into a dangerous area and\
      \ that is far more intense than many so-called horror games.  Into the Radius\
      \ reminds us of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. with strong feelings of dread and feelings of\
      \ extreme isolation in a deadly zone.\u201D<br>Recommended \u2013 <a href=\"\

      \ to VR veterans, who may think they\u2019ve experienced all that\u2019s to\

    review: "I first played this game with my Viveport Infinity subscription yesterday,\
      \ and immediately hopped over to Steam to purchase it. This game is pretty brilliant.\
      \ If immersion and realism is what you want, this game will give it to you.\
      \ \n\nJust be prepared to manually do everything. Its an indepth survival game.\n"
