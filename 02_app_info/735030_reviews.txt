Anyone buying should be well aware of what it is, and that what they are actually doing is supporting the developer in the (probably vain, given the months of no updates) hope for continued development.\n\nStart with the positives: this general type of thing is something I'm always glad to see (and surprised at the lack of) in VR. Abstract 'adventure game' experiences piling on interactive vignettes with more regard to conveying tone and mood than any actual narrative. Some particular little bits were cool, and I'd like to see more of them - I'd like to see more in general.\n\nNegatives: lack of clarity in what is happening. I understand 100% that is 'the point', but eg. unlabelled generic buttons with unclear effects, random props of no apparent purpose in otherwise relatively spartan scenes. There were multiple later scenes which I 'solved' by some total mystery, with the seemingly-intuitive interactions not actually working.\n\nThere is not really enough here to form any kind of recommendation, positive or negative, and so I will default to 'positive' . Anyone buying should be well aware of what it is, and that what they are actually doing is supporting the developer.\n\nConstructive criticism for the developer: disable locomotion altogether if adequate space is detected, to prevent the player messing up the alignment, and give some constant subtle indication of the play area bounds in the virtual space. Drop the weird proprietary chaperone (unless there was some point to it I missed).","timestamp_created":1544143470,"timestamp_updated":1544143470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw2++Hw+cCdtbJtAE="}
