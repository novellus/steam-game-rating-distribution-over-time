    review: 'LV99: Final Fortress is a game that can be played by beginners thanks
      to simple controls. You can use a gamepad or your keyboard. I was impressed
      by the graphics and animations. The characters are designed with a love for
      detail, which is very important to me in games. The music and sound effects
      also fit the atmosphere well. The special twist in this game is that your characters
      don''t start at level 1, but at level 99. Thus, the battles are interesting
      and exciting right from the start. All in all, LV99: Final Fortress is a great
      indie game which I would like to recommend to RPG fans wholeheartedly.'
