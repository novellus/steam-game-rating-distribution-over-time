    about_the_game: "With PT+, you have the ability to measure and record neck range\
      \ of motion. Using this data with a physical therapist, you can determine which\
      \ stretches and exercises within the app are appropriate to perform. Your therapist\
      \ can also base the need for other exercises and stretches in the clinic according\
      \ to the data collected.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are three modes within the\
      \ app:<br />\r\n&quot;Measure Range of Motion&quot; displays small tabs with\
      \ numerical values that show degrees in certain planes. You can &quot;push&quot;\
      \ each of these tabs in a single direction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe &quot;Stretches&quot;\
      \ section will show you how to stretch each muscle in your neck by directing\
      \ your center of view in a precise way. When you overlap the object in your\
      \ center of view with the duplicate object in space, PT+ will time your stretch,\
      \ then count repetitions for you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Exercises&quot; also\
      \ directs your center of view, then scores the accuracy of your motion. Use\
      \ this mode to gain control and fine-tune the movement in your cervical spine.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nPT+ utilizes your headset's sensors to monitor your neck's\
      \ movement. It is an excellent tool to be used in conjunction with physical\
      \ therapy. PT+ is to be used only with the guidance of an MD, DO, chiropractor,\
      \ or physical therapist. While range of motion exercises are widely used in\
      \ treatment of neck dysfunction, always consult the above-mentioned professionals\
      \ before using the app."
