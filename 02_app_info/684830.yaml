      notes: " The parts of the story where a character is killed or defeated is untouched,\
        \ meaning the player is at an unknown position where no one knows if the charactert\
        \ is somehow dead, fainted or just disappeared.\r\n\r\n Most similiar elements\
        \ are there to boost the player's imagination to an extent as to a point in\
        \ which one wonders if this is the dream or the dream is one?"
