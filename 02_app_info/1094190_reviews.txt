I went into this game optimistically, and this game has some good things going for it. I like the atmosphere of the festival taking place, and I thought the use of a computer interface was an interesting change of pace. Sadly, there were too many flaws to make this a satisfying experience (at least for a game sold on Steam). The control scheme is cumbersome (arrow keys to move and WASD to adjust the camera), I don't understand how this game is 3.4 GB when the art assets are so low quality, and the game ends abruptly. In terms of walking-simulators based off dreams, I think that [url=lsddev.itch.io/21-the-world]#21: The World[/url] achieves greater success. While I sadly found 故郷をさがす三姉妹 to be disappointing, I think Yorunoatochi shows great potential, and I'd like to see what they make next.","timestamp_created":1583289489,"timestamp_updated":1583289489,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550927400588989258","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45ora0fACcOz89QE="}
