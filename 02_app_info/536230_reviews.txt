(And due to the competition in the VR space now it really needs to be on sale.)\n\nThe concept, story and syle is interesting and different enough from most other tower defense games that it's worth a look for towerdefense addicts. I'm looking forward to seeing what the future brings for this game, and for future titles the devs might use this style.\n\nThe gameplay starts out really slowly though on the default difficulty. You need to be patient.\n\nIf you aren't the patient type, and aren't really into towerdefense games then you'll do better to look at other titles.","timestamp_created":1495468469,"timestamp_updated":1495468469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4sL23mNwCfN3ZeQ=="}
