A no nonsense action game.  Very immersive with sick bullet dodging. \nVisceral shooting and great sound effects.\n\nYou've got 3 different weapons on each hand. Just press the trackpad button to cycle through them.  No nonsense.\n\n The enemies look real.  I can see why they used green blood because it's almost too real. It's not bad.  You get used to it.\n\nPerfect demo game to show people new to VR.\n\nUpdate: since I play this game a lot.  The game is still awesome and not just because it's $3.  I still haven't beat it yet.  One thing is the game plays much better with a large playspace.  It's not needed,  but it's much more immersive when you can use your roomscale to get behind cover.","timestamp_created":1493567813,"timestamp_updated":1500234404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwioq8pt0CfNWEeA=="}
