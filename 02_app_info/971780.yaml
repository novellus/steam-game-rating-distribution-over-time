      [i]june 9 edit: achievements have been fixed, so edited that part of the review.[/i]


      [b]econ[/b] is the very definition of a hidden gem. I totally missed it until
      recently, but really glad I ran into it and decided to give it a shot sooner
      than some other titles.


      it''s basically a board game: [b]place squares next to each other so that their
      colors match.[/b] the more sides match up, the higher your score, but if you
      match two different colors, points are taken away. matching borders (if there''s
      a border) gives extra points, but not doing it doesn''t take any away. fill
      the board and make sure you have more points than the opponent.


      you get 2 pieces to choose from in every turn, rotate with right click, left/right
      arrows or q/e, left click or enter to select. you can continue rotating after
      selection, but only with the keys, as right mouse cancels the selection, which
      is both convenient and a bit annoying. use the mouse, arrows or wasd to move,
      hold (not just click!) the left mouse button, enter or space to place, then
      it''s the opponent''s turn. their tiles aren''t shown and you can only find
      out their score at the end of the match, and also look at a [b]handy analytical
      graph[/b] that breaks down every turn. nice touch, if probably unnecessary.


      it can be played against [b]6 levels of ai or real people online[/b]. sadly,
      it''s highly unlikely that anyone in your vicinity has even heard about the
      game, let alone plays it, but you can try going against randoms too, with about
      zero percent chance of finding anyone. besides the opponent, you can also [b]customize
      the board and choose from 5 shapes and 5 border settings[/b], and pick from
      4 different backgrounds.


      there are also [b]36 extra challenges[/b], all unlocked from the start. these
      are pre-set unique board shapes and sizes with a few new mechanics, still mostly
      against ai opponents. in [u]tug of war[/u] you don''t have to fill the board,
      just win the ''war'' with enough points. on [u]puzzle levels[/u] the goal is
      to beat a score on your own (I found these the hardest and couldn''t do all
      of them) and [u]skull levels[/u] are basically sudden death: no points, the
      first one to make a misconnection loses.


      [b]the presentation is really pleasant[/b], minimalist, yet colorful without
      going overboard, the music is fitting as well. there''s a music on/off toggle
      and a master volume setting (ideally there would be separate toggles and sliders
      for music and sound), windowed mode with a resizable window, various colorblind
      settings, some stats and in-game representation of achievements, plus a ''quick
      tips'' toggle, which doesn''t give any tips, but zooms in the board every time
      a tile is placed to focus on the points you get. definitely turn it off, everything''s
      clearly visible without it and probably should''ve been called something else.


      most settings are available while playing, but I would like one to let clicking
      place tiles (and navigate menus) instead of holding, though it''s more foolproof
      this way for sure. end-game scoring should definitely be skippable too, I know
      mine already, just show the opponent''s immediately and let''s move on.


      [b]econ is an excellent game and a steal even at full price[/b], and if you
      have others to play with, even better. rounds can take a while though, so keep
      it in mind before starting one.'
