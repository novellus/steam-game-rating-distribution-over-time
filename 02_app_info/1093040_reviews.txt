Colored LED lights that go from Red to green to purple. Its a really nice show. This pinball table also has a ton of missions that are fun and mostly on the easy side to do. I think its a much better table then Star Trek the next generation table.  I would buy this pack just for Star Trek alone. It also has voices from the movies. Just a real treat to play. \n\nFrankenstein is a good table but it yells at the player a lot. It got on my nerves after some time. Flight 2000 is an old school table its not bad but its a slower paced table. Ripleys is a solid table and well worth playing. A very interesting game. Starship Troopers looks great however the small flippers and the balls wants to drain almost on a constant basis. I owned most of these table except for Star Trek Vengeance and I feel like its a bargain. I would have spent more on that playing the real thing. This is currently on sale for $3.74 and that is a good bargain.","timestamp_created":1586920155,"timestamp_updated":1586920155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.668180704116821289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49/zzvfECds/vgAI="}
