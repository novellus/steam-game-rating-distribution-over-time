(in regards to the bot mechanics and match like structure)\nits of course not as customizable as those games in regards to mechanics like game type or even something like a weapon system.\n\nbut it is a really fun game to just jump into and start a kill streak to lead your team to victory, and the chess-like aesthetic and team roles is a fun and creative.\n\nthe game also includes a \"battle chess\" style game mode in which you play chess and when pieces meet you can go into a one on one match to try and defeat the opposing piece, which is an interesting game changer.","timestamp_created":1593446647,"timestamp_updated":1593446647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zci0gPMCdYqwkQI="}
