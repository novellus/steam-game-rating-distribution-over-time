I can't believe that something that had so much effort put into cartoon qualities is so obscure, almost a shame.\n\nBut a hidden gem it is not. More like hidden jank.\n\nYou can see people really wracking their brain of making it more like a cartoon action, so they came wiht a structure where you have a compilation of minigames and walk in 3D-like maze. The maze is played from the third person and is actually impressive for its time, I like how you can control the devil to walk around in 8 direction. But you really can't see any obstacle coming, especially with mutt's muttness blocking the view. And maze is a maze with nothing interesting going on aside from funny obstacle animations, so.\n\nAnd minigames are horrible to control, especially their nearly one button fighting. It sure is not Street Fighter 2, not even 1, more like Flash animation and it's bad and stay for too long. And if it's not fighting, then it's not terribly unique, probably more of annoying, like teleporters maze. There are very few decent minigames, as I saw in longplay video because I have too much self-respect to beat games nowadays, ho ho ho, but they aren't worth it.","timestamp_created":1604005743,"timestamp_updated":1604005743,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481348633766174316","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mamMu/UCe8H2qgI="}
