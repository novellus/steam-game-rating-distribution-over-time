Latest version 1.08A removed story mode and most characters. That sucks.\n\nUpdated review 01:\nI read about them removing Mai Shiranui DLC and it turned out to be true. What a ridiculous business. I mean it's time to move on DOA6 but the way they treat earlier version is unacceptable.","timestamp_created":1475566999,"timestamp_updated":1609756203,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534090936183929443","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/8q85vYCcavOYg=="}
