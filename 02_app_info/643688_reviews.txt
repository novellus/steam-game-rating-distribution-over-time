This rugged little workhorse comes in a lot of attrative paint schemes, both as a land plane, floatplane and amphibian. An ideal aircraft to load up your outdoor gear and to go anywhere you like, especially secluded little canadian lakes and the like.\nVirtual cockpit looks and feels authentic and the rumble of the Continental IO-520 sounds just great. \nThe airplane gets mushy on long and slow landing approaches, but just give her some gas and she pulls herself out of this. Very stable aircraft, a fine trainer for pilots who want to get in touch with taildraggers. Highly recommendable.","timestamp_created":1594727669,"timestamp_updated":1594727669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40KPLpvMCcsiblQI="}
