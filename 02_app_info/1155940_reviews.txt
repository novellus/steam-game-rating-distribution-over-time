However, while those games often involve a moving story of fictional characters, this game centers on the player and self-reflection.\n\nWhat I disliked most about it was the loss of momentum at times. I felt there was a good flow throughout the game, but it got interrupted by a few annoying sequences and unskippable repetition.\n\nWhat I liked most about it is that it gives this serious commentary about an uncomfortable yet pervasive issue, but provides it as a lighthearted exploration game so itâ€™s more easily digested.\n\nOverall a short fun adventure that makes you think.","timestamp_created":1589739187,"timestamp_updated":1589739187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s931kfICeMy4iAI="}
