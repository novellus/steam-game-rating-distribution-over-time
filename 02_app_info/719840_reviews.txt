Also the menu music is much better than the soundtrack used for the actuall gameplay.\n- The trailer for steam should definitely start with the intro animations from the game, it's setting the right mood.\n\nGood job - keep it up!","timestamp_created":1513282354,"timestamp_updated":1513282354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502186596393585205","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtYeqq+ACeLuRkgE="}
