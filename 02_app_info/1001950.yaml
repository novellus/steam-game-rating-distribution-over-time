    review: 'Quickie Review

      Game with an interesting idea, but the game is poorly optimized, causing constant
      low framerates and I swear near crashes at times. Gameplay feels really fetchquesty
      at times, and quest markers are not obvious. Plus, sidequests don''t even have
      markers at all, causing me to get lost at times when trying to not only do the
      sidequest, but also returning to the quest giver so I could finish. Also I know
      the game''s in Early Access still, but the game still feels very buggy in places
      that shouldn''t be buggy, like the tutorial which I had to skip since it didn''t
      detect me doing the tutorial. I was interested in this game, but came out pretty
      disappointed with the product I got. Maybe a future patch can fix these issues,
      but right now, I''m no longer interested'
