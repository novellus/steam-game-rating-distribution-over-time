It's a rhythm game made by people with a deep and obvious love of electronic music and the culture around it.  It plays in a unique and intuitive way that makes it simple to make some kick ass music.  Honestly, I never knew how much I needed something like this in my life.\n\nUnlike other rhythm games which rely on quick reflexes and tapping along to the beat, most of Hexagroove's gameplay centers around layering different instrumental loops.  If you're the kind of person who likes to play a game for the challenge, then it might not be for you.  Most of the fun comes from putting together the different pieces and finding a solid groove, then adjusting it and playing with it on the fly.  There's room for a lot more experimentation and playfulness than in games that emphasize skill mastery, like Beatmania or Audiosurf.  It offers some mini-games and an obligatory campaign, but you won't find anything too taxing except on the highest difficulty.  I've made my way through the whole game on each difficulty level, but most of my time is spent in free mode just jamming out.  I'd hesitate to even call Hexagroove a game.  It controls like a game, and it's got levels, achievements and tricks to perform for style points, but it plays more like an instrument, something you can play to make cool music, without any of the hassle of having to learn to beatmatch or how to use an MPC.\n\nIf you're one of the people who it appeals to, it'll leaving you wanting a whole lot more.  There are 13 tracks to play with, and while that's not too terribly many, every single one is an absolute banger that is a pitch-perfect representation of a wide range of genres.  If you enjoy electronic music, you will find some really legitimate tunes ranging from liquid drum & bass, psytrance, minimal techno and nu garage.  Seriously, the only thing I can really find to criticize about the game is that I simply want more.  More genres more producers more samples more more more.  I can't even imagine what could happen if Workshop support opened up.\n\nIf you like music games, just go ahead and give the demo a try.  If it hooks you the same way, then I guarantee that it's worth the price tag for how much you can get out of it.  You will get lost in making dope beats for hours.  There's nothing quite like it out there.","timestamp_created":1604331628,"timestamp_updated":1604331628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.710144937038421631","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3rznxPUCeqjpqwI="}
