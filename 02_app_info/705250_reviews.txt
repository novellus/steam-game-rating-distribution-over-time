Developer is too busy to fix it. I am also too busy to leave a positive review.\n\nIn all seriousness, this is a pretty good game with lots of good puzzles. \n\nThe negatives:\n- The broken puzzle. This has been mentioned numerous times, and the problem has already been solved by someone else.\n- The bright, pulsing background that can't be disabled and seriously hurts my eyes. I need to look away when it decides (randomly, I think) to do this.\n- The fact that it is impossible to eliminate candidates. The only thing this limitation accomplishes is to needlessly obscure and complicate the otherwise interesting puzzles.\n\nIf and when those 3 things are resolved, this will be a \"strongly recommended\" from me. But until then, I say give this one a pass.","timestamp_created":1585795506,"timestamp_updated":1585795506,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546218514442443848","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9eOxnPECebyh/QE="}
