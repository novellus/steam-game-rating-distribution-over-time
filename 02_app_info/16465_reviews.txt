Just as I foresaw. The time has come to awaken! To be... reborn[/h1]\n\nI usually do not cover a separate review for DLCs and expansions but I made an exception with F.E.A.R Reborn because I loved it! It’s a very fun dlc. It’s only an hour long (you could finish it in less than 45 minutes if you’re very good!) and despite the short length I’m not disappointed. I’ve enjoyed it more than the base game and it’s rare to have such great fun with expansion. Reborn has a bigger focus on action and the pacing is very fast yet doesn’t feel rushed. If you’re expecting this to be Perseus Mandate and Extraction Point like experience then you’re going to be terribly disappointed with short length and heavy focus on action.\n\nYou play as a replicant soldier this time around. Things go even wilder and supernatural in the background with an apocalyptic and destructive chaos. The story is very straightforward and very silly. It doesn’t mean the story is bad in any shape or form because it’s story surprisingly works effectively well. Minos spoilers ahead!! They brought back Paxton Fettel from the first game and yes, he is alive, reasons unknown? You’re controlled by him and your mission is simple. Set Fettel free…. that’s it! Reborn delivers a tense final battle and a true climax that will have you pining for a sequel, which is in pleasant contrast to F.E.A.R. 2's final WTF?? moment, which probably left me more confused and disappointed. With Reborn It seemed like they were trying to set a foundation for Fear 3. \n\nAlthough the developers resorted to reused assets from the main game, I expected them to just recycle the same environments and locations and the good news is that they didn’t!!  It’s not very perfect though. I’m not a hundred percent sure about this but enemy A.I seemed to be slightly toned down and acted a lot dumber. Graphics also looked worse especially in cutscenes and background. There aren’t any new enemy types so you’ll still be fighting the same Armacham’s soldiers, feral creatures, ghosts, mini bosses and assassins. Reborn lacks the tense creepy atmosphere from the Project Origins. It also doesn't provide any real creep-outs or scary scenes. \n\nIn spite of some minor setbacks, I got more than what I expected. The dlc retains the same gameplay from F.E.A.R 2 with minor touches here and there. The short story provides a more gratifying bridge to the sequel and I think that’s cool! \n\n[h1]My Rating: 8/10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1608906727,"timestamp_updated":1608906727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.680837810039520264","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45YuUzfYCdMuIvQI="}
