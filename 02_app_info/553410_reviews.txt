Your objective is to sink the ships before they made it to the end. If 20 ships reaches the end, you lose.\n\nThere are 5 buildings which you can place, but the game doesn't give an explanation about their capability. There's a crossbow tower, an antenna-light building, a hammer, cannon and a crystal. From what I gathered, the crossbow is a rapid fire tower, while the cannon is slower but is effective against larger ship. Both the laser and the crystal are more powerful, but the sharp wooden hammer inflicts the most damage.\n\nThese pirate ships come in various sizes, the bigger it is, the more attack it takes to sink. The more ships you sink, the more golds you earn. These golds are needed to upgrade existing building, or construct more building. Unfortunately, the game doesn't display how much gold is needed to upgrade the building. These buildings can be level up twice. A max level crossbow can wipe out a fleet of ships very easily, and when you have several more of these maxed level buildings, you are practically invincible. In fact in my first gameplay, I was so overwhelming powerful, I went through more than 10 waves of ships without doing anything much (the ship waves seems to stop getting more powerful after certain waves, so they got sinked almost as soon as they appear)! I ended up quitting the map to the main menu because it was going on forever, and I see that the rest of the maps are still locked.\n\nSpeaking of maps, there are only 3 playable maps, 1 of which is only playable from the start. In other words, this title is severely lacking of content too.\n\nThis game make use of content in terms of VR capability too. you can shift the map up/down left riight with the trackpad, but you can't scale nor rotate the map. The VR support brings nothing to the table for this game. The background just keep going too and it gets rather repetitve.\n\nDue to these reasons (unbalanced gameplay, repetitive, lack of contents etc) I am rather regretful to say I can't recommend this title. If you wish to see what I mean in this review, check out my gameplay video of the first map below\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Fi9T1Dj7f4I","timestamp_created":1491143315,"timestamp_updated":1491143639,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/cfFl9sCfoXxdQ=="}
