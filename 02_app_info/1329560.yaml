    about_the_game: Welcome to Lure, Survivor!<br><br>Lure is an open world multiplayer
      survival game with a zombie theme. If you will decide to play on another server,
      you won't lose your progress like in other games. You can play on any server
      in any region. Let's have a closer look at Lure.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1329560/extras/1.png?t=1609510498"

      /><br>Zombies aren't the only thing you have to fear in Lure. If you ignore
      your hunger and thirst any longer, you can die. That means you have to travel
      through cities and search for food. Try not to eat rotten food, you could get
      poisoned. When you kill zombies, animals, and enemies, you will receive experience
      points and each time your character level up, you will receive one skill point.
      You can use these skill points to improve your character in three different
      ways.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1329560/extras/2.png?t=1609510498"

      for the bank. You can keep your stuff safe. If your character dies, your items
      in the bank will not be lost, but the items you carry will be. After you have
      learned the necessary skills, you can build bases of wood and stone. And you

      pluses but firstly you need to deserve. Clans have a level system, that means

      your clan and display it in the captured areas and at the base, you have built.<br><br><img
