    review: Twin stick and tower defense elements. Too bad it starts lagging when
      5+ enemies are on screen. I have a GTX 1060 6gb that runs everything with no
      problem so it's weird that this isn't working well. Also the pause button isn't
      working for me either. It's a good try and if it worked as intended I would
      recommend it.
