Yes.  Hell, I even recommend it to newer players since it is a way easier game to get into (and I'm sure many out there know what I mean when I say \"get into\" lol) the grand strategy genre with than almost anything else out there. \n\nAt the end of the day, I'm an AGEOD fan with American Civil War 2 being 1 of their best, if not the best game that they've made.  To End All Wars is another OK one.  Haven't tried Wars of Napoleon and \"30 years war\" or something akin to that title relating to the 30 year (or thereabouts) religious/sectarian war that occurred in Europe in the 1600s.  \n\nThere's one annoying fact about AGEOD (and their publisher Slitherine) and that's the DLC.  No, they don't release a crapload of it but they overcharge for it.  \n\nTL;DR - yea, go ahead and get the game (even at full price) but try to pick up the DLC when it is at least 50% off, o and stay the frruck away from Fields of Glory 2 and the whole \"battle importing\" BS.  Its a waste of time/money.","timestamp_created":1610035957,"timestamp_updated":1610035957,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40OHn7vYCdLanwQI="}
