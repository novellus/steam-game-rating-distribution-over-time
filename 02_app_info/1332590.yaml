    review: 'I was really exited to read the sequel,but it turns out it was not what
      i expected:

      First, you are treated like a slave and there is no good dialoge option to rebel,
      this is a major flaw with the game because it really ruins the whole cyoa thing
      going on

      Second, the deaths are just everywhere, this leads to just not wanting to get
      along with anyone, and in that same note the relatonship is also really bad,
      one day you can be friends then the next one she is a bitch with you (Im talking
      with you joo)

      Third, the "Endings" just feel as ends of chapters, for example in the first
      one after the big battle with Aggy you could go to 4 separate places each with
      diferent thing to do, in this one not only its the same planet most of the time,
      it forces you to fight no matter what.

      In conclusion this is a weak game compared to the first one, i would recomend
      you playing the first one and unless they work to make this one better just
      dont buy it.'
