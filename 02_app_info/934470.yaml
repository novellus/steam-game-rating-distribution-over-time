    review: 'Absolutely horrible.


      It`s a game where you avoid the guards (peopel in black) and do the objective.
      Sounds nice, dosen`t it? But it is not.

      Let me just describe the first level:


      -Enter level

      -Greeted with bad music and horrible way of giving hints / instructions

      -Go into area

      -Grab random stuff

      -Walk past a guard

      -Enter house

      -Notice there are 2 guards running through walls

      -Hope they don`t get me

      -One gets me


      Forgot to mention, it includes what seems to be a rape scene.

      Wait till on sale for $0.49 and once it has recieved its millionth update.
