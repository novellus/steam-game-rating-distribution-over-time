You can easly go to the 100 round doing nothing having a Life Recovery disc.\nLeaderboard was a good idea but it's awfully programed. (you have to put your name in a cmd box at 2019 jesus christ) and the people who has 0 wins are in the 1st place, what kind of joke is that. And also the rewards are awfull shit that doesn't worth your time.\n\nI mean I get the idea that a dlc at this time is for some kind of crowfounding. I can even acept some hidden reason like the programers want to buy something and need the money but come on man. DO SOMETHING GOOD. \n\nBuy another dlc with your money.","timestamp_created":1555476441,"timestamp_updated":1555476441,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.713851451873779297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+tznlOoCceKwvwE="}
