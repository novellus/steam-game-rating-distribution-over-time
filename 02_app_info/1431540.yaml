      \ Tower. Construct buildings, recruit dark units and bribe them to do as you\
      \ please and attack the noble heroes around. Each hero has to be defeated, each\
      \ building has to be converted under your rule to enable the corruption to spread\

      \ a positively dark theme with a colorful pixel-art style and a load of light\

      \ by gold, rather than purchased and blindly obedient. So have enough gold in\
      \ your pocket to ensure that your units actually do what you want them to do.\
      \ Plus, some of them are really dumb, so you might need to spend a little extra\
