Below are some things that I like about it and an overall conclusion. \n\nLoco: (behaves just as the ExpertLine model from vR webpage)\n- Working PZB90 (all 3 modes) and Sifa\n- Very detailed cab, with many switchable buttons\n- Working EBula\n- Very nice exterior model\n- High quality textures\n- Great sounds\nand more...\n\nFreight Cars:\n- I haven't really tested them, but since this is a vR addon, they are probably done as good as the loco is.\n\nGenerally speaking:\nThis addon is basically the same thing you will get on virtualRailroads page, but cheaper (especially when it's on sale). Everything pointed in the \"Key Features\" list works as it should. There's nothing to complain about, really. As a person, who is interested in Germany's railway and has seen this loco in real life, I can highly recommend this addon.","timestamp_created":1583546441,"timestamp_updated":1583547368,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpOix2fACeL7C9gE="}
