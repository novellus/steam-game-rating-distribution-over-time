    review: 'This has the feeling of a mission pack which had very little effort put
      into it. With a few simple changes, it could have been so much better. It is
      not bad enough not to play, but I wished for more.


      I agree with ravenshammer that the best way to play this is to do the navigation
      as manually as possible (as the manual recommends) - getting into the spirit
      of navigation in the 1930s when there was no GPS. If you just follow the mission
      compass, this is a pretty boring mission series.


      PROS:

      The best thing about this series is it gives me a purpose for flying. Otherwise
      I have to stare at the FREE FLIGHT page trying to think up my own interesting
      flights.

      The missions all have rewards.

      Lots of flight time in the Grumman Goose which is a really cool aeroplane.

      I like Rick''s music that he plays on the flights.

      The Custom Grumman''s paintwork.


      CONS:

      There isn''t much swashbuckling adventure. Apart from missions 1, 12 and 19
      it is just flying from one large airport (i.e. long, boring taxis) to another.
      In the rest of the missions, the most adventure we see is occasional bad weather.
      Where are the water landings / takeoffs in remote places which would use the
      capabilities of the iconic Grumman Goose?

      The voice acting is desperately wooden.

      There are almost no additional scenery objects. For all but 2 missions it''s
      just stock FSX terrain and traffic.

      The missions are linear - there are no user choices or alternative outcomes.

      There is very little interaction with the treasure hunting team.

      The overall narrative is almost non-existent: the first plot development happens
      about 10 mission in.

      It''s buggy: mission 4 crashes FSX and mission 5 does not give its reward. (See
      below for fixes.)

      The missions are disjointed, jumping from one part of the world to another with
      no explanation of what happened in the gap.


      Important notes / fixes:


      Mission 1: This is easy to complete if you use the rudder to compensate for
      the asymmetric thrust generated by a single engine. However a huge caveat is
      that you simply cannot do it if Autorudder is switched on. So switch it off.
      Then be quick on the rudder and you''ll be fine.


      Mission 4: FSX usually crashes for me and others in this mission. Here''s the
      solution: delete the file DLC\343961\Missions\Treasure Hunt\Treasure Hunt 4\sound\_recorded_b9b66705-3e41-4973-8d33-76010c0e3130.wav
      under the FSX install directory. Don''t worry, you just lose one unnecessary
      line of dialogue saying "Lets get underway on our next clue!"


      Mission 5: You don''t get the reward because of a bug in the mission file. Use
      notepad to edit file DLC\343961\Missions\Treasure Hunt\Treasure Hunt 5\TreasureHunt5.xml
      and find the line that starts with "<RewardRef>". Replace the text in the braces
      with "C3891027-9D3B-468C-A7F1-D927EAAD9601".'
