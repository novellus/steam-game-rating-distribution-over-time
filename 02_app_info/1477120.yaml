    about_the_game: "&quot;A fast-paced, tough as nails first-person shooter evocative\
      \ of the direct-to-video action flicks of the 1980\u2019s, Revenger is a short,\
      \ but memorable experience about one man\u2019s hunt to rescue his daughter,\
      \ and kill everyone responsible for her kidnapping.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInfluenced\
      \ by a variety of modern games, Revenger is a small-scale UE4 project that acts\
      \ as the debut release from one-man studio Trillix34. Work your way through\
      \ a series of varied, large environments, taking out every enemy that dares\
      \ to get in between you and your daughter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRevenger is a\
      \ shooter at its core, but also carves itself into the genre slightly differently\
      \ with the main weapon - the Axe. Use this to chop, hack and lob at your enemies\
      \ like a bladed boomerang. Also available to you is an array of ranged weaponry,\
      \ from 12-gauge shotguns to sniper rifles that decimate your foes, you\u2019\
      ll surely find something here worth loving.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game features\
      \ a checkpoint mechanic to keep you engaged in the action, and you won\u2019\
      t be traipsing through the large maps looking for enemies for long as they are\
      \ chock-full of bad guys for you to put down. As you fight your way through\
      \ the campaign, you\u2019ll hear your character make badass quips, reminiscent\
      \ of games such as Duke Nukem and Rogue Warrior.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDo you have\
      \ what it takes to rescue your daughter, and slaughter her kidnappers? Find\
      \ out now.&quot;"
