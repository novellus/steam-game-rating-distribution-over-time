      It's the 1st 3D game with 360 degree camera movements among Tuomo's games. It\
      \ features a classic turn-based JRPG. It reminds us of PS1 game titles. You\

    review: So, i started with Strangers of the Power 2, went to the first one and
      than found the 3rd. It is amazing how the art has changed so much, for the better
      in my opinion from the very beginning til now. I was able to make it through
      the entire game and defeat the final boss in 4 hours. But I am following the
      creator in case he creates more works of art. Well done!
