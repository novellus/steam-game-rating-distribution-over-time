    review: 'This game was great! The art, characters, and world are fun and I liked
      the core mystery of the story. The gameplay was fluid, though I had some trouble
      being reliably good at the core mechanic, which led to some trouble with time-sensitive
      sections later in the game.


      I left it on overnight one time so my "hours played" is a bit skewed, in practice
      it probably took me about 10 hours. I went for all upgrades, but not all achievements.
      Fights against standard goons felt easy to me, but I still found a bit of a
      challenge with the bosses, and I prefer that part to be too easy rather than
      too hard. Bosses had some creative patterns and fun animations. I''d love to
      see a sequel someday!'
