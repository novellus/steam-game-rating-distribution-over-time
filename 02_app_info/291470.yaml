    review: This music pack is exceptional. A lot of it reminds me of the game series,
      Silent Hill, in the way it's presented - atmospheric and delightfully creepy.
      This has to be one of my favourite DLCs for RMVXA. If you're planning on making
      a horror game, this pack is a MUST for you. You won't regret this buy.
