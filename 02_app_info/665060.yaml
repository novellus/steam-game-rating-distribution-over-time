    short_description: Triangulate, a game that is easy to learn but hard to master.
      Stack the falling triangles to create bigger triangles of the same color making
      them disappear along with the black background. A very simple concept, but doing
      it for an entire level requires quick memory, clever strategy, and great dexterity.

    review: "No. Just no. I thought a tetrislike game with a triangle theme would\
      \ be interesting. But it is a drag, there is no way to do combos or anything.\
      \ The most interesting thing is that you can build upside-down triangles. A\
      \ single level takes forever and fixing a mistake takes ages. After you cleard\
      \ the black at the bottom, you have to build an ugly base, just to reach higher\
      \ areas. All in all, playing is very unrewarding. \n\nThe controls (xbox controller\
      \ or mouse and keyboard) are not even close to being snappy enough. It's like\
      \ the gaming equivalent to a stutter: You have to repeatedly tap a direction\
      \ to move a piece. And do you remember how you can rotate tetris pieces into\
      \ place? Not here! \nThe graphics are between bland and ugly. The presentation\
      \ is all over the place and reminds me of the 90s. Also, I found no way to increase\
      \ the teeny weeny window size. \n\nThe music is not as bad though and there\
      \ appear to be around a dozen tracks.\n\nThe \"how to play\" page leads me to\
      \ think this is a port of a mobile game. The credits say, it was a one man project\
      \ - Brian, I don't want to crush your spirits but this is not a game to be SOLD\
      \ on steam. Please, keep on learning what makes a game interesting. Take Peggle\
      \ as an example. The idea behind that game is not very hot but the presentation\
      \ makes you come back for more. \n\nI'm going for a refund."
