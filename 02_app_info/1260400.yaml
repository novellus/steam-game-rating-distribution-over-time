    about_the_game: "Challlenge Speedball is a cooperative multiplayer game based\
      \ on the paintball variation called Speedball.  <br />\r\nIn this fast paced\
      \ competition, teams of 1 to 5 players occupy a small playing field filled with\
      \ inflatable &quot;bunkers&quot;.  Each team tries to eliminate each others\
      \ players by &quot;marking&quot; them with paint until they are all eliminated.\
      \  They can also win by reaching the other team's home base.  <br />\r\nEach\
      \ game match is timed typically depending on the number of players: 2 players\
      \ play for 2 minutes, 10 players play for 10 minutes.   <br />\r\nEach team\
      \ will score 5 points through elimination of the other team's players and/or\
      \ reaching the other team's home base.  <br />\r\nEach team will score 1 point\
      \ for lasting the duration of the game without being eliminated.<br />\r\nThe\
      \ actual game of Speedball is played on a small field where communication between\
      \ team members is a vital part of winning the game.  Team members will call\
      \ out their position as well as other teams status.  Each team will develop\
      \ tactics and strategies with each member of the team having a designated position\
      \ and role to play.  For this reason we highly recommend communicating during\
      \ the game using Steam voice chat, Discord, or other means of voice communications.<br\
