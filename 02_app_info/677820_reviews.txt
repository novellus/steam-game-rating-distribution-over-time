It has a good foundation and could have been a great game. The problem is that it crashes a LOT, freeze up and all progress is lost.\nWhat makes me sad is that i believe it was abandoned some time ago, no updates or fixes for ages.\nI will not buy anymore from this dev, untill he finishes what he started, this product is at best in beta stage","timestamp_created":1590487659,"timestamp_updated":1590487659,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n/acqPICcqCwigI="}
