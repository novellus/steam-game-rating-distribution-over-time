When I first played it, the story line was short and the grind to get things unlocked was massive. I did figure it out and put in the time to get a good chunk of my farm up and running: 5 sets of plots, 3 chickens, 2 cows, fishing and gathering all unlocked. \n\nThen, they added ... multiplayer? but weird and awkward?\nThen, they added ... in-app purchases. \n\nSo cute, great potential, but an entirely one-button interface (everything you do in the game is a mouse click, this game was made for a touch screen) and so little focus on developing a story followed by asking me to spend more money on a not completed product have led me to wonder, for my first time ever on Steam, how do I ask for a refund?","timestamp_created":1609904024,"timestamp_updated":1609904024,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwnL3w6vYCcObywAI="}
