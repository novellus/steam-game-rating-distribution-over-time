And believe me, I have used most of them; 3D and 2D. The interface as well as documentation and especially support for the team has been top notch! It takes me a while to learn things but as I keep pushing I get better and this program is my gem, and reason to keep pushing. I was going to give up (as it is a hobby for me), but I am now very involved. Thank you guys for making this. Been searching for years for something that flows with my understandings!","timestamp_created":1609616435,"timestamp_updated":1609616435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ487Sn4vYCeaLqvwI="}
