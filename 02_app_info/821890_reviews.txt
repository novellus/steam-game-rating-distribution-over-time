Press the button for a 'Perfect', or be late by 0.0000001 seconds and get whittled down to an inevitable loss.  Also, the combat is very slow, making you sit there and watch your 'Star Power' bar fill up.  The amount of downtime in combat is near 70%.","timestamp_created":1605379785,"timestamp_updated":1609820465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.436507940292358398","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49tyx6PYCfZmwrgI="}
