Dev guy needs to hire a grapical designer, and probably someone else for the whole UX thing. It looks really bad and is all over the place with fonts and colors. For me the visual aspect really digs this down to a sub $1-tier (cant remember what I paid). \n\nIt's a a defense game. But not a tower defense. It's monster-clicking game in first person view but with a stuck camera. Monsters run by, you cast spells, using keys 1-4 and mouse to aim. Sometimes (once during my 15 min of play) you are forced into quick-time events where it'll literally display a few digits (1-4) on the screen and you have to press them in order. It's awkward and reeks of homebrew. The camera perspective is awkward as well.\n\nBut other than all of that it's actually not so bad. The bosses movement and such were pretty interesting at times. You can feel that the dev has tried, and someone clearly has put quite some time into making this work. It looks like it's a complete game with upgrades and stuff. If this had been on the homebrew scene (for free) when PSP was first released, I'm sure it would have been popular.\n\nBut since It's really just a monster-clicker and not at a tower defense at all the mechanics are just too dull, and it looks so bad. Gameplay wise it's not even close to interesting enough to make it into a recommendable game. \n\nSorry!","timestamp_created":1525537245,"timestamp_updated":1525537344,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550123989582061768","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoJHHmOMCf8TcnwE="}
