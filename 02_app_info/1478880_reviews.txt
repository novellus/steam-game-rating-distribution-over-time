I was most apprehensive about the movement controls as my play area is limited. I was glad to find out that you can customise the movement controls in-game, which allowed me to stand in one position & still be able to interact with all the games elements. \n\nVisually the game looks great; the colours are vibrant & sharp, there are a variety of NPC's, the overall ambience is perfect. The difficulty curve provides a tailored experience by forgiving casuals & challenging the Pro Chef's. \n\nOut of all the VR titles I've been hording these past few weeks, Sep's Diner has been an absolute steal. Whether you're chasing the nostalgia from your glory days in fast-food or want to experience the hustle of working in a kitchen, Sep's Diner is a great title to pick up!","timestamp_created":1608690190,"timestamp_updated":1608690190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw64jaxvYCf6WqvAI="}
