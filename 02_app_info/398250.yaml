    review: I wanted this game since it came out in September 2015, but I only had
      gotten it in August 2017.  I know Steam only says I've played it for .3 hours,
      but since I have a laptop, I play this game when I go on vacation, and in the
      car. I probably have 15 hours in this game, but i was offline for almost all
      on if.  This game is very fun and addicting, and I really do recommend this
      game to anyone looking for a car ride game or a casual game to play while waiting
      for friends.
