    about_the_game: When an untraceable group of elite bank robbers execute the perfect
      heist making off with millions in cash and leaving a dead bank manager in their
      wake, the FBI Agents investigating the robbery/homicide (Christopher Meloni,
      Dave Bautista and Adrian Grenier) begin to uncover signs of corruption involving
      the bank's owner (Bruce Willis) and his high power clients. As they dig deeper
      into the case, the Feds realize that things are not what they seem, and in order
      to untangle a complicated web of deception and corruption they must push themselves
      to the brink - where the lines between right and wrong are often times blurred.

    review: 'I really enjoyed Marauders, despite it''s many flaws. The plot is gold,
      but the actors deliver a stiff response that doesn''t fit the gravity of what
      their characters portray, at least not at key moments. Great actions scenes
      with a sense of gritty realism I hope I''m beginning to see a trend back to.
      Reminescent of Heat scenes. Twists offer plot spinoff opportunities, I could
      see this done as a three parter. (admit it, the studio''s are still in love
      with 3)


      I could also see a game offshoot. With VR around the corner, I would be excited
      to hear about an entire IP product for something like this, say as a hardcore
      ffafpsmmorpg, full loot sorta thing.'
