I loved homm3 and for a long time no other game in the fantasy 4x ganre came close to it until i found this game. At first glance the gameplay is nothing special but once you get the hang of it you can really appreciate how interesting the game can be. \nWhat I liked:\n- units level up and some can evolve into more powerfull units\n- interesting tactical battles: flanking, action points, etc\n- a lot of neutral enemies to fight/conqure\n- a lot of combinations between hero class and race resulting in great variety of playable fractions\nThings that could have been better:\n- leveling heroes of different classes lacks diversity, most of the skills are generic even if their names are different (they do the same).\n\nP.S. the review is about the vanilla game+ both expansions.","timestamp_created":1610101509,"timestamp_updated":1610101509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uOnh8PYCf9PAwQI="}
