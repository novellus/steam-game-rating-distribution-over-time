The movements could be smoother. The concept is really cool, especially that everything is VR and more or less buttonless - you really only control your character's directional movements. Even to switch weapons you have to use your belt. It's fun but playing with the bots gets boring fast and the online multiplayer doesn't function for me most of the time.","timestamp_created":1606791612,"timestamp_updated":1606791612,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609228518,"developer_response":"We're sorry you have ran into an issue with our matchmaking server.
