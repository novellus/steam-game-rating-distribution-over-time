      sisters at odds over what to do with a pecan grove they have inherited following
      their mother's death. Wanda wants to keep the land in the family while Sarah,
      who is hiding a devastating secret, wants desperately to sell. They are startled
      to discover an elderly woman, Lilly (Della Reese), living on the property, and
      claiming it as her own. Against her mother's wishes, Sarah's rebellious teenage
      daughter, Gina (Anna Chlumsky), befriends the delusional Lilly, who mistakes

      story, and becomes determined to find her long-lost son.
