    about_the_game: "<strong>Smugglers 5 </strong> is the fifth installment in the\
      \ <strong>turn-based </strong> single-player space trading game series. Will\
      \ you be a greedy trader, an ambitious fleet pilot or a ruthless pirate? Board\
      \ enemy ships, manage factories, conquer star systems and forge your own galactic\
      \ empire - ultimately, your actions will have an impact on a galactic scale.<br><br>This\
      \ <strong>downloadable content (DLC)</strong> is <strong>a compilation of background\
      \ stories</strong> for the indie game &quot;Smugglers 5: Secession&quot; and\
      \ is named after the first of the three stories. Upon installation, the player\
      \ can choose to play one of three short but dynamic and multiple-pathed background\
      \ stories, which will lead the player through the game.<br><br>The first story,\
      \ <strong>&quot;The Smugglers Guild&quot;</strong>, starts with the retirement\
      \ of your trader father through ill health. There's no money in being an honest\
      \ trader these days. Smuggling contraband is a risky business, but the rewards\
      \ are great - especially for those lucky or connected enough to join the exclusive\
      \ Smugglers Guild. &quot;The Smugglers Guild&quot; is playable with &quot;Smugglers\
      \ 5: Secession&quot; and &quot;Smugglers 5: Invasion&quot;.<br><br>The second\
      \ story, <strong>&quot;Thirst For Vengeance&quot;</strong>, recalls the pirate\
      \ raiders that killed your parents and kidnapped your sister when you were a\

      \ has finally come to seek your revenge.<br><br>In the final story, <strong>&quot;Solomon\xB4\
      s Treasure&quot;</strong>, your father dedicated his life to finding the hidden\
      \ treasure of Solomon McTavish, legendary pirate, and died without success.\
      \ Perhaps you can do better - but you are not the only one seeking this vast\
      \ fortune."
