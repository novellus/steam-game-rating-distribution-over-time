      /><br><br><strong>Dashing Fire</strong> is a fast-paced, challenging roguelike!<br>Every
      area is randomly generated, filled to the brim with unique tiny planets riddled
      with juicy creatures of all shapes and sizes!<br><br>You must DASH between these
      small worlds, diving into fiery hot flames and blasting your way upwards through
      monsters and clouds, treasure, and ashes! Master the mechanics rather than the
      levels, since these change with every new playthrough, providing a fresh adventure
      each time.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240130/extras/5.png?t=1605178926"
      /><br><br>Over 10+ challenging bosses, 40+ unique and squishy creatures, 10+
      powers to upgrade your fiery hero, and 5 drastically different areas. Discover
      and learn all you can about this universe so that you may bring balance to it.<br><br><img
      src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240130/extras/1.png?t=1605178926"
      /><br><br>It's designed as a &quot;pick up and play&quot; experience. With minimalist,
      engaging gameplay - you can jump in for just a couple minutes, or immerse yourself
      for hours as you attempt to beat the many challenges on your journey.<br><br><img

      /><br><br>Enjoy epic, colorful, heart-pounding soundtracks by Dave Allen while
      you try and become the next Sun. <br><br>The entire world of Dashing Fire, from
      art and story to gameplay was created by Noa Calice, creator of Blackthornprod,
      a popular game development Youtube channel!
