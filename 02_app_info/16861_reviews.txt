While the map is a good look-alike of Asia, you can pretty much find the same using the Steam Workshop.\n\n[h1]Long review[/h1]\n\nThis map is exclusively available in Large size. It is in fact a relatively good representation of Asia. I played it once and didn't detect any critical issues. The problem with this type of DLC is that it should've been in the base game or included with a free update. This map \"pack\" includes work that a modder performs for free on the Steam Workshop, sometimes better than the developers themselves. I got it in a bundle alongside Civilization V but why would you pay for something that you can find for free? If you desperately want to play in Asia, head to the Steam Workshop and you'll find your happiness.","timestamp_created":1605619538,"timestamp_updated":1605633935,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46bDP6/UCf+/3rgI="}
