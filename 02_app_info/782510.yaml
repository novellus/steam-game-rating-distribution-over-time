    review: There are a lot of improvements that could be made (option to decline
      penalties, seeing the final play of the quarter, fixing the glitch where if
      you defer to the second half you get the ball instead of kicking off at the
      beginning of each half) but for what I'm looking for (stats and game management)
      it's the best I've found.
