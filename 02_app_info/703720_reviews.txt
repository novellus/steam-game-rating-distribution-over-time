Design wise there's a lot here, especially at first glance. So far I haven't seen any repeated bosses and the levels have required unique combinations of inputs to overcome new challenges each time. Unfortunately I won't be playing more because this game is far too difficult for me to want to put significant time investment in. And it would be *significant* time investment to properly master this game. So... cautious recommendation to anyone who loves playing ridiculously hard rhythm games or platformers, but it's not for me.","timestamp_created":1581362942,"timestamp_updated":1581362942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg/KkmPACd4G68QE="}
