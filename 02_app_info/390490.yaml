    review: '[h1]Nice read outside the game[/h1]


      This DLC basically gives you a PDF which roughly goes over the story as it''s
      played out in the  game itself. I actually enjoyed this better than the full
      game (no offense intended) simply because it left a lot more open to your own
      imagination. Which I think helped the story a bit more.


      Next to the (brief!) story you''ll also get to see several pictures which have
      been used in the game. Which is where a fair warning is in order: I strongly
      suggest you only read this [u]after[/u] you''ve finished the game, otherwise
      you''ll have a few spoilers to deal with which can ruin some of the surprises.


      But yeah, I think this is a good addition to the game and it can help relive
      some of the moments from within the game.'
