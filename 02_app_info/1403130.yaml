    about_the_game: "This game is a mash-up of pixel art made by at least 14 different\
      \ artists. As the development of the game continues we hope to feature art from\
      \ a few dozen different artists. I feel this is a good way to showcase a lot\
      \ of different artists and support the indie community.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nIn this melee fighter, the game generates different waves every time\
      \ and each run will be different from the last.  You will be trying to survive\
      \ waves of increasingly difficult enemies while leveling up your skills and\
      \ making your character stronger.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Arcade Mode\
      \ you will start with every skill unlocked. Punch, Kick, Sword, and Double Jump.\
      \ You will also be able to continue when you die. This is a good way to learn\
      \ how each enemy attacks since every enemy will attack differently. <br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nIn Survival Mode you will start with only the ability to punch and\
      \ block. When you defeat an enemy you will gain XP. When you level up your HP\
      \ will be replenished and you will receive 2 skill points that you can spend\
      \ to unlock new attacks and increase attack damage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nEvery other time you level up your max HP will be increased. This will allow\
      \ you to play a little more aggressively if you choose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThings you can unlock:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n    Punch Combo\
      \ - Instead of only punching once, you can time your punch and punch again after\
      \ ( or button mash ).<br />\r\n    Kick - Allows you to kick and execute a kick\
      \ from a punch or sword attack if pressed at the correct time.<br />\r\n   \
      \ Sword - The sword is a slower attack that does more damage, you can execute\
      \ a punch or kick from the sword attack if the timing is right.<br />\r\n  \
      \  Double Jump - Allows you to double jump.<br />\r\n    Gravity - Decrease\
      \ gravity, allowing you to jump higher and get on those pesky platforms.<br\
      \ />\r\n    Critical Chance - Increase your ability to land a critical hit in\
      \ combat.<br />\r\n    Critical Damage - Increases your critical hit damage."

    review: A pretty fun small indie action game. The mixing of different art from
      multiple artists is unique and I like it. Looking forward to see more content
      added to the game throughout early access!
