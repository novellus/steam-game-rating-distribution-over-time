    review: "33 games and 2 PDF files are what you got from this game pack.  And I\
      \ can't believe that there are 28 games that come with source code now!!!\n\n\
      **** There are source code in both \"game\" and \"source code\" folder.  Almost\
      \ all the games have source code now ****\n\nWhen I opened some game projects\
      \ from IDE there is no files there because the project files  (.agk) are missing.\
      \  You have all the source files (.agc) but no project file (.agk).  That's\
      \ not too hard to fix. Just create new project in the game folder and all the\
      \ source files will be added to the project.\n\nMost games use two deprecated\
      \ functions: LoadMusic and PlayMusic.  You need to search and replace them with\
      \ LoadMusicOgg and PlayMusicOgg. Then go to media folder and convert mp3 files\
