You need the base game of course and you even enter this digital trips like the others - a NPC vendor in the campaign (both Aiden and T-Bone, however the outfit unlocks only for Aiden). It is the weakest of the digital trips. Whether you love or hate some of them all of the others are at least interesting but this one seemed kind of bland. The idea isn't bad, you profile people in an area to search which are cyborgs. Ideally, after you find them all you should shoot them in the weakspot(s) which only show after profiled. Optionally, you can just kill the first one and then most of the others will go after you. But 16 levels is rather short, especially once you get the shotgun in the skill tree. With it, profiling is optional and it is hard to actually lose a level. Best way to get this DLC is through the Watch Dogs Complete bundle. It is part of the Season Pass too. But separately, I do not recommend it. \n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] To activate the Conpiracy DLC install it on Steam and then launch the game while having uPlay on. It should ask you if you want to add it to your uPlay account and then confirm once you are in the game.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this DLC review you can find more in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1588698652,"timestamp_updated":1588698652,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.619660854339599609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1rP08vECeo/lhQI="}
