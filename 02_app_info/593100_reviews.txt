I'm not a fan of this genre of games, but I can say that it has this riddle that I want to solve.\n\nThe game has very cool quest mechanics for a musician and an IT specialist. It lacks responsiveness, but overall it was enjoyable to play.\n\nThe locations in the game are a bit dead, but quite realistic, I especially liked the maze with a love theme. The game itself is a maze, you can feel it, finding places with quests is not so easy.\n\nThe game has great music, there is nothing to add.\n\nI have not seen a puzzle game like this before, and I can recommend it because there is something to puzzle over.","timestamp_created":1609686418,"timestamp_updated":1609686418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpbCy5PYCeIyMwAI="}
