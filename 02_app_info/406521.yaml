    review: 'If you liked the art of the game, this is a must have, cyberpunk tropes
      go down in my book as a win always. I''m a sucker for that shit. I had the pleasure
      of meeting some of the people that worked on the game at Magfest a couple years
      back, knew I was going to enjoy it then and there. Must have.

      Classic Vaporwave sunset to start us off with, followed by the MOST IMPORTANT
      PAGE: ALL OF TURING''S EMOTICONS. The only sad part is that the shirts and posters
      are all sold out at this point, but god they ooze so much fucking style it''s
      incredible. I cannot wait for the next game.'
