      \ political prisoner of no particular value. An immigrant who never found her\
      \ roots in a city of immigrants. A chainsmoker whose favorite pastime is staring\
      \ blankly at the streets through the windows of a fast food joint at 4AM. The\
      \ sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach tells you that you\u2019re doomed,\
      \ and distorted voices from the shadows seem to agree. The curse of your clan\
      \ makes interacting with everyday technology difficult. Dissociation is your\
      \ natural state. <br><br>But when New York\u2019s Anarch leader meets a gruesome\
      \ end, out of all the bloodsuckers in the metropolis, you\u2019re the one picked\
      \ to investigate. Make no mistake: this is obviously a trap, yet another move\
      \ in the horrible game of Jyhad, the eternal struggle for power between warring\
      \ vampire generations. But you\u2019re Lasombra, and if there\u2019s one thing\

      \ you, they\u2019re going to deeply regret it.<br><br><strong>Vampire: The Masquerade\
      \ \u2013 Shadows of New York</strong> is a visual novel set in the rich universe\
      \ of Vampire: The Masquerade. It acts as a stand-alone expansion and a companion\
      \ piece to our previous title, Coteries of New York. While Coteries was a general\
      \ introduction to the world depicted in the 5th Edition of the hit tabletop\
      \ role-playing game, Shadows presents a more personal and unique tale.<br><br><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A visual novel tackling themes of personal and political\
      \ horror, suitable for both Vampire: The Masquerade veterans, and fans of narrative-driven\
      \ games who are newcomers to the setting.<br></li><li>A stand-alone expansion\
      \ to Coteries of New York. See the familiar metropolis through entirely different\

      \ the paths you take.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">If it\u2019s called Vampire:\
      \ The Masquerade, does that mean you have something in common with World of\
      \ Darkness, Bloodlines 2, Redemption, the cult tabletop RPG system, or...?</h2>Yes.\
      \ Shadows of New York is set in the same shared universe, but offers stand-alone\
      \ experiences and stories. You may spot some connections with the other titles,\
      \ but Shadows is not a sequel to any existing products. The World of Darkness\
      \ is a media franchise and shared universe, shaped by various creators and participants,\
      \ meaning: all stand-alone stories play into a greater whole. Berlin falling\
      \ to the Anarchs during an official LARP, the Lasombra clan joining forces with\
      \ the Camarilla in the Vampire: The Masquerade - Chicago By Night 5th Edition\
      \ sourcebook, Sophie Langley\u2019s plot to take control of New York in Coteries\
      \ of New York \u2013 all of these events subtly influence and interact with\
      \ each other.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Do I need to play Coteries of New York to\
      \ understand and enjoy the story of Shadows of New York?</h2><br>Not at all.\
      \ Shadows of New York is a stand-alone expansion to Coteries of New York, which\
      \ means it shares the New York City setting and a large part of the supporting\
      \ cast with our previous title, but is designed to offer a different experience.\
      \ Coteries served as an introduction to the basics of Vampire: The Masquerade\
      \ 5th Edition \u2013 it was focused on showcasing different vampire Clans and\
      \ core concepts of the setting through the point of view of a newly-fledged\
      \ vampire, a character who did have a defined backstory, but by and large meant\
      \ to serve as a player avatar. <br><br>Shadows of New York is a more personal\
      \ story, told from the perspective of a well-defined character who\u2019s already\
      \ integrated into the Kindred society and has a developed inner monologue of\
      \ her own (which means you influence her personality instead of shaping it).\
      \ Those who are familiar with Coteries will already know a large part of the\
      \ cast and catch some references that would otherwise go unnoticed, but those\
      \ who decide to start with Shadows and get back to Coteries later should be\
      \ able to enjoy both experiences just as much as they would if they played them\
      \ in their release order. The two stories are essentially separate, different\
      \ both tonally and thematically.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Which platforms will Shadows\
      \ of New York be available on? Will there be a simultaneous release date?</h2>Shadows\
      \ of New York will launch simultaneously on PC (Windows/Mac OS/Linux), PS4,\
      \ Xbox One and Nintendo Switch in 2020.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Does the game support\
      \ controllers?</h2><br>Yes. You\u2019ll be able to play both with mouse and\
      \ keyboard, as well as with a controller."
