I have 3 RTS games in VR including this one and although it's not my favourite (Brass Tactics in case you were wondering) it is definitely a close second. \n\nThe visuals have a bit of a Command & Conquer vibe and the ability to control the Airmech to switch from RTS to action gameplay is a really cool feature. I'm sure that RTS purists will probably say that the game lacks the deep strategy of pancake RTS games, but for me this is just right. Think of it as Arcade Strategy and you won't be disappointed.\n\n","timestamp_created":1599556666,"timestamp_updated":1599556666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqbjAtvQCeuLEoAI="}
