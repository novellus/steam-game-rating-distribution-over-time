Ayyye (read below)\n\nOn the ground, this airport makes me wet. (If I was of the female gender of course) \n\nHOWEVER\n \nThis airport kills frames quicker than RAID kills bugs. \n\nI have a fairly decent computer. i7 CPU, and GTX 970 GPU alone with 16GB of Ram on top of the 4GB of memory on my GPU. \n\nI never go below 25 FPS. (Thankfully the human eye doesn't see things as choppy unless it's below 24 FPS) \nBut.... I dance a fine line below 30 FPS that makes this airport barely flyable. However, like my highschool grades, I'm okay with barely getting by. (Sad  but true) \n\nI can enjoy flying in and out of this airport for some touch-n-go fun. Aside from that....The fact that it looks nice is the only thing it really has going for it...That and the fact that it's modelled after the real KSBA.\n\nBuy it if you are willing to put up with lower frame rates, worth it.\n If you wan't smooth AF frames and ultimate awesomeness, not your airport. Your best bet is to find FSX:SE airport add-ons directly from the websites of the talented people who make them. (Not that it didn't take talented people to make this, but at an average FPS rate at around 25...what?)\n\nThis add-on is only worth it if you are willing to lower your standards on what you expect out of games in terms of FPS.","timestamp_created":1499823104,"timestamp_updated":1499823104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgIybmt0CdLPWfw=="}
