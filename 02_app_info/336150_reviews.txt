I've set up some shots on my real table and them set them up in practice mode in VP4. The results, including spin, are very accurate. Use practice mode for learning pattern play and spin.\n\nBut, in the competitive games (hustler or pro careers), it's almost impossible to aim accurately. Much harder than on a real pool table.
