    review: I played this game and honestly it was such an enjoyable experience, the
      game is still in development so I can't wait to see the new levels to be updated
      with. Always been a fan of puzzle games so if you like puzzle games as well
      that can challenge you but also maintain a relaxing atmosphere then Iconic would
      be a good choice. For the price its worth it in my opinion.
