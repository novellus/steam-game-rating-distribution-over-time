    review: 1984 Rewired is a Fun game at a reasonable price. It seems pretty polished,
      but I have found some visual bugs when playing. Keep in mind at the time of
      me writing this review it is still in early access. I've sunk 3 hours into this
      game on the first day of buying it  before i got burnt out and needed a break.
      Overall, I would recommend buying it if you are looking for a fast paced high
      energy game with a unique look. This game is also perfect for speedrunning or
      to have in the background of a commentary YouTube video.
