Some levels are boring, some are fun, panda costumes are quite cute. \nGame itself is not very long (~3-4 hours for 100% achievements) however it's price is so low, so it worth every penny.\nNot \"must play / extraordinary gameplay\" game but relax and easy game for couple hours.","timestamp_created":1608930229,"timestamp_updated":1608930229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.564610004425048828","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sN/tzfYCceOVvQI="}
