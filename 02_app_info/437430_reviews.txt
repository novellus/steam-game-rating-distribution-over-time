It is everywhere…\n\nPlease note that this Review may contain spoilers from the Base game \n\nSome key points that this game add on has to offer:\n\n1.\tNew Map Theme; Deserts\n2.\tNew Enemy Types\n3.\tNew Building\n\nReplayability:\n\nSand of the Damned adds onto the base game; It expands it by adding a new map type to be chosen. It shares the same replay value as the base game.\n\nMGR Gaming’s Conclusions:\n\nThe first DLC is here. And with it comes a new map type. Deserts, a brand new map type that you can choose to play on. The new map type is the full package, it is very decently designed to represent actual Desert like behaviour.\nIt is dry and dangerous and surviving in these harsh conditions is quite the challenge. The one thing that a desert is, is dry! So farming is quite difficult, but not impossible, with this new DLC comes a brand new building that allows you to irrigate the lands and make surviving a tad easier!\n\nThis is a Tiny DLC that doesn’t add much more to the game except for the new map type. Playing on this new map does add some new challenges to the game which are new and fun.\nUnfortunately, with this DLC there seems to be no update or improvements to the game itself. Just like the base game itself, the fun stops a few hours in.\n\nScore 6\nBy: MGRza \nDate: 11 February 2016\n\nAdditional Info:\n\nPlatforms: PC: Linux: Mac: PlayStation 4: Steam OS\nGenre: City Builder: Fantasy: Indie: Mythology: Management: Simulation: Strategy\nCensor Rating: n/a\nAge Rating: n/a\nDeveloper: Funatics Software\nPublisher: Daedalic Entertainment\nRelease Date: 8 February 2016 \n\nMGR Gaming Steam Curator:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/32364038/\nMGR Gaming:\nhttps://www.mgrgaming.co.za","timestamp_created":1595596895,"timestamp_updated":1595596895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sY6/wPMCf+WilwI="}
