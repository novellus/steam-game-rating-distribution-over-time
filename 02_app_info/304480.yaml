    short_description: Betrayal Mode lets you completely reverse the usual game flow,
      working as a full planetary power trying to destroy your foes, not unite them.
      Invasion Mode sees you working with the other races to survive slaughter by
      a grave new threat. Plus new ships, abilities, music, and more!
