    review: Bought this to support the low, low price on my favorite anime.  Special
      forces camaraderie, near-future sci-fi setting, great character development,
      thought-provoking moral commentary, comic relief in the form of the Tachikomas,
      and very subtle animation.  This is the smart series you've been fruitlessly
      searching for in seasonal anime.
