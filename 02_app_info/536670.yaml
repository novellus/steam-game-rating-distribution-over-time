      \ be displayed. You will have to avoid pedestrians, cars and obstacles in order\
      \ to not fail the level. In the top-left corner, the distance from the target\

    review: This game is very fun.  What I like most is that you drive your car without
      any pressure, trying to collect the items while avoiding the obstacles. It runs
      great on Linux, too!
