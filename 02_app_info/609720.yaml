    review: "first up, i played only the \"new\" version i don't know about the problems\
      \ with the old one\nGeneral:\ni like the mega man games and i love northern\
      \ mythology, so why don't give this a shot?\ni fell in love after the demo,\
      \ smooth gameplay and demanding lvl design, story is some kind of okay but not\
      \ my focus anyways,\nit's more the world setting which fascinate me.\nu have\
      \ 60 minutes to beat 6 stages and 6 bosses, hardly anyone will do that in their\
      \ first attempt.\nu can after u finished a stage go back and replay it to spare\
      \ some time even when the timer counts 0\nFor every defeated boss, you get a\
      \ power cell that you can use to improve your abilities\nAfter u beat the game\
      \ u unlock the boss rush mode where u can beat all bosses again in a row.\n\n\
      LVL design:\npretty demanding especially in u first run, but very satisfying\
      \ if you know the surroundings and starting to speed it up.\nespecially niffelsm\xB4\
      s Lab and the last one is the pain in the ass and i was starting to hate these\
      \ while im playing it but after i had done it i directly replayed it to beat\
      \ my time.\n\nBoss design:\nthe boss rng feel unfair sometimes but never impossible.\n\
      there are some classic bosses and some with great new ideas like nidhogg\n\n\
      Music:\nmost of the time a well fitting music\n\nConclusion:\na little short\
      \ but ok for the price\ni love it, i ll play it again 10/10\n\nfor those who\
      \ are interested in a demanding platformer!"
