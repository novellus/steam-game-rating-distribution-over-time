There are seven standard puzzles and an eighth bonus puzzle that you can find (which was a pretty cool feature). The puzzles are available in different sizes: 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, and 9x9.\n\nI really enjoy the hand-drawn images and the story they tell. The pictures are animated rather than still. Though I like the idea of animation (and really enjoyed it in the first collection of slide puzzles, [i]Slide Stories: Neko's Journey[/i]) I did find the animation to be a bit too much: it felt like each image was persistently [i]shaking[/i] and I often found myself feeling rather nauseated. That was really unfortunate. I would suggest, in this case, to have an option to freeze the animation. Maybe in future collections revert back to the fewer animations from the other collection.\n\nThe music is really relaxing. It's a soft and soothing melody, and perfectly complements the story being told. I wouldn't mind a few more tracks (it's one single tune that repeats and is used for all puzzles as well as the main screen). It is nice as it is, but variety is good, too.\n\nSome of the great features that are included in the [i]Slide Stories[/i] series are the options to number your puzzle pieces and looking at the completed picture. Numbering the pieces is really handy on the high piece counts where it's hard to distinguish differences between similar looking pieces: the numbers set you straight as to the order they need to be placed in. The option to look at the completed image is handy if you want a simple reference to look at as you work to complete the image.\n\nOverall, I think it's a fun game. If you like slider puzzles, I think you will enjoy this set. The images are lovely and the story is very moving. It's well done (despite my slight dislike of the over-animation). I recommend this puzzle set, and look forward to seeing more in the future!","timestamp_created":1609810561,"timestamp_updated":1609811940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqpqR6PYCcuLIwAI="}
