The teaser movie of this game is funnier than the game itself. \nGreat idea but clearly not finished yet.\nThe bow (shooting birds) is not working well. Arrows will not always be placed well on the string of the bow. Throwing axes towards walking skeletons:an impossible task.\nNo one was online so a multiplayer or Lan game was not possible.\n\nHope there will be artificial opponents to be added to the game so you can dual without the multiplayer or Lan option.","timestamp_created":1495306491,"timestamp_updated":1495350845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ45OP2lNwCf4DIeQ=="}
