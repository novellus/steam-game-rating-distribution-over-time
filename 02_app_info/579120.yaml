    review: '2.5D adventure

      great music, graphics and character profiles

      a 3D model with a pixel art texture attached, but the scenery is beautiful

      sci-fi, suspense, human drama

      the game progresses by investigating something and using items

      this game has early access but no noticeable bugs, but some things can''t be
      investigated when trying to play in other languages'
