    about_the_game: "With the struggle between order and chaos quelled by saviours\
      \ from beyond, the realm was destined to fade from existence. Instead, an arcane\
      \ power has breathed new life into it\u2014bestowing these decaying remains\
      \ with purpose once more. The fight has begun anew, and the world is your arena.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nOver twenty-four of FINAL FANTASY's most recognisable faces\
      \ have assembled to take part in interdimensional fisticuffs. Face off against\
      \ other teams in action-packed, three-on-three melees that require sense as\
      \ well as strength to win. Each combatant can be one of four types: vanguard,\
      \ assassin, marksman, or specialist; play off your allies' fighting styles,\
      \ master the bravery system, and emerge triumphant from the clash of steel and\
      \ sorcery!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to standard battles, there will be\
      \ skirmishes that employ special rulesets, along with cutscenes that tell the\
      \ story of this reborn world, the gods that rule it, and the warriors who fight\
      \ for it."

    review: " (skip to the bottom of this wall of text if you wanna see my final results,\
      \ and personal note to skip the wall of text) ((for those who dont wanna read\
      \ my personal opinion and just wanna see what I rated it))\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
      \ Okay. So i'm going to make this quick. \nThe multiplayer: I played this game\
      \ with a few friends, with and against and I gotta say. it's frustratingly fun.\
      \ It's a great multiplayer game. Against A.I. with a friend of mine (who was\
      \ new to the series) also found it fun. The frustrating part is that sometimes\
      \ the A.I. seems to either give up or go all out. But I had a blast playing\
      \ it either way. \n\n  The versions: \n F2P: you only get 4 or 5 playable characters\
      \ \"I don't remember\" and can only do gauntlet mode, or online. The characters\
      \ are: Shantotto, cloud, jecht, and someone else (idr who). But try it on f2p\
      \ with friends first.\n\n Paid: You get the base characters only. I dont remember\
      \ who is all in the base version. You also unlock the story and you're able\
      \ to get treasures to get random items from the store. if you get the season\
      \ pass, it gives you a most of the characters that arent in the base paid version,\
      \ and the rest of them like zenos, Ardyn, Gabranth are separate. All of the\
      \ characters are like 5$ or 6$ I dont really remember. (could check. but too\
      \ lazy too meh).\n\n The story: very bland, boring, and frustrating as hell.\
      \ Theres only a few parts where I have found it fun. To progress you gotta play\
      \ online to get levels, or just do offline. (I have just got the right amount\
      \ to beat the story and will when I get back from work, may update it idk).\
      \ It just failed in my eyes. should have been the same premise. Like as in the\
      \ first 2 you got gear, leveled up, and actually gave more of a reason to play\
      \ and use gil instead of using it for music or player icons.\n\n The gameplay/graphics:\
      \ Looks gorgeous, and gameplay feels really clunky and frustrating when stuff\
      \ just doesnt work, and you get 3 people on you at once. Yeah no, should atleast\
      \ have 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3. The story mode only has 2v2 in it and it is a BLAST.\
      \ Just 3v3 just has too much chaos. I think that everyone needs to be incapacitated\
      \ to lose so you still have a chance to win a 2v1.\n\n The summons: \"A HUGE\
      \ dissapointment but still a spectacle\". I was hoping they'd have more than\
      \ just a hand select few. I hate the cutscenes and love them they're so cool\
      \ to see, and still awe inducing after hours of gameplay and seeing them thousands\
      \ of times. But multiple times in a play session gets really meh to frustrating\
      \ FAST. Should allow to turn them off or add a skip summon cutscene in the lobby\
      \ options. \n\n  My total rating of this game:\n Music: 9/10 (coulda had more\
      \ songs from the older dissida games sadly.)\n\n Multiplayer: 7.5/10 (very fun\
      \ with a buddy to play with or against. A.i. still has some bs methods to it.\
      \ \n\n Solo: 4.5/10 (very boring, gauntlet has a difficulty system that goes\
      \ bronze to ultima bots level with you)\n \n summons: 6/10 (looks good, and\
      \ the summon fights suck)\n \n Story: 2/10 (very stupid method to progress.\
      \ Just an arcade game with story tacked on)\n \n Graphics: 10/10 (for the time)\n\
      \ \n Grindy-ness: 1/10. (very boring and too much padding to keep people interested)\n\
      \n Final result: Needed to have Final fantasy elements, like a full on RPG game\
      \ to satisfy fans' needs. Let's just hope for a dissida 4 and they go through\
      \ with these graphics \"if not better\" and plays and has a system like dissida:\
      \ doudecim. \n\n  (I know you peeps probably don't care bout my personal review.\
      \ But I just wanna let you know I love the dissidia series and simply end with\
      \ this game. Sad thing is I think it's just a test for graphics than gameplay.\
      \ It was a graphics first gameplay second game sadly. Fingers crossed they use\
      \ these models if they ever make a new dissida. I really think the concept of\
      \ the  characters, that replace cosmos and chaos they're cool I guess. Overall\
      \ the game's still a blast to play, try gauntlet on f2p to learn and because\
      \ online is pretty much dead. REASON WHY I RECCOMEND. ||MULTIPLAYER|| ||MUSIC||\
      \ ||GOOD GRAPHICS||)"
