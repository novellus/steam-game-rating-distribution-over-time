Even the most ferocious players will be challenged, as success in the lower leagues is rewarded by promotion - like the sixth grade student entering junior high, you will suddenly find yourself thrashed around by the vastly superior physical skills of your opponents.  Demotion, likewise, isn't too bad because you get the chance to dominate back in the minors and earn valuable experience.  Only the supreme focus and discipline of a ninja will allow you to eventually overcome your rival players, who possess blazing speed and will violently check you literally across the arena.  Having won the Canvas Hockey League Elite championship, I can now die in peace knowing that I have accomplished something truly great.\n\nCanvas Hockey emphasizes entertaining gameplay over glitzy graphics - its hand-drawn style and tasteful, folksy music add an endearing atmosphere to the whole affair.  Loading speeds are extremely quick.\n\nI bought this game as a boy.  I completed it a man.  For the low price, you have nothing to lose and immortality to gain.","timestamp_created":1606277676,"timestamp_updated":1606277676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvofn/vUCfdmtsAI="}
