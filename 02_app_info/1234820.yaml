    review: 'I had high hopes for this game, looking at the screenshots and the description
      on the store page. It reminded me a lot of the old school Apogee platformers
      like Commander Keen and Crystal Caves which I loved playing in the nineties.
      I struggled with it for about forty minutes, and while I do think it has a lot
      of potential, I must unfortunately give it a negative review, based on the small
      part of it that I was actually able to experience.


      - Jump controls are floaty and imprecise. I never felt like I had tight control
      over when my dwarf would jump, and where he would land.


      - The dwarf does not automatically grab onto ropes and ladders when he jumps
      toward them. Instead you must press the "up" key at exactly the right moment
      to make him grab them, otherwise he just falls straight down (usually landing
      on spikes or some other hazard). This makes it very difficult to complete stages
      where you must jump from one rope to another.


      - There is a single "attack" key that is used both for attacking monsters, and
      for breaking blocks. Unfortunately it is difficult to control the direction
      of the attack; the dwarf would often accidentally break the blocks underneath
      him (and fall into a death trap below) rather than attacking the monster next
      to him as I intended.


      - There are monsters that fly across the screen, and can pass through walls
      and floors to get to you. While it is sometimes possible to kill these monsters
      (if you can line up the attack correctly), there are often several of them coming
      at you from different directions, which makes it impossible to explore the map
      at a reasonable pace.


      - There are places where the dwarf gets stuck, and stops responding to the movement
      keys. I cannot tell whether this is a bug, or an intentional hazard to be avoided,
      but either way once you get stuck it means inevitable death once the flying
      monsters catch up to you.


      As bad as all of that is, I could have dealt with it, if not for the absolute
      worst problem:


      - There are no checkpoints in the game, as far as I can tell. If you die, you
      get teleported back to the very beginning of the level, and everything is reset:
      all of the gates you had opened are closed again, and you have to restart from
      scratch, replaying the same parts over and over. This is really bad, especially
      in a game where most of the fun comes from exploring the huge, maze-like levels,
      but you never even get to see most of it.


      I don''t know whether the developers intended for the player to have to complete
      an entire level without dying, but given the size of the levels, the poor controls,
      and the large number of hazards and monsters, I think it would be nearly impossible
      for all but the most hardcore players to get even halfway through the first
      level. At least, I do not have the patience for it, which is why I refunded
      the game. If the problems I have outlined in this review ever get fixed, I might
      consider buying it again.'
