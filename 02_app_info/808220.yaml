    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Welcome to the SCP-087 VR Survivor.</h2> This
      is a small indie survival rogue-like horror game based on the SCP foundation
      lore. My name is AlexTheCreator and I am the author of this game. I'm gonna
      quickly explain o you quickly what this is game about.<br><br>The original SCP-087
      story is based on an infinite stairwell. If you are SCP-fan like me, you might
      remember the first SCP-087 game which was just basically a walking simulator.
      It was unique when it first released, however it isn't that much now. Nowadays
      you can't just enjoy a game where you walk down some stairs while getting scared
      by simplest jumpscares. Even in VR... Trust me, I made the first version of
      this game just like I've described above. Nothing special, very simple and not
      entertaining at all. So I havedecided to turn the tables!<br><br>SCP-087 can
      have a huge effect on the subject's mind... So now you are one of the SCP Scientists
      which, for unknown reasons, had gotten inside SCP-087. You start off by regaining
      consciousness and see different corridors in front of you. The setting is like
      a basement. You recall that something similar was written in one of the classified
      documents on SCP-087, and you understand that there is no other solution for
      you than begin looking for a way out. SCP-087 is afraid of light and noise,
      that's why you'll have to collect all the objects that can make noise, help
      craft torches, repair lamps and prevent SCP-087-01 from getting you. Your goal
      is to survive in a procedurally generated world filled with danger and loneliness.<h2

    review: When I first got this game, I was excited to follow it through like many
      other titles I get early access for, or even earlier. Sadly, that excitement
      was very short lived. I came into this game with very minor expectations with
      very little content, which is what I received. I was more than okay with that
      though, because I knew how early it was in development, and that it was going
      to continue to get updates. The game slowly got less and less support, until
      none at all. The discord became quieter and quieter from the creator, until
      completely silent by him and everyone else. This was the type of vr game I really
      wanted, and was looking forward to watching it grow, but instead, I was forced
      to watch it die. Do not buy it and do not support it. This game hasn't had support
      for more than a year. The last message from the creator was on 8/11/2019. I
      wish the supporters weren't fed false hope, and I hope that maybe one day this
      game will get support again. Until then, don't even bother.
