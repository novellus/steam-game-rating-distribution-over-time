      /><br><br>All the villages have stories about the town or its inhabitants. Stories
      about ghosts, haunted houses, crimes,... Stories of implausible things that
      an acquaintance claims to have lived, but no one has ever seen. However, what
      happens here is manifested on a daily basis. Those bloody footprints with deformed
      nails appear without warning and drive the animals crazy. Recently several horses
      ran amok and appeared in the vicinity of the forest open in channel. The viscera
      was intact but all the bones were missing, I don't know what kind of creature
      can do this with such precision.  <br><br>Horror Globes is a short first-person
      horror adventure with special attention to spatial sound and atmospheric Halloween.
      It belongs to a collection of short horror stories contained in collectible
      snow globes. Do you dare to disturb your nightmares? <br><br>Immerse yourself
      into the atmosphere of this story as you explore an old property set apart during
      the night of Halloween. <br><br>Join Allan, an 8-year-old boy who wanders from
      door to door asking for tricks or treats. Taking advantage of an oversight,
      he sneaks onto an old lady's property to look for her secret homemade candies.
      Soon he will discover some macabre events that will be repeated in his head
      forever.

    review: "A must for Halloween night..fits perfectly! \nCheap price for what it\
      \ offers you! Small length horror game, it would take you about an hour and\
      \ a half to finish, but if you're going for the freakin Candie achievement gonna\
      \ take you much more time (and still to this day i'm out of luck to find the\
      \ last goddamn candie lol)! \nIs very tricky cause it's dark and you have to\
      \ look everywhere with the flashlight. \nThe puzzles in the game are not to\
      \ difficult if you're pay attention. The map is not too big. You can see it\
      \ every time you feel you lost the trail, but soon you'll memorize it. Everytime\
      \ you feel the witch is near..you'll need to close the flashlight, stay still\
      \ and always crouching. You'll see her patroling the forest in spiderwalk stance\
      \ everytime you're outside. \nGet the treats and find about the missing kids!\
      \ \nA nice one if you want to spend some relaxing hour :)\n\nP.S At last i found\
      \ the last damned candie :P"
