You literally can't beat the price. I got like 8 hours of entertainment for a single dollar. This game and the base game is like $3 combined and you can get endless hours out of it. The puzzles are very challenging and the new mechanics are really fun. Definitely worth it the price if you enjoyed the original game.","timestamp_created":1606777473,"timestamp_updated":1606789142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw35KGjvYCd6SOtgI="}
