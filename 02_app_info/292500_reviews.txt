You can tell that the guy who created Cave Story is behind it with the art style in question, but it never hits the same level of charm or story that that game did. It's originally an IOS game that feels more at home here, with simple controls but solid gameplay that relies on good level design and basic weaponry to propel it forward. What it doesn't have is anything that hits you in the mouth, aka the knockout punch to really sell the game, as it's solid in most aspects, but not great in any one either. Some elements have problems with boss fights that let down and an overall sense of having played the game before, but for a title to pick up on sale, it will bring back some memories of Cave Story while you play through it, and it is enjoyable. Just don't expect Cave Story 2.\n\n[b] Gameplay Footage and Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0zlBJWN3Xw[/b]\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Strong level design adds to the game's variety over time and helps the simple mechanics succeed thanks to enemy placement and rearranging of hazards.\n[*] Simple straight forward gameplay that feels polished, and doesn't go overboard in any one way. Feels like most pieces fit together with no issues. \n[*] Difficulty curve is solid as there's a solid progression of it throughout the game, never having large gaps or peaks of difficulty, but a solid rise of it. \n[*] Controls feel at home here as opposed to the iOS.\n[*] Gun variety is simple but rewards smart use of each gun type and different gameplay styles. \n[*] You'll get some nostalgia for those who played Cave Story by the feel of the game.\n[*] Jumping takes a bit to get used to for some of the more tricky jumps, but it does settle down once you get an understanding of what the game is going for.\n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Some boss fights miss badly being basically regular enemies with nothing really new to show for it.\n[*] Audio options missing, and screen resolution options are really non existant. Even for a mobile port, it doesn't really do a good job of playing to the Steam strengths.\n[*] Some jumps go for the extreme limit of jump height, leading no room for error, and frustration sets in.\n[*] Those Expecting Cave Story 2 in terms of charm and story will need to look away, as it never hits that level.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.
