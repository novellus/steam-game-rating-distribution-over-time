    review: "The story is interesting because of mixing spirit world mythology with\
      \ technology. Quite an interesting match that really holds. The game itself\
      \ is more of a book. Generally you read. There are some choices and they are\
      \ meaningful ones but they are really rare in comparison to the development\
      \ of the story. I think the use of communication technologies as a way to create\
      \ narration through spekaing in chat in this visual novel was a good idea. It\
      \ gave at start necessary ignition for the story to unravel. After that there\
      \ were many unnecessary repetitions of the same phrases and questions. It made\
      \ just the novel more lenghty. \n\nAs to the philosophical themes - they are\
      \ basic. It is not a critique, rather a statement because I have decided to\
      \ play this game mostly because I am interested in the relation between different\
      \ worlds mediated through technology and searching different media to check\
      \ how this problem is addressed. So although there are no new ideas here I found\
      \ the world convincing and interesting when it comes to showing different aspects\
      \ of technology. There is potential here so extenting the ontology of this world\
      \ would be interesting as a subject. The ideas are basic but there are so much\
      \ ways they could be extented! As as story it was nice. I haven't got new ideas\
      \ concerning subjects that I am interested in but it was a good effort on the\
      \ writer to try to create convincing relations between the worlds without being\
      \ to rationalistic on one hand and on the other to dependant on fantasy cliches.\
      \ Good basic philosophical themes (of course from my perspective). Many questions\
      \ were unanswered like for example what happens to the bodies of people (I won't\
      \ say more to not spoil the plot or at least one of possible plots). The novel\
      \ has it's emotional moments but mostly it was done through rational discussion!\
      \ I really liked it. Even if that for some people could be considered boring,\
      \ for me personally was a quite interesting way in incorporating arguments.\
      \ Generally, people in \"Reality\" are communicating by giving reasons for their\
      \ decisions, behaviors and they are thinking. So if somone is looking for a\
      \ tearjerker then it's not the right place. It had interesting feel because\
      \ all of the characters were really concious about themselves and this made\
      \ the repetetiveness of some of the material more endurable. \n\nAlthough I\
      \ haven't checked all the endings I would say that the story revolves around\
      \ 0 and 1 choices. It is not niuanced but this is good. You choose to this or\
      \ that. The game is very straightforward in that regard. And they are relatively\
      \ rare. You read, read and read. The animations are rare too - rather few images\
      \ portraying different emotions and some animations that are placed in key moments\
      \ of the plot but generally they are rare. So generally if you are not concerned\
      \ that much with moving pictures, animations and could accept the slow pace\
      \ of the plot here, then the game is worth the try. \n\nI would seriously consider\
      \ a continuation if some in-world issues were extended, especially the relation\
      \ between different worlds and some other things that I won't spoil."
