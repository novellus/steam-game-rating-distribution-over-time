Good \n\nAs for my personal preferences.\n\nEdit:\nThis game is cool, and its got great visuals, but I don't agree with the devil may cry aspect as I don't see anything that really relates to the game apart for the fact that you have extremely limited aerial combat and that you are playing as a demon. The stamina system feels like a very counter productive implementation if you are taking inspiration from DMC, hence where i guess the \"Souls like\" mechanics come in. I think this game is fine and has great potential but its just not for me and doesn't satisfy that in depth combat that i am looking for.","timestamp_created":1609087363,"timestamp_updated":1609195282,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5evg1fYCcMbnvQI="}
