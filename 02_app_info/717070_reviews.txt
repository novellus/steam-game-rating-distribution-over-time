When your firing system gets its wires crossed with your thrusters, you're in for a bumpy ride! Have I mentioned wave after wave of alien ships, all intent on your destruction?  \n\nI needed a game that I could play quickly, and I found this retro arcade homage to Asteroids on a Steam sale. I've definitely been loving it!\n\nPros\n* This game is hard - probably difficult enough to keep interest for those who like a challenge.\n* \"No stress\" mode with infinite lives, if that floats your boat.\n* Fun retro graphics and sounds.\n* Just what I wanted for a 10 minute shmup session.\n\nCons\n* This game is hard - maybe not the best for those easily frustrated.\n* \"Stress free\" mode doesn't clear the screen of enemies when you re-spawn, so you can be repeatedly killed by the same evil ships. Keep firing, you can (eventually) get past it.\n* The thinnest of plots - but that's not the point anyway.\n\nThere are Steam leader boards for regular mode. I'm currently #16 in the world, which at my age and playing with a mouse instead of a controller means that there aren't nearly enough people who know about R-COIL.","timestamp_created":1592107407,"timestamp_updated":1593630204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhuTwhfMCdIn1jQI="}
