    review: 'So reading the reviews for the game as well as the Discussions Thread...
      this is what I''m making out....


      back in 2019, the developer announced through their Discord channel that they
      were not making money from the game and hadn''t for 6+ months.  So the developer
      pulled any further development of the game from that point on.  Funny thing
      is, the whistle-blower was actually a player who brought this news to light....
      the developer clearly did not post anything regarding this "important" bit of
      news to anyone.


      So the game is definitely abandoned.   You have a bit to do in it, but really,
      perhaps a few hours at best...  Give it a big swerve.'
