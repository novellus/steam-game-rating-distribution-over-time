If you are a simple casual player, you can probably beat this too. The ranks (bronze, silver, and gold) are actually the difficulty, not something for time based. But even the hardest difficulty doesnt feel THAT difficult to me. Its still a fair challenge nonetheless and the design is pretty good.\n\nOn the plus note, it supports workshop in case if you feel to try out other people's creation.","timestamp_created":1568759007,"timestamp_updated":1568759007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48djUoO0Ccpm20gE="}
