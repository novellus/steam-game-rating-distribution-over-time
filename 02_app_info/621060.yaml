      own PC building and repair business. From your own cozy workshop, you must use
      all your technical skills to complete the various jobs that come your way.<br>Customers

      /><br>PC Building Simulator will allow you to experiment with a large selection
      of accurately modelled, fully licensed parts from your favourite real-world
      manufacturers.<br>If money was no object, what would you build?<br><br>Build
      your PC from the case up with your favourite parts and express your building
      flair by choosing your favourite LED and cabling colors to really make it stand
      out. Choose from a range of air and water cooling solutions to keep it cool
      or even go all out with fully customizable water cooling loops! Once your rig
      is ready to go, turn it on and see how it benchmarks. Not happy with the results?
      Jump into the bios and try your hand at overclocking to see if you can get better

    review: it is good if you want to learn how to build a pc in real life or if you
      want to learn how pc works it is really helpful because I wanted to build a
      pc but I just did not want to watch a video of how to build a pc so I found
      this game and it helped me a lot about computers I really think you should buy
      this game.
