When I buy a route then I buy it for the route alone, not for the locomotives or assets included. I do have my own Pro version trains and so have many others as well. I must say that the route and scenery is very well done, as a huge collector of Railworks routes and assets, from Steam and all other third party Devs I must rate this route far above 80 to 90% of the available routes out there. I love the distant scenery in this route, I can see how every detail was done to perfection and distant scenery is mostly absent in many routes, this route is standing out far above the most. I don't want to offend someone but this route surely does not deserve the rubbish status as in the reviews here, I am actually upset because it almost caused me not to buy this route but I took a chance and must say that reviews like rubbish status keep people from buying a very good route. There is not a boring moment and I like this route a lot. I almost missed a very good route. My rating for this route 9.8 out of 10. Well done JT, you dis a great job !","timestamp_created":1607885796,"timestamp_updated":1607886031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558823525905609131","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ibnervYCc6T1uQI="}
