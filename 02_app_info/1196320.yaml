      the god of the sun has deemed it time to relinquish his throne. In order to
      choose his replacement, he casts out Blood Scrolls all over the earth to a few
      chosen warriors. Upon receiving the Scrolls written in blood, each fighter regains
      memories of their past lives as shamans, warlords, and sacred monks, gaining
      long lost abilities including plasma manipulation and even levitation. In order
      to choose a replacement, each warrior must meet each other and conduct a battle
      of wits, strengths, and integrity to find the soul worthy of the throne. Some
      strive for a world of peace and harmony for all, while others relish in the
      pain of their enemies, thriving on war and negative energy. Choose your warrior
      and fight for your vision as you receive your Blood Scroll!

    review: "EDIT: polished the review a bit.\n\ni actually enjoyed writing this review.\n\
      \nif i'm to be honest, then i would admit that i'm stuck between recommending\
      \ and not recommending this game. because why buy this game when you can play\
      \ a similar game that plays exactly the same way as this plus it's free. but\
      \ this game does have a few qualities that surpass its predecessor.\n\nafter\
      \ years of waiting for news about his next mini warriors game, i checked his\
      \ gamejolt page one more time, only to find out that the dev released a game\
      \ on steam. this actually surprised me\n\nprice was previously over 300 Gs (where\
      \ im from) but then dev reduced it to 40. which is great because this game is\
      \ nowhere near worth over 300 Gs.\n\nalthough this game looks like a reskin\
      \ of his previous title, dragon ball z mini warriors which can be found on gamejolt\
      \ for free, it's got its differences.\n\n[b]praises:[/b]\n\n- great music\n\
      - great pixel art\n- a few other healthy balance changes (like the increased\
      \ healthbar)\n\n[b]bads:[/b]\n\n- plays literally exactly the same as dbz mini\
      \ warriors, nothing new to the gameplay was added\n\n- artwork not so good;\
      \ can absolutely be improved upon\n\n- the controls section only show what button\
      \ does what for a controller, not for a keyboard.\n\n- game doesn't tell you\
      \ how to win clashes\n\n- no way to know what player 2's controls are \n\n-\
      \ clashes still require you to mash to win\n\n- the windows key is the pause\
      \ button. WHY?\n\n[b]in what ways does blood scrolls surpasses dbz mini warriors?[/b]\n\
      \n- actually tells you how to use beams, grabs, and parries\n\n- superior music\n\
      \n- characters have a lot more health now, meaning matches dont end as quickly\n\
      \nthe game is slower paced but that was probably a design choice. and the A.I\
      \ is easy even on normal, and only becomes a challenge if you select the hard\
      \ or above difficulties.\n\n\nif i had bought this while it was still set at\
      \ over 300 Gs, i would refund the game. but because it costed a mere 40 Gs and\
      \ i dont see this purchase as a complete waste, i will be keeping this game\
      \ in my library.\n\nif you like the characters, music, and stages, then this\
      \ is probably for you. unless you prefer the version of the game that has dragon\
      \ ball z characters.\n\ndev is working on a sequel to dbz mini warriors on gamejolt\
      \ called dragon ball super mini warriors. it would be awesome if he were to\
      \ actually add new gameplay mechanics to the new game. and i hope he makes parries\
      \ actual parries in his new game. arent parries all about predicting when your\
      \ opponent will attack, and then timing it juuust right and hit them with a\
      \ parry? parries should last only for an instant. it would increase the skill\
      \ ceiling of his next game, which would be a pleasant change."
