    review: "The DLC includes 7 Tracks, which I recommend buying if you liked the\
      \ in-game music or just love game OST. \nIn my case, I am both therefore I enjoyed\
      \ the soundtrack very much. For me at least, it is worth the 2$ so if you liked\
      \ the game and want to support the creators, go ahead.\n\nYou should know I'm\
      \ fool for soundtracks in general and really appreciate Game developers who\
      \ care about soundtrack in their games and even more, those who add it as DLC\
      \ so - a big shout-out to the devs, if you're reading this."
