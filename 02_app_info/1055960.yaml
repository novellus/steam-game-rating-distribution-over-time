    about_the_game: A personal tragedy forces Oni to push beyond the borders of her
      village, in search of an unspeakable horror. As she assembles the pieces of
      an ancient magical contract, Oni leaves a bloody trail behind her, careening
      towards darkness, death, and worse.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1055960/extras/pain.gif?t=1590716693"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Pain</h2>Thistledown is a small, personal story set in
      an epic fantasy world. It's a meditation on the pain and helplessness that we
      feel in the face of tragedy, and how we cope.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1055960/extras/story.gif?t=1590716693"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>Stories help us navigate our lives, stories move
      us, and make us better. Thistledown is a great story, told with deep respect.<br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">World</h2>We sought to make a world that felt real and
      bigger than the story itself, so we put in major work building the world of
      Thistledown, only 10% of which will be in the game. We made a world that feels
      like you are only glimpsing a bit of it, because you are. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1055960/extras/character.gif?t=1590716693"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Characters</h2>You'll encounter sad, real stories as you
      explore the world. Characters are well-developed, varied, and real.<h2 class="bb_tag">Story
      Only Mode</h2>I believe everyone should be able to experience the story, so
      I've included a &quot;Story Only&quot; mode, which skips challenging platforming
      and all combat. Players of all skill levels can experience what Thistledown
      has to offer, without the need to reach a certain skill level.<br><br><br><strong><h2
      class="bb_tag">GAMEPLAY</h2></strong><br><br>Thistledown is mechanically light,
      but I've worked to make the gameplay as satisfying as possible.<h2 class="bb_tag">Fight</h2><img
