      \ /><br><br>HALLOWEEN\xAE is a Chapter for Dead by Daylight, where you\u2019\
      ll witness the purest form of evil. Where pain is the beginning and death is\
      \ the end. You\u2019ll get to meet Michael Myers himself. Together with Laurie\
      \ Strode, you\u2019ll either fight for survival or slaughter in their old hometown,\
      \ Haddonfield.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The masks we wear...</strong></h2><br>A\
      \ white mask that stalks the night. A simple babysitter who wouldn\u2019t hurt\
      \ a fly, a town that felt safe as they went to sleep with unlocked doors. Whatever\
      \ happened that dark Halloween Night?<br><br>HALLOWEEN\xAE is a Chapter for\
      \ Dead by Daylight and it includes a new Killer, a Survivor and a Map.<br><br><img\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A familiar face</h2>We all hide behind masks. Some\
      \ more than others, and for Michael Myers, this is more true than ever. If there\
      \ is any humanity left inside him, it is hidden behind his mask. All his screaming\
      \ victims see are lifeless eyes as he robs them of their lives.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Obsessive behaviour</h2>Michael Myers is a disturbed being with a mind\
      \ only focused one thing, killing. He is beyond help, and the only thing that\
      \ can sooth his mind - for a while - is to kill. His power is called EVIL WITHIN,\
      \ and as he stalks his prey, he starts to obsess, thus tagging a Survivor as\
      \ an Obsession. This in turn, changes the chances of survival radically.<br><br><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/530711/extras/p3-killer-perks.jpg?t=1541602376\"\
      \ /><br><br>Michael Myers also comes with 3 new Perks, all based around Obsession.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Save the best for last</h2> \u2013 As Obsessions stays alive,\
      \ cooldown of missed and successful attacks are decreased.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Dying Light</h2> \u2013 The Obsession\u2019s\u2019 speed for altruistic actions\
      \ - such as healing and rescuing - is increased. But once killed, there\u2019\
      s a penalty to repairing, healing and sabotage for other Survivors.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Play with your food</h2> \u2013 As you let your Obsession escape after\
      \ a chase, your movement speed is increased.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/530711/extras/p4-survivor.jpg?t=1541602376\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The babysitter</strong></h2>Laurie Strode\u2019\
      s suburban way of life was simple, even boring from time to time. Sunday night\
      \ dinners. Game shows on TV. She filled her days with school, earning a few\
      \ bucks babysitting the neighbor's kids and seeing friends. Her life and name\
      \ would never had made the headlines or earned it\u2019s spot in the town\u2019\
      s history, if it weren\u2019t for that one fateful night.<br>\u2003<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Escape - again and again.</h2>Laurie has done this before. Escaping\
      \ and surviving, over and over again. Her perks are focused around becoming\
      \ the Killer\u2019s Obsessions. Laurie is a survivor by heart and will never\
      \ give up.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/530711/extras/p5-survivor-perks.jpg?t=1541602376\"\
      \ /><br><br>Laurie Strode comes with <strong>3 new Perks</strong>, emphasizing\
      \ on <strong>Obsession</strong> and survival.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Last Survivor</h2>\
      \ \u2013 Your chances of survival increases as other Survivors die - disrupting\
      \ the Killer\u2019s aura reading ability.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Decisive Strike</h2>\
      \ \u2013 As a last way of escaping the Killer\u2019s grasp, Laurie takes a stab\
      \ at the Killer.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Object of Obsession</h2> \u2013 If you\u2019\
      re the Killer\u2019s Obsession, you are able to see the Killer\u2019s own aura.\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>You are now entering Haddonfield</strong></h2>Nobody\
      \ would ever suspect that a place like Haddonfield could shape the terror that\
      \ is Michael Myers. It\u2019s a calm place, a secluded place, a place where\
      \ you can take a midnight stroll with your dog and never think twice about what\u2019\
      s hiding in the dark.<br><br>But that Haddonfield is no more. Instead a new\
      \ place has formed after the events. A place where people make sure that their\
      \ door is locked. A place where you might see a neighbor, just gazing out in\
      \ the dark, as they thought they saw someone\u2026<br><br><strong>Welcome home,\
      \ Laurie!</strong><br>Haddonfield is a brand new map for DEAD BY DAYLIGHT.<br><br>Echoes\
      \ of children\u2019s laughter and carolers can still be heard as you enter Haddonfield.\
      \ Houses, streets, rusty bikes and driveways fuse together with the dark night\
      \ and create a realm of fear and horror. But don\u2019t be fooled by the town\u2019\
      s calm facade. Instead, be alert and aware of Haddonfield\u2019s dark past.\
      \ As you\u2019re now part of it."
