    about_the_game: Wakamarina Valley, New Zealand is a short exploration/photography
      experience set near Queen Charlotte Sound on New Zealand's South Island. Use
      the game's camera to observe and interact with the world around you while exploring
      and completing photo-related objectives. The game has in important focus on
      immersion and not holding your hand, your attentiveness and eagerness to explore
      will be rewarded with access to hidden areas and new features. The game also
      includes an immersive curated soundtrack, This is definitley one for turning
      down the lights and wearing headphones.<br><br>This project started out as a
      showcase of my work in environment design, I wanted to create a realistic, densely
      forested scene using photoscanned 3d assets that could run smoothly in real-time.
      The environment was created in Unreal Engine 4 with heavy reference to photos
      taken at the location, You'll encounter rocky riverbeds, dense forest paths,
      vast farmland and distant hills, a lot of which resemble the appearance of the
      real valley in NZ. As I spent more time on this I began to build on some camera
      mechanics I thought added a unique/personal level of interactivity to the experience.
      I hope the atmosphere and ambience created by the environment will keep you
      coming back when you're stressed.<br><br>Some Extra Reccomendations:<br>- Personalise
      the soundtrack! Feel free to pause the in-game music and play your own in the
      background.<br>- The VR version is a great way to be immersed in the world but
      I'd still recommend the desktop version as the best way to experience the game.<br>-
      Please try to avoid looking for online guides if you're feeling impatient. Often
      what you're looking for will only take a few extra minutes to discover.<br><br>Thanks
      so much for your support! I'll be in the discussions section as much as possible
      to listen to feedback and talk about potential new features.<br>- Matt<br><br>Try

    review: It's cool for a little walkabout. I just wanted to know what it was like
      to step foot in a sane country that understands how to deal with pandemics.
