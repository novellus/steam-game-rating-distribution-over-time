    short_description: Akane discovers recipes from her late mother, and a flood of
      beautiful memories return, all attached to her cooking. After Kasumi falls ill
      the next day, Akane is motivated to do more for the family. Unfortunately, her
      abilities as a chef fall far short of her abilities as a martial artist.
