    review: "I really didnt want to write a bad review, but I have to put the facts\
      \ out there so less people do the same mistake and waste their money on this\
      \ product. For starters let me tell you - this game is  one big mess, feels\
      \ unfinished, has barely working features which I will gladly describe beacuse\
      \ they have been source of many frustrations, where I kept playing because it\
      \ became a challenge to keep going, not for its difficulty, but for its incompetence\
      \ unfortunately.\n\n1. Game is littered with bugs: You wanna inifinitely fall\
      \ thru the floor on random places - check (where surfaces should be playable\
      \ but they are nor rendered as they should) where only way to end that torture\
      \ is quiting the game where we come to next problem.\n\n2. Random Checkpoints\
      \ - now this is super weird. Normally games load your last checkpoint as you\
      \ fail, die...whatever. But here, it kinda random, here if you die you might\
      \ be teleported to a mile away from place that suppose to be last checkpoint\
      \ (and you can see saving in progress), seems game doesnt load your last checkpoint\
      \ but the one that is closest to that place by some imaginary air line distance.\
      \ So if map is U shaped and you die near the end you will be reloaded at the\
      \ beggining of the level. With worse jimping mechanics known to man this is\
      \ another issue, you will start pulling your hair out - doing same thing over\
      \ and over again, and to top that up with timing sections - be prepared to get\
      \ some gray hair as you play this.\n\n3. Random deaths with almost full health:\
      \ You have 5 increments of health bar, game over as you lose all 5 of them.\
      \ BUt still I cant even count how many times I got game over with 3/5 health\
      \ for instance...you never know when your game will end cause well game can\
      \ decide to off you eventough you are healthy AI individual :P.\n\n4. THE WORST\
      \ JUMPING MECHANICS - this takes the cake. And I'm not exagerating, this game\
      \ has the very worst jumping mechanics and jumping detection known to a man,\
      \ in any game in any universe. Its incredible, I just cant believe this is put\
      \ on sale, itc completely broken, as everything in this game is random, you\
      \ never get the feeling when to jump, it has some lag to boot making it painful\
      \ experience. Platforms that change their height as you jump on them are the\
      \ worst, they just didnt programed it right, left to small time buffer...and\
      \ successfully clearing them as obstacles for any progress becomes game of big\
      \ numbers, you will die and die and die until game decides ok we had enough\
      \ now randomly you will be able to clear them, its crazy. With high density\
      \ of invisible walls in this game - you might get PTSD for real.\n\n5. Terrible\
      \ landing detection - as with jumping per se, landing is also an issue, if you\
      \ drop from height more that 1.5 m you will lose health, it might sound like\
      \ - sweet they made this game realistic. No they did not, this is not a feature,\
      \ this is badly programed game. Its again - random, so you will just sigh as\
      \ it happens, and will happen in most unexpected places and you will wonder\
      \ - WHY did I lose health again for no apparent reason.\n\n6. ISSUES with levels\
      \ programing: On second to last level things get crazy. Whoever made this game\
      \ had it in his head what you should do to progress. You are progressing thru\
      \ the level and you see - things are getting weird. PArt of levels you finished\
      \ get reseted. You are thinking to yourself, it must be that random loading\
      \ issues. But nooooo, you see you can finish a level in only one way, by steps\
      \ followed to a tee. Otherwise level will go in broken game state. And the worst\
      \ thing is you cant see it happening, leading to frustration. Not to spoil anything,\
      \ lets just say again - you will go crazy most likely as I did and lose few\
      \ hours just to obseve what kind of foolishnes is going on. It just goes to\
      \ show this game is one hell of a ride. And not for the right reasons.\n\n7.\
      \ Absolutely atrocious LAG between your input and action on screen, where I\
      \ was wondering is my gamepad broken or what, tried 2 of them, its the same.\
      \ Lag is 1+ seconds long, and it totally ruins your rythm where it is needed.\
      \ Feels like you are giving commands to some future action, forget about immediate\
      \ response. Your thumb will get sore, cause its only natural to try and provoke\
      \ something on screen, and you are trying pressing harder by logic where action\
      \ will be completed on time. I have never seen anything like it.\n\n8. Broken\
      \ achievement/s? Glitch prone collectible: For all the achievement hunters out\
      \ there, one achievement is broken for sure. Tested it to no end, and it just\
      \ doesnt trigger. Other issue related to them, or if you want to collect Totems\
      \ - other than acievement you gain nothing, is their tendency to bug out. On\
      \ Swamp level, IF you die only once that totem will for no apparent reason disappear\
      \ - making you not be able to collect them all and for another chance at it,\
      \ you will have to replay THE WHOLE GAME. Die again on second try - replay the\
      \ game again, and so on. With worse gameplay mechanics on the market you can\
      \ only imagine how tedious it becomes. If you want to avoid replaying this \"\
      masterpiece\" be prepared to backtrack after 2 hits, fails (dropping in watter,\
      \ falling from 1,5 meter or above, getting hit by obstacles with atrocious hit\
      \ detection et cetera) to beggining of the level - to collect respawning health\
      \ item there, and that is many feets away...plus games \"feature\" to kill you\
      \ off with 3 health increments - just reminding myself now...I get terrible\
      \ flashbacks XD.\n\nI wount even go into lack of voices in game, meaningless\
      \ interactions with AI, no connection with game world (you never know what is\
      \ going on, why am I doing all this things, for whom the bells tolls..., music\
      \ that cuts itself on randokm places like a broken radio, no environment sounds.\
      \ Enemies itself, with one exemption are total lackeys...you dont even have\
      \ to fight them most of the times, and when you do, its mash mash buttons and\
      \ after 3 hits they are dead - it feels they are just waiting there to get offed\
      \ not even trying to attack you on later levels (like fish enemies). \n\nI just\
      \ cannot recommend this game. If jumping, landing mechanic was competent and\
      \ they fixed input lag then maybe this game would have some kind of value. But\
      \ all things considered it just doesnt. Forget about fun here, this is more\
      \ or less a pain simulator, and Im 100 % sure there are more fun ways to hurt\
      \ yourself if that is your kind of thing. Dont be fooled by screenshots, I wouldnt\
      \ call them a ruse to gain some money, I still dont want to believe someone\
      \ made this on purpuse THIS BADLY...Just avoid it if you expect some nice Zelda\
      \ clone, this is not it, this is a torture device for all of your senses.\n\n\
      PS. I tried giving this game a chance few more times, and came to conlusion\
      \ this game is ABOMINATION of SUPREME ORDER. Come to think of it, it would be\
      \ better that I gave those 2,5 E to someone who actually needed it, not to this\
      \ people that made this manure. Hope you are having fun with that 1 E you maybe\
      \ got from Valve at the end. Now I have to go delete this product from my list\
      \ and put it on Hidden - fur immer, so I can forget about this mistake and 6\
      \ hours of terrible experience which I hope will soon forget, playing something\
