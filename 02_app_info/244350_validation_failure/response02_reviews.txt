Funny reading it now a year and a half later.\nMy language was a bit harsh, but I still agree with most of what I said.\nThe Russians are OP as hell, tanks and planes.\nThe Americans are just crap, tanks and planes.\nEveryone else is pretty much balanced.\n\nThey could just call the game 'Yak/T-34' and that would pretty much cover it...\n\nAs for the P-51 D 20, THE iconic American fighter of WW2, which cleared the skies of Nazis before the D-Day invasion, allowing for both USA and Russia to march on Berlin- well, it's crap. Utter crap. In fact it's so crap it's hard not to see it as just hate propeganda. Zero acceleration, zero energy retention, unable to climb above any enemy it faces (which is historically totally inaccurate as the purpose of P-51's huge gas tanks was not just for range but to insure with absolute certaintly an altitude advantage). In game the P-51 is always below the enemy, which is just- wrong... And every Russian plane out BnZs the P-51. And one turn even at very low gs and you lose all energy. It's just wrong in every way and definitely the worst BnZ plane in the game.\n\nSo no, really really don't buy it! Anyway...\n\nIt's hard not to see it as a hate USA agenda, but...\nI have learned to ignore all the USA haters. It's still kinda sad to think about it. \nAnd yeah, they can say things in the forums about USA that you can't say in return or you will be the one banned for a month and tomorrow they will still be making Anti-USA posts.\n\nBut I play all nations evenly now, and not getting 'attached' to any one nation is the key to fun in this game. The graphics are very very nice, and scale better than any I've seen in any game IE you can play in 4K with a mid range video card! And it looks great! The detailed models of planes and tanks are simply awesome. And I have to say that the American plane tree is MUCH better than it was a year ago, with the new low level (T2) P-51, the new high level (T4) P-38s, and machine guns actually doing something once in a while. Still USA is the worst in game by pretty far...\n\nYeah so ignore the haters, don't spend time in the forums with the sadly USA-hating community who will just lie to keep American tanks/planes crap.\n\nIn short, enjoy the game, play Brittain, Germany, Japan and ignore the community and you can have a lot of fun.\n\nI have!\n\nStill waiting for the community to 'evolve' a bit and learn that ALL nationalistic hate is bad bad bad, and we're all the same in some ways, and games are to connect on *those* levels, then I will give it a thumbs up.\n\nThanks for reading :)\n\n--------------------\nOriginal Post Unedited:\n--------------------\n\n\nFirst things first- the Russian developers of this game are totally anti-American. They screw USA in every way possible. Serously, their treatment of American planes, is nothing short of propeganda. Yes you CAN do well in USA planes, maybe get 3 kills per round, but if that's your skill level, you'll get 9 kills per round in anything else. The game is designed to favor dogfighting (since Russian planes are dogfighters) and NOT Boom n Zoom (USA). BnZ gets punished by lower Activity scores (which is HUGE), silly stupid hit to kill ratios like 10: 1, where other planes get 2:1 hits per kill. One game recently as USA I got 47 hits and ZERO kills. And that kind of thing happens ALL THE TIME. ITS JUST STUPID HOW THEY SKEW THIS GAME TO FAVOR RUSSIA AND SCREW USA. And BTW, while you're 'Zooming', dogfighters are stealing your every kill. Kills BTW get ALL the points. You really don't get crap playing USA in this game and the Russian developers like it that way. Yes, you CAN play USA well, but no matter what your skill level, you'll get 3x the kills and 10x the points with ANY OTHER NATION.\n\nWORSE The developers at Gaijin are totally fascist, to the degree you wouldn't even think exists in the modern world. In the forums they've locked and deleted literally thousands of threads complaining about stupidly negative treatment of USA, and block users from posting if they ever said anything even remotely critical of the game. DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY! YOU'RE ONLY SUPPORTING FASCISM AND CENSORSHIP! YES, REALLY. \n\nI suggest you just play the game for FREE, take their resources, and learn FOR FREE what the community is like (CRAP) seriously the worst MMO environment ever. You will learn to totally hate your teamates as they are NEVER there to help you out when your smoking on fire with an enemy on your tail, they'll just fly away, but if you have an enemy on fire, your entire tream will INSTANTLY DROP EVERYTHING to put the last bullet in and steal your kill. Yeah. It's like that. And the Russian developers like it that way. Say anything about adjusting the points rewards system to favor teamwork and your post will be deleted and you'll be banned permanently. \n\nBTW, THERE IS NO CONTENT AVAILABLE THAT IS WORTH PAYING FOR. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PLAY RUSSIA AND YOU AUTOMATICALLY WIN. The very first Yak 1 has a 20mm gun, which is like a 500mm nuclear death star ray or something. The difference between 50 cals (12.7 mm mgs used by USA) and 20mm canon (used by Russia) is so totally exagerated, simply to favor Russia- to an absoluty stupid degree. Russian guns of the same caliber are even more powerful and win every head-on, their planes don't catch fire, they have massive hit point buffs and resistance to crits, they win EVERY collision ramming conflict and use it as a cheap shot easy win. If you want to win, just play Russian Laggs = auto win. Or German 190s, or Spitfires (if you want some variety), JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. BUT DON'T BE SO STUPID TO ACTUALLY PAY THEM MONEY FOR CRAP THAT DOESN'T HELP ANYWAY. Yes, if you're wondering the Typhoon actually is a good plane, but you simply don't need it. Lagg/Spit/190 = auto win, and they're FREE. \n\nOh yeah- anyone who tells you it's more balanced in RB is full of crap BC nobody plays RB, everyone plays Arcade = faster points/unlocks, more action, no 20 minute waits just to get instantly critd and game over no points, by players with every exploit mastered with thousands of hours gameplay. PLAY FOR FREE, FIGURE ALL THIS OUT FOR YOURSELF. In Arcade which you WILL play 99% of the time JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, the three planes noted (AND ANYTHING RUSSIAN) are so massively superiour its silly, and they're all FREE. \n\nAGAIN, DON'T BUY ANYTHING. YOU DON'T NEED IT. Don't give em your money just to chase higher levels and jet unlocks. THE LOWEST LEVELS ARE THE MOST FUN ANYWAY!!! Everyone who unlocks the later game jets agrees the gameplay is no fun. So you gave em all your money, just to unlock planes that are really just a disappointment. When you could have just played the very first level Yak 1 with a BR 2.0 and AUTO WIN. Believe me, the game doesn't get any better at higher levels, don't get on the cash paying treadmill of unlocks! Play the fist Yak, Lagg, 109, or 190, and automatically win. And you can learn all this very soon, and FOR FREE. MOST IMPORTANT DO NOT SUPPORT THE PROPEGANDA AND CENSORSHIP BEHAVIOUR OF FASCIST GAIJIN DEVELOPERS. IT DOESN'T BELONG IN THE MODERN ERA!","timestamp_created":1422362464,"timestamp_updated":1461506260,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487275302410125732","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwvejpNQCfqCRNg=="}
