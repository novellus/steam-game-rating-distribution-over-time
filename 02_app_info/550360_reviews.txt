Purchase at your own risk!\n(IF your wanting something similar to nazi zombies I would look at Pavov instead as they have the nazi zombie maps on there!)\nI last got a chance to speak with one of the developers via twitter almost 2 years ago when I first purchased my vr headset. (Oculus Rift)\n\nI asked the devs if there was going to be any more updates back in December of 2018. they first claimed yes and to send any bugs into the forums and they will be updating. They have not updated anything at all. \nthe game has a tendency to freeze during playing. there are glitches where you will get stuck inside trash cans on certain maps and un-accessible areas you can not go to but its open to grab the gun on the wall.\nits a shame though that the devs abandoned something with potential here. I know the game is cheap, but your better off spending your money elsewhere.\nyour more than welcome to copy and paste this as i just want to help others not make the same mistake","timestamp_created":1589578110,"timestamp_updated":1589578209,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47tKPjfICeKv8hwI="}
