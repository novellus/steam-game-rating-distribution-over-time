I really like the art (especially the background art - I know nobody buys VNs for the backgrounds art, but this is legit the most gorgeous background art in any VN I've played). The world has interesting lore, not quite as fleshed out as I would have liked it but interesting nonetheless. The heroine Lena's relationship with the antagonist is actually very well-written, and I really enjoyed the complexity of it. Unfortunately, in my opinion that relationship is the most interesting one in the game. The romance routes were mediocre at best. Gavin's was the most interesting, as he had a bit of character development and backstory that paired very well with Lena's. The others, though, were a bit flat and not really memorable (Simon and Lena don't even really get overt romance). The writing also drags a bit in some parts, especially where you're \"choosing\" the one location on the map that's available. \n\nAgain, overall, it wasn't irredeemable, and if you're a VN fan and/or fantasy story fan there might be something here for you (although I'd recommend picking it up on sale like I did - sixteen dollars would have been a lot when I really only enjoyed the art, one love interest, and the antagonist). Even though I didn't ~love~ this, I'll be looking at the developer's next project to see if it's something I'm interested in.","timestamp_created":1594948619,"timestamp_updated":1594948619,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r5GWrfMCceTilQI="}
