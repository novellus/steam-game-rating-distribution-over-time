And now I'm completely dissapointed. There is still no story game. No tournaments. No Android version for my Kindle Fire. This game is unplayble due to its pay2win strategy, legendary cards are so unbalanced. They just smash you in the face. Deleted after month of trying. Give me my money and time back!\nBTW Richard Garfield, shame on you.","timestamp_created":1385637591,"timestamp_updated":1546182562,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.448295623064041138","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjbLq/+cCfq7iHQ=="}
