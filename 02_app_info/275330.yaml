    review: "This is a first impression, not a full review, and I suspect it's going\
      \ to stay that way. The reason for that is that this game is a timing puzzler\
      \ with unsuitable controls. \n\nThe general idea is nice: you need to get colored\
      \ runes to the same colored altars, except for tutorial dude, each elemental\
      \ can only carry its own runes, and there are specific things only they can\
      \ do, and they can be combined to combine their abilities. That should make\
      \ for interesting puzzles, except they're timed, your guys never stop moving\
      \ (why not?), and the camera and controls mean it's very hard to translate intent\
      \ into the game world.\n\nNow with the same basic mechanics, this could just\
      \ as easily have been a puzzle where you draw some paths in advance, including\
      \ possibly some wait times, and thenset it in motion like a machine. But instead,\
      \ like Charlie Chaplin in modern times, I need to struggle to keep  up with\
      \ the \"machine\" that I want to see solve the level. Very annoying.\n\nIf you\
      \ like timing puzzle games, this is a game you might want to try. If you like\
      \ the puzzling without someone running and falling off a cliff while you try\
      \ to figure out what's going on, get something else."
