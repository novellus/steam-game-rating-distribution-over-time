Just look at Bethesda's sad fix for Fallout76 that modders did better. :D\n\nSo, upon entering the game to me it felt like a puzzle game I wasn't able to figure out. I read some of the update posts and thought perhaps it was about imagination but I left a post in the Discussion to seek clarity regarding these artifacts asking me to Write stuff. Developer responded super quickly. \n\nI then moved on to explore until I felt I had hit a wall.. a glass wall.. that was transparent and smokey black :D \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1682931732\n\nI sent the developer a friend request and upon seeing where I was stuck promptly said it wasn't suppose to be this way and they would get it resolved in approx 30 min. \n:ThumbsUp: Pretty awesome considering they already posted their Farewell and mentioned no more Steam support. For that reason alone I would recommend the developer. Unfortunately it seems like I found them too late as they are leaving Steam but hopefully they will still be out there.\n\n\nP.S.  \nHere is a link to the manual just in case you've missed it. \nhttps://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/911440/manuals/Manual_(Eng).pdf\n\nDev shared this link for it. \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/manual/911440\n\n\n\n[h1]Thoughts after completion.[/h1] \n\nNow that I have completed the game, even though it is not available on Steam I wanted to update with my thoughts. \n\nWhen I purchased Evemnesis I honestly expected a short game. And more of a walking simulator with a little story than anything. I was honestly surprised at some of the challenge encountered with solving the puzzles and to learn there were multiple worlds. Especially that  'a clue here' leads to 'an answer there'. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1684414371\n\nMy favorite feature has to be that you reach a point mid game that allows you to teleport back and fourth between the various places. For someone like me who likes to fully complete achievements having the ability to go back versus starting a whole new game from the beginning is extremely awesome. I wish more games of this genre did that. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1685123562\n\n\nI really wish two things. \n\n1. I had found this game and developer sooner. One of a handful of developers I have had the pleasure to meet that care about their game and the people who buy it. Not only did he hotfix a bug quickly but was kind enough to provide hints when needed to help me along, or even backwards to discover something i overlooked. *Opsi*\n\n2. Valve actually curated their own platform so this hidden gem didn't get lost in the pile of \"cash grab\" or asset flip trash that litters steam and prevents users from finding games that have real play-ability. \n\n\nP.S.S\nNot sure if all my badgering was part of it :D but the amount of users who showed interest after Valve disabled purchases prompted for developer CloudScapeGT to put it up on itch after all. \nSo if you still want to play it (without steam), https://cloudscapegt.itch.io/evemnesis","timestamp_created":1552609570,"timestamp_updated":1552780925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.695857048034667969","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hJO9xOkCd52KvQE="}
