    review: 'This game is absolute garbage. Go and buy Cat Sorter VR instead, which
      is clearly where this idea was taken from, but fails to deliver in practically
      every area that made Cat Sorter VR enjoyable.


      Cat Sorter VR was fun because it was full of bizarre bodyparts from different
      creatures that you could stick onto your cat. In this game, there are 3 boxes,
      and all those boxes contain are normal dog heads, normal dog legs, and normal
      dog tails. So if you want to pay $10 AUD to stick a head, some legs and a tail
      on a dog body, go for it, but for 99.9% of people, this game will be a tremendous
      waste of your money.


      Hard pass.'
