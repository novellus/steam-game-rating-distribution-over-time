While the powerups in game are somewhat low level, you can upgrade your ship permanently by using earned credits from destroyed enemies which is cool.\n\nThe story is campy but serviceable. Fully voiced too. If you're not really into story in your shmups like me though you can easily skip it. It would be cool if there was a separate arcade mode which would remove all the chatter entirely (besides maybe at the beginning to get olyou started and at the end after you beat the game), but it's no big deal.\n\nOnly other thing I would like added is to be able to revisit previous levels after completing the game to grab some achievements, credits and upgrades. Life bars on bosses would be welcome too.\n\nDev is also really responsive to feedback and generously added a patch which makes upgrades much better so you feel better suited for the later levels and achievements too. There's  also a hardcore mode added in which is great as well. Looking forward to more from this dev.
