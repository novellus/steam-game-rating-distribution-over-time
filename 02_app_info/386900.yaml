    review: A humorous logic game of cats and train tracks. A cheery tune as you play
      and a lot of meowing when you solve a puzzle. It kept me entertained. Every
      machine has a solution and more than a few were a conundrum. The cats are cute.
      If you enjoy logic puzzles, you'll like this game.
