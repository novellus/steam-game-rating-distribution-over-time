    review: "One of two otome games poorly, crudely, most unprofessionally \"translated\"\
      \ by this publisher, \"Desperate game\" is a hybrid of an otome visual novel\
      \ and a Hunger Games/battle royale knock-off. \n\nHowever, ten minutes in you're\
      \ bombarded with instructions on the rules of the game-within-the-game and they're\
      \ basically impossible to understand. I was eliminated from the Desperate Game\
      \ -- basically a Game Over that takes you to the Title Menu -- the first night\
      \ because I failed to secure a Base, which I wasn't aware was a requirement.\
      \ The worst thing is, nothing exciting happened, like being attacked by the\
      \ other players in the game. It was just like \"You failed to get a base. You\
      \ lost the game\" and that's it.\n\nThere's elements of fighting, \"ghosts\"\
      , two battlefields, and loads of dialogue in the first ten minutes that made\
      \ my head spin trying to understand. Without spoilers, all I could decipher\
      \ was the main character was blind, in the Hunger Games, kind of a dimwit, and\
      \ partnered with someone who doesn't seem to belong in this game to begin with.\
      \ Which is interesting, but there's not enough motivation here to make me keep\
      \ playing and figure out his story.\n\nIt's unspeakably frustrating that a game\
      \ as interesting-sounding as this is so unplayable because of the severe lack\
      \ of English-translated and English-language otome/otoge games there are in\
      \ existence, especially when you compare it to the amount of hentai/eroge/male-geared\
      \ games that are made in English, translated excellently into English, or fanpatched\
      \ into English. This game sounded like it had a lot of potential, more interesting\
      \ than the snooze fest that is Code: Realize, but it's bogged down by an easily-solved\
      \ problem.\n\nHire a translator! If you're cheap, don't worry - no one is buying\
      \ this game as it is with all the negative reviews, so it really can't hurt\
      \ to fix your mess for a fee, and do a bit of marketing/advertising (especially\
      \ to the curators) that your product is up to snuff.\n\nI'm going to TRY to\
      \ get through this one some other time, but right now my brain hurts from so\
      \ many other things (shoutout to COVID) that I don't need this in my life. I\
      \ really DO want to know what happens to Ning, if that is her name, and enjoy\
      \ the story and beautiful art. Because the art IS fairly well done."
