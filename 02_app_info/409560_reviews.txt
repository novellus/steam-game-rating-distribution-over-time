It is very similar but seems also incomplete. The levels are short and sweet, you are a small rabbit that has to run and jump across platforms reach the goal. You are avoiding spikes, buzz saws, missles (sound familiar right?). The controls are okay, a little bit more slippery than SMB but still fun, I used an XBox1 controller and it worked fine. I completed all of the levels over the 2 worlds (20 levels for each world with some bonus levels to unlock as well). It only took me about 2 hours which is why I was wondering if they were originally planning on more levels but then ran out of time and just released what they had. There is little to no story, but from the brief cutscenes that are shown, it seems like it ends on kind of a cliff-hanger which also suggests they were planning on more levels. Anyways, it suited my purpose of finding a game like Super Meat Boy (I love that game a have completed it a few times) until Super Meat Boy Forever comes out later on this year or next. If you like Super Meat Boy or similar type games (another suggestion: Never Give Up) than this one will satisfy you for a few hours.","timestamp_created":1573503804,"timestamp_updated":1573503804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwptSIru4CeNC82QE="}
