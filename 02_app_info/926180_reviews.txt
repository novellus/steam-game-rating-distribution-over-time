I mean, unlike some of the other games in the series, Paws on Fire is at least functional. But there's just a lot missing from the experience. With the writing and the jokes put in the background of the auto-runner, the gameplay is supposed to be holding up the game by itself: and it doesn't do that well. The thing is, auto-runners can work if there's enough variety in terms of reactions: forcing you to work against the games level design and hopefully you don't react in the wrong way. But the repetitiveness of Paws on Fire, forcing you to replay levels several times (even though the characters are different) ends up really grinding your gears rather quickly. Even the character differences don't do that much to feel like you're just hitting a jump button at the right time, and there's no thought needed in terms of the gameplay. \n\nBut it's the soul of Bubsy's character being regulated to the sideline that makes this feel more of a skinned version of Bubsy more then anything else. I wonder why this game exists honestly, this doesn't feel like Bubsy first of all, but more like a game wearing the skin of bubsy. He's not exactly put into the spotlight, but he also doesn't feel like himself either. His charm is gone, which is weird to say but he needed to talk a LOT more. It doesn't help that the series staples such as his wit and the unique death animations aren't here, and the bit trip runner type effects can really not work well for the presentation of the story elements. Even when getting to the second world, some of the presentation's reuse is obvious, and you can't help but wonder why what the game was supposibly delayed for. \n\nThere's just not enough from the Runner3 developer to really justify that price point. Maybe something a lot smaller,but even then there are better experiences out there without the Bubsy layer. \n\nEven for \n\n[b]Gameplay Footage: [/b]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_c3Yatk9CE\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The character and colors in the artwork is reasonable and there's nothing that doesn't work (well mostly) from the presentation.\n[*] The Armadillo levels provide a good change of pace.\n[*] Controls are reasonable and there's a reasonable responsiveness for each of the characters.\n[*] The different characters in theory should have added variety to the game's length. They do.... a tiny bit.\n[*] Music tracks aren't bad and sound design isn't either.  \n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Level Design gets repetitive very quickly and the game doesn't do enough to keep up variety in the first hour or so. Within 20 minutes, you're sitting there wondering why you'd continue to play. \n[*] Repetition, Repetition, Repetition, even beyond having to do levels over again with different characters, it's the same patterns for jumping and dodging that bat you have to deal with. \n[*] The writings and jokes are god awful for a Bubsy game. I mean, that's when you get them, but where's the cleverness in the puns? Sure, level names are fine, but where's the actual character of Bubsy that people are here for?\n[*] Further more those lines get repeated very quickly and make you wonder why more wasn't recorded. You'll want to shut sound off entirely....if you need to.\n[*] I mean, the game has a section or two that's ok, but challenge isn't the games strong suit. And the lack of difficulty can wear really fast.\n[*] UFO girls levels are just.....time wasters. Barely any challenge. \n[*] No unique animations for death really stands out when the death animation for running into bees, sawblades, and creatures are all the same.\n[*] Just the price in general. I'm having trouble justifying the price tag, even with the 20% sale for the first seven days, for what you get here gameplay/game wise. It's a steal....for the seller. \n[*] Some of the energy effects really hurt your eyes if you stare at them for a period of time and can really use it toned down. \n[*] Costumes and cosemetics feel reasonably lazy. Like they need a dose of life in them. \n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.
