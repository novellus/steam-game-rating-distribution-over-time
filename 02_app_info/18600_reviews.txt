It's pretty much just a straight line. There realy isn't much to do other than build up an fleet and try to overwhelm everything as you expand outward. Other than your ships, the only resource to manage is upgrading factories on planets so they will build more ships each turn. This does forfit any ship building for that planet that turn and the only limit is that you can only upgrade one factory per turn & a particular factory cannot be upgraded on consecutive turns.\n\nThe main negative of this game is that there is no online community anymore, meaning that there are 3 achievements that will be impossible to earn without help from friends who also own this game.\n\nSo why do I recommend it? Because sometimes simple is fun. It's easy to generate a small map and have a quick game that you can finish in under 15 minutes or pull up a huge one for an 8 player last-man-standing war that can last a while. If you either allow the adaptive AI to level up as you win games (or raise it manually), eventually your opponents will put up a decent fight. If they get to be too much, you can always knock it down a bit to make it challenging and fun for you the player (and turn off adaptive AI). Without any real online play I don't think I'd pay full price, but if you can catch it on good sale it worth a few bucks for a quick and simple strategy fix.","timestamp_created":1479989123,"timestamp_updated":1479989123,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476981639862060547","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+7qOy9gCcpjBZw=="}
