With an engaging story and decent design it's worth a look now and devs being willing to fix things if they're broken is encouraging as well.","timestamp_created":1601940131,"timestamp_updated":1608070484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1602479967,"developer_response":"This is really unfortunate and I'm sorry you encountered this frustrating issue. Something in one of the recent patches from Beamdog seems to have broken the wagon asset that allows you to interact with it to leave the area. It's been working for 14 years, so this was an unpleasant surprise.  We've come up with a simple workaround for the time being, until we get an official fix in NWNEE through Beamdog. Please contact me about it at info@ossianstudios.com (I'm Ossian's CEO) and I'll have our lead QA tester help you resolve this bug in short order."}],"cursor":"AoJwgoqetPYCcpKPpgI="}
