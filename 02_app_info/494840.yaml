      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UBOAT</h2><br>UBOAT is a simulator of a submarine from\
      \ WWII era, yet different than all you have seen so far. It is a survival sandbox\
      \ with crew management mechanics while its primary theme is life of German sailors.\
      \ The boat is their home, but it can become their grave at any time.<br><br>In\
      \ UBOAT you control the crew in order to control the boat. You look after their\
      \ physical and mental health, because if the sailors are hungry, tired and their\
      \ spirit is low, there\u2019s no chance of winning even a skirmish.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Survival</h2><br>The extensive damage system is a foundation of the\
      \ game's survival elements. Unprecedented situations are bound to happen as\
      \ the effect of received damage, testing player's creativity and ability to\
      \ stay calm. You can try to save the whole crew or leave someone behind, to\
      \ save the others.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/494840/extras/Damage_System_1.gif?t=1607033044\"\
      \ /><br><br>While your ship travels through the open seas, you will often find\
      \ yourself being on your own. Use your management skills to spend resources\
      \ taken on the trip optimally and in special cases try to recover them on the\
      \ sea, by asking your allies for the help... or by looting wreckages of enemy\
      \ ships.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Disable unnecessary devices, to keep\

      \ /><br><br>Brave completion of assignments from the headquarters is rewarded\
      \ with additional budget for the unit under your command and with acceptance\

      \ that if something needs to be done, it's better to do that on your own - sit\

    review: 'Let me begin by saying that when I was younger, "Deadly Games" was a
      Macintosh studio that released a series of war simulator games. Among a tank
      sim and bomber sim was a game called U-boat. It was a crude game released in
      94 before I was even a teenager, with black and white graphics. Sad to say,
      I loved that game. Then, Deadly Games released U-Boat II, Drumbeat. This was
      similar to the first release however it had better graphics that were actually
      in color, better sounds (some of which were taking from Das Boot) and came with
      a booklet with all the info you needed in order to identify and sink enemy ships.
      I still have the book.


      Anyway, time went on, the games got old and I no longer played them. Fast forward
      to current time. I am a few decades older and regularly browse Steam for old
      games I used to play. I plugged in U-boat and up popped this game. I was skeptical
      at first but decided to get it and check it out. It is eerily similar to the
      original Deadly Games releases but up to 2019 standards with excellent graphics
      and more duties, control, options, upgrades, and tasks in order to survive and
      fight among other things.


      To sum it up - you have to be a certain person in order to enjoy this game.
      I grew up playing these types of games so I love it. Deep Water really did a
      great job on this one. I can spent what seems like 30 minutes playing this and
      when I look at the clock, three hours has gone by. I would love to see future
      updates and releases on this one. Thank you Deep Water, again, great job on
      this!'
