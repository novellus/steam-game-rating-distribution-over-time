    review: I think this could be a fun game and it ticks off many checkboxes that
      I would look for in a game like this but the control style is very counter-intuitive.
      When your ship is pointing towards the top of the screen the controls act normally,
      left it left and right is right, but when you're facing towards the bottom of
      the screen those are reversed and moving the mouse left turns your ship right
      and vice versa. I tried to mentally adjust for this but after a while I just
      started to try and keep my target in the top half. It made dog-fighting nigh
      impossible. If there was a way to toggle control schemes that would be wonderful
      but I couldn't find any setting like that. The UI does also have a somewhat
      clunky feel at times. For example using F1 to bring up the help menu doesn't
      bring up a menu so much as an overlay that can then be overlaid itself by other
      menus. Keeping track of what windows respond to what commands (for exapmle the
      map only responds to the space bar and not escape) is challenging when first
      starting out. Consistency is a good thing in a well designed UI and this one
      has some room for improvement.
