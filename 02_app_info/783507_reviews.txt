Unfortunately, on both of my PCs (my laptop and my desktop), it did not install.  The page says that it's in my library, and it's in the DLC section of the game page in my library, but no matter what I do it will not install.  Going to attempt to get a refund if possible.","timestamp_created":1518438937,"timestamp_updated":1518438937,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mu6AxeECc93WmAE="}
