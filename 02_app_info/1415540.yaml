      another team. You will not be able to move buildings and their place for construction
      is limited, so think about their location in advance.<h2 class="bb_tag"> </h2>Your
      creatures will walk, attack, use abilities - automatically! After killing enemy
      creatures, you will receive gold, which you can spend on buying new buildings

      your base, but do not find the hero, they will begin to capture the base, which
      will lead to their victory.
