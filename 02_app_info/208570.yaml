    review: 'So I just finished 100%-ing this DLC, all achievements, 3-star on everything
      and all that. As other have pointed out - some of the most frustrating sh*t
      you''ll ever do. But I cant deny that it feels amazing to be done with it and
      on many of the challenges I actually had a lot of fun once I got the basics
      down. Theres just 2 or 3 that really REALLY suck. Like, B A D L Y.


      So - for casual play, this DLC is a blast imo. An assortment of minigames straight
      from the dishonored universe. If you just wanna try your hand at some of the
      challenges this game has to offer, I can only recommend it to you, especially
      for that price.

      For completionists this DLC can be a complete pain, but also immensely rewarding
      to finally get it all down. So youll have to decide on your own if you wanna
      take that risk. Definitely is a recommendation from me even with the many many
      curveballs this throws you on your way to 100% :D'
