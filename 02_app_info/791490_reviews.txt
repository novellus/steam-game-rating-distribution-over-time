It's really helpful to watch people who aren't familiar with our game try to play it, especially since it's an unusual genre.\n\nQuick note: those black circles are a bug. They're supposed to be on top of the white lines above the enemy heads. I really apologize for that, we had multiple people test it for us and none of them reported that issue. It looks like a resolution issue, we'll get a fix for that pushed out today.\n\nI don't know if you're planning to keep the game and play it more in the future, but you may enjoy the easy mode more - the box cost doesn't increase when you forget to make combos which was what killed you a few times. If you continue to play it on Normal mode I'd recommend using the fire a lot less frequently, and using yellow+yellow (shield) and blue+blue (tornado, traps 5 of any color) instead.  They're really the bread and butter combos for beginning players.  Also remember that you can use the rainbow to attract enemies, to grab multiple kills at once without taking much damage by getting close.\n\nI appreciate your let's play though, there are definitely a couple issues we need to explain better, especially the boss position. He spawns in one of the corners of the building, if you tap/hold (depending on your settings) the spacebar to free-look around you should be able to see a red beam of particles from the boss location."}],"cursor":"AoJwtpSr2OYCcsevrQE="}
