    about_the_game: <i>Sucked through the appalling nightmare of the Seltsian Void,
      the starship Traveller emerges at the other side of the black hole into an unknown
      universe. YOU are the captain of the Traveller, and her fate lies in your hands.
      Will you be able to discover the way back to Earth from the alien peoples and
      planets you encounter, or will you and your crew be doomed to roam uncharted
      space forever?</i><br><br>With Fighting Fantasy's popularity on the rise in
      the 80s, Steve Jackson was inspired by a different setting from the traditional
      swords and sorcery - instead looking to science fiction. Starship Traveller
      allows players to control an entire ship and crew, with each member skilled
      in certain abilities.<br><br>Explore the vast reaches of space, updated for
      PC, Mac and Linux. Presented in full colour with realistic physics-based dice
      rolling for battles, auto-mapping, an auto-updated adventure sheet and stat
      keeping.
