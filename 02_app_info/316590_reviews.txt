They increase your in game cash multiplier. Cash is used to buy cosmetic items for your avatar. To my knowledge, it serves no other purpose other than that, and as such cannot be used to gain an advantage over players who do not have this DLC.\n\nThe gold items are not the only ones that increase the cash multiplier, they just have the largest multiplication effect. With a full set of gold items, including the exclusive hummingbird, shirt, pants (or skirt/ kilt), both clubs, and hat, your gold multiplier is raised to a total of 4.65.  \n\nThe clothing, clubs, and hummingbird all look quite fancy, befitting of a gold pack. If you like Vertiginous Golf, and want to add a bit of flair to your avatar, feel free to pick this pack up, perhaps on sale.\n\n\nI haven't put much time into the course creator, as such i cannot properly review the golden course pieces.\n\nI will update the review at a later point when i have examined them. Although I am sure they are quite fancy.","timestamp_created":1446035206,"timestamp_updated":1446035206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.708751857280731201","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw98Wa19ACf7K3Rw=="}
