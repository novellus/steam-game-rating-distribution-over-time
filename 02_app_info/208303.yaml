    about_the_game: "The East Coast Main Line is familiar to millions of British travellers\
      \ as the main connection from London to Edinburgh, and now you can travel back\
      \ to the 1970s and drive along some of the fastest stretches of this important\
      \ railway line. <br><br>The route of the ECML was originally constructed in\
      \ the 19th Century by the North British, North Eastern and Great Northern Railway\
      \ companies individually. York eventually became the headquarters for the entire\
      \ line, its impressive station and enormous 295-lever signal box (the largest\
      \ manual signal box in Britain) imprinting the city in history as one of the\
      \ country\u2019s most important railway centres. The world speed record for\
      \ steam locomotives was set on the line at Stoke Bank back in 1938, and in the\
      \ late 20th Century much of the ECML was relayed for modern high speed running,\
      \ beginning with the fearsome Deltic locomotives and continuing with the ubiquitous\
      \ HST sets which still operate today. The East Coast Main Line for Train Simulator\
      \ recreates the fast, open stretch from Newcastle to York as it appeared in\
      \ the late 1970s, and includes a selection of British Rail diesel locomotives\
      \ with rolling stock and plenty of scenarios to test your driving skills.<h2\
