I'm not saying it's good, it's just meh. There are many things wrong with this game but mostly it just seems to have no direction. They type of game seems to change randomly in each chapter making it feel like some sort of miss matched story pieces strung together with little continuing gameplay. There are a few bugs such as being unable to holster your gun and firing it every time you try to do something as well as one make which is so open you get lost even though the rest of the game is linear. That and some of the most annoying \"spooky\" I've ever hear. Man I don't need to hear a gasp from behind me every five seconds especially when you never use it to hint the monster is near. \nMy main problem with this game however is the way that it made me feel when it was over. I have a thought that the writer of this game took a real life tragedy and made it into a stupid \"It was satanists and monsters!\" story. It gave me a gross feeling and though I have found no major evidence that they are using a real life story to make a dumb tasteless horror game, I can't get it out of the pit of my stomach that there is something deeply wrong there.\nI say pass this one guys, it's not worth it.","timestamp_created":1606926281,"timestamp_updated":1606926281,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kqWRkvYCcpXltgI="}
