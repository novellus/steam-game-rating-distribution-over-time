It just wasn't the kind of game for me.  I had to figure out what I had to do myself, and there were way too many enemies spawning very quickly, and the movement was (for me) awful.  you can only move forward, and that will be in the direction you're facing, so if you try to look around, you'll walk into fences and trees.  It would have been nice to have a choice of movement.  There is no inventory (or I didn't know) so if you hold a key, you lose your knuckledusters, and by the time you find a cage to unlock, you've no idea where you left the knuckleduster, and you've gone through around 25 enemies without it anyway.\n   I could not leave the recommend blank, it doesn't let me, but this game may suit others.  It just isn't for me,","timestamp_created":1573199647,"timestamp_updated":1573199647,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56081080436706543","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1573323608,"developer_response":"Hi Tiddyvrlive, thank you for playing our game ! Although we are sad that our game wasn't for you we appreciate your feedback,as we are always looking to learn. We will be adding toggle to our movement so the player will be able to look left and right , and yes we have an inventory in the Main Menu/Load Scene we have a sign with the instructions of how our inventory system (the watch) works. It's what shows you how many keys and bombs you have in your possession, and the Ice-nail Gun and Electric Knuckles icons turn off or on depending if you have them in your inventory."}],"cursor":"AoJ4kbKApe4CcOy62AE="}
