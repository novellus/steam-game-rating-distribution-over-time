    about_the_game: 'Immortal Darkness: Curse of the Pale King is a dark fantasy dungeon
      crawler, that blends the best of old school dungeon crawlers with modern graphics,
      slick combat, and context driven audio. It features challenging real-time tactical
      combat, a wide variety of spells, and a dark and brooding dungeon full of lethal
      enemies, sadistic traps, and mind-bending puzzles. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/868060/extras/Immortal_Darkness_Strategy.jpg?t=1571685555"
      /><br><br>The world of Uuld is under siege by the Vampyr who have destroyed
      and devoured all but a few remaining strongholds of civilization. The world''s
      last hope, Shade, an ancient and legendary vampire hunter, has been bitten in
      the last epic battle on the surface. <br><br>You play as Shade now struggling
      against the vampiric curse, using it to heal yourself but at a terrible price.
      You must fight your way through a twisted labyrinth of horror and death to finally
      face the Pale King, lord of all Vampires, before succumbing to the vampiric
      curse yourself.<br><br><strong>Fools Rush In</strong><br><br>This is a game
      that will challenge you to think tactically about every situation. Rushing into
      a room without a good plan will most likely get you killed very quickly. Control
      the flow of combat by using spells and potions to slow, stun, confuse, poison,
      scatter, separate and take out your enemies a few at a time.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/868060/extras/Immortal_Darkness_Spells.jpg?t=1571685555"
      /><br><br><strong>The Thirst</strong><br><br>As a half-vampire your primary
      means of healing is drinking the blood of your fallen enemies. Using this ability
      pushes you closer and closer to full vampire. Use it sparingly or pay the price.
      There are ways to reduce your build-up of evil, such as potions and holy altars,
      but they are few and your enemies are many.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/868060/extras/Blood_Drink_crop.jpg?t=1571685555"
      /><br><br><strong>Items are Everything</strong><br><br>With the exception of
      your basic melee attack, every spell and ability you will have is based on the
      items you choose to equip to the 6 slots in your action bar. As you progress
      through the game and your pack begins to fill with dozens of items, choosing
      what you equip to your action slots will define everything about how you play
      and what you can do.<br><br><strong>Secrets Within Secrets</strong><br><br>Few
      will find every secret or unlock every puzzle in this centuries old dungeon.
      Evil has been at work here since ancient antiquity and there is more concealed
      in this place of eternal gloom than anywhere else in Uuld.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/868060/extras/Immortal_Darkness_Secret.jpg?t=1571685555"

    review: "This game is sooo good. \nThis is not an RPG as description say. This\
      \ is more like survival game. It reminds me of Resident Evil 1-2 and Dark Souls\
      \ 1. \nYou need to think to progress. Every item, shrine, secret door is important.\
      \ You can't just go forward and make progress - you will die or spend to much\
      \ resourses if you do this. Your \"skill\" means nothing. Game work such way\
      \ you just can't win with your reflexes, only smart and carefull planing make\
      \ you through the game. This is the part that reminds me of oldschool survival\
      \ horros :) \nVery nice mechanic of Evil in here. I love it."
