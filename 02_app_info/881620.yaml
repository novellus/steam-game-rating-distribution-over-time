    review: "Note: As of reviewing, I have played the first ten levels.\n\nThis is\
      \ a fun game which at its most basic is about using pipes to transport toxic\
      \ waste from point A to point B without a leak. However, the gameplay contains\
      \ a lot more nuance and presents additional challenges as you progess through\
      \ the levels. The pipes come in multiple shapes and some of them add extra directions\
      \ for the waste to travel while others create a \"dead end\", allowing you to\
      \ make the waste travel a certain direction. You will not always have the pieces\
      \ you want, so there is some tetris-esque strategy involved in deciding when\
      \ to trash one of your current pieces to try for a better replacement or to\
      \ improvise with what you currently have. Additionally, some levels already\
      \ begin with pipe pieces present, so you have the option of placing your pieces\
      \ strategically to connect with these or to work around them as if they were\
      \ an obstacle. \n\nOne feature that really comes in handy to save time on the\
      \ early levels (in which the toxic waste moves quite slowly) is the \"fast end\"\
      \ button. If you press this button, the waste will travel very quicky through\
      \ the rest of the pipe you've laid out. Just make sure that before you press\
      \ the button you've connected the pipe from start to finish without any openings\
      \ for the waste to leak into the surrounding water.\n\nThe main downside for\
      \ me is that the tutorial is a bit weak. Some aspects of the games like moving\
      \ unwanted pipes to the trash (click and drag), the correct orientation of multi-directional\
      \ pipes, or under what conditions a misplaced pipe can be replaced have to be\
      \ learned through trial and error."
