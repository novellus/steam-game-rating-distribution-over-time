It just lacks variety, not nearly enough variety in towers. It gets boring very quickly. The soul catching mechanic is very awful, you end up getting nothing for many waves because of its cool down, just an awful way to do this. This is obviously a game that the developer probably planned much more for and then gave up half way through and just released it.","timestamp_created":1515792072,"timestamp_updated":1515792072,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475563913583755493","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1O+P9uACeZnxlQE="}
