    review: 'pros


      +solid adventure/point and click


      + good dialog


      + a combat system that i feel is better for when your controlling 1 char then
      the standard turn-base system.  if you were controlling 3-6 chars at once though
      it would be hectic.


      + the rpg element adds something more to the already existing genre.


      + can play in a single sitting as long as you dont get stuck.



      neutrals


      = its a short game but alot in this genre are and its a fair price


      = music is nice and fitting


      = no rekeybindings but this game doesnt really need them



      cons


      - using steam screenshot button advances the dialog so make sure you read the
      dialog before taking a pic.  i havent tested the ingame screenshot button though
      so cant say further there.


      - i dont care about achievements but for those achievement hunters there are
      none.



      other tidbits of info.


      the game is a good point and click adventure game with added rpg lv which gives
      you +10 health and +1 attribute point per lv.


      combat isnt turn-based but instead meter based. your bar fills up over secs.  different
      options cost different amounts of the meter.  combat is pretty simple and just
      adds to the game more variety then your normal point and click.


      you cannot avoid combat completely but if you play smart you can avoid about
      50% of the non boss fights if you want.


      game requires a mouse and keyboard to play.   keyboard is used for ui and combat.   while
      mouse for movement; point and click aspects (also for ui).'
