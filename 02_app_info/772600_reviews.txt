Didn't like this at all. I like Feed and Grow: Fish much better, even with bugs.\n\nControls are bad. Graphics nothing special and sounds are getting boring.\n\nHalf the time you don't know what hit you and you have to start over, half the time you can't hide fast enough. Frustrating and cheap game. I'm gonna ask for a refund, and I won't buy it even if it is on sale at $0.5.","timestamp_created":1519953124,"timestamp_updated":1519953124,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529147982597351074","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqoOR8uECdoq/mgE="}
