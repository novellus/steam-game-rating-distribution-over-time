I have played a ton of star realms so when I heard about this I bought the game right away. I really like this game but that is not to say it is a perfect game.\n\nPros:\nThere are some really good story line missions though they were a bit easy I found.\nThe humor and theme work well together.\nit does feel like a more polished star realms.\nThe art in this game is really good.\nCan play online or pass and play style.\nCons:\nAfter one or two games you will have seen all of the cards in the deck.\nnot too many strategies to try out.\nAI can be beat almost everytime once you know what to do.\n\nOverall I really like this game, and if you liked star realms you would love this game. I would like to see more added to it but for the simple card game it is, it's worth the money.","timestamp_created":1472163932,"timestamp_updated":1472163932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9tzz4dYCcv3zXw=="}
