      /><br>Backstory: A Dominion informant known only in the intelligence community
      as Silver Rain, has successfully infiltrated the Royal Imperial Institute of
      Engineering and Technology. The informant has managed to gain access to schematics
      of classified naval ships, including those of the Royal Navy. But with the galaxy
      on the brink of war and no way to directly transmit the huge quantity of data,
      the informant has opted to leak the schematics to an organization of black market
      traders. While dealings with such organizations is usually the purview of criminal
      enterprises, the Dominion high council has given you complete autonomy to ensure
      victory for the Dominion by any means.<br><br>Since most conflicts are deemed
      beneath the involvement of the Royal Navy, it rarely operates outside of core
      Imperial regions. Their one charge is to serve the Imperial royal family, with
      entire battle divisions at the sole discretion of each member. Clad in advanced
      armor and with enough firepower to deliver swift justice, the mere arrival of
      Royal Navy ships is typically enough to crush any misguided notions of independence.<br><br>While
      being state of the art naval ships, the Royal Navy does bear a striking resemblance
      to the ships of the old Federation. During the great Imperial war, the Federation
      remained steadfast in their refusal to submit to Imperial rule. The Federation
      had the largest navy ever built, and outnumbered the forces of the rising Empire
      several times over. The general belief was held that the mighty Federation couldn''t
      possibly lose the war, and that victory would ensure the continued sovereignty
      of all regions in the galaxy. But sheer numbers proved frighteningly insufficient
      in the face of the Empire''s newly developed strategic subspace weapons, now
      known as Tacknium warheads. Region after region fell victim to this terrifying
      new breed of weapon, and soon the unthinkable came to pass. The indomitable
      Federation had been brought to it''s knees.<br><br>Victorious and eager to send
      a message to the remaining factions of old, the Empire redeployed the conquered
      vessels of the proud Federation, now flying the Imperial colors of the Royal
      Navy. Although the ships have since undergone several generational changes,
      the Royal Navy still to this day serves as a symbol of Imperial power, and an
      ominous reminder to all who would dare defy the will of the Empire.'
