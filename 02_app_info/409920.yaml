    review: I have only played through one of the endings, so I can't say how all
      of them will go. In general, this game was great. The story is interesting,
      the characters are fun, and the interface is just fine (which, sadly, isn't
      always the case). However, I found the ending to be a little too disjointed,
      especially compared to the rest of the story. There were elements that weren't
      explained, which I found frustrating. That being said, the story was still definitely
      worth it. I really look forward to seeing the other endings.
