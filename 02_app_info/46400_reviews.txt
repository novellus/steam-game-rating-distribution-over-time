The three classes you can choose from all quickly become boring. The locations are forgettable, the combat is tedious, and the design is unimaginative. If you want an ARPG that hits the spot, there are many others on Steam that will do better. Will they do better for the money? ($5 asking price at time of writing) That's not clear. But I would rather have a cup of good coffee.","timestamp_created":1597593601,"timestamp_updated":1601667544,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.436172932386398315","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvOa09fQCcaftmwI="}
