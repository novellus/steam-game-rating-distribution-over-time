      airfield started life as RAF Glatton, built in 1942 and used by the USAF B-17
      Flying Fortress bombers throughout WWII. The airfield was mothballed by the

    review: Here is what I would say, if it is on sale definitely get it but if it
      isn't I wouldn't say it is completely worth it because it comes with no scenery
      around it, still a fun airport to fly at for sure but I have airports that are
      6 dollars with more scenery then this. all in all the airport is good and I
      give it an 8/10
