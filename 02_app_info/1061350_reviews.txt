Why can I only have 4 cars on the mack spinning coaster and 2 cars on the infinity coaster? Why the hell does this completely unnecessary limitation exist??? Why in god's name do game developers feel the need to limit player freedom and choice for absolutely no reason??? Also, there's no launch track for the Mack spinning coaster which is incredibly lame and renders it useless for my needs. Honestly, this dlc is pretty disappointing and I probably wouldn't recommend it to someone.","timestamp_created":1606808555,"timestamp_updated":1606808555,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ435nQjvYCdPGitgI="}
