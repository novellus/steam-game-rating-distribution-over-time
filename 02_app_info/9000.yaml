    about_the_game: <p>It's World War II and you are B.J. Blazkowicz, the Allies'
      most valuable agent. In the midst of the German Blitzkrieg, the Spear that pierced
      the side of Christ is taken from Versailles by the Nazis and secured in the
      impregnable Castle Wolfenstein. According to legend, no man can be defeated
      when he has the Spear. Hitler believes himself to be invincible with the power
      of the Spear as his brutal army sweeps across Europe. Your mission is to infiltrate
      the heavily guarded Nazi stronghold and recapture the Spear from an already
      unbalanced Hitler. The loss of his most coveted weapon could push him over the
      edge. It could also get you ripped to pieces.</p>
