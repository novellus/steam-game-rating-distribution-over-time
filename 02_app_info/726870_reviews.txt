Quite a bit (from what I remember, but it's been a loooong time) has been changed, pretty much all of it for the better.\n\nUsually when you play a game like this, it's hard to get all the puzzle pieces to fit and make a place seem like more than just an inventory hunt. This game definitely doesn't fall into that common trap. It's 'oldschool', harkening to ye olde Zork days, but does so with eldritchian glee. \n\nDefinitely a step up from Lurking Horror-- actually, it might be the best horror IF out there?","timestamp_created":1607751648,"timestamp_updated":1607751648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsOjdqvYCf8auuQI="}
