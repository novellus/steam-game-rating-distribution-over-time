Nothing new. The same things over again. Finished this game fairly quick. It has many pros, rather than cons; but it's straightforward and a little \"mih\". Nice experience, though. It's worth it if you like HOPA games and if you purchase it on a discount sale.","timestamp_created":1605303629,"timestamp_updated":1605303629,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zK7j4fUCfqGZrgI="}
