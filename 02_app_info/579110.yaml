    review: 'No subtitles, and the only way to know what to do is to listen to an
      english speaking russian with a strong accent through low quality radio. Couple
      that with the fact that you are in an environment you definitely aren''t used
      to and it really killed it for me as I didn''t understand anything and it didn''t
      seem interesting enough for me to bother trying stuff by myself.

      Also the hands work in a weird way, they are not aligned with your real hands,
      and they do not interact with things in the way you expect as there is no animation
      for certain things, and don''t try to shake them too hard or they''ll develop
      consciousness and try to escape your body.

      Performance isn''t too good either.'
