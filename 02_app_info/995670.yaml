      Does it contain any valuable artifacts? Important writings? Perhaps codices
      of vile heresy? It is your job to find out and secure whatever treasure or evil
      lies within.

    review: 'A vital DLC to posses.

      The reward is a constant aid to the game rather than just a bit of cosmetic
      fluff.

      If you are interested in crafting it is a game changer in my opinion.'
