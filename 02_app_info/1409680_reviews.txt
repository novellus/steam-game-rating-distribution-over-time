I was trying to find something to play and came across this one, and since it was so cheap I decided to give it a try.  There is not much to the game but I found the story to be quite nice.  I finished it in about half an hour, but during that time it did allow me to think back on some of the fun memories I had with old childhood friends of mine who are sadly just not around anymore.  A sweet game for what it is and if you are looking for something nostalgic to reflect on, then I would recommend it.  I am glad that I gave it a try!","timestamp_created":1603072579,"timestamp_updated":1603072579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ428qkn/UCeZ7gqAI="}
