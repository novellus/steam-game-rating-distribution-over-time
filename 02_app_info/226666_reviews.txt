It allows you to customize your appearance, your coat of arms and dynasty name and those of vassalized dynasties, the names of your kingdom or other titles. It also allows you to name more dynasty members, not just your children.\n\nThese things together improve your gameplay experience by a lot and can be hilarious: I ruled the republics of Spaghetalia (Italy), Lasagna (Sardinia) and Vermicely (Sicily) as Doge Fusilli of house di Pasta. I couldn't have done that without this DLC.\n\nAn argument can be made that this DLC should be free, because it doesn't add any content. On the other hand, customization in strategy games is not a given (I don't think any other Paradox Grand Strategy game had had any significant amount of customization prior to CK2) nor was it present in the base game. The developers went out of their way to make customization possible and coders probably had to work more than half an hour to implement these features.\n\nBuy this DLC on sale, because it's definitely game changing.","timestamp_created":1609165970,"timestamp_updated":1609165970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpYPx1PYCf4yPvgI="}
