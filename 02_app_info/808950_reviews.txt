And it's true - if you click the \"Theme\" button after loading up the game, there are four books (cultural: Russian, African, Oriental, and Native American, if I remember correctly) that you can color in beautiful patterns. There's actually no challenge to it whatsoever because you can't make a mistake. If you use a color on the wrong spot, it simply won't show. Now the music is nice and it's relaxing enough but I had to wonder.... I actually DO cross stitch and it's not called counted cross stitch for nothing. There's a lot of counting when you cross stitch so why call this game \"Cross-Stitch Puzzle\"? Hahahahahahaha, little did I know. When I finished up all the theme books, I then clicked on the bottom buttons on the main menu page labeled \"Color 1/2\", \"Color 2/4\", and \"Color 3/4\". I was given only part of a pattern and then had to fill in the rest with the correct colors and I COULD make mistakes. The first couple patterns, I thought I had done them correctly and nothing happened. I had to look over them in detail to find out what I did wrong. The thing here is that you're going to have to make your mind work a little differently. Because you're not copying... you're mirroring. You have to turn the pattern backwards to make it work together, if that makes sense. And there's a LOT of counting. Counting counting counting to make sure you're hitting the right color on the right spot. Luckily, I quickly figured out a good way to make sure I was doing it correctly. On the bottom right, there's a number that shows exactly how many squares need to be colored and it counts up to it as you're making the pattern. So, if I wasn't sure I was clicking the right spot, I'd look at that counter. If I clicked and the number went up one, it was the right space. If not, I'd click the erase button and count again. This part of the game is quite challenging but it's FUN challenging. If you like to count, that is. :)  And when you've done enough patterns, your brain will start to adjust and it will become easier. There are 20 patterns for each category - 1/2, 2/4, and 3/4. So 60 pictures to count in all. (This is not counting [excuse my pun] the theme books or free color mode). 1/2 gives you the left side of the pattern and you copy it on the right. 2/4 gives you the top left and bottom right quarters. 3/4 gives you just the top left quarter. That's what I'm working on now and I'm still having a blast making my little ol' brain count. I absolutely recommend this game if what I've written here appeals to you at all. And there are achievements, so your work will feel all that more satisfying.","timestamp_created":1577468686,"timestamp_updated":1577468713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.764114081859588623","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gsudpO8Ce8/A5wE="}
