    review: Wow. Just Wow. The graphics of this game is amazing, If you have the right
      computer to play in Fantastic (Ultra) I haven't had a jumpscare like this before.
      if you would call it a jumpscare (while i was scratching my eye) It's Got Puzzles
      but for me to say it's just a brain teaser. One thing annoyed me was that when
      you tryed to shot the guy in the head. it goes threw him and not only that but
      takes 4-5hits to kill
