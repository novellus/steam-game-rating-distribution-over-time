If that is stuff you do not like to deal with, then stay away from this.\n\nI figured I would give it a try and see how well I could do, but I couldn't even get out of the starting area. I think I had found the door that leads to the exit, but it was locked and I could not find the key anywhere. I figured out how to move around and how to talk to NPCs and recruit them, but that was as far as I could get. This game might be just a little too old school for me.\n\nThe controls are super clunky and have not aged well. I really had to turn my mouse sensitivity down as the game makes it really high. The game only plays in 320x320 with Dos Box, and the font choice can make it hard to read sometimes.\n\nIt also sounds like from other reviews that this game has issues, and game breaking ones at that. I can't say, because I couldn't even get to the second area. Maybe some day I'll try going back to see if I can do better, but for now I have to pass. Like I said if you are someone that's used to how old school rpgs worked, then I would recommend checking it out, especially on a good sale. For more modern gamers out there, This is something you probably will not like. It's old school jank at it's finest.","timestamp_created":1609107632,"timestamp_updated":1609107632,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561732113361358643","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+L2S0/YCdK3zvQI="}
