To break them down:\nUp/W: used to ascend the level, not to move forward\nDown/S: used to descend the level, not for backing up\nLeft/Right/A/D: still move you across the level in said directions but do so isometrically\nIt takes some messing around with to get used to.\n\nThat said, the level designs and play-thru are well worth the price.\n","timestamp_created":1609280869,"timestamp_updated":1609280869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qKqn2PYCdbLLvgI="}
