I am reviewing the soundtrack for this game. I am a big fan of Claude La Bon Bon's work, and I think he did a fine job at it considering the circumstances that he was going through while creating this soundtrack. He had to make several trips to London and the men who run the studio that Dr. House records at made him bring his own fire wire cables, but he didn't have the right one at first because he had the four pin to six pin but he needed the six to six or six to nine pin connector. It resulted in a lot of work lost because he bought the wrong cable. Considering he didn't have the good cable, he did a great job. You can go to their youtube page to hear a lot of the songs that they had to cut from the game and this soundtrack because Claude La Bon Bon got screwed by \"The Man.\" Luckily, when in London he found an English cat. The English cat was a very cute cat and I now call my own cat an English cat because of it and in Claude La Bon Bon's honour.","timestamp_created":1492056683,"timestamp_updated":1492056683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499549955129623413","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n8bgstsCfqzWdg=="}
