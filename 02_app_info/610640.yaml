    about_the_game: While scientists and sceptics argue as to what is causing the
      ominous sounds emanating from the sky known as Sky Quakes, Adam encounters the
      dark phenomenon and begins his own journey to find the source. As the mystery
      unfolds, he finds himself plagued by haunting dreams that turn into an even
      more terrifying reality. Pieces of a complex, otherworldly puzzle begin to fall
      into place as Adam falls apart and his friend Grace desperately tries to hold
      him together. Searching the Internet, she finds eyewitness video by others who
      have heard the sounds. This database becomes a list of victims, who have all
      gone missing after hearing the skyquakes. Fearing she and Adam are next, the
      search to find the source of the sounds becomes a race against time before it
      finds them. Beautifully shot and hauntingly moving, Skyquake is an edge of your
      seat thriller, based on real life events, that far exceeds its humble statistics.
      Sacrificing nothing, audiences will be shocked that it was shot in only 10 days.
      With a talented cast and crew of less than 20, and for a budget far under most
      features' catering costs, Skyquake is a true testament to what indie film is
      all about, keeping audiences talking well after the credits have rolled.

    review: "This is a great psychological horror that kept me guessing till the end.\
      \  It fosters a distinct feeling of unease that kept me feeling it for quite\
      \ some time after my initial viewing.  \n\n[spoiler]It turns out the movie is\
      \ not what you might think from the trailers.  It is still creepy, but in a\
      \ different way, and as it turns out, incredibly tragic. [/spoiler]"
