    review: A beautiful game that I look forward to playing again without interruptions.
      The variety of mini games I found a nice break from the regular. At the end
      of the game wait and watch the credits, it is worth it to see the dancing monster
      knights busting their moves. I thoroughly recommend this game. Well done to
      the developers for such a wonderful game and also for making the bonus chapter
      pick up from the original story.
