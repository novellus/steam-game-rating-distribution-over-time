      /><br><br>Grass Cutter is a game with rare and unique mechanics that requires
      logical thinking and quick reaction speeds. You have to mow the lawns at all
      the sites. At first it seems quite simple ... Right? But it''s not! The game
      contains a real challenge that not every player can manage.<br><br>Almost every
      level is a small puzzle. Solve it and you will be able to find the right solution!
      And this is the easiest part of the game.<br><br>Each lawn mower in the game
      has an energy reserve that is constantly running out. If you forget about the
      energy, then boom, you''ve lost! If you turn in the wrong direction when you
      are near dangerous obstacles, then boom, you''ve lost a part of the valuable
      energy reserve or you lose! If you come into contact with dangerous enemies
      or come under their influence, then boom again, you lose!<br><br>In addition
      to the challenges in the game, there are many rewards and bonuses that will
      keep you interested and make the gameplay even more fun!<br><br>And this is
      just the tip of the iceberg, the most interesting things are in the game itself.<br><br>WARNING:
      The game requires nerves of steel, quick reactions and concentration!<br><br><br><strong>THE
      GAME''S PLOT:</strong><br><br>The well-known, innovative company Grass Xtract,
      which specializes in plant breeding, has been developing new, beautiful and
      thick grass for lawns under the leadership of its CEO Michael Green.<br><br>Under
      pressure from management, the scientists developing grass seed did not have
      time to conduct all the laboratory testing before the company decided to release
      their product. To simplify the grass breeding and speed up the process, a drug
      was invented called leavenatine. Without enough time to calculate the optimum
      amount needed for the process to continue stably, the scientists made a mistake
      and added too much of the drug.<br><br>All this adversely affected the DNA of
      the grass. It began to mutate, leading to the birth of real, live monsters --
      straight out of the lawn. The monsters are threatening the rule of law and the
      life of humanity!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/777490/extras/Monsters.png?t=1563987206"
      /><br><br>They can not be set on fire or poisoned with acid because the components
      released into the environment can infect other plants nearby.<br><br>There is
      only one solution. All the lawns of Grass Xtract clients must be mowed.<br><br>Are
      you ready to face danger and become the hero who will save the world?'
