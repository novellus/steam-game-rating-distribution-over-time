    short_description: In this chapter we will activate surface noise in ZBrush to
      generate procedural masks to quickly create corrosion on our amulet. Next we
      will use the Clay Build Up Brush and the free downloadable Orb Brushes to hand
      sculpt destruction and weathering on our model.
