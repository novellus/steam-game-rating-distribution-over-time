While playing in Dissonant Mode, the Balance gauge is used to power Flash Bombs instead. A Flash Bomb will clear bullets in a radius around you. If a regular enemy is caught in the radius of one, that enemy will be marked. Marked enemies will drop additional items, including extra life and bomb pieces if the enemy is sufficiently powerful.","about_the_game":"<img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/834580\/capsule_616x353.jpg?t=1579804457\" \/><br><br>Touhou Gyakumyouran ~ Ephemeral Unnatural Balance (東方逆妙乱 ~ Ephemeral Unnatural Balance) is a Touhou Project fan game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">♎ STORY ♎<\/h2><br>A peaceful spring in the land of Gensokyo descends into chaos.
