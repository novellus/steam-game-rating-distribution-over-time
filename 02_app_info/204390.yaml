    review: 'So Pineapple Smash Crew,


      Believe it or not this is actually one of the first games i picked up on this
      platform, it just happened to pass by one day and after seeing the neo-retro
      artstyle my compulsive little gamer brain had decided to buy it before my parents''
      bank account could ever object.


      But enough personal exposition. What''s the game like i hear you ask.

      Well in terms of gameplay it stays true to that retro feel i mentioned earlier.
      Though i don''t see that as a bad thing (and i''m never wrong), the mechanics
      that are here feel more polished because of it. The roguelike crew-management
      mechanics are a nice touch too and incentivise you to actually think and strategize
      rather than going in guns a blazing, though there is still more than enough
      opportunity for that don''t worry.


      Closely tied to this aforementioned strategising is the grenade mechanic. In
      the game each of your soldiers can carry a grenade, these ''nades come in many
      different types with each having their own unique behaviour. This is in my humble
      gamer opinion one of the most important mechanics in the game, as it not only
      directly affects the way you play this game but also allows you to quickly switch
      up your style of gameplay if things aren''t really working out. Wanna take things
      more slow? Take the shield and heal grenade. Need some more firepower? Use the
      laser and missile grenades. You get the point.


      Is all of this worth 10 bucks though? If you''d ask me i''d probably say why
      not? I don''t mind supporting indie developers and to me that more than makes
      up for the extra costs. But if you''re short on money i''d suggest you put this
      on your wishlist and wait for the next steam sale. Because if you like top-down
      retro shooters, i think this should be right up your alley.


      Oh and P.S: Game''s got a dope soundtrack'
