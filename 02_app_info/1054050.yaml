    review: "I had this on my Wishlist for some time, and finally got around to trying\
      \ it out. While I have yet to reach the true ending, I wanted to express my\
      \ thoughts with the hours I had so far.\n\nAs the game says, you\u2019re Hero,\
      \ the main dude who killed the demon lord and saved the world. Sadly, you also\
      \ died doing so, and God has given you 5 days to spend your life however you\
      \ like. You have the freedom to go anywhere and do what you like; explore, battle,\
      \ and relearn about the world Hero had forgotten whilst finding your one true\
      \ love.\n\nYou start overpowered, max gold, full equipment and skills- a pretty\
      \ much end game level character. And, as the days go by, you\u2019re weakened\
      \ and stripped of your skills and weapons, your stats decreasing to a point\
      \ you can literally have 1hp and 0mp. Thankfully, you can hire party members\
      \ to join you in your final moments, practically carry your sorry butt through\
      \ the end. (Thomas will always be there to help serve you at the start of every\
      \ new game, but many will have to have a quest completed to join.)\n\nLike every\
      \ JRPG, it\u2019s your regular turn-based system- attack, spells, defend, and\
      \ so on. It\u2019s simple to the core, and more of authentic pleaser as you\u2019\
      ll usually want to end battles in 1-3 turns. Its big focus is on magic elements,\
      \ as enemies will be Fire, Water, Wind, or Normal type in varying ways. (Basically\
      \ Rock-Paper-Scissors.) Nothing spectacular, but this game is meant to be faster\
      \ pace than thought provoking because time is constantly moving, even during\
      \ the battle!\n\nMost of the game will revolve doing small quests and searching\
      \ through dungeons, memorizing the layouts, what items lay within and how to\
      \ obtain them. Events change every playthrough, so it\u2019s best to keep an\
      \ eye out for things you didn\u2019t see before.\nHero will die, a lot. So don\u2019\
      t feel stress if you can\u2019t complete a certain quest in time or struggle\
      \ within dungeons (due to a bad party set up or lacking damage.) Explore and\
      \ experiment, and see what kind of endings you can get doing certain things,\
      \ because there\u2019s a lot of them!\n\nOh, the game also has a neat little\
      \ save replay, so you can look back on all the things you accomplished in your\
      \ five days and how many people mourned for your lost (Like a point system).\
      \ It can be a good motivator to see how many points you can obtain in the end.\n\
      \nOff the subject of the gameplay, the visuals are quite pretty and the battle\
      \ animations are nice to watch when selecting spells or attacking. It\u2019\
      s that usual JRPG look you get from many other games- Elf Forest, Mountain Volcano,\
      \ Dark Lord castle, and so on. And the map is pretty small, so you won\u2019\
      t have too many areas to visit either. It does its job, but it\u2019s nothing\
      \ to write home about.\n\nCharacters are hit or miss, many not really given\
      \ much in background to stand out from the usual stereotypical JRPG trope (Haughty\
      \ Elf Girl, Loli Merchant, Brawny Muscle girl, etc.) You can marry any of your\
      \ female party members though, which is pretty neat. Sadly, Thomas and Zoro\
      \ are only for an achievement.\n\nThere are some pleasant musical beats and\
      \ sounds, but nothing that really stood out to me besides the battle music-\
      \ which is a given for most RPGS. Again, it does the job well enough.\n\nWhile\
      \ the core concept is pretty cool on its own, it may not be for everyone, maybe\
      \ even frustrating if you don\u2019t know how to handle it. Same with the time\
      \ limit- but I feel the game gives you plenty of time to do everything, especially\
      \ if you abuse magic and items to move around.  \n\nI\u2019d probably wait for\
      \ an even bigger sale off, as even 20$ seems a bit high for a quite repetitive\
      \ game. But, if you like the concept, and if you don\u2019t mind repeating certain\
      \ things to the point of perfection, I\u2019d give the game a chance. You can\
      \ easily get through your first playthrough in less than two hours, so if it\
      \ doesn\u2019t come to your liking then, you can refund it.\n\nSlightly Recommended\n"
