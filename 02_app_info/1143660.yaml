    review: 'The pictures are very nice, and a lot are not included in the wallpaper
      DLC. However, the text which describes the design of the characters is written
      in a language I cannot read (Japanese, I assume). So, I can only enjoy a part
      of this DLC, therefore, I think it is a little bit expensive. But I recommend
      this DLC if you enjoyed the wallpapers.
