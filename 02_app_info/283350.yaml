    review: 'Thanks to ZenZone1 for on how to get this to work (works fine on Win
      7 x64):


      See his review on how to get the gamne working! I highly recommend getting steam
      to create the shortcut on your desktop!


      A lot of users are asking for the manual so I have uploaded these to my google
      drive (including a strategy guide). You can find them here:


      https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1w7Tm1SmIHvZ1ZqUXJHVkxNdTA?usp=sharing


      It''s a great game. Very complex. The model aircraft and how it handles are
      stunning, and the sounds in game are excellent for when this game was initially
      developed. I love the external camera view and you can defiantly hear the doppler
      effect. I love how you can watch your enemies die by following your missiles
      to their target. You can provide commands to your wing man and assign them a
      target whilst you concentrate on another. You can even communicate with the
      air bases located around the map.


      Easy to configure your plane for each mission. Dog fights are really good fun,
      though hard in places. I highly recommend viewing the manual and strategy guide
      included in the above link. They will help considerably as the tutorial via
      the peace game mode doesn''t have details on how to fly the aircraft, let alone
      how to operate it''s complex systems on board. Another useful tip, use the autopilot,
      it is there for a reason!


      Overall, a great game for its time. Even now I still enjoy this. Highly recommended;
      especially if you haven''t played this before. I can see myself playing a lot
      of hours on this again (regardless of what steam says as the game won''t run
      via steam play button, it will only run via the shortcut).'
