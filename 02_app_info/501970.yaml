    review: Ah yes, I remember this game, my mother buying it for me at the store,
      getting it home and the excitement of its opening cut scene. It is still great
      to play, the characters acting is professional and really brings the story to
      life. The only thing negative is a few tough spots in game, you will get frustrated,
      but it is totally worth it. Also, i'd have to say this video game (Im pretty
      sure) had the first and most well done portrayal of a gay man in a time when
      being homosexual in film was really hammed up. Really worth checking out, nostalgia
      or not!
