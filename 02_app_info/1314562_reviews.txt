Campaign sucks. Eramis feels like a shitty MCU villain who poses 0 threat.\n2. Sunsetting sucks. It would be fine if Bungie brought in weapons to replace what we've lost, but they added like 5 weapons for the playerbase to grind for. \n3. What the fuck is this price? Why do I have to pay $10 for every season? Every season gets you 2 cutscenes, 1 exotic, 1 armor ornament set, and nothing else. \n4. Fuck Stasis. Stasis is cool on paper, but it's infuriating to play against no matter how good you are.\n5. Fuck Bungie. Bungie released this game as an F2P on Steam, but that's completely false. You NEED to pay for this garbage expansion to have any sort of competitive edge in PVE and PVP. There is nothing a F2P player can get that is worthwhile. \n\nGo play something else and spend your hard-earned cash elsewhere. This shit is a scam and you shouldn't fall into like many of us already have. I've been playing since launch and I've watched the game's quality go down and down post-Forsaken.","timestamp_created":1610001892,"timestamp_updated":1610001892,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqujl7fYCdbqawQI="}
