It's you vs the clock or a faster PB or ever others' PB.\n\nGraphics: It's self-explanatory. mix it up some 8-bit and 16-bit looks. ever see a top down car zooming around in a Mario Bros. Level?\n\n\nControls: Simple pick-up-and-pay. But hard to master the \"Tap Steer\" move.\n\n\nSoundtrack: Alright. Nothing to listen outside the game. it's good neither or less.","timestamp_created":1608307519,"timestamp_updated":1608307519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44aWmu/YCcfWbuwI="}
