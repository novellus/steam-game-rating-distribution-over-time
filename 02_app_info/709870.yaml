    review: "The developer 'racing bros' tends to create these games that somehow\
      \ cause my laptop to overheat and then crash; yet when I play a triple A game,\
      \ my laptop is fine. \n\nBesides that, the objectives of the game is just: go\
      \ here, kill all enemies, rinse and repeat. Not much else except a story that\
      \ sounded like it was juiced poorly out of 'A Nightmare On Elm Street'. Freddy\
      \ Kruger would be disappointed.\n\n\"Every town has an elm street\" -Freddy\
      \ Kruger \n(Except the town in this game)"
