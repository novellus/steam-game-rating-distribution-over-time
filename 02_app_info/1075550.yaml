      \ to craft new weapons, unlock new abilities and special attacks, and transform\
      \ into a powerful Zombro form to smash foes. Explore four character classes\

    review: 'I tried to give this game a good shot (pun intended). Although eating
      your enemies is kind of unique, it just didn''t appeal to me. It just felt weird,
      carefully shooting enemies ''just enough'' to stun them, then eating them. In
      practise it just kills your ''momentum'' and therefore harms the flow of your
      game experience.


      Controls can be a bit awkward, you can choose from two different layouts, but
      you can''t rebind them yourself. Tutorial didn''t explain ''dashing straight
      up'', so I almost gave up when I thought I was stuck.'
