    review: "What a little gem! Simple in design, elegant in execution. Explore a\
      \ small grid of connected rooms - scavenging weapons and items to take on the\
      \ great evil lurking within. The easiest games are when you don\u2019t find\
      \ the Maleficus until late in your exploration; but the most exhilarating game\
      \ is when you find it early. Heart pounding as fast as your fingers on the keyboard,\
      \ moving from room to room as the beast lurches after you, finding just enough\
      \ items to defeat the lesser monsters in your way as you frantically flee, until\
      \ you\u2019ve scavenged enough to turn and fight."
