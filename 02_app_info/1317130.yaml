    about_the_game: "It is 1989, due to a breakthrough success of the so-called Star\
      \ Wars space defense program the United States has become a sole state entirely\
      \ protected from a nuclear weapon attack. Its influence has since spread over\
      \ most of the world through both diplomatic and military measures. <br />\r\n\
      USSR weakened by a devastating defeat in the Afghan War has been swiftly overtaken.\
      \ Many large cities lie in ruin, others are being controlled by the US military\
      \ forces. While the occupants are establishing control over the new territories\
      \ rebels are gaining more and more members each day, many of whom have combat\
      \ experience.<br />\r\nIn the demo you play as a rebel recruit tasked with retrieving\
      \ an item from the enemy base. You can go in guns blazing or take out the guards\
      \ silently (for the most advanced players there is a non lethal way through)."

    short_description: Fight for your loved ones and your country in this third-person
      stealth shooter. Scavenge for weapon parts and supplies to survive and maybe
      even make some profit through trade. Make difficult choices in a branching story
      taking place in an alternative history in which US has invaded USSR in 1989.
