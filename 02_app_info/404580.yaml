    review: Didn't finish the game :( Gets very boring and took me 47 minutes to complete
      the first level, i had to guess what i am doing half the time because it's very
      hard to find. Such as in the first level one having the code on a noodle cup
      even though there is about 100 round the map :( To be honest there is some better
      and funner free games to play
