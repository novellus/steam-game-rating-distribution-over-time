      /><br><strong>Physics System</strong><br>The physics in Monster Collector is
      very realistic.  You can pull monster around (if they are not too big). You
      can punch monster away and they will get balance again from ground. You can
      grab monster and jump with them.<br><strong>Slice System</strong><br>You can
      use sword to slice monster apart  from almost every body part. Slice legs ?
      yes you can . Slice head? yes you can.  Slice body ? yest you can. Slice tail
      ? Yes you can. <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1423090/extras/final_5f5dd95a0116fe0074a862bf_659457__1_.gif?t=1606662988"
      /><br><strong>Stab Slash system</strong><br>Try to stab your monster on the
      wall. or just stab its sliced body part on the wall. Or even stab 3 monster
      all together. Use your imagination.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1423090/extras/final_5f5ddbf33c6d060068ff8e0d_301429__1_.gif?t=1606662988"
      /><br><strong>Tear system</strong><br>Slice is cool. But how about tear monster
      apart with your bare hands?  For some monster you can even tear them apart from
      their long nose.(Elephant? maybe)<br><br>Combine all these system with all the
      unique monsters together. The gameplays are endless. You can kill monsters in
      million ways. Just use your bloody imagination.<br>(More monsters are planed
      to add into the game)
