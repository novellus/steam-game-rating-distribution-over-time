If you're a fan of minesweeper/nonograms or similar logic-based puzzles then this is a great title to pick up.\n\nThere seems to be a save bug where if you save a puzzle, close the game, open it, and load the puzzle, then you won't be able to save the puzzle again properly. So you either finish it in the second session or lose your progress. The other reviews here seem to see that as a deal-breaker, but it's really not that hard to just finish a puzzle within two play sessions...It would be really nice if the developer had fixed it some time over the past year though.\n\nI've almost finished the game and have yet to see any other bugs related to the saves or anything else. The UI is smooth and responsive, and I haven't had any issues with it either.","timestamp_created":1573932176,"timestamp_updated":1573932176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqOLquu4CeJnP2gE="}
