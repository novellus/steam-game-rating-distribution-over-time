It seems to be far better.\n\nUprising: Join or Die is my most favorite games ever, being a mix of RTS and FPS, perhaps one of the first in the genera. Released back in 1997/98, this had filled me with fears as a kid from the designs of the turrets (specially the enemy citadels) and how enemies would simply be \"teleported\" to your position when you least expected, and in the eyes of a 4 year old me, that was scary. When I became a teen I took upon myself to try and play it again, but not only that, try and beat it. And I did! But part of me wishes for more and more of it, and I keep coming back to it every year to do it all over again.\n\nWhen I first saw the release on GOG and here on steam I got hyped seeing how it has achievements and other goodies. \"Finally I can play on windowsX and not on a virtual box!\" I thought, but no. It is extremely unplayable, broken and doesn't load properly. For a game that was abandon-ware to suddenly get \"revived\" to such a horrible state leaves me sad.\n\nTo dive a bit more into the issues I've gotten to:\nSome cutscenes have lost color information and look like a puke of colors while you see it\nThe mouse movement feels like it's on a grid, it's not a smooth movement and I have yet to see mentions of this for some reason. I've changed rigs twice and still have the same issue.\nThis \"modern re-release\" has a feel of cheapness. Like, buying the IP and putting it on sale, but nothing works \"correctly\".\nGoing through the pain of installing a virtual box with WinXP just to play the old abandon-ware version is far FAR better than this steam release.\n\nIt saddens me but eh, it is what it is I guess.","timestamp_created":1609376270,"timestamp_updated":1609376270,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw66CT2/YCfJT6vgI="}
