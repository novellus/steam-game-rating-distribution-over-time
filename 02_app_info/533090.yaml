    review: I never really got around to playing any of the other additions to the
      series besides this one, and the bronze horseman, but I'd like to say that those
      game were my childhood. I played the hell out of them and I'll never forget
      being a little kid getting scared whenever the gremlin would pop up on screen.
      Maybe it's not for everyone, but this franchise has given me a lot of fond memories.
