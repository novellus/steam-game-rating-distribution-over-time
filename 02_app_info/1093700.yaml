      \ Alaska, predators beginning to unbalance the delicate natural order, and tree-eating\
      \ parasites threatening forests recently damaged by a forest fire, Jim is struggling\

    review: 'For those who don''t bother much with the story: this map is rather similar
      to the free ''Layton Lakes'' map - just with a few different animals. This one
      feels like it''d be a better pickup if you''re interested in the geography rather
      than something ''unique''. It''s a great looking map though.


      For a new player, I would pick Silver Ridge or Vurhonga over this and would
      rate this one ''middle-of-the-pack'' IMO.'
