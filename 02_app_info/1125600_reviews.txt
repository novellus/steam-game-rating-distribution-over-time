An experience is set from the parameters allowed in a situation. This games main feature, cannot currently be enjoyed. Because an online multiplayer party game (not unlike the currently popular Fall \"shortstack\" guys) requires other people have bought and are willing to play this game. Unfortunately, this casual party game, has never, and unfortunately unless this review can persuade people, will never have enough people playing it for the game to take off. Sounds fine, and all, but you're here for the gameplay.\n\n[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]\nThis is the non-VR version of a conceptually great idea. It's VR (or in this case non-VR) version of Bumper Cart, where one uses Capitalist greed to get a higher score than your opponent. Game-play takes place in various \"shopping\" environments. The character, armed with 2 scanners, is tasked with competing with opponents for highest score based on cash value. Points are achieved by either \"buying\" (shooting) opponents, collecting valuables (which replace your scanners or weapons), or eliminating opponents by using \"collected\" (scanned) weapons against your opponents. \nAt the end of a round, the characters points \"cash value\" is totaled up to figure out who won. \n\n[h1] Good Fantasy [/h1]\nThis fantasy setting, is the only safe and appropriate reality to experiment with capitalism, without worrying about the racist, fascist, backlash that usually occurs with these awful situations. Anyway, I would love to show this game off at parties, and I'm hoping this review convinces people to play it, and start multiplayer servers.\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\nBuy the game, play the game.\nMaybe other people will play it with you.","timestamp_created":1597042987,"timestamp_updated":1598644543,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528985500335693359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44fuom/QCd4nGmgI="}
