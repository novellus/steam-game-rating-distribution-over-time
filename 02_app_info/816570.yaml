    review: 'I''m quite partial to rail shooters and shooting gallery games. "Desolate"
      is one of those games that I really want to like but can''t recommend.


      First off, the game has problems running smoothly. (My computer is about four
      years old and running Windows 8, but this game doesn''t seem so graphically
      intensive that it should me any trouble.) Whenever you shoot an enemy (excepting
      bosses), the game freezes or lags for a second or so. It doesn''t affect your
      cursor movement but affects everything else. Sometimes your shots register during
      that freeze and sometimes not--it''s hard to tell whether you''ve hit an  enemy
      unless the enemy dies, so often you''ll think you killed an enemy during that,
      but when the game moves normally again you find out you didn''t. There is no
      options menu, no way to tweak graphical settings and try and fix this problem.


      Even without that problem, the game is just too bare-bones. Whenever you finish
      shooting  a wave of enemies, your character walks to a new place (which looks
      good and kind of does invoke the old arcade rail shooters). There''s no interaction
      until your character reaches the next spot to fight enemies "Time Crisis" kind
      of did that, but "Desolate" doesn''t make it work. Each  battle a static screen
      with two or three hotspots. One of three different sprites will pop up in each
      hotspot and not move. You shoot them before they shoot you, and another promptly
      pops up in the same place. Repeat this ten or fifteen times, and then your character
      moves on to a new location. I made it to stage 4 out of 9, and other than boss
      fights, that seems to be all the gameplay there is.


      The environments look pretty nice, but the few enemies are basic and repetetive.
      There is a story, but this is a genre that stands on gameplay, not story. I
      know this is a tiny and ambitious development team creating a budget title.
      I don''t mean to be harsh on them. Sadly, there just isn''t enough variation
      or excitement in the gameplay; if you take away the 3D envireonment, there isn''t
      anything here you couldn''t find in an old flash or DOS shooting gallery game.


      Even when it''s on sale, most gamers hwo aren''t die-hard genre fans would probably
      do better to skip this one. While my review might be different if the technical
      issues were fixed, I would still have strong reservations.'
