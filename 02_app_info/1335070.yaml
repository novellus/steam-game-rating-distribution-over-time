    review: 'A good OST to a rough start of a good underrated JRPG series.


      I do like the traditional bounciness of early 90s Capcom in this OST for most
      of the songs mixed in with SNES style orchestral pieces.


      I really do hope this is a sign of more Breath of Fire to come. I would like
      to see the games hit Steam in a collection one day.'
