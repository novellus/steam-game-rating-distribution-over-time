    reviews: "\u201CA gorgeous FPS that blurs a Hotline Miami palette with a grindhouse\
      \ art style, a Quake-in-CGA aesthetic and a general vibe of lucid divebar nightmare,\
      \ this was one that made me sit up and pay attention from the very first frame...\
      \ The enemies are nasty in all the right ways, the weapons are straight out\
      \ of some forgotten b-movie and the music sounds like that nightmare sex room\
      \ out the back of the Roadhouse bar in Twin Peaks... Genuinely, this feels both\

      Here\u2019s an FPS with an interesting, albeit garish, retro sensibility...\

    review: "Absolutely loved the idea of Midnight Ultra when I saw it.  It kind of\
      \ looked like what would happen if Killer 7 met Duke Nukem with a hazy, phasing\
      \ artwork style wrapping it up.  The unfortunate problem though is that ideas\
      \ don't hit full-tilt unless execution is backing 'em up.  Midnight Ultra falls\
      \ short and it's a shame because with more polish to the gameplay and presentation\
      \ this could have been a good one.  \n\nDon't worry about plot here.  You're\
      \ a bounty hunter/mercenary type with a knack for taking on the supernatural\
      \ and it's your job to clear out a desert area that's become a hive of cultists\
      \ and beasts.  A plus right off the bat was being able to choose different weapon\
      \ sets that include both long-range shooters and melee, hand-to-hand smashers.\
      \  It helps flux the gameplay to suit different styles of FPS players.  After\
      \ that, well the game sort of takes a sharp rudder turn into troubled waters.\
      \  \n\nThe graphics are cool but there is absolutely no impact to animations,\
      \ attacks, etc.  Oftentimes you just line up, press fire and hope for the best.\
      \  It's like gambling in Vegas as to whether or not you're gonna win or lose\
      \ the fight.  Even less responsive is the melee combat which requires a degree\
      \ of closeness that's very hard to judge with the game's chosen graphic style.\
      \  That's a shame because the look is cool but impairs every action that you\
      \ try to perform because of it.  It doesn't lend to having good depth perception\
      \ in combat or exploration.  You'll probably die a fair amount and there is\
      \ some challenge to be had but the game's short-length and the amount of pick-ups\
      \ made it only a fair challenge to complete in just over two hours (as far as\
      \ skill is concerned).  The graphics and shifty, drifty aim/control/visual acuity\
      \ bungs up what should have been the game's best features.  \n\nVariety is also\
      \ a problem as all of the things that made the old school PC shoot 'em ups a\
      \ blast (extensive weapon variety, increasingly dangerous and different enemies\
      \ and attack patterns, bosses, switch puzzling, etc.) aren't really part of\
      \ Midnight Ultra's world.  It's more or less aim and blast and try to squint\
      \ your eyes in certain areas to see which direction you're supposed to head\
      \ next.  That's really all you're doing and the reason this review isn't going\
      \ to be much longer.  \n\nFor its cheap price you can't lose by picking it up\
      \ and giving it a try.  You might love it, you might hate it.  I don't even\
      \ feel neutral with this one.  I didn't have much fun or feel legitimately challenged\
      \ by the game.  There was a certain FPS itch I was hoping to scratch when I\
      \ saw it released but sadly I had to get my fix elsewhere.  I will say this\
      \ though, the stylistic presentation and coolness of weapon set choices are\
      \ certainly something to build on and I think these developers can hit a stride\
      \ in the future.  In the meantime, MU is far too mediocre for me to feel good\
      \ about recommending."
