It can be such fun.\nThe visual effects look bad and that makes them great.\nExactly the same thing can be said about the story too.\nOverall, It's just a terrible movie and that makes it good.\nI really have to give a positive review to this masterpiece.\nSteam deserves a thanks for allowing this to be sold here.","timestamp_created":1547230765,"timestamp_updated":1547230765,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/PuIn+gCcZSLuAE="}
