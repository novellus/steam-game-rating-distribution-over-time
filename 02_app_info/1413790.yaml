    review: 'I purchased the full 10 Minute Game Collection and am going to play them
      in the order they appear in my library. That means this is #4 of 10.


      Know in advance what you are getting. As the collection title suggests, a ten
      minute game is not a triple A title. It is a short game-jam-esque proof of concept
      / working prototype / execution of an idea. At least that''s what I''m going
      to infer from first impressions.


      So far the quality of these little 10 minute games has been superb.  Let me
      say this from the outset; this game is a mini masterpiece.


      We play a dreamer, charged with beating four evil wizards so that he might awaken
      from his slumber and ultimately save the denizens of the dream world.  When
      our hero dies, he is brought back to the starting dream where a dungeon master
      character answers some of his questions and buffs his health.  Explore, die,
      explore, die repeat.  It''s a distilled rogue like.


      Graphics are tiny but evocative.  The world is foreboding and gloomy in a style
      that calls to mind Dark Souls, Zelda, Shadow of the Colossus and just about
      everything in between.  Quite remarkable for a 160x144 resolution display.  Characters
      have a surprising amount of personality for such small sprites.  Dungeons are
      spooky, courtyards are mysterious; golems are solemn and undead creatures are
      freakish.


      There are a number of nice background music tracks that add bucket loads of
      atmosphere.  I purchased the soundtrack on Bandcamp as I really did dig the
      tunes.  The ticking clock beat of MARCH adds a sense of immediacy and drive.  CHIME
      is haunting and melancholic, but definitely creates a spirit of adventure.  When
      it comes to WIZARDRY, there is a playful vibe which belies the difficulty in
      facing down the magical adversaries.  Finally we have SLIME which has an unsettling
      hum of evil deep within the quirky discordant main track.


      Gameplay is simple but subversive.  That is not to say the game is easy, rather
      the opposite, but I mean it is simple to understand what is expected of the
      player.  This is a single stick shooter if such a thing exists.  It can be difficult
      to get used to aiming and moving with the same keys or control stick, but once
      you get used to the system, more complexities reveal themselves.  Deflecting
      projectiles and angling attacks off walls soon become second nature.


      Aside from the combat, there are also some puzzle elements to overcome.  Immovable
      creatures which must be moved.  Undefeatable foes which must be defeated.  Each
      tiny bit of progress feels monumental.


      It is easy to forget while playing, that this is a TEN MINUTE GAME.  In fact,
      I played for an hour and was beguiled the whole time.  It''s a real microcosm
      of a game.  It is minuscule and yet expands so far beyond it''s own boundaries
      as to become huge.  There is so much potential in this game, and I am excited
      to see what the developers dream up for Issue 1.  I would very much like to
      see a whole volume of stories appear over time.


      In the comic book world, an issue zero of a given title is usually a precursor
      to the main narrative.  It contains background on characters or events that
      will become central to the ongoing plot.  Sometimes it is a promotional comic
      designed to garner greater interest in the ongoing series, and very often it
      becomes a much sought after collectable.


      I''m going to bag and board HANDMADEDEATHLABYRINTH Issue 0 for now, but will
      likely return to it before I play Issue 1.  I wish the creative team all the
      best for the future.'
