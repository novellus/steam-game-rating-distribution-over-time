    about_the_game: '<strong>MAINFRAME DEFENDERS</strong> - tactical retrofuturistic
      strategy game.<br>A computer virus have infiltrated Microlinc Dynamics  AI controlled
      research complex. While AI itself is intact, most of its subservient units are
      controlled by virus. Lead squad of 4 prototype units on mission to defend complex
      mainframe. You''ll have to repel assaults, destroy unit fabricators, download
      valuable data, clear infected nodes and do more on your way to deepest parts
      of the complex. Work around item limitations and drawbacks to build powerful
      combinations. Destroy your enemies with diverse tactics: overheat them, melt
      with corrosion, absorb damage and return fire. Don''t rely on a single strategy
      too much, though - enemies might have a way to counter it. But above everything
      else: defend the Mainframe!<br><br><strong>* RETRO STYLE:</strong> Graphics,
      inspired by 80s terminal PC with hybrid synthwave soundtrack.<br><br><strong>*
      DIVERSE TACTICS:</strong> Cook enemy robots to death, bury them under your bullets,
      eliminate with single powerful shot, or render your opponents useless with debuffs
      - this game is designed with a lot of viable strategies in mind.<br><br><strong>*
      BUILD YOUR SQUAD:</strong> Similar to how in card games you have to build your
      deck, in MAINFRAME DEFENDERS you have to combine different items with unique
      abilities, to create unstopable squad. Work around item drawbacks or double
      down on them, creating flawed, yet powerful build! <strong>Over 100 obtainable
      items</strong> in demo version alone!<br><br><strong>* UNIQUE ENEMIES:</strong>
      Enemy squad woun''t sit idle, though. Each unit have its own role in squad,
      and designed to couter certain strategies. Pick your targets wisely, or you
      will lose.<br><br><strong>* PROCEDURAL LEVELS:</strong> Hand-made rooms are
      combined with procedural generation to create random levels. Missions have differing
      objectives, combined with unique mission conditions. Will you accept the challenge
      or avoid the unknown and risk to fall behind?'
