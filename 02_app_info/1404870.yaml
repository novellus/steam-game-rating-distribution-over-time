    review: "My initial impression is that this would play ALOT better on a touchscreen.\
      \ It feels a bit janky doing it with the keyboard but it's alot better with\
      \ a controller. \n\nGame is hard as fuck on survival. A bit of impossible game\
      \ vibes there but there are also a campaign where you can get a better feels\
      \ for the controls before doing survival."
