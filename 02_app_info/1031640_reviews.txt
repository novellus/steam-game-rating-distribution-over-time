In this game the player needs to collect all the orbs to make the exit portal to appear, and then he can travel to the next level. A really nice idea is if the player did a mistake, a new orb will spawn and collected orbs will remain collected, so, the player can continue like nothing happened.","timestamp_created":1601752153,"timestamp_updated":1601752153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4usf39/QCeYvWpQI="}
