Some people will see similarities in game play like Hotline Miami or the Original GTA mainly because of the top down view but instead of having to kill anyone or etc, It's simply get out of the car, find the delivery point, drop it off and get out. Provides many lols, Its worth a whirl, I liked it.\n \nSo yeah, good work lads. :)","timestamp_created":1458213359,"timestamp_updated":1607328985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+r2RnvYCfua9Uw=="}
