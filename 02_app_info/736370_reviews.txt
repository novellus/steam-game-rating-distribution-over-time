To make it worse, the game is more enjoyable with a larger army, but you need to unlock the slots for it. So you dish out a few bucks for the extra slots, but then you notice that even fewer people are playing with larger armies. \n\nTo make things worse, it you dare point this out to the developer, you get banned from the discussio forum, even if you make a respectful and constructive criticism of the game.\n\nI would have loved to give this game a thumbs up, but can't, and being banned from the discussion forum encouraged me to give a thumbs down review.","timestamp_created":1541912187,"timestamp_updated":1541912187,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h5rIgOcCc/3ErgE="}
