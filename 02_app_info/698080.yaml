    review: 'The game is pretty bare-bones, but what makes me refund it is, essentially,
      a game-breaking bug, that makes the camera pan out, when you have a big group
      of mobs and are moving fast, but never pans back in, making the game unplayable,
      since the player can''t move around, because the camera doesn''t follow them
      anymore.


      Otherwise, I am pretty happy with the concept. It requires a lot more work and
      the way you search for things and places to progress, without any indication,
      is not to my taste. Nevertheless, it reminds me of the flash games I played
      a long time ago.

      The price tag isn''t outrageous, by any means, and I hope  putting a price on
      this means the developer wishes to put the time in and improve. However, I am
      not willing to put the money down just yet, especially while I can''t progress.


      TL:DR A supposed game-breaking bug, in a good concept of a game, that still
      needs to, and more importantly, can improve.'
