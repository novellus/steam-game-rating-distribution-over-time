    review: "I desperately want to love this game, and I do-- but it's a messy, complicated\
      \ love.\n\nOverall, I think everyone should check this game out if it interests\
      \ them. The charm factor is off the hook, and I love this game for that alone.\
      \ But this game isn't perfect, there's some definite flaws; ones that have given\
      \ me frustration and rage throughout my playthrough. I'll provide my pros and\
      \ cons, starting with the cons. I'll stick with 2 for each to keep things simple,\
      \ but I still implore you to check the game out for yourself and develop your\
      \ own opinion. I can tell this game has a lot of love put into it, so I don't\
      \ want this review to act as a definite summarization-- this game is beautiful\
      \ and deserving of your time.\n\n___ THE CONS ___\n\n1) Difficulty\n\nSomething\
      \ about this game's difficulty ranges from challenging, but fair... to just\
      \ outright bull$@!#. The levels are procedurally generated which I feel is this\
      \ game's biggest caveat. You have to focus on so many different things in this\
      \ game, it feels like a sick joke that the levels are entirely unpredictable.\
      \ There have been situations where I've gone through an entire fight without\
      \ a single healing item, and other fights where I'm constantly being healed.\
      \ The platforming is tricky enough without the levels constantly changing on\
      \ you. It reaches \"controller throwing\" levels of frustration because you\
      \ just don't feel like it's your fault.\n\nThere's also something just outright\
      \ difficult about the way these bosses work. As of typing this review, I'm stuck\
      \ on \"Yama, the God of Death\", which is the 5th Kaiju you fight. Now, I haven't\
      \ gotten close to beating Yama once in my two hours trying their stage. I've\
      \ definitely died over 100 times, and it's just hard to understand what I'm\
      \ doing wrong. The level changes each time-- so it's not like I can just continue\
      \ playing until I understand the level layout. As mentioned before, you have\
      \ so many different things to focus on, which in turn makes these fights even\
      \ more stressful. Every Kaiju has their own unique projectiles that they're\
      \ sure to fill the screen with. You counter with your own projectiles of course,\
      \ but not all projectiles were made equal. Some Kaiju will shrug off a projectile\
      \ that works better for another Kaiju. You have to find out what works best\
      \ while also avoiding instant death pits, the hundreds of bullets flying your\
      \ way, and the Kaiju who is more than happy to delete your character if you\
      \ come too close.\n\nIt's not like I don't enjoy a challenge, but I feel like\
      \ there's a reason why as of this review, 0% of players have the achievement\
      \ for defeating Yama. Maybe this game needs a difficulty slider to go along\
      \ with its procedural generation... but I just think it needs to be easier in\
      \ general. \n\n2) Game feedback/presentation\n\nI'll keep this short and sweet,\
      \ this game is kind of hard to figure out... at first. Everything seems self\
      \ explanatory, but I feel as if this game could use a bit more feedback to help\
      \ the player understand what they're doing right or wrong. Maybe some game tips,\
      \ a tutorial, or even basic things such as distinct, clear sound effects in\
      \ cutscenes as well as the gameplay to help the player understand what's going\
      \ on. Obviously you can see the Kaiju's healthbar decrease and know you're doing\
      \ damage... but I feel it'd be a lot better if we could also have some indication\
      \ on what works best against each Kaiju, what a Kaiju's \"vulnerable\" spot\
      \ is, and just some feedback in cutscenes to add a bit of kick to the overall\
      \ presentation.\n\nAnd now...\n\n___ THE PROS ___\n\n1) Gameplay\n\nOkay, I\
      \ know what you're thinking. You complained about the difficulty being completely\
      \ asinine, going so far as to say it's rage inducing... so how is the gameplay\
      \ a pro? Well, while I do think the difficulty is a bit bonkers, I just can't\
      \ stop playing, even when the game is coming off as total bull$%@#. Here's why.\n\
      \nThis is a 2D platformer shoot 'em up, where you have to effectively utilize\
      \ your kite to shoot, as well as move. I don't know how this idea came into\
      \ fruition, and I'm just as dumbfounded at how it works so well. You have to\
      \ manage two health bars: one for your little dude, and the other for the kite.\
      \ You have to manage what projectile you're throwing, as well as ensuring your\
      \ kite is always at an optimal position for a precise jump. It's absolute insanity\
      \ when you start playing, but I just find it so goddamn fun. I mean, don't get\
      \ me wrong, I'm screaming at my monitor. I've called my little dude some very\
      \ mean-spirited things, I've thrown more insults at the Kaijus than I like to\
      \ admit... but I keep coming back despite my frustrations because at its very\
      \ core, this is a game that I feel should've been a mess, but isn't. I just\
      \ love how this game feels, and though it's quite tricky to understand how the\
      \ game physics work with your kite, give it some time, and you'll be flying\
      \ in no time.\n\n2) The writing/kaiju/art design\n\nNow look, clearly I haven't\
      \ beaten the game yet. Maybe there's more to be said on this, and I'll definitely\
      \ provide some edit notes whenever I do beat the game if there is more to be\
      \ said. But from what I've experienced so far, this writing is so damn charming.\
      \ I mean, I don't expect anyone to purchase this game for the writing alone,\
      \ but I feel it definitely adds to this game's \"messy brilliance\", for lack\
      \ of a better term. It's very tounge-and-cheek, but that's what makes it great.\
      \ It has gotten genuine laughs out of me which is no small feat, I assure you.\
      \ \n\nAnd if I don't mention the Kaiju design I'll never forgive myself. These\
      \ Kaiju are just oozing charm. I love looking at them, I love their animation,\
      \ I love the art design in general. This is a game that, aesthetically, hits\
      \ every checkmark in my opinion. If you're looking at screenshots thinking this\
      \ game looks interesting, then you owe it to yourself to buy it. \n\nPerhaps\
      \ you've caught on to something... my pros and cons are on basically the same\
      \ categories. Gameplay and presentation. How can they be both good and bad?\
      \ Well... the easy answer is \"see for yourself\". The long answer is buried\
      \ deep in this review, but I'll try my best to sum it all up here. This game\
      \ is flawed at its core; gameplay and presentation are the core aspects of a\
      \ game. So maybe you're a math person and you think this means the game is just\
      \ a 5/10. That's not the case. I think putting a numerical score for this game\
      \ is a disservice.\n\nAll in all, this game has made me a fan of the developer\
      \ PWCA and I'm more than willing to support their future games. I feel this\
      \ game isn't perfect, but it's one that almost nails what it was going for.\
      \ With some tweaks to its difficulty, and some additional sound effects, songs,\
      \ maybe even voice acting, this game will be a definite must-buy. While I feel\
      \ this game IS a must-buy, I will say that only goes for the person who is already\
      \ interested. If you've found this game and are thinking about getting it, definitely\
      \ do so. If you don't really have much interest in this game and this review\
      \ didn't do that any favors, I don't blame you for giving it a pass.\n\nI applaud\
      \ PWCA for what they've done here, this feels like a lovely, joyous game that\
      \ I just wish I could beat. I hope there's encouragement to fix this game up\
      \ and move onto the next project, as I'd love to give this game a second go\
      \ if it ever gets tweaked. \n\nThough it has left me with a broken keyboard\
      \ (I blame Fashisuto) and a lingering sense of defeat... I don't regret any\
      \ minute that I spent on this game. I'd do it all again in a heartbeat, and\
      \ you can bet I'll continue playing this game for as long as I feel like it."
