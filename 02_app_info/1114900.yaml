    about_the_game: "With Ayo the Clown, we\u2019d like to reintroduce you to the\
      \ incredibly fun platformer games of the \u201890s where platforming is accompanied\
      \ by an inspiring and memorable story. <br><br>Ayo the clown has a very unique\
      \ and cute art style that everybody loves. Expect the unexpected as this clown\
      \ takes you through a world of imagination. <br><br>In Ayo\u2019s hometown,\
      \ things are generally peaceful. He juggles in the park with his talented circus\
      \ dog, Bo, hangs out at the carnival, and longs after the shoemaker\u2019s granddaughter.\
      \ Until one day, his dog goes missing! <br><br>You play as Ayo, your not-so-average\
      \ clown embarking on an epic journey in search of his missing (or perhaps ran\
      \ away, or kidnapped?!) best friend and beloved dog, named Bo. What happened\
      \ to Bo? Will they ever juggle together at the park again? Or put together a\
      \ legit circus act? You\u2019ll find out along this incredible adventure as\
      \ you struggle to reunite clown and dog. Like all good adventures, you won\u2019\
      t be all on your own. Ayo\u2019s world is full of friendly people and interesting\
      \ creatures that are willing to lend a helping hand.<br><br><strong>FEATURES:</strong><br><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Unique Platforms-</strong>  The most important\
      \ part of any platform game, each stage has a unique theme and interesting platforms\
      \ to ensure gaming is fun and not repetitive. Ayo is not the kind of clown to\
      \ make the same old jokes over and over again. His jokes get better each time.\
      \ <br></li><li><strong>Huge Bosses</strong> and loads of enemies- Take on bosses\
      \ bigger than life itself and prove that clowns are much tougher than they seem.\
