I played it on ets 2, but still it is a big challenge to turn into corners without clipping the trailer, but after getting used to it, it is pretty easy to do 0% damage and deliver them safe. \nI would recommend this to people who can easily transport regular deliveries without any problems.\nTo those who are still new to the game and have trouble in regular deliveries I would say, it will be way too hard for you, but still you can try it. I mean seriously on this game I had to deliver a house xD like for real a house was on my trailer, (Turnkey House Construction) I could barely look behind. \nOverall. I would say give it a try.","timestamp_created":1609840725,"timestamp_updated":1609841025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/pOA6fYCcN7TwAI="}
