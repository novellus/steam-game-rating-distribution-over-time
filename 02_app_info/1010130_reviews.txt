The main reason to buy it was that DTG put a lot of effort in updating the RT route. I have some mixed feelings:\n\n1. The model looks good, but does not offer a new driving experience.\n2. It has two nice features, destination boards and the thyristor sound.\n3. Wagons do not add anything new.\n4. The AFB function is  bugged.\n5. The three scenarios are dissapointing, just ordinary drives. One of them is supposed to drive an empty train, but passengengers are still visible.\n6. A fair number of services is added and the variety in stock doubles in service mode. But the services seem not to add any interesting game play.\n6. You can use the loco for the MSB route and some other newer routes  as well, though no new services or gameplay will be added.\n\nAs said, mixed feelings. A missed opportunity to add some yard tasks (switches were changed to manual, but you cannot access the yard areas). I decided for a downvote this time, but for half price it still may be an interesting purchase.","timestamp_created":1555441593,"timestamp_updated":1608541516,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.693502128124237061","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjvaiwvYCdZCuvwE="}
