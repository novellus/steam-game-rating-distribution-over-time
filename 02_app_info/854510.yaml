    developer_response: "Hi, i'm sorry you are having problems with the game.\n\n\
      I've been working over the weekend trying to replicate your problem but I haven't\
      \ been able to no matter what I do. If you haven't already, please try removing\
      \ the game and reinstalling it, and I am releasing a patch after updating unity\
      \ to it's latest version but if this still doesn't help all I can suggest is\
      \ refunding.\n\nHowever I did encounter a similar hanging on start up problem\
      \ earlier in development, however in my case this was due to my GTX 1070's imminent\
      \ death after it started occasionally blue screening a month earlier when playing\
      \ the Witcher 3. After the card stopped working completely and I started using\
      \ the cpu's onboard graphics the hang on start up no longer happened. If you\
      \ are also having odd problems with other games or occasional blue screens this\
      \ may be the cause. \n\nI sincerely hope this isn't the problem you are facing."

      my way.


      Game now hanging on startup - hopefully a patch is coming quickly, otherwise
      I will refund.'
