    review: Last update was over 1 year ago.  The game was't really that enjoyable
      in it's current state, but there are many games I have that I just let sit to
      be reevaluated when updates come in. Since it's been over a year since this
      game got anything (It's october 2019 and the last update was Sept 2018)  I'm
      going to say  that it looks like this is all you get, and that is not worth
      it.
