I bought Drones the day it released and had a very unique experience. I was streaming the game, and the developer was active in my stream as I played. There were bugs like any other game upon release, but this time the developer was actively trying to fix them as I played and asked for my feedback on the game. There were times where the developer would have me restart the game because he had poured over the code and fixed bugs I was finding as I played. He was friendly and helpful, and for that alone I would rate this game 10/10. He is truly passionate and cares that the game is the best it can be. The game isn’t entirely my style, but I stilled enjoyed it greatly. It was kind of repetitive at first, but that is due to the fact that it is challenging enough to push you to play better, learn the tricks, and invest the time into unlocking upgrades. It is visually appealing, the music fits well, the graphics are well done. So those get a 10/10. My greatest complaint would be the mechanics and bugs. I don't have much experience with games that aren't from some big name company with many employees and a huge budget, so this game was finitely a change of pace for me. The movement can be choppy at times, the doors hitboxes are weird, and some other minor bugs like getting stuck in a wall and having to use a grenade to get out. It would not surprise me if a couple days after I post this review the developer has already fixed the problems I have presented. I guess that's the upside to a small developer, they are invested in their product, instead of cash-grabbing. I would highly recommend this game. It is well worth the price, and your feedback will be valued. That’s the only reason I went out of my way to actual write a review.","timestamp_created":1574738413,"timestamp_updated":1574738413,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.600544750690460205","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43Kju0u4CfbDY3AE="}
