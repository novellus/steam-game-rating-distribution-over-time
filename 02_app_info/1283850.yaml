    review: "[i] My Experience [/i]\n\nMaryPark St. is a challenge to review. It contains\
      \ two frustratingly aimless gameplay sections, and in each I considered calling\
      \ it quits. However - without these sections, would the game so vividly create\
      \ the emotional experience that it does?\n\nThere are points in life (or there\
      \ have been points in my life, at least) where you are so desperate for companionship\
      \ and connection, that you go on dates with people that you are clearly incompatible\
      \ with and maintain stale text conversations in the hopes that the two of you\
      \ will eventually experience some miraculous and magical connection. \n\nWhen\
      \ self-worth is contingent upon the creation of real relationships from these\
      \ bad seeds, it can be difficult to perceive that you're trying to draw water\
      \ from an empty well. You just push forward, over and over again, into a wall.\
      \ There are other sources of water around, but they might as well be invisible.\n\
      \nDeveloper Starless Studios depicts this emotional state through their game\
      \ much better than I ever could through words. If you'd like a game that creates\
      \ a unique emotion for the player not often seen in gaming (as opposed to power,\
      \ wonder, etc.), give MaryPark St. a try."
