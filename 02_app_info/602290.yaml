    review: "Jack Orlando has - hands down - one of the best jazz soundtracks I ever\
      \ heard. I love every single song from the start and of course I also wanted\
      \ to support the person who wrote the OST, Harold Faltermeyer, by buying the\
      \ soundtrack here on steam.\n\n\u201EIntroduction\u201C already confused me\
      \ and I seriously thought Steam gave me the wrong files. It\u2018s a rap song\
      \ performed by Vanessa Ekpenyong who can clearly sing (I checked her stuff on\
      \ youtube), but wtf does that song have to do with Jack Orlando? Did I miss\
      \ something?\n\n\u201EJack Orlando Main Theme\u201C is at least within the genre\
      \ I expected, but I don\u2018t really remember hearing that song in one of the\
      \ JO versions I played. It\u2018s clearly not the song from the menu. Or any\
      \ song which could be close to \u201EMain Theme\u201C.\n\n\u201EIn The City\u201C\
      \ is finally the first song I remember and love. And it\u2018s even the same\
      \ version as in the game. \n\n\u201EStreets Of Crime\u201C also sounds familiar\
      \ but the version on the soundtrack is a bad remix. No, it did not land there\
      \ by accident. This is the version the composer wanted to have on the OST. At\
      \ least it\u2018s the original song... they just added beats on top of it. Another\
      \ skip.\n\n\u201EI close my eyes and think of you\u201C has a woman singing,\
      \ it may have been in the game or not, at this point I don\u2018t care anymore\
      \ because they again added beats and bass on top of a great song. \nThose beats\
      \ sound like those free beats which were in hip-hop ejay. I was only waiting\
      \ for the \u201Eclash clash bang bang hiphop jam gangster slang\u201C computer\
      \ choir. Keep it moving gotta keep it moving. Back to the JO OST.\n\n\u201E\
      Casino\u201C doesn\u2018t sound familiar at all. Maybe I wasn\u2018t far enough\
      \ in the game.\n\n\u201EThe Night Time Is the Right Time\u201C please please\
      \ please don\u2018t mess this one up... And there are the hip hop beats again.\
      \ Messed up the best song, GREAT!!!\n\n\u201EMystique\u201C sounds familiar\
      \ but just average.\n\n\u201EBlues At The Harbour\u201C Hell yes, another wonderful\
      \ saxophone song. I absolutely love that one too. They actually didn\u2018t\
      \ rape this one and left it to rot on the streets.\n\n\u201EScaletti and the\
      \ Bad Guys\u201C Absolutely okay version, but not representative for the JO\
      \ OST.\n\n\u201EThe Attack\u201C. Well I heard parts of that song in the game\
      \ but I don\u2018t really remember it. \n\n\u201EEpilog\u201C is the song from\
      \ the menu (Sax sets in at 0:48), unfortunately it\u2018s also not the version\
      \ from the game. But this one is actually good. The bass and the beats are okay\
      \ this time. \n\n\u201EMilitary Grounds\u201C Okay. What is going on.\n\n\u201E\
      The Night Time Is The Right Time (Authentic Swing Version)\u201C is tagged wrong:\
      \ This is actually \u201EClose My Eyes And Think Of You (Swinging Version)\u201C\
      \ and should be tagged like this.\nHowever, this version is soooo much better\
      \ than the other version from before.\n\n\nSo... This OST is a mess. I absolutely\
      \ regret buying it because I could have had the same for free and even the correct\
      \ versions on Youtube. At least I only paid less than \u20AC 3,- for it and\
      \ it has 2-3 good songs. \n\nBefore you buy, please check the OST on Youtube\
      \ and decide after hearing these versions."
