If it were free, I would have immediately removed it from my Steam library. If the game gets fixed, I am willing to change my review. The main issue I have is that if I shoot the ball like I normally would, it hardly goes anywhere, but if I flick my wrist a little more during the release, the ball takes off like a line drive. Even if I'm standing right next to the basket, which even has an oversized rim, you will have an extremely difficult time finding a groove. Using the backboard for a shit doesn't help either. I think I got lucky when I hit 3 layups in a row. Please fix this shot mechanic at least.","timestamp_created":1596334765,"timestamp_updated":1596334765,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557801604270935059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vO691vMCd5fymAI="}
