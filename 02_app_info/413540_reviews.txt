The game doesn't have enough content nor does it feel quite polished enough for what it wants but the devs are active and constantly updating so that could change in the future.\n\nAs a puzzle game, this game is... not too hard, really. The puzzles get bigger more than they get trickier, though the later puzzle levels (8 and on) can certainly provide a decent mental workout. But there's definitely a decent bit of variety, up to continuing to introduce elements even in the last levels of the game. And it does feel like every type of puzzle the game presents is developed about as far as it can be, though there are certainly a few that overstay their welcome. There's a nice feeling of progression throughout though, each level is an interconnected hub of smaller puzzles and picking apart one piece unlocks two more, the real joy is finding the ways all the separate pieces interact with each other to get the secret pickups, honestly. \n\nThe combat is... a bit weak honestly, since it's all indirect. You throw deployables that do the fighting for you, at least until you unlock the bonus weapon waaayyy near the end of the game that is. There are really only two or three weapons worth using out of the eight available. And the enemies tend to be an annoyance more than a threat. Death is pretty cheap, either just sending you back to a checkpoint with no penalty or dropping all your collected items in the wave rush and payload levels but allowing you to pick up half of them again, and if you're playing it smart you don't keep a large stash anyways. The wave rush levels in particular feel just a bit unnecessary since the combat is never a strong point, but there's few of them and technically you can finish them all in seconds if you want to. The payload levels are a nice change of pace, there's a time limit but not a very strict one and it's easy to extend it as well. I dig this level style a lot more than the wave rush levels. And I do admire that there's diversity in level types, showing off different aspects of the game. The optional race things that appear in every level are another nice little bonus though there's no incentive to beat the best time and trying to do so tends to be the only real source of frustration in the game.\n\nWhere the game really works best is in its movement, which is kept consistently fast allowing you to travel large distances with little hassle. And there's even little quirks of the game engine you're expected to discover and exploit a few times. Movement in this game just feels fun, though if you had to be really precise with it I'm sure it'd wear off, but it's distinctly different for a puzzle game. The other aspect of the game that's particularly memorable is the dialogue between the two main characters, which I enjoyed a lot more than I expected to honestly. There's an air of mystery to the overarching plot that plays well into the conversations, a lot of \"AI not understanding humans\" bits that develop into some serious snark towards humanity by the end and plenty of genuinely funny quips. And there's just, so many dialogues too, I haven't even found them all yet I'm sure, even with how much I have found. There's also some nice little easter eggs tucked away that you can get near the end, they're pretty fun to hunt for and decently clever.\n\nThe game also looks pretty solid visually though the game's aesthetic is a bit limited, it kind of wears off after a number of hours playing. And the soundtrack is nice for what it is but definitely a bit restricted, since it's the same set of songs playing on loop for the entirety of the game. You'll probably have them all memorized by the time you beat the game. I eventually just turned the music off and used my own music to stop from going insane.\n\nIt's definitely a pretty good game but I wouldn't say it's a great one. Regardless I definitely enjoyed playing it and I would recommend it... on sale.\n\nUpdate on Feb 1st, 2019:\n\nHmm... they basically redid a lot of the game. New puzzle elements, completely redone wave rush and payload levels, revamped graphics... I think the graphics are probably more \"interesting\" than the original graphics were but at the same time they look kind of like rainbow vomit. The real change for the worse is the nerfing of the wave rush and payload levels which are all now basically completely identical, when in the past they were certainly much more interesting, not the best parts of the game sure, but, interesting. Most of the new puzzle elements are interesting enough, too, and while I don't remember the original game quite enough to be certain it feels like there are some quality of life fixes too, less having to follow cables all over the place with the node system in place and a lot more doors that stay open when you unlock them. I'd recommend it still, again not for full price, but it's, fun enough and I enjoyed replaying it well enough.","timestamp_created":1477807951,"timestamp_updated":1549086444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnumv1ugCf+qtZA=="}
