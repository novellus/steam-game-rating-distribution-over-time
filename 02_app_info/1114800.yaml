    review: 'Alright this redux helps make the game a bit easier now that you can
      take 3 hits instead of dying from the first bullet you see

      but room 13 is way too hard when your friend dies in 1 hit (i dont think he/she
      could die in the original version) so im currently stuck there it just takes
      so long to kill all the enemies and then you have to be careful enough that
      your friend doesnt die and when he/she eventually dies you have to shoot down
      enemies for couple minutes


      edit there is a bug with the bullet reflecting melee attack where the instead
      of reflecting it back it stops it on place which most of the times means you''ll
      run into it'
