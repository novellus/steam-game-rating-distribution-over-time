      where the player must navigate an advanced underground base whilst occasionally
      avoiding the alien creature that stalks you.<br><br>As a new employee of the
      mega corporation Abbotsfield Corp, you have arrived on Cadmus, a planet far
      from Earth. Once home to an ancient alien civilization, you have been sent to
      support the research team. However, upon waking from your long cryo sleep, you
      discover that something has gone horribly, fatally wrong in the base beneath
      the surface.<br><br>Set in the distant future, advanced contact lenses are now
      commonplace, and are used as one of the main forms of computing. Owing to the
      specific light frequency emitted, the alien inside the base is able to sense
      when you are nearby. Your only hope for survival is to keep your eyes closed
      and not get too close.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Narrative
