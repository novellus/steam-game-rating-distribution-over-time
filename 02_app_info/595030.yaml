    review: "[h1]Please -- the illegitimate child of a deep-web video game and a .exe\
      \ game[/h1]\n\nThis title plays like a virus. A confused, sick and ultimately\
      \ volatile virus that does not care about the player. But maybe that's the purpose\
      \ behind [b]Please?[/b] I am not here to recommend this game, because it is\
      \ incomplete and has its fair share of control issues and graphic bugs. The\
      \ walls have a moving static texture that is incompatible with most resolutions\
      \ and causes minor crashes. The game is short (about 10mins or so) and there\
      \ really is no cohesive narrative -- just a Jean Paul Satre quote on the protagonists'\
      \ journal. The abridged version of this review is functionally: [b]don't buy\
      \ it[/b] or [b]do buy it but expect a flawed and desolated horror game that\
      \ may have set the stage for [i]the deep-web sub genre[/i][/b].\n\nThe graphics\
      \ are grimey, the music is some off-beat, anti-aesthetic dubstep that is triggered\
      \ when you have an enemy near but then never goes away. The controls are also\
      \ a mess. Your mouse bugs out most times you inspect a puzzle and you have to\
      \ kind of right-click and drag the camera back into view. There is no cohesive\
      \ narrative, just random mumblings, disparate ruminations and one or two journal\
      \ entries. This title actually reminded me a lot of [b]Sad Satan,[/b] an alleged\
      \ authentic deep-web game that not only is a virus, but has a similar nihilistic\
      \ playstyle -- devoid of the gore and sexual assault porn of course. There is\
      \ a new sub-genre brewing, or maybe it already exists; nevertheless, this title\
      \ along with Sad Satan belong to it. \n\nIt's a genre I believe could be done\
      \ well. In film theory, for instance, The Room by Tommy Wiseau is considered\
      \ to be the worst film of all time -- but it's still taught in film school.\
      \ Why? Because you can learn so much from the misunderstandings and mistakes\
      \ of others. For the purpose of a fair review, I am going to list a few things\
      \ that I believe [b]Please[/b] got right in the context of placing it in the\
      \ \"deep web\" subgenre:\n\n[list]\n[*]Gritty grayscale, black and white color\
      \ scheme\n[*]Grimey textures that you can almost unfortunately feel\n[*]Off-beat,\
      \ off-thematic, irrational music that is hard to play through\n[*]An overall\
      \ lack of care for the player. Items you pick up seem to serve no purpose, events\
      \ trigger for apparently no reason, and so forth.\n[/list]\n\nI geniunely do\
      \ not know how I finished the game. I just kept playing until I was bombarded\
      \ with flashing lights, images and jump scares until I unlocked the achievement\
      \ for finishing the game. I felt cheated out of time. No clear purpose, a lack\
      \ of akwoledgement from the game -- in a way, it truly felt like I had just\
      \ entered an incomplete hell maze. And I mean incomplete in a very literal sense.\
      \ I walked to the edge of one of the levels and the walls were not finished.\
      \ There was an empty black gap that started into the abyss of Please. All in\
      \ all, not a good game. At least by traditional standards and the binary choice\
      \ of \"Yes\" or \"No\". I would not recommend this game to the public, but I\
      \ know one or two people who could make something out of it.\n\n[h1]If you enjoy\
      \ the way I review games, consider joining and following my curator group! It\
      \ comes with a fun discord channel for horror fans to chill and game. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/malkavianmadness]Malkavian\
