With around an hour or less so of gameplay and around an hour an a half if you're going for 100%, don't expect a lengthy session. You can beat it in one go, but that's not a bad thing. The experience is packed with charm and it's simply a joy going through everything. The puzzle design is solid and everything makes sense in one way or another, however it's on the easy side so don't expect a mental workout. \n\nI recommend playing the other games in the franchise as well if possible.","timestamp_created":1609399108,"timestamp_updated":1609399108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525316417217254639","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmrDq2/YCcd+DvwI="}
