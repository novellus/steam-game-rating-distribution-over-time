      \ we have fought a long, long war. Yet, these ten thousand years, our Warband\
      \ has been undivided in its faith, even though the Imperium still stands. <br><br>When\
      \ Cadia fell, we were there. We made our prayers to the Dark Gods for guidance\
      \ and entered the Warp behind Abaddon\u2019s fleet, and there we stayed, stuck\
      \ like insects in some dead gods\u2019 amber.<br><br>We wandered dark corners,\
      \ lost to the warp\u2019s delights, until our craft found an entryway to\u2026\
      \ this dead planet. This pathetic world that stinks of the Corpse God\u2019\
      s Empire and more.<br><br>Why have we been brought here? Something is here,\

      \ the Imperium, they will stop at nothing before they exact their revenge. Fielding\
      \ hellish machines, wielding Warp powers and possessing the experience of a\
      \ thousand wars, these ancient warriors are ready to conquer Gladius Prime,\
      \ killing and enslaving all who oppose them. In the name of the Warmaster, and\

      \ prove themselves in battle might find boons bestowed upon them by the Dark\
      \ Gods, and even rise to the rank of Daemon Prince. But beware, for the Gods\
