Working long hours, bored out of my mind, all that is on my mind is coming home to play Hailey for countless hours. Slowly passing my endless hours of life, dragging the four most amazing letters onto a chess board an connecting them based on an unparalleled strategy that without the right attitude can induce raging anger. But if you blast the soothing Zen music your heartrate will slow and you will be back to the calm state that freezes time allowing you to play for hours on end. 10/10 - an amazing game with true originality.","timestamp_created":1538793086,"timestamp_updated":1538793086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.398124337196350098","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww+PNo+YCesWTrAE="}
