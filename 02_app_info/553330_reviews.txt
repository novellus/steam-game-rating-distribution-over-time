Unique part matching /part hidden object, different types of picture puzzles and word puzzles too!   Lots and lots of variations to these too.  Can be replayed over & over so this is one great deal!   Your favorites can easily get very addicting.  Simple yet challenges nonetheless.  One of my top go-to games when I don't  feel like getting involved in an adventure game.  Control panel lets you choose which games / difficulty you want to play.  Highly recommend this unique game choice.","timestamp_created":1561947949,"timestamp_updated":1561947949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/MjW1esCds2EyQE="}
