    review: 'THIS IS NOT A FINISHED GAME


      I just want to get that out there so that anyone who buys this is not disappointed.
      For more info you can check out my review video:

      https://youtu.be/V4ly2bGg8t0


      I am only recommending this because I enjoy the art style and environments,
      and because I think that the core mechanics are interesting. With some tweaking,
      the addition of a tutorial, and some quality of life stuff, this game could
      be cool.'
