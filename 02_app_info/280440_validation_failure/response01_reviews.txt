It's still very much in it's beta stage, but it's already extremely entertaining to build mechs and fight bots/other players. It's as close to a Chromehounds 2 as we'll probably ever get since SEGA hates money.\n\nBuilding your mech will at first be very confusing, and the controls aren't too good in the garage, but once you get it down you'll be making different mech builds for different situations and then you'll notice you've made 15 different builds and you haven't even tested out a single one since you've been so busy building.\n\nPlenty of weapons, a decent selection of levels (thankfully with many more to come), plenty of styles of mechs to build (hovering, biped, hexaped, and wheeled mechs). Want to make a pizza boy mech? Don't worry, you [url=http://bombdogstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/screenshot_302.png]most definitely can.[/url] You can make some insane mechs if you want, or you can download other people's creations off the game's forum.

Everyone choosing alliances and fighting for territory. Sounds like it'll be a lot of fun! The dev is also planning a single-player campaign and 6 player co-op, as well as more maps.\n\nThe only negative I have to say about this game is that the framerate is pretty bad at times. When you're in the thick of a battle it'll drop down to 30-40 fps, and that's with the lowest settings selected on my decently beefy gaming rig. The developer says optimization is high on his to-do list, though, and the game is still plenty playable even when the framerate does dip, so I still highly recommend this. \n\nEspecially if you played Chromehounds and have been hoping for something similar after all these years.
