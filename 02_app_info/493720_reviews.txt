I did try using the telescope but it failed to indicate any locations bar one.  Even a green light would have helped. There is very little content to the game so it is over too soon...leaving a feeling of disillusionment and having to play again to get the other ending for the achievements ... I do not like having to play a game twice to experience the entire game.   It is a good game for a person who wants to while away some time and the graphics are really good.  On that basis I do recommend it to others but with a caution not to expect too much.  This game is on the way to being really good if ever updated and filled with more content.","timestamp_created":1610014342,"timestamp_updated":1610014342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt6eV7vYCdayewQI="}
