As an avid boardgame player, I was tempted to buy the physical game years ago in a bookstore when traveling for business in Alabama and was attracted to the old style graphics and solo variant.  \n\nFor $.99 this little gem is rather addicting for a half inning of play!  Well, now to spend more money on the physical copy.  \n\nNice play, Handelabra Games.","timestamp_created":1606725151,"timestamp_updated":1606725151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kYWSjPYCdNPZtQI="}
