The ambience, the design and look, and most of all the puzzles themselves are all outstanding.  The controls are intuitive and easy to use, which underscores how deceptively difficult the levels can actually be.  Limiter is rather addictive and it's easy to get into a flow where you bang out level after level, and it is obvious that each stage has a lot of care put into it, as each one is fresh with its own flair.  I would recommend this for anyone who likes logic and puzzles, retro-style ambience, and deceptively simple controls used in creative ways to create a rich overall experience.","timestamp_created":1598392510,"timestamp_updated":1598392510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw48Tnk/QCft3hnQI="}
