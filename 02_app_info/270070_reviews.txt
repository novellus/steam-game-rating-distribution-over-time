I feels a lot like an old PS1 game both graphically and gameplay wise. \nThe ending is a cliffhanger but not a very good one at that.\nThe controls are hot garbage! OOB the stem controller doesn't work and i couldn't get it working with my PS4 controller either. the Keyboard/mouse controls aren't well laid or very intuitive. I spent the first 20 minutes tweaking the control map on the steam controller and never got it working very well. I ended up having to swap to the kb/mouse and back a few times for some segments. \nOverall, it might be worth it if you get it on sale (like $3 or less). Gameplay is ~1.5 hours unless you suck like i do and fight with the controls the whole time. then expect it to to be a bit closer to 2.5 hours of game time","timestamp_created":1606973377,"timestamp_updated":1606973377,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nvnEk/YCdvv1tgI="}
