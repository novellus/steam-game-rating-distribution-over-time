This one feels like it'd be a better pickup if you're interested in the geography rather than something 'unique'. It's a great looking map though.\n\nFor a new player, I would pick Silver Ridge or Vurhonga over this and would rate this one 'middle-of-the-pack' IMO.","timestamp_created":1609772750,"timestamp_updated":1609772801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vvP75vYCdP20wAI="}
