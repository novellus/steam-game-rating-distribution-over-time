    review: "[i]This review is part of my mini-project to review all four of the Johnny\
      \ games.  The Revenge of Johnny Bonasera is a 4-part episodic series by independent\
      \ developer Rafael Garc\xEDa.  The series began in late 2016 and concluded in\
      \ early 2020.  The developer has floated the possibility of doing a fifth game\
      \ at some point in the future, but the series is currently finished; The four\
      \ games that are out tell a complete story with no loose ends.  Each game in\
      \ the series takes about two to three hours to complete, and each successive\
      \ game is a bit larger and more ambitious than the previous entries.\n\nThe\
      \ series follows a physically weak but terribly ruthless young boy.  In the\
      \ first game, which works as a standalone title, Johnny takes revenge on some\
      \ teenaged punks who ruin his sandwich.  The second, third, and forth games\
      \ change course a little bit and follow a whole story arc as Johnny takes revenge\
      \ on some aliens who have abducted his mother.\n\nMy overall impression of the\
      \ series as a whole is positive.  Johnny is not as big or as flashy as many\
      \ other games; but it doesn't feel like it is even trying to compete with those.\
      \  I am writing these reviews on Jan 2, 2020, the day after Adobe Flash officially\
      \ died.  Johnny feels like exactly the kind of game that would have existed\
      \ and thrived as a mega-hit on a site like Newgrounds or Kongregate had it come\
      \ out 15 years earlier.  With the basic cartoonish art style, large and crudely\
      \ animated sprites, vaguely adolescent humor, and simplicity of design, the\
      \ series brings me a certain nostalgia for that era of gaming.[/i]\n\nThis is\
      \ the third entry of the series, and easily the best so far.  Having escaped\
      \ the police station in Part 2, Johnny and his new pals (a punk chick, a washed-up\
      \ detective, and a crackpot conspiracy theorist) go in search of a UFO that\
      \ will take them to the aliens.  The group stops at a dusty old saloon in the\
      \ middle of nowhere, and Johnny soon discovers the top-secret facility hiding\
      \ beneath its foundations.  \n\nThis third entry in the series is really good.\
      \  Rafael Garc\xEDa has fully hit his stride, and this entry is bigger and more\
      \ complex than the previous two.  The government facility is well-designed and\
      \ full of creative little touches; we are confined to a very small area at first,\
      \ and gradually gain access to more and more of it through solving puzzles.\
      \  This is the first game in which Johnny needs to rely on the help of others\
      \ to solve a number of the puzzles; each of the companions is able to assist\
      \ in some way.\n\nThis is a solid game well worth picking up.\n"
