      \ Rhine Valley Railway between Freiburg and Basel to Train Simulator!<br><br>Envisaged\
      \ as an important route throughout the south of Germany and into Switzerland,\
      \ the Rhine Valley Railway was funded in the late 1830s. The Baden State Railway\
      \ knew they wanted to build a line between Mannheim and Basel, making it as\
      \ straight as possible to keep both journey times and construction costs at\
      \ a minimum, all while serving as many major cities as possible.<br><br>The\
      \ line subsequently followed the natural path already carved out by the Rhine,\
      \ with construction lasting until 1855. The line opened in sections as each\
      \ was completed, and the railway in full quickly became a key route for Germany\
      \ and Switzerland. When first built, the line was actually 5ft 3in in gauge\
      \ (Irish Gauge), before being converted to standard in the mid-1850s.<br><br>Today,\
      \ the line is one of the most important in Germany, ferrying local and international\
      \ passenger and freight traffic, almost always operating at peak capacity. Two\
      \ of Europe\u2019s largest marshalling yards are present along the railway to\
      \ host the level of freight traffic it gets.<br><br>The route from Aerosoft\
      \ is set around 2013/14 and covers the 60 km section between Freiburg (Germany)\
      \ and Basel (Switzerland), including the newly built high-speed line, taking\
      \ the route to over 80 km of expertly crafted railway which will be yours to\
      \ explore. Combine that with 2 locomotives, the DB BR 111 and 189, plus the\
      \ addition of the DB BR 401 \u2018ICE 1\u2019, you will soon have a package\

    review: "Ich habe jetzt 3 mal  versucht den RE mit der 111 zu fahren,  hedoch\
      \ fehlt auf der Strecke Geschwindigkeitsvoranwanungen, weshalb die PZB einen\
      \ Zwangsbremst, Zudem h\xE4ngt sich  das Spiel kurz vor M\xFCllheim komplett\
      \ auf, der TS l\xE4sst sich dann  nicht mehr schliessen und man kann  nicht\
      \ mehr raustaben,  weshalb man seinen PC immer neustarten  muss.\nIch  empfehle\
      \  von den Kauf abzuraten und das Geld in ein  besserres Adon rein zu investitieren.\n"
