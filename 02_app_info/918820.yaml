      /> <br>  <br>A stack of news article sits on your desk, two stampers on each
      side - green to approve, red to reject. Your reporting team is hacking away
      in the background as corporate music plays through the loudspeaker. It''s time
      to make decisions. Will you endorse nationalized healthcare, even though your
      love interest is worried about increased wait times? Will you demonize the new
      synthetic alcoholic drink, even though your boss stressed they are an important
      investor? Will you support current government, as tensions grow between the
      neighboring country? <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/918820/extras/headliner2_gif03.gif.jpg?t=1602541947"
      /><br><br>After work, you emerge on the streets of Novistan, shaped by the very
      news you publish. Perhaps you will see more graffiti, angry bums or even a riot?
      Or perhaps you will turn the nation into peaceful utopia, filled with cameras
      and drones watching your every step? How will your channel address tragic events
      about to happen? Will you agree to meet the clandestine group of truthtellers,
      or stop to watch the Prime Minister''s speech? <br><br>On the way home you meet
      with three main characters: Evie, your co-worker and immigrant, worried about
      her health and growing xenophobic sentiment; your brother Justin, an aspiring
      comedian struggling with impostor syndrome and social anxiety; finally Rudy,
      a single father trying to provide for his little girl and keep his store afloat,
      while a mega-mart opens up next door. Each day provides a glimpse into their
      life and how the media shapes their beliefs. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/918820/extras/hnn_chars_2.png?t=1602541947"

      /><br><br>But every Headliner deserves to relax at home from the stress of the
      job. Listen to the radio and unwind on the comfy couch bought with hard-earned
      cash, as you watch the city burn outside the window. Perhaps splurge on treats
      to feed your doggo? Adopt a drone? Have your brother over for dinner? Or maybe
      keep your doors locked, hoarding every penny, as your apartment slowly fills
      with piles of cash? <br><br>After good night''s sleep, it''s time to once again
      face to boss, new articles, a growing sense of responsibility, and.... power.
