If you like a little bit of challenge - play the timed mode, if not - relaxed mode is really awesome.\nThe levels are not too long (the longest ones took me maybe 3 minutes). 200 levels of pure joy and the addition of \"find the difference\" or \"hidden object\" stages  made this game even better to me!\nThe graphics are really nice and the music is just wonderful.\nThe only tiny minus is the story...It is kinda weak (and yes...the main character does remind me of Lara Croft), but then again...many match 3 games don't have any stories.\nI highly recommend Heart of Moon: The Mask of Seasons to anyone that likes to relax with a nice casual game.\n9,9/10","timestamp_created":1606059828,"timestamp_updated":1606059828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540481388568878174","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsoSo+PUCeaLzrwI="}
