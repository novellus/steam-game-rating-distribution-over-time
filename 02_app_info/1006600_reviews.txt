Starts off easy enough with some non-standard shapes but then gets bigger with even different layouts. The borders are quite helpful and almost necessary to make it a little more tolerable on later stages. The key with those later ones is to try and find the one missing piece so you know where to start building from lest you make a fatal error. The music and images are rather decent.","timestamp_created":1602468175,"timestamp_updated":1602468175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yfuijfUCeLaupwI="}
