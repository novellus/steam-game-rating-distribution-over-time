    review: '[h1]THIS NO LONGER WORKS ON WINDOWS![/h1]


      Installing the plugin is easy, open the RPG Maker Tools from the Tools menu,
      then click the Select Path button and look for the tools folder under RPG Maker
      MV. Select that and any of the three tools you have as DLC will show up in the
      list.


      The problem is that once you open MADO (and possibly SAKAN as well) and then
      click on Open MV Project, [b]NOTHING HAPPENS[/b]. No error, no dialog, no nothing.
      So you can''t actually use this. I suspect this might be an issue with the build
      of Windows 10 Pro that I''m using - 19041 - having broken compatibility with
      Qt5 5.4.2, which is what MADO is using.


      If you have an earlier version of Windows 10, you might be in luck until you''re
      forced to update. Otherwise, steer clear.'
