I only bought it at discount price and couldn't even bring myself up to keep it.\nI like no hand-holding, when it comes to figuring out the rules of the game world - it's just unfortunate that both the game world and gameplay mechanics lack any sort of variety (as the other user correctly pointed out - this game is a blatant tech demo), as the levels progress.\n\nIn each level you do the same thing. The world consists of two stances - one is static another is dynamic (need to enter it through a card-portal), in which you can shift the height of platforms to traverse the simplistic landscape to your goal. Reach a mcguffin and kill another mcguffin with it (use a scope).\n\nExpect for the mouse clicks to not work in main menu (use keyboard + Enter).\nDefault kb controls are:\nWASD - movement;\nShift - run;\nZ - overworld map (shows your goals);\nQ,E - shifting the platforms height up and down;\nX - scope (for when you obtain the mcguffin bullet).\n\nTry it out at your own risk (recommended to wait for a discount, because it's hardly worth one full dollar at this stage of development)","timestamp_created":1584896289,"timestamp_updated":1584989251,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556974649429321289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ425SuhPECf8yO+gE="}
