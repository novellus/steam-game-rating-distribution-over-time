    review: "This only adds two new teams, no new species or Dirty Tricks but it's\
      \ very cheap. \nThe Purple Mutant Eaters are apparently a parody of the Minnesota\
      \ Vikings and play in a arena that slightly resembles the Thunderdome from the\
      \ Mad Max movie with some nasty traps on it. \nThe other team are the Hexxon\
      \ Oilers, based on the Texas Oilers (currently known as Tennessee Titans) and\
      \ it's one of two teams that managed to kick my ass in Dynasty, so despite their\
      \ 80 rating they are quite good. \n\nEasily worth the low price."
