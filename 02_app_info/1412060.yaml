      \ (1E)</h2>White Plume Mountain has always been a subject of superstitious awe\
      \ to the neighboring villagers. People still travel many miles to gaze upon\
      \ this natural wonder, though few will approach it closely, as it is reputed\
      \ to be the haunt of various demons and devils.<br>This adventure contains background\
      \ information, referee's notes, player aids, a complete map level, and a cutaway\
      \ view of the mountain complex. White Plume Mountain is form the Special (&quot;S&quot;)\
      \ series; like others in this series, it is meant to stand on its own and is\
      \ a complete Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure.<br>For 4-10 characters\
      \ levels 5-10.<br><strong> Product History</strong><br>S2: &quot;White Plume\
      \ Mountain&quot; (1979), by Lawrence Schick, is the second &quot;Special&quot;\
      \ adventure for AD&amp;D. It was published in August 1979.<br><strong> Origins.</strong>\
      \ In 1978, Gary Gygax decided to create a Design Department within TSR, and\
      \ so began advertising job positions. One of the applicants was Lawrence Schick,\
      \ a recent graduate of Kent State University. After he was asked to submit an\
      \ AD&amp;D adventure as a sample of his work he cobbled together his &quot;best\
      \ ideas&quot; from five years of dungeon design and wrote &quot;White Plume\
      \ Mountain&quot;. Not only was Schick hired, soon becoming the Head of the expanding\
      \ department, but &quot;White Plume Mountain&quot; was also scheduled by Gygax\
      \ for publication.<br><strong> <i>Sources.</i> </strong> The sword <i>Blackrazor</i>\
      \ , one of the three named weapons in <i>White Plume Mountain</i> , is an obvious\
      \ rip-off of Elric's black blade, <i>Stormbringer</i> . Schick says he &quot;would\
      \ not have put it into the scenario if [he] ever thought it might be published.&quot;<br><strong>\
      \ <i>Continuing the Special Adventures.</i> </strong> &quot;White Plume Mountain&quot;\
      \ followed S1: &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; (1978) as the second &quot;Special&quot;\
      \ adventure -- which seems to mainly mean one-off adventures for AD&amp;D, not\
      \ connected as part of a campaign like the G, D, and T adventures that had preceded\
      \ it.<br>&quot;White Plume Mountain&quot; is notable for being the first AD&amp;D\
      \ adventure not authored by Gary Gygax -- though it was preceded by Mike Carr's\
      \ B1: &quot;In Search of the Unknown&quot; (1978) for the Basic D&amp;D game.\
      \ The trend of other authors writing for D&amp;D would really take off in 1980.<br>Like\
      \ all of TSR's early D&amp;D adventures, the first edition of &quot;White Plume\
      \ Mountain&quot; was printed with a monochrome (orannge) cover. It was updated\
      \ with a full-color cover with an orange border (1980) just a year later; at\
      \ the same time the book was expanded from 12 to 16 pages, mainly thanks to\
      \ the addition of more illustrations.<br><strong> <i>Continuing the Adventures\
      \ Archive.</i> </strong> By late 2005, TSR's free 3e adventure archive was nearing\
      \ its end, but that year also contained two of their most notable adventures,\
      \ 3e revamps of classics &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; (2005) and &quot;White\
      \ Plume Mountain&quot;.<br>The 3.5e version of &quot;White Plume Mountain&quot;\
      \ is based closely on the original, with the design adjusted in some areas for\
      \ balance and better polish. The three named weapons have also been statted\
      \ up with the <i>Weapons of Legacy</i> (2005) system.<br>Wizards supplemented\
      \ this adventure with a web enhancement, &quot;Outside the Mountain is just\
      \ as Dangerous as Inside&quot; (2006). It updates material from <i>Return to\
      \ White Plume Mountain</i> (1999), including the fourth weapon, <i>Frostrazor</i>\
      \ .<br><strong> <i>Adventure Tropes.</i> </strong> <i>White Plume Mountain</i>\
      \ is an interesting contrast. On the one hand it's one of the earliest quest\
      \ dungeons: players go into the Mountain searching for three magic weapons.\
      \ The dungeon is very tightly organized around that quest. On the other hand,\
      \ &quot;White Plume Mountain&quot; was TSR's first &quot;fun house&quot; dungeon.\
      \ This was doubtless a result of the piecemeal way that Schick constructed the\
      \ dungeon. The result doesn't feel like an organic whole and certainly doesn't\
      \ contain any &quot;Gygaxian naturalism&quot;. Instead, it's a random assortment\
      \ of monsters, puzzles, and traps. Just as &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; popularized\
      \ the idea that D&amp;D dungeons could be &quot;killers&quot;, &quot;White Plume\
      \ Mountain&quot; in turn debuted the idea of fun house dungeons as professional\
      \ releases (though GMs all over the country had surely been cobbling them together\
      \ for half a decade).<br><strong> <i>Exploring Greyhawk.</i> </strong> Like\
      \ &quot;Tomb of Horror&quot; before it, &quot;White Plume Mountain&quot; is\
      \ only very lightly set in Greyhawk. The beautiful full-page map on page three,\
      \ showing the Great Swamp, White Plume Mountain, and Castle Mukos didn't match\
      \ up with anything else at the time, though the text of the adventure clearly\
      \ places White Plume Mountain in the Shield Lands, near the Great Rift. The\
      \ background in the module was also entirely self-contained at the time.<br>Years\
      \ later, <i>Return to White Plume Mountain</i> (1998) would much more fully\
      \ connect up Schick's famous module with Gygax's world.<br><strong> <i>NPCs\
      \ of Note.</i> </strong> The central NPC of &quot;White Plume Mountain&quot;\
      \ is dungeon creator Keraptis -- except the 1,300-year-old wizard is never actually\
      \ seen.<br>Instead, it's probably the undead dragon Dragotha who's best remembered\
      \ from this adventure. This primordial dracolich only shows up on the map of\
      \ the local area as a possible adventure seed. He finally got a full writeup\
      \ a decade later in the &quot;Lords &amp; Legends&quot; column of <i>Dragon\
      \ #134</i> (June 1988).<br>Both NPCs got much better usage in <i>Return to White\
      \ Plume Mountain</i> , while Dragotha also starred in the &quot;Age of Worms&quot;\
      \ adventure path in <i>Dungeon #124</i> (July 2005) to <i>Dungeon #135</i> (June\
      \ 2006).<br><strong> <i>About the Creators.</i> </strong> Schick mainly worked\
      \ for TSR as a manager, but he did write one other adventure, A4: &quot;In the\
      \ Dungeons of the Slave Lords&quot; (1981).<br> <i>Converted by:</i> \_ <strong>Mike\
      \ Wilson</strong> <br> <br><strong>Requires:</strong> An active subscription\
      \ or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and a\
      \ one time purchase of the D&amp;D Classics - AD&amp;D 1E/2E ruleset. Compatible\

    short_description: 'D&amp;D Classics: S2 White Plume Mountain (1E)White Plume
      Mountain has always been a subject of superstitious awe to the neighboring villagers.
      People still travel many miles to gaze upon this natural wonder, though few
      will approach it closely, as it is reputed to be the haunt of various demons
      and devils.'
