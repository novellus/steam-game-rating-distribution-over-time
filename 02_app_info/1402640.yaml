    review: "I'll start with this: This is a PDF file. To view it you need to go into\
      \ the folder of the game and open it there.\n\nThe Guide is very helpful and\
      \ has some nice extra things. Like a good guide it shows you who loves/hates\
      \ what gift and how to increase the one you want to love you. You can use it\
      \ to find out how to unlock the secret ending (and in a way all the achievements).\n\
      \nThe only thing that bugs me about it the order of things. I'd like all the\
      \ parts to do with Sota be one page after the other and Lenga to be one page\
      \ after the other and so on. Right now it's per day so E.G: you picked Rald,\
      \ all the ups and (no change) for the Spa massage are there. Next to that is\
      \ Spa Bath - Sota Route 4 pages down (page 58 to 62) is Spa Bath - Rald Route.\
      \ It's not all grouped in one part (like other guides). \n\nIn the end all the\
      \ info you need is there and you can read a nice little story at the end. The\
      \ minor part is over shadowed but the rest."
