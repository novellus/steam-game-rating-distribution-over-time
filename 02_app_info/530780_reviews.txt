If you enjoy the supernatural elements of the game it can be really fun, however if realism is your goal do not buy this. Some of the features can make your game incredibly easy. Kidnap anyone, regrow limbs, become immortal. This DLC depends entirely on what you like from CK.","timestamp_created":1522265809,"timestamp_updated":1608427480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.590213418006896973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvPTvvvYCfILsnAE="}
