    review: "If you like the series or genre, then it's decent. One of the easier\
      \ games in the series, though I did also play it on PS4 [miserable experience\
      \ due to time requirements there] but anywhere I struggled on console was easy\
      \ on PC with a mouse. \n\nThe 'loading' isn't centered properly, this is in\
      \ a few of the games it's an odd issue to have. But it's worth it on sale."
