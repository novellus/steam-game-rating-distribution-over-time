The positives are an immersive VR experience, excellent voice acting  (spaceship female British voice), a convincing alien landscape, not bad graphics,  and a distinct structure to the experience.  The problems experienced are related to game play, which I understand were even worse at one point.  \n\nThere still does not seem to be any game save in the checkpoint sense, albeit there are checkpoint entries to the game in the starting menu - but these are all available from the onset, and possibly tagged on as an afterthought in relation to previous saved problems.    Not ideal and not really a save, but at least allows some form of entry position near your last point.\n\nThere is over two hours of game play, and unlikely to be done in one sitting; or should I say standing as its a standing VR experience.  The puzzles are fairly straightforward which is just as well as there appears little in the way of walk through online  (An over 2 hr video is on You-tube without narration if desperation requires), but can be unbelievably frustrating due to some poor control responses - and it is possible to get yourself (or the energy orb) in an impossible to get out of position.  \n\nA few tips without giving too much away.  The beginning where the spaceship voice prompts to the aqueduct can take ages to figure out, albeit gives you a chance to explore the expansive alien landscape, and force fields blocking just about every viable pathway.  Just focus attention on the first tower to get you to the aqueduct. As for controlling the energy orb over the huge sloped wall,  I found following as close as you can whilst propelling the orb using carefully aimed energy blasts was the strategy that appeared to work best.\n\nWith some of the above tips for some of the big frustrations, I feel this is worth the price.  It is basically a good game, albeit with some inherent game play flaws.  Worked fine in Windows Mixed Reality Samsung Odyssey Plus.","timestamp_created":1607905965,"timestamp_updated":1607906385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xousr/YCe8D+uQI="}
