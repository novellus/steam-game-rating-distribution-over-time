    review: 'Can only recommend this for the Spiritual Warfare game (actually decent
      for a Legend of Zelda rip-off), the best version of the game here since you
      can SAVE the game instead of having the overtly long password feature from the
      NES, Genesis and Game Boy versions, or if you''re an AVGN fan and enjoyed those
      three episodes of his.


      Other than that, I can''t recommend it, as it''s three of the other bland and
      bad Bible games that AVGN played and reviewed, except it''s on DOS, nothing
      really to see here, and besides the fact how it''s not doing Christianity any
      favors, makes me wonder why Wisdom Tree even bothered to rehash the same games,
      it''s a mystery as to how they''re still around.


      Also, there''s no King of Kings, King James Bible, Sunday Funday nor Bible Buffet
      in case anyone''s wondering, not that they''d be good on the DOS either.'
