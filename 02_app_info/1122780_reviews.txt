I found a bug quite early that bugged progression and I'm not sticking around to find any more. Do not buy this one, at least until it's been fixed.\n\nSomething else that might be a bit of a normality bias from the makers of the game is that the game starts in Russian. Now, for someone Russian it's probably quite unthinkable that someone can't read something as simple as 'Options' or 'Language' in their native language, but believe me; it's quite possible and quite bothersome. I can speak and write in three languages and Russian is not one of them; their alphabet is nothing but hieroglyphs to me not different from ancient Sumerian, Egyptian or what-have-you. They should probably fix that, too. Finding how to change the Language was not too easy; especially if when you choose one of the choices that isn't 'Options' in Russian, you could start a New Game or close the game altogether and have to restart the whole thing.","timestamp_created":1609560347,"timestamp_updated":1609560347,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l7rR4PYCcf7NvwI="}
