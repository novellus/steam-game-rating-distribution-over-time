      mythical beast, which torches Shennong to his last breath. In the despairing
      darkness, Shennong is revived by a secret friend. With the awakening superpower,
      he conquers the beast, breaks the illusion and acquires another valuable plant.<br><br><strong>About

      of medicinal plants into a book, &quot;Shennong's Classic of Herbal Medicine&quot;.
