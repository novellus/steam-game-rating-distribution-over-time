Well! Street Racing 2020! where to begin? well part from the audio and music that i think have caused my to not be able to hear, like i need help now, my ears are bleeding, why ye the music crackles like mad at the bassy moments in the songs and there is no option to change audio! like great! terrible music for the many minuets you will be playing this game for! its totally made with unity! \"AI\" car in the ONE race you start with and painfully have to repeat to get further in the \"game\" is a drag race in a \"town\" what is 10 buildings and a few trees in the most flattest part of the world! This AI  can't go in a straight line, its funny to watch the car ping off into space when it inevitably does crash, i honestly think this is unfinished! controls esc for menu. yeeeeeeeeeeeeee that doesn't work! Have fun alt Tab out of this game! the 22gb storage required is misleading at best so is the recommended specs needs a 12 core to render like a couple of buildings a small world and some trees! ye laughable! well done steam not checking the games that come onto your platform.","timestamp_created":1585758918,"timestamp_updated":1585758918,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":58,"votes_funny":18,"weighted_vote_score":"0.832194089889526367","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw15qmm/ECfbCQ/QE="}
