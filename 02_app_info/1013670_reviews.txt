Initially checked this out as I appreciated it's industrial visuals, and lighting. To be honest, I'm quite terrible at puzzle games, my safe space generally being RTS games. However, if puzzle games are your thing this game is without a doubt up your alley.\n\nAdditionally, if you're up for a challenge, well, you're in luck! This game is masterful in making you feel stupid, and a genius at all the right times.","timestamp_created":1578525316,"timestamp_updated":1578535174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467032968997955322","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9+eBxO8Cce/j6gE="}
