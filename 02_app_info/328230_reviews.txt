If you liked the vibe and feel of it, you get all these short to medium long songs, in this DLC. While the price is a bit high there is a base game + soundtrack bundle you can get. If you already have the game I recommend to wait for a sale before getting this.\n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] You can press Download Album in the Soundtracks section of the library filter and then find it in \"..\\Steam\\steamapps\\music\\A Bird Story - Original Soundtrack\". Or in the game directory if it downloaded with your game.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this DLC review you can find more in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1494440271,"timestamp_updated":1604434639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ibfwx/UCePfneA=="}
