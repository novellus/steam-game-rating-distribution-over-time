    review: 'A small time management game about real archaeology in which you lead
      an excavation of the Villa of Dionysus in the ancient city of Dion. Archaeology
      is something which interests me a lot and I wouldn''t have found Secrets of
      the Past: Dion without the help of the Discovery Queue here on Steam.


      The challenge lies in assigning the right number of people to either do the
      digging, the preservation, the restoration or the cataloguing of the artifacts.
      There''s a time limit, you''re actually supposed to discover all of the artifacts
      and process them before winter comes. There''s a focus on marble statues and
      mosaics in this, and I suppose that''s fair enough since it''s about classical
      antiquity and an extravagant Roman villa. You do discover stuff like pottery,
      coins, bones and carbonized grains, but they''re not studied in detail, instead
      they are archived for future research.


      Some of the neat stuff in the game are the 3D models of the discovered items,
      in-situ photos and separate descriptions of artifacts at the moment of discovery
      and after being catalogued. There''s also some background story for the ancient
      city of Dion.


      The main problem this game has is I think the time limit, I wish this was turn-based
      instead of real-time. There''s a feeling of hurry throughout and you can''t
      enjoy the act of discovering new items slowly. Otherwise it''s a nice game which
      I recommend and would play more if there were any similar games. It''s short
      (1,5 hours or over 3 hours for all of the achievements), but I think it''s worth
      the money since I found it unique.


      If there will be any future games like this, my wishlist for them would be:

      -Discovery of the site (aerial/satellite photos etc.)

      -More scenarios / different digs

      -Larger digs and multi-year campaigns

      -A way to discover yourself which room/place is what (e.g. "this is a bath",
      "this is a garden" etc.)'
