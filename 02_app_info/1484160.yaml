      \ is to protect the precious dragon egg. In this ancient and mysterious world,\
      \ you are the Dragon Warrior tasked with the monumental mission to protect the\
      \ dragon egg. After the old Dragon King entrusts you with this dying wish of\
      \ his, you will be thrusted into battle against relentless waves after waves\
      \ of savage foes. In order to learn about why the enemies will stop at nothing\
      \ to destroy the dragon egg and to find a way to revivify the dragon race, you\
      \ too will stop at nothing to survive on the battlefield until all mysteries\
      \ are solved.<br>With classic bow and arrow attacks and construction of defensive\
      \ towers at your command, complemented by the creative mode of casting magic\
      \ through hand-drawn magic circles, X will bring a whole new kind of battle\
      \ experience. But the enemies are ruthless, so will you flee or will you fight?<br><br><strong>Story\
      \ Background</strong><br>In an unknown space, there exists a seemingly peaceful\

      \ how the dragon race live and behave: There are six classes of dragons, but\
      \ regardless of their rank, they are unified behind the belief to safeguard\
      \ this homeland of theirs. But everything changed one day when the player, from\
      \ a different world, descended on this land and the ensuing butterfly effect\
      \ resulted in unprecedented turmoil - the dragons mutated into various monsters,\
      \ with the exception of the Dragon Prince who has yet to be born. The mutated\
      \ dragons lost all their memories but their instinct compels them to kill the\
      \ Dragon Prince, as if their intent is to launch a preemptive strike and eliminate\
      \ the &quot;threat&quot; before it is even born...<br>Succumbing to an increasing\
      \ horde of enemies, the dying old Dragon King left the Dragon Prince in the\
      \ hands of the player and bestowed on the protagonist the title Dragon Warrior\

      \ catastrophe, the player needs to construct towers and learn magic to repel\
