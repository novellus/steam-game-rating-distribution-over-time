    about_the_game: No Time to Explain Legacy is the original version of No Time to
      Explain developed by two dudes from their bedrooms back in 2011. It is what
      started tinyBuild. You should probably play the Remastered version which was
      built in Unity and has proper controller support and local multiplayer. You
      should play this if you want to see how it all started, and/or to express your
      support for indie devs. It was written in Flash, is very unreliable, and glitchy.
      But hey, it's legacy.

    review: 'HOW DO I ACCESS THIS?!


      Edit: It seems this DLC is now categorised as a separate download to "Remastered".
      Kinda weird how it is like this, but nonetheless, it''s the original game!'
