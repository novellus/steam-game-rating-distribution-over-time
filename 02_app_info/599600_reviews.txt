After you build some houses and handle some tenants, the game becomes a mess of stealing properties, thugs wrecking havoc on the streets, gangsters killing foremen, and fake repairmen causing gas leaks. And it is BEAUTIFUL.\n\nThere are 5 levels of houses and tenants, two tenants per level. Each tenant has different demands concerning their house and garden decoration, as well as money, lifetime and other stats. These tenants will provide moneys for the funs, but keeping them happy can be a pain. Besides those there are several undesireables, such as hippies, thugs, psychopaths, clowns and ghosts.\n\nThe computer is merciless in this game. Even in the easiest difficulty they won't give you  a break and you get flooded with all they got. Playing against 3 computers is not for the weak. You can also go multiplayer, but I never tested that. The controls are lacking, since you must click to do pretty much everything, but that's no show stopper.\n\nFunfact: this should not have the Windows symbol in Steam Store, since it is a DOS game. Ironically, it runs on DOSBox emulator which is Linux native (ported to Windows). Linux users can use Steam Proton to run Windows version of DOSBox to emulate Constructor... OR you can modify the launcher options and directly launch Linux's native DOSBox instead!\n\nSadly no achievements or cards here, but there is a new HD version with the former\n([url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_holysword/recommended/579020]see my review here[/url]). All in all the game aged a lot but it is still buckets of fun. The style is very unique and if you like it, there will be nothing similar in the market.","timestamp_created":1585252644,"timestamp_updated":1606812469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48JDfjvYCeqio+wE="}
