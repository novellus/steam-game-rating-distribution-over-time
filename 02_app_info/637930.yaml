    review: I only paid .49 USD for the game so it would have to be pretty bad for
      me to dislike it.  As it turns out the game was reasonably fun and some of the
      levels quite challenging.  Some people might find it a bit repetitive and grinding
      but I feel that is true of most of these types of games.  If you don't like
      time management games then why are you even looking at this one?  Anyway I do
      recommend it for people who enjoy this time of game.
