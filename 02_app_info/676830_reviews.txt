This is a space-age roguelike with strong elements of the Aliens series (arguably too strong?), a bit of crafting/make-do-and-mend thrown into the mix and a likeable dollop of Space Crusade (for those old enough to remember that). It's atmospheric, addictive and fun, despite the characteristically basic roguelike graphics.","timestamp_created":1579286521,"timestamp_updated":1607804014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw28mlrPYCffe87AE="}
