      \ To Duck!</h2><br>Enter the world of VRNinja, a fast-paced virtual reality\
      \ game that challenges you to dodge and duck your way past flurries of flying\
      \ weapons. With three scenic Japanese environments to experience and two challenging\
      \ modes of play, VRNinja will put your reflexes to the test as you train to\
      \ become the ultimate ninja master.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Which Weapon Will Be\
      \ Your Undoing?</h2><br>Each weapon in the ninja\u2019s arsenal serves a different\
      \ purpose, whether it is to trick you into letting your guard down or to overwhelm\
      \ you with bombastic force. You\u2019ll need to keep your wits about you and\
      \ your body moving to outlast the ninja\u2019s deadly onslaught.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Simple Controls, Yet Difficult To Master.</h2><br>Playing VRNinja is\
      \ as simple as plugging in your VR headset, booting up the game, and dodging\
      \ your way to victory. No extra controllers or peripherals required.<h2 class=\"\

      \ VRNinja is a perfect party game for all-ages. Go ahead and try not to crack\

      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Pick Up And Play Controls:</strong> There are\

      \ VR headset to play; no additional peripherals or controllers required!<br></li><li><strong>Two\
      \ Modes of Play:</strong> In Campaign Mode, you will be pitted against increasingly\
      \ difficult waves of projectiles as you advance through the game\u2019s three\
      \ unique environments. Complete each area to unlock it in the tremendously challenging\
      \ and endless Arcade Mode!<br></li><li><strong>Three Beautiful Japanese-Inspired\
      \ Levels:</strong> Explore the peaceful Dojo, the steamy Hot Springs, and the\
      \ spooky Nighttime levels! Each new area you discover introduces a new distraction\
      \ that will test your observational skills and focus.<br></li><li><strong>Four\
      \ Ninjutsu Weapons To Avoid:</strong> Quickly identify the patterns of incoming\
      \ projectiles to survive! Each weapon has its own trajectory, whether it\u2019\
      s the straight-flying Kunai, the swirling and twirling Rockets, or the curving\
      \ Shuriken. On top of the basic projectiles, you\u2019ll also have to contend\
      \ with the deadly Kunai Bombs. When their timer hits zero, they\u2019ll explode\
      \ and shower you with Kunai!<br></li><li><strong>Super Slow-Mo Ramen Power:</strong>\
      \ Feeling overwhelmed? Take a break and slow down time by catching a flying\
      \ bowl of ramen! This power-up is only temporary though -- make sure you\u2019\

    review: 'Simple fun, you watch the video you basically get it.

      The Video pretty much explains what is going on.

      Youll know pretty much immediatly if you are into this kind of game.

      Its decently done, the graphics and graphical options are good.

      The comfort and control are both good.'
