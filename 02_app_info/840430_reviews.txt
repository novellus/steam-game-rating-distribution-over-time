It's not the worst you could do for 15 smackaroons, but I would definitely recommend getting other games for similar money. For every positive thing I have to say, there's at least as many negative things to say about it.\nIt takes heavily from Gungeon, a little bit from Nuclear Throne in terms of progression and level layout, and effectively lifted several bosses straight from Enter the Gungeon but did it worse.\n\nExplosions have damage radius inconsistent with the spritework, especially those little warning markers from airstrikes. You'll frequently take bullshit damage when you were visibly outside of an explosion's radius.\nThe gameplay itself isn't bad, just kind of okay. \nThe music seems like it was ripped from flash games, though I have nothing to prove this. I would have to take a look at the credits.  I swear I've heard at least two of the most common tracks in a flash game before.\n\nGame's not bad, but it feels like a flash game with all of the jank that entails.\n\nOh, also, the game crashes toward the final stages of a run. A lot.","timestamp_created":1609729335,"timestamp_updated":1609729931,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4767Y5fYCd46jwAI="}
