Do I recommend the game? Yes. However, for a certain type of person would this game be for. Ask yourself do you like a game where you will need to grind a lot, and I mean a lot. If your answer is yes then this game is for you. If no then maybe pass on this one. Game is getting updates and it's in Early Access. But there is enough there to give fun and enjoyment. The game is a lot better when you're playing with others. Game does have some bugs but a lot is reported and gets fixed over time. Developer is active in discord and is always open to feedback and suggestions. There isn't any story as of yet, it's mainly grinding levels for materials to craft new and better stuff, or getting lucky to get good drops. There is some min/max that can take place but if grinding is your style of game this is what you should get. I like it, it's a solid game. If you have any questions just ask but it's worth it imo. \n\nI'll rate the game at this very moment 7/10 and I can see it increasing in the future. Thanks for reading, hopefully it helped someone.
