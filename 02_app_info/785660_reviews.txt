Its one of those games that you play for 30 minutes then get bored and regret buying it, it isn't worth 15 dollars at all to me. Very little content in my option for a 15 dollar game, would not recommend for price","timestamp_created":1609731566,"timestamp_updated":1609731566,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm83e5fYCcoGkwAI="}
