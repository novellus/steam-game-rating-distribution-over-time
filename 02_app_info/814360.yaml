    review: "I really like this game! I feel as if my decisions actually mattered\
      \ at the end of the game. Most games of this nature, it feels like the outcome\
      \ is always going to be the same no matter what, but this felt different. Granted,\
      \ I have only gotten through one cycle. It does feel like Amar (my chosen god)\
      \ would have handled things different should I have interacted with him differently.\
      \ It is kind of short though, and I feel like there isn't much replay ability\
      \ outside of getting other gods and maybe slightly different endings. Collecting\
      \ the pages, completing the fables, and talking to the NPCs I can see becoming\
      \ mundane rather than fun rather quickly. \n\nThe game is also very beautiful,\
      \ I like the character designs very much, and the art style is very pleasing.\
      \ The colors are vibrant without being too much, and they really set up the\
      \ atmosphere very nicely. Nothing felt out of place or ugly. The animations\
      \ are fluent and very well done.\n\nI also very much adore the characters, and\
      \ found myself becoming attached to them and wanting to learn more. I especially\
      \ adored the twins, as they felt like they have very real emotions, and really\
      \ portrayed the way kids would feel and act in their situation. [spoiler]An\
      \ angry bitter defensive exterior, but in reality they're just scared confused\
      \ and sad.[/spoiler] The same goes for Amar. [spoiler]He's very outgoing and\
      \ doesn't seem to care, but once you get to know him better it might not be\
      \ the case.[/spoiler] Lutra was a bit lacking for me, but I understand I don't\
      \ think they were supposed to be a very strongly developed character (considering\
      \ they don't even speak in full sentences, and their entire story line (for\
      \ me at least) centered around [spoiler]eating[/spoiler]). That could've also\
      \ been my fault, though, as I did not give enough attention to Lutra and sometimes\
      \ did not say the right things. The fact that characters grow and change throughout\
      \ the story and through your interactions with them is lovely, and adds so much\
      \ to this game. \n\nOverall, I couldn't recommend this game enough. The sheer\
      \ lack of attention it has gotten is rather unfortunate. If you've got $15 to\
      \ spare, I'd say definitely give it a try. I certainly for one do not regret\
      \ it. \n\nEdit: I haven't actually touched this game since finishing it the\
      \ first time around. I still do recommend it, but it has definitely lost my\
      \ interest after the first play through.."
