    review: "\"The Avengers\" table is actually the worst table ive played in this\
      \ game so far.\nIt managed to make me angry. Didnt think that was possible with\
      \ pinball. :)\nThe ball drops too easy out the sides, with no insurance, (Kickback,\
      \ Extra ball, shoot again) too many loops and often when you hit the center,\
      \ it throws it back exactly down center, nearly impossible to counter. \nVERY\
      \ frustrating. The other tables are ok though i guess. Nothing great, kinda\
      \ mediocre.\n\nI give it a weak thumbs up.\n"
