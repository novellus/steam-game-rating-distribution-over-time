For some reason it's made using Unity instead of as a regular application. You can't resize the window and have to select the resolution on startup like many Unity games do. I've had it crash on me many times with my losing my progress. The UI is confusing and make learning how to make a tileset more trouble than it's worth. If you want a better solution that is currently being supported, check out Tilesetter. It works similar to this and is very well documented on how to use it. You can export immediately to RPG Maker or GameMaker with it.","timestamp_created":1592256402,"timestamp_updated":1592256402,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpZL43PICecKgjgI="}
