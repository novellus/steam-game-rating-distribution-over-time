The year 2020 has been a year I'd like to forget with Covid and everything else that's just been bad right along with it.  This trash game is a pretty good game to define what kind of year 2020 has been for so many of us.   - But that doesn't mean you should purchase it!  Oh HELL NO!\n\nThis Game Should Be Called \"SlapaLazyDevaLot\" and not \"Speyarranoth\"!  Would have been a MUCH better name!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh_iAd375zQ&t=49s\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED!  If someone gifts you this game, Do NOT play it, Do NOT accept it!  ..Instead, un-friend them immediately and mute them forever!  They are NOT a friend!  ;-)\n\n","timestamp_created":1607866541,"timestamp_updated":1607866541,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.422150909900665283","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1607938040,"developer_response":"Thank you for your honest review! As this game is in Early Access Program for a low price I was hoping to elicit constructive criticism for my first published game and build an early adopter community to steer the direction of the game. I will try to put more effort into the game in the future to address any concrete issues identified by users as well as consider new features. I will start working based on concrete issues identified in your YouTube review."}],"cursor":"AoJ4vIyUrvYCeLTquQI="}
