    about_the_game: Are you tired of recalling robots, working a simulated job, training
      to be a pirate in space, or enjoying the weather in Arizona? Then it's time
      to take a relaxing trip to the DreamTank, a sweeping musical journey that takes
      you through randomly generated alien worlds in an interaction-light VR experience.
      <br><br>DreamTank contains ten different DreamTracks--the musical score that
      drives the visuals--with each experience beginning with simple shapes and a
      muted color palette, and then as the DreamTrack plays on, the worlds become
      more vivid, the shapes more complex, and the colors more vibrant. Watch the
      sun rise and set over alien worlds, see massive objects float through the sky
      above you, and watch distant comets burn through the night sky backlit by stars
      and planets--each world a randomly generated snapshot that will be unique to
      your experience!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>DreamTank is an interaction-light
      experience!</strong> </h2>DreamTank was created to be something that was observed,
      something that was relaxing and something that would inspire the imagination.
      This means that there is no teleportation, no weapons, no gravity guns or terrain
      manipulators, and this is by design! DreamTank is the kind of experience you
      would want to do when you don't want to do anything, just watch and observe
      the worlds it makes for you! When you're wanting some more VR, but don't want
      to work up a sweat, give DreamTank a try. You never know what you might see.<br><br><br><strong>Key

      Performance notes:</strong> DreamTank uses significant GPU resources to render
      the beautiful worlds you will encounter. Although DreamTank works on a AMD RX480
      and Nvidia GTX 980ti, for the best experience we recommend at least a GTX 1070
      with 6GB of RAM or more. If you have a system that struggles to play other VR
      games, then DreamTank is not for you!<br><br><strong>High-Resolution Screenshots:</strong>
      To enable 4k screenshots, press the letter H on the keyboard to toggle high-resolution
      screen captures. Be warned that this takes a powerful GPU, and that rendering
      may be momentarily paused while the screenshot is saved.
