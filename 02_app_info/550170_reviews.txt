It could use more leagues, but after 20 hours I still haven't beaten it, and don't plan to anytime soon, as the last league is pretty rough. \nYou can craft items, buy and sell items, you gain experience to level up and SP from battle that you use to give your guys passive stat bonuses. The heroes have a lot of skills they unlock as they level up and you usually play with a party of 4, but sometimes it's rarely 3, and the later stages allow a party of 5, which is nice. You can even get an armor piece that anyone can wear that doubles experience gain for the wearer. That is especially nice because only the recruits in your party gain experience from battle. \n\nI think you can really get a lot of time out of this game, but there are some aspects to it that I wish were expanded on, if not downright fixed. There is a certain area where you can talk to a man who offers 3 more leagues, but when you click on them nothing happens. I don't know if I was even supposed to get to him, as you have to walk through a wall and around the edge of the arena. So, more leagues to play in would be nice, but I have no idea if the dev is done working on the game or not.\n\nThere are tons of grammatical errors... like, more than I've ever seen in a game. Also, there's a weird ranking system that goes off of the time it takes to win a battle, but it doesnt pause while you're selecting your moves. So it's basically impossible to get S ranks unless you're way overleveled for the area, which is kinda weird because you could just grind higher level areas if you're that much stronger. The only way to get an S is to hold down spacebar and have the right action selections (which is usually just attack, but recently i've gotten spells pre-selected to clear mid-leagues with S's) beforehand so you kill everything in 1 or 2 moves. \n\nOverall it's cheap, I didn't expect to like it nearly as much as I do. It kind of makes you wanna find everything and craft that top tier gear, and beat that last league, which is a doozy. You can actually fight the last boss before you beat it I'm pretty sure... if it is even beatable. It might just go on forever. Definitely try this game out!","timestamp_created":1580558409,"timestamp_updated":1580558409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1580708477,"developer_response":"Hi ! \nJust to start, thank you for the kind review this always helps the game to have some good feedback and this might lead other player to play it even if it kind of getting old with time. But yeah like you said a lot of tweaks and others bugs fix could be done to improve the overall exeprience. I hope I could have the chance to find enough time in the near futur to make some corrections and improve the overall experience. I'm glad to see that the game still take many hours to discovers a lot of his potential. I just wanted to make a game that is fun to recruit and develop the power of your character and to continue the quest to find the best team for you even if everything become quite easy at the end. If you have any other feedback just let me know I hope I will get the chance to put everything in it and create something really great that people will continue to enjoy even if this game still have my mistakes. Thanks again! You are a real challenger to have finish the fight! You are way better then you imagine."}],"cursor":"AoJ40uungPACf+/C7wE="}
