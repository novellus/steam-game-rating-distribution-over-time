    review: Easily the best Text based RPG I've ever played. Seeing so many well written
      character occasionally interacting at each other, Is just the best.  I've been
      a fan of a text based games since playing "The Life of the Mercenary" and "Heroes
      or Villain" But this series is my most recommend.
