Even worse, they in no visible change when they are upgraded. The graphics only show four directions, so it all looks very clunky. There are few options in upgrading, and every tower type appears to be identical when maxed.\nThe heroes are cute to look at, but really offer very little in the way of game play, aside from the fact that you can move them around the map.\nThe support units are the weakest, like weak heroes that you can place, and that only exist for a short period of time before vanishing, if they live that long.\nThe mech unit offers two tactical options, a cannon ball, and a machine gun burst.\nThe card collection aspect of the game is also weak. There are no choices or options, they simply incrementally improve the matching unit or tower type. There is no combining them, they don't play off each other in away way, they are simply a weak mechanism for upgrading that could have easily been replaced with experience points for all the blandness. They don't even work well and internal info contradicts itself, in total confusion.\nAs such, the game gets very grindy early on, as you try to build up your cards, but even this gets difficult fast as the early levels get harder faster than your units gets stronger. \nThe shaving cream atop the mud pie is the complete lack of personality. The game has cute (but repetitive) art, there is no fluff connected to the heroes, the villains or the units, and the story is nearly non-existent. (Really curious if there is any backstory to the villainous unit that has spider legs and a baby dolls head. We may never know,) \nI would give this one a pass, even if you found it for free, as there is little to no fun to be had. The sad thing is it wouldn't have taken genius to make it fun, only a little effort. Even a cookie-cutter tower-defense game would be better if it had all the pieces.","timestamp_created":1564519549,"timestamp_updated":1565598779,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ457C9wuwCf4e4zwE="}
