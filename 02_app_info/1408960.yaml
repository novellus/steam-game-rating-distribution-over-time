    review: I will definitely recommend this visual novel to any person out there
      and those who want to try something new. The substantial message conveyed in
      the book I think is beyond the developer's religious beliefs but more on the
      importance of one's choices that adds up in time and makes the person. It is
      not your typical game on steam and I think the price is very affordable. You
      can say you paid for something worth reading and your money won't go to waste
      as it inspires something well within you.
