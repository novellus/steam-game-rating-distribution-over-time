Can no longer recommend\nEDIT 2020/06/28 The community has taken over the game, and fixed major bugs join the discord to find games\n\nThis game is a little rough around the edges, especially with regard to documentation and introducing new players but after a really rough few games you can begin to see the potential of this game. \n\nUnlike first person shooters like heroes and generals, or RTSes like company of heroes, in this game you control a single squad with no respawns. You move them around with the mouse or keyboard (in this game, learning hotkeys is a must or there's no way you can respond in time to changes in the field of battle). The objective of the game is to either capture victory points (VPs) or to eliminate the other team. \n\nYou move your units between cover and you try to minimize the percentage hit chance the enemy has on you. The game has mechanics of suppression, including for grenades, and also fog of war (though, it's not indicated as fog on the map, your units have a limited field of view in a cone in front of them). \n\nThe game moves very quickly, and falling behind can quickly lead to being flanked. However, with good team work and communication you and  your team can also move individual soldiers so optimal positions to snipe, suppress, or kill the enemy and win the game. \n\nI reccomend this for anyone who wants a tactical game based on soldier positioning and teamwork.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nthe game has a limited player base which leads to many empty lobbies. I'm hoping that will hange with time\n\nIt's hard to manage all the soldiers individually and even with hotkeys I find myself unable to properly command soldiers as I want to. \n\nThere's a few bugs but for a first steam release I think it's pretty good\n\nA lot of people complain about grenade spam, but personally I think it's ok because of the suppression mechanic.","timestamp_created":1474152710,"timestamp_updated":1593373002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542376279830932617","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkdGb/vICf6q/YQ=="}
