    review: "[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch controllers [/h1]\n[i]\
      \ Note for Oculus users; Roomscale setup strongly advised [/i]\n\nSo I got this\
      \ on sale for $1.79 from the normal price of $1.99 USD, yeah I'm a cheapskate.\
      \ Anyways, there's no comparing this game to Thrill of the Fight because this\
      \ is a $2 game. I can say, without any shadow of the doubt, this is the best\
      \ $2 boxing game on Steam VR. The question is would you rather spend more for\
      \ the better Thrill of the Fight or spend less than $2 on this game and get\
      \ a similar, but lesser, experience? \n\nThat's actually a close call believe\
      \ it or not. This is a decently good game. There's not much bells or whistles\
      \ to the game. No AAA production values here. The UI is clunky. The boxing AI\
      \ is not the best, but it's decent enough. I was surprised. And you can block\
      \ shots or dodge them. I think the description of pure dodgeplay mechanics is\
      \ misleading by the dev, why he'd want to undersell it though it anyone's guess.\n\
      \nBest of all, I got beat up pretty good by a girl. Normally you'd have to pay\
      \ a premium dollar for that experience, but not in this game. You will probably\
      \ need to adjust the distance of the AI boxer. Some of them just fight too far\
      \ away. So you need to be able to put a few steps forward to engage them. And\
      \ that's my biggest complaint: if you can't step forward to engage them, they\
      \ will box you from a distance which just looks silly. Nobody does that in real\
      \ life. They throw boxes and kicks that have no chance of hitting you. Luckily,\
      \ not all the AI boxers are that risk advese so it's only a few that you definitely\
      \ need to be able to take big step forwards or re-arrange how far away they\
      \ are from you which is in the options. So unless you have a big roomscale,\
      \ I suggest you change the options so that they are closer to you from the start.\n\
      \nOther than that, I liked the different boxers. They all behaved differently.\
      \ Some were obviously more into kicking you than punching you. Sadly, you're\
      \ always boxing in the same environment. There's really no progression. You\
      \ pick which boxer you want to box and that's it. You get graded afterwards\
      \ on your effectiveness. I actually knocked out one guy and the ranking was\
      \ that he bested me .. seriously? I landed more punches too ... who is judging\
      \ these sparring matches, russian mobsters?\n\nI digress. Most of the negative\
      \ reviewers seem to be before the mid August 2017 update. Even if the game is\
      \ abandoned, I'd still recommend it as is. This is a good deal for $2. \n\n\
      Rate 7/10."
