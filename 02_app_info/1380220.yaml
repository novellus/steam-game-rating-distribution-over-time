      \ /><br><br><strong>Starsand</strong> is a desert survival game set among the\
      \ dunes of a remote planet. An open world full of danger, a vast desert for\

      \ /><br>While running a desert marathon, you get caught by a sudden sandstorm\
      \ and end up swallowed by a yellow wall of sand. You find shelter for the night\
      \ in an old desert shrine and you wake up next morning with the feeling something's\
      \ not quite right. The storm is over and the sky is clear; all around you, calm\
      \ reigns over an ocean of infinite sand. If you survive long enough they\u2019\
      ll eventually find you and rescue you, that\u2019s the plan. Hope is going to\
      \ keep you alive, at least until you find out the truth about this place.<br><br><br><img\

      \ build your shelter. Once you\u2019ve built your shelter, take a tip and build\
      \ stronger walls, add some traps, and craft bigger weapons, because these dunes\
      \ are teeming with noxious creatures hungry for your flesh.<br><br><br><img\

      \ heat will kill you during the day, but nights won\u2019t be easier as the\
      \ temperature drastically drops down. Find your ways to build paths you can\
      \ trust, learn from animals, rely on the sun to orient yourself, don\u2019t\
      \ waste any energy. Become a desert dweller.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1380220/extras/StarsandOpenDev.png?t=1605630609\"\
