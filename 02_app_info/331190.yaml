    review: 'Disclaimer: My scores/reviews are almost always based on having bought
      the game at close to the "lowest historical price" on steam at time of purchase.


      Quick score: 4/5


      Notes: DO NOT attempt master mode as your first playthrough. I repeat, DO NOT.
      It will make you hate your life and the game. Aside from that, the game is OKAY.
      Its not amazing. But everything about it is decent. Everything from the character
      movement, levels, mechanics, enemys, graphics could be better IMO. But it''s
      worth a playthrough. But I repeat, DO NOT attempt master mode initially.'
