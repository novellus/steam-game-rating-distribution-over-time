They really could do no wrong.\n\nIn the game you build a base on your own planet with various crystals. It has cute, colorful characters that everyone will fall in love with.\n\nUnnyWorld tries to seperate itself from the pack with interesting features. There are lots of fun upgrades and things to buy through the game's easy to use purchasing system, but players will find that they can easily progress in the game without spending any money at all.\n\nThe main mode of play is Bang Bang Party, a quick 3v3 deathmatch with two lanes that have a tower each before the core structure that must be destroyed to win.\n\nThe graphics are adorable, especially if you love cute cartoons. But don't that mistake you UnnyWorld is very competitive and all for the E-Sports community.\n\nYou can max out all graphics settings and run at maximum resolution without too much worry. Not only that but it's also for iOS and Android so there's always friends to make and play with.\n\nThe game is actively developed and growing FAST so there's always fun new features to look forward to. Honestly it's my new favorite game and i'll be playing it non-stop. Also I'm making a guild if anyone wants to join send me a friend request. Look forward to seeing you all in UnnyWorld!\n\n\nOverall Score: 10 / 10 \n","timestamp_created":1510191451,"timestamp_updated":1510191451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462409317493438721","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t5mbz98CdIrnigE="}
