    about_the_game: 'Blink: Rogues is a fast-paced top-down shooter that brings combat
      tactics, sharp reflexes and multi-lane combat under the same roof. Fire rockets,
      shotgun or railgun, flip your ship, jump to the other lane and chase the perfect
      score. Steal the opponent''s power-ups or simply frag him!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>GAME
      MODES: </strong></h2><h2 class="bb_tag">PVP: </h2>Challenge your friends and
      find out who''s best by playing a 5 minutes Blink duel. Jump and frag your opponent,
      steal his drops, deny his kills and achieve victory by finishing the fight with
      the better score.<h2 class="bb_tag">STORY MODE: </h2>Put your skills to the
      test and play through Blink''s increasingly difficult campaign mode. Fight your
      way through the hand crafted enemy waves and reach the maximum star rating for
      each and every level. Show the world what you got and challenge the top leaderboard
      position!<h2 class="bb_tag">SURVIVAL: </h2>So you have finished the story mode,
      got a few stars, even. But can you complete all the missions, one after the
      other, with only one ship?<h2 class="bb_tag">COOP: </h2>You and a friend are
      trying to destroy increasingly difficult and increasingly faster waves of enemies.
      Each enemy that escapes will make you lose a bit of HP. How long can you last
      with only three ships?<h2 class="bb_tag">VERSUS AI: </h2>Top your game by playing
