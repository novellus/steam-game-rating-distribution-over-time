    review: "[h1]Jonathan Wandag created with the Soundtrack for Song of the Deep\
      \ a solid piece of art that has a couple of highlights...[/h1]\n\nMay it be\
      \ songs like Merrow Ruins, Watcher's Hollow, Undying Caves or the Main Theme\
      \ of Song of the Deep Jonathan Wandag did create here something special after\
      \ he had already worked on Soundtracks for Outernauts and some other smaller\
      \ projects.\n\nConsidering that a Game Soundtrack has often to carry the mood\
      \ alone in many Games or sometimes even intensify it up to a special moment\
      \ in the Game to lead to a grand finale Jonathan did deliver in my eyes a solid\
      \ performance with the Soundtrack for Song of the Deep.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n\
      \nThe Soundtrack is available in the MP-3 (320 kBit/s Bitrate) Format. There\
      \ are no further file Formats available and there is also no Album artwork.\n\
      \n[b]The tracks I liked the most:[/b]\n\n[i]Merrow Ruins[/i] & [i]Undying Caves[/i]\
      \ - Also the main theme of the Game is too well written Merrow Ruins & Undying\
      \ Caves easily topped it. Merrow Ruins is easy and playful, Undying Caves the\
      \ complete contrast to it. \nSlow, deep and depressive while at the same time\
      \ beautiful. Those two songs fit so often 100% in the Game in the mood of the\
      \ Game that many times when i was playing the Game I stoppd my submarine right\
      \ in the middle of the ocean and just listen to those two tracks while at the\
      \ same time the waves were crushing against the walls of my submnarine.\n\n\
      [b]The tracks I like the least:[/b]\n\n[i]The Watcher (Ancient Spider)[/i] -\
      \ Not because the track is bad or worse but because I remember doing that boss\
      \ fight over and over again because of a Bug in the Game so that in the end\
      \ I was so burned out because of those hundreds retries that I got sick of that\
      \ track in the end.\n\nI got the Song of the Deep Soundtrack during the Halloween\
      \ Sale for less then one Dollar which is clearly way below what the Soundtrack\
      \ is worth in the long run.\n\nIt was worth it. I already enjoyed playing Song\
      \ of the Deep a lot even back then while it was still full of Bugs and Glitches\
      \ but I just kept playing since I liked the Game and the Soundtrack back then\
      \ as much as I still do nowadays.\n\nWell done Insomniac Games & Jonathan Wandag\n\
      \n[i][b]Thumbs Up[/b][/i]\n\nThat\xB4s it. Thanks for reading and have a great\
      \ time ;-)"
