    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Description</h2><br>Birthdays are always days
      of change, even if we don't expect it. We get another year older, wiser, hopefully
      kinder and better, then we were just the day before.<br><br>Birthdays can change
      everything about you, and about the world. Take mine, for instance.<br><br>I
      had no idea when my friends came to celebrate just how things would end. I had
      no idea that a day begun with cake and presents, would end with a journey to
      stop an evil I had never heard of, a legend I didn't know, from destroying everyone
      and everything I ever cared about. I didn't know that on my birthday, I would
      have to embrace not only my destiny, but all my potential destinies, all of
      our potential destinies. Now me and my friends are exploring lost ruins, soaring
      through the sky on forgotten ships, and facing down monsters that I can barely
      imagine, and can just barely survive, all to prevent the very literal end of
      the world.<br><br>Suddenly, getting older doesn't look so bad.<h2 class="bb_tag">
