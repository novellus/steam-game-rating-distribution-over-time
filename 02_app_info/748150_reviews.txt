The story is cute and the music relaxing.\nSome success are a bit tricky to get. I think of level 30 that asks for a perfect score (think about having nothing in your hands at the end of the level!) and the gathering of all the mice (think about selecting them in the diamonds menu). Luckily, the developers answer the questions if we have trouble.\nI think I'll always recommend these games!\n\nIf you want something easy and stress free, here you go!","timestamp_created":1577762899,"timestamp_updated":1577762899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w+j/rO8CcJDG6AE="}
