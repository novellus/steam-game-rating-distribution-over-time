    review: "I saw several reviews not recommending this DLC... In my opinion this\
      \ mod is great just like the real-life boardgame. \n\nI don't find re-rolling\
      \ the food in the birdfeeder or tucking cards to be an issue. \nOnce you understand\
      \ where you have to put the dices for re-rolling the birdfeeder it's very simple.\
      \ Tucking cards I find pretty quick and easy when one player just lifts up the\
      \ card (or the pile of cards) from the board and another player puts the card\
      \ that is supposed to be tucked on the board."
