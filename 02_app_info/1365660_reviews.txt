It's as lazy and effortless trash ..and a complete SCAM from this corrupt developer.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5K-dmv_TjI&feature=youtu.be\n\n..And this isn't the only time this developer has done this.  I've covered other demos from GameGuru also being uploaded as is and being sold for ridiculously high prices here on Steam just under DIFFERENT DEVELOPER NAMES.  It's certainly the same developer, but he/she is just trying to hide what they are doing using different developer names.\n\nI submit this evidence as my proof for my claims above: (evidence is also in my review video above)\n\n1) https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240830/Psychedelic_world/\n\n2) https://store.steampowered.com/app/1362450/lualu/\n\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED!  (Unless you want to pay money for nothing more than a DEMO from the GameGuru kit)\n\nMy Score:  -1,599 out of 1 to 100.  Nothing more than a scam.  This should be removed from Steam ASAP!","timestamp_created":1595588349,"timestamp_updated":1595589026,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":45,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.809464752674102783","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjYyhwPMCdqOglwI="}
