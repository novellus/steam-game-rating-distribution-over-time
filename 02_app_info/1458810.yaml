    review: 'An incredibly well made shooter built on the Doom engine, Dismantled
      is a horror game that will scare the pants off of you. Inspired by the likes
      of Resident Evil, you''ll have to fight off creepy animal hybrid experiments
      while making your way through a big castle to hopefully escape.


      Really shocked this game doesn''t have more people playing it.
