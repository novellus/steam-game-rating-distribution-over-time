It's enjoyable at least.\nNice detailed arenas and interactible like traps, domolishing pillars and nice power-ups\n5/10","timestamp_created":1498423448,"timestamp_updated":1498423448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51155465841293335","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnOq/8NwCft6JfQ=="}
