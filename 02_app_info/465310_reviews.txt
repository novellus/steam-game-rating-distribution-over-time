This isn't really VR. You're in a VR environment sure, but it's just a sad white room with 5 big screens where you can see a 2D film play on on those 5 screens and you can sort of get immersed in the different happenings on each screen. Sometimes there will only be one screen showing, other times all 5 screen will be showing different perspectives of the story.\n\nWhole affairs takes approximately 12 minutes (the experience does restart on its own and has an abrupt conclusion). There is good spatial audio. The drawings and animations, in my opinion, were not all that great. The story was very artistic and experimental. There is no dialogue. \n\nThis experience really wasn't my cup of tea. You may enjoy it more than I did, but I can only give it a neutral recommendation, mostly due to the low price.\n\n[b]Rate 5/10. Buy if you're into artsy, college-level productions.[/b]","timestamp_created":1593058031,"timestamp_updated":1593058031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553571403026580811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42Y7q9PICdqeAkAI="}
