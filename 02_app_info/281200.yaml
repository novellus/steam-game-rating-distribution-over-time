    review: "Deep down, I really, really love this game. It's one of my childhood\
      \ games. \n\nIt's adorable, the morphing blob concept is great, and some parts\
      \ are really fun. But man... does it have some of the most annoying platforming\
      \ I have ever experienced. If your position is off by a fraction of a pixel\
      \ or your timing is a millisecond off, you will plunge into spike pits and get\
      \ eaten by evil blobs over... and over.. and over. It does not help that the\
      \ controls are not particularly responsive (at least, I do not find them to\
      \ be). To say nothing of the boss battles, which are even more tedious.\n\n\
      It gets really frustrating. If you like cute things and have lots of patience,\
      \ it can be fun. Or you might just give up after having to repeat the same section\
      \ ten times in a row.\n\nIt's one of those games that I hesitate to give either\
      \ a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down because the first half is really fun, but as\
      \ the game progresses I feel like the frustration outweighs the fun."
