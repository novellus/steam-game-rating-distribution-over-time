However, the project has been all but abandoned. It is currently a bug-ridden proof of concept, nothing more.\n\nThis is what people initially expect from Early Access titles, but they also expect things to change as the game is developed. Given the catastrophic lack of progress in the past year, the game is unlikely to be finished, and what does exist is not worth anyone's time or money.\n\nFix the bugs.\n\nI can't recommend anyone play this it in its current state UNLESS they intend to actively work with the developers to be directly involved in the game's development and bug fixing.\n\nWill update the review if things ever change.\n\nEdit: Development has apparently resumed after being on hiatus for over half a year, but no update has been released to Steam yet.\n\nEdit 2: It's almost 2021 and there haven't been any updates since 2019. The RPGMaker game I made in a month during middle school had less bugs and more content than this.
