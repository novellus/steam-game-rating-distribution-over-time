The second i feel was rushed a bit more and was more easier to work around than the first one. monsters are a bit harder but no big issue if you are use to RPG. Grind and press on.  These games are worth at least one play through each but it doesnt have that replay value .","timestamp_created":1610035475,"timestamp_updated":1610035475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o/bl7vYCcZmnwQI="}
