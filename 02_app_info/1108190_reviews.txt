Be aware that the interface can be quite touchy - in an early scene, you need to use a bucket of water to put out a fire, and it took several attempts for me to find just the right spot to click in order for it to register. This issue occurred in multiple games.\n\nOne other quibble (and it is a minor one): when a puzzle requires multiple similar items to solve (e.g. scraps of paper), there is no way of knowing if you have all of them other than going to the puzzle, putting in the pieces you have, and then checking if it will let you play. So, it can get frustrating running back and forth to the puzzle to see if you finally have all of the bits.\n\nOn the plus side, the artwork is quite nice, and the mystery story is engaging, which made me want to keep pushing through to see how it all turned out.","timestamp_created":1599945826,"timestamp_updated":1599945826,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7fuMwvQCd4G3oQI="}
