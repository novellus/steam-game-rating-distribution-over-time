    review: '+ Atmosphere, story, voice acting

      + Interactions with animals

      + Climbing controls


      - Performance, severe pop-in and stutter when loading new area (Which is often)

      - Walking simulator (Climbing and light puzzles)

      - No environmental interaction, no object manipulation


      It''s ok for a first playthrough, but without any replay value and it''s short
      duration I can''t recommend at full price. Maybe for your kid?'
