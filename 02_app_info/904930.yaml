    review: 'I have yet to finish this game, but I guess I need to save its life by
      giving it a positive review now, because it''s pretty darn good. I''m enjoying
      it very much. It''s not perfect - it has a few problem but they''re not dealbreakers.

      Also, about the "YOU" feature. I don''t know if the developers know what info
      you''re filling, but you can always call yourself "Ronald McDonald" and upload
      a photo of him or something if you''re worried. Nothing is stopping you from
      doing this. Play it!'
