      picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid are filled in by following the

      we have a secret twist to our puzzles!  Unlike traditional games which limit
      your puzzle to one grid, our puzzles consist of 3 layers.  As a portion of each
      layer is colored in, the final image will begin to form based on how all 3 layers
      blend together.   Ensure each layer is correct, and you'll reveal the final
      image and solve the puzzle!</li></ul>

    review: "[i]Depixtion[/i] is yet another stellar entry in Steam\u2019s ever-growing\
      \ list of Picross-style games, one that stands out with its unique visuals and\
      \ puzzle structures. For anyone looking for more thoughtful puzzles of this\
      \ sort to go through, this is one of the better options available on Steam right\
      \ now. \n\n[i]Depixtion[/i] requires an adjustment compared to other nonogram\
      \ puzzle games; the grid is split up by 4 instead of by 5, and the nature of\
      \ using two different colors within a single image changes how one approaches\
      \ putting a line onto the grid. Where some may find that off-putting, however,\
      \ I found these changes to be refreshing in how they forced me to look at the\
      \ board in a new light each and every time I sat down to do a puzzle. It kept\
      \ me on my toes all throughout. \n\nWhile some snags come along the way - a\
      \ couple puzzles toward the middle are somewhat grindy, and some puzzles accidentally\
      \ leave you with the wrong solution because the labelled numbers give you a\
      \ different solution than is intended - this game is still a total delight.\
      \ I\u2019d be happy to see more puzzles come along for this, whether that be\
      \ through workshop support, an update, or another DLC pack. I was definitely\
      \ itching to go through more puzzles even after the dozens that I\u2019d already\
      \ gone through - something that\u2019s always a sign of a truly enjoyable video\
      \ game experience. \n\n9.0/10"
