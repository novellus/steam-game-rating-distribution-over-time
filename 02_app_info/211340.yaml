    review: "I still haven't had the chance to play the far more recent sequel yet,\
      \ but Magical Diary: Horse Hall remains my favorite English VN to this day.\
      \ \n\nThe characters have depth and personality, and the story presents a world\
      \ that seems at once familiar with a very obvious nod to the world of Harry\
      \ Potter but ready to show its claws as a completely unique beast with strong\
      \ integrity and intriguing worldbuilding that strays far from what might seem\
      \ like a parody or cheap reference on the surface. It deals well with choice\
      \ and consequence, and does an excellent at times presenting consequences for\
      \ different types of choices.\n\nHorse Hall has both less visual and mechanical\
      \ polish than several of the developer's other titles like fairly well-known\
      \ Long Live the Queen, but I really think this is pinnacle of their skill from\
      \ what I've played in their library of products thus far. My greatest critique\
      \ is that I really wish there was more -- I don't think the VN understays its\
      \ welcome, I simply enjoyed it that much."
