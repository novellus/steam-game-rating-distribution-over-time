    review: "[b]LocoSoccer[/b], trata-se de um jogo de futebol side-scroller com 5\
      \ jogadores em campo, cujo objetivo \xE9 ganhar a partida com maior pontua\xE7\
      \xE3o, nele voc\xEA controla simultaneamente dois jogadores de uma vez ou o\
      \ goleiro quando tiver que fazer a defesa.\n\nO jogo \xE9 bastante personaliz\xE1\
      vel, possibilitando o jogador de criar determinado campeonato, jogar campanha\
      \ ou com um amigo em tela compartilhada, \xE9 poss\xEDvel tamb\xE9m alterar\
      \ a apar\xEAncia dos jogadores com uniformes pr\xE9-definidos, acess\xF3rios\
      \ e a bola usada em campo. \n\nO ponto negativo, se d\xE1 por conta da dificuldade\
      \ dos controles ou mesmo acostumar com eles (assista ao trailer para entender\
      \ do que falo), mesmo havendo um tutorial, ele n\xE3o facilita muito. A op\xE7\
      \xE3o de multiplayer cairia bem neste jogo, podendo mudar significativamente\
      \ a nota dele, inclusive esperamos por isso.\n\n| [b]Valor pago:[/b] R$1,09"
