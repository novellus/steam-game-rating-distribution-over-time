I completed the game in just 24 minutes. I am on the fence about recommendations. The UI is simple, although I got hung up on how to control the game (just use the mouse, to drag the colour through the boxes). The levels did not really scale in difficulty and were all easy for me. Restarting a level is not necessary as you can reverse your colour (or flow) to retract your path.\n\nIf you want a very simple puzzle, then this will fill the spot. If you want some difficulty, then look elsewhere. Should keep kids occupied for a bit if they like these sort of puzzle games. The game is cheap (just $1.50 Australian) but might be worth adding to your library in a sale.","timestamp_created":1592722932,"timestamp_updated":1592722932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598300457000732422","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkujr6vICdNmjjwI="}
