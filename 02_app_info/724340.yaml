      by combining modules together, to create more powerful, newer generations of
      turrets<br></li><li>Fight bosses, and proceed in an ever increasing difficulty</li></ul>

    short_description: "You are the crew of an almost destroyed spaceship, and you\
      \ find yourself barely escaped combat alive. Only the ship\u2019s core and cockpit\
      \ are still functional and intact. Manning the tractor beam you bolster your\
      \ ship by scavenging from fallen foes and attempt to escape the enemy sector.\
      \ How long will you last?"
