I had much higher expectations, sadly for me.  Firstly, I absolutely hate not having control of my camera and not being able to explore. In this you are tightly driven to the end, after solving what round out to be very simple puzzles (and very few at that). The game has only one save point before the end from what I could tell on screen and is only a few short chapters. Most of which are cut scenes. Again, if a demo, I could forgive quite a bit, but in no way can I recommend this as a \"game\".","timestamp_created":1604715412,"timestamp_updated":1604715412,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwor+f0PUCf8jnrAI="}
