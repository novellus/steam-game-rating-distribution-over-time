    review: 'Yes, I only played 21 minutes. If you''re one of these people who thinks
      a person has to play a game for 1,000 hours before daring to criticize the fonts
      used in the game, find something more interesting to say. This is bad, and I
      determined this in fewer than 21 minutes.


      The visuals will sell you, of course. The weird concept is neat. It does not
      play well. The difficulty spikes in a terribly uninteresting way. That last
      point is the real issue. Spikes in difficulty, even unfair ones? Not always
      an issue. Rather, it''s that the whole game ends up painfully uninteresting,
      even for this type of game, often of passing interest by design. Nothing compels
      to get past the humps. Success in whatever it''s trying to get you to do level
      to level seems disconnected from your own actions, and thus does not satisfy
      as gameplay. What a dud.


      It''s a mobile-ish reiteration of the send-out-your-troops-and-launch-attacks-on-timers
      sort of game that rewards CRITICALLY IMPORTANT upgrade points based on the old
      three star level performance rating. Yes, another game that becomes theoretically
      more difficult the further you go without perfecting every level left in your
      wake. Figure out the single way to beat the improbably difficult second level
      boss, and then... whatever. The star ratings serve better as an extra challenge,
      not as the bricks of the wall built to obstruct the main strut of the game.
      This is bad design.


      And it''s all just so uninteresting. This surprised me given the immediate oddity
      of the thing, normally a very appealing feature of a game. I don''t know if
      I have issues with the controls. The minions seem not terribly interested in
      doing what you expect them to do. They''ll kill things, not always the one attacking
      you. Yeah, if you fire one of your slow-to-load missiles or such at enemies,
      they die. There will usually be a prohibitive number more following right behind.
      You can use your pet to do whatever at times. I don''t know whatever other greater
      sense of control I can take over the game. I don''t know, I don''t care. Too
      old for this. Not enough time to keep fighting with a game.


      This was a ramble, but there''s a point in there somewhere. Refunded on principle.'
