So any smile I get is very welcome.\n\nThe bad things about this so far is I think tiny bit the writing and the lack of people in the scenes.. Like host mother and host father are not pictured but they are in the dialogue. Its a bit silly. \n\nAnd the script is not foolproof but I would say if you want to support a first project I would say whoever is behind this has some kind of good touch whatever that person does, and even though it might be a mess as it is now I dont mind as I am happy to support a non adult VN happily. Too many of those around anyway, its nice to have something right and clean for once that someone has made, I think that might be the reason why I smile at this, its still a noob project but the mind behind it is pure and good.. Thats why I say thumbs up and support this!\n\nEDIT: I would still say it needs more characters shown in it because it describes masses and this and that but NO One is there hehe so it sort of well falls short on the story because it does not back it up visually. Still recommending it but maybe for the next project if theres masses of people they need to be shown thats all.","timestamp_created":1607432981,"timestamp_updated":1607551460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqpTipPYCdOWWuAI="}
