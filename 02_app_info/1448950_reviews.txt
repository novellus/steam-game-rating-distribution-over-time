I realize its a new release and some of these things will (Probably,iunno) get patched out, but there are just some general basic choices made for the game that would kill most people's enjoyment/ first impression of the game as it did my own. that being said for 8 dollars what are you really expecting?     refunded and moving on.","timestamp_created":1604853743,"timestamp_updated":1604860530,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1YnJ1PUCdt2WrQI="}
