But it is obviously not for everyone. Who will like it?[hr][/hr] If you are much into space flying/trading simulators like Elite Dangerous, X series etc., and you want to bring it to a next, much more realistic level, this game might be for you.[hr][/hr] What is Rise? It is mostly airplane/spaceship simulator placed in future on a moon which is being colonized. If you have some experience in Microsoft Flight Simulator or X-Plane it will help you a lot because this simulator is realistic. Different planes every with its own flight model, some with vertical t/o capability and everything in realistic physics. You will need some piloting skill or you can learn these skills during gameplay. But it's not only about flying in the atmosphere. Some ships will allow you for a suborbital and even orbital flight to the space stations. So basic knowledge of orbital flight is needed as everything is modelled correctly in Newtonian physics. If you have experience in Orbiter or even in Kerbal Space Program it will be very helpful. If not - you will have to learn it.[hr][/hr] Now while mentioned simulators only give you possibility to fly your own scenario, Rise also simulates your career. You start as a poor colonist who has to literally drive taxi to earn. Soon you will be able rent a truck and start hauling vehicles or do some basic trading. From that it's very soon to renting first flying vehicle, which will allow you to visit nearby colonies and earn much more on trading. Now I must admit here that car driving might not be very appealing, as the city seems empty without AI traffic, but it really works well for the immersion and also as basic guide before you start to understand how the game mechanics work. At that time you can also use a simulator to get the feel of flying.[hr][/hr] As a more endgame activity you can build your own colonies. You will first have to find a good spot which is rich either in some rare materials or fuel ore and then you can build your first mine. You will also need to have a farm to feed the colonists and a town if you want to future refine your ore and basic materials into more valuable stuff. The game is an online MMO and whole economy is player driven. Everyone sets their own prices hoping that other pilots will supply their colonies with stuff they need and buying their products. Nothing is scripted here. People can form alliances or even make some economical wars, for example setting up dumping prices to shut down other enterprises. Unfortunately the player base is small mostly because the game is difficult and requires a lot of effort to get into.[hr][/hr] The game interface might be a bit puzzling at first but actually it is pretty effective. Most of the stuff is done either by context menu or by writing in the computer window. Again it gives a lot of immersion. For example if you want to load some stuff to a cargo hold you will have to write something like \"1+10\" which will mean to put 10 tones into bay 1. I really like that idea because it feels more realistic than just moving some sliders on a menu. There is also so much attention put into little details. For example if you want to build a mine, you will first have to visit a place where you buy the land, then you will have to buy or rent a container which will suit your new project, then you have to visit a company which will put a mine project inside. Then you bring it to your spot and deploy. Next you will have to supply it with needed materials and personnel, or pay others to do it for you. With enough materials you can now order your workers to build certain elements of the mine like extractors, separators, storage buildings etc. It's very fun to see how it grows and how your products affect the global economy. If you for example buy an ATM for your colony, so people can get cash from their account to buy stuff from you, you will have to put some money inside. That is the level of detail involved.[hr][/hr] The game itself is more or less a hobby project developed for many years. Therefore, the graphics may look outdated but it's not for the graphics itself why you play the game. And some views, especially sun setting from the orbit are just beautiful. The game even though advertised as in alpha state is fully playable but in the same time still developed. You may be sure it won't be abandoned, because people involved in development also love to play it themselves. They are very open to discussion and any opinions. The game is connected to a discord server and you will spend a lot of time talking with them, learning the stuff and giving your own ideas.[hr][/hr] The game is made by people with some real life aviation background and you can really see it. You can do ILS approaches and there is even ATC which will vector you to the airfield. But also the economy model is very realistic with a lot of attention into details. While flying similar routes may seem to get boring quickly it's not, because every flight is different. The plane will behave differently depending on how much cargo and fuel it is carrying. Depending on distance your suborbital flights will look different. You will get better at planing a good and not so very hot re-entry every time. It's so fun to see how your skills in piloting increase and so how does your bank account. As the game is MMO there is no time compression. You will sometimes have to wait for example for a take-off window to a space station and flights may take from few minutes to even few hours. It's designed for hardcore simmers but it's really worth the effort.[hr][/hr] One drawback of the game might be the fact that there is no real manual for it and the game is difficult with a steep learning curve. There is a wiki which gives a lot of information but it doesn't explain everything in detail. You will have to ask people about certain things, how they are done and how they work. So you need to be prepared for some serious learning. If you don't like it and just want to get straight into action, the game is not for you, so be aware of that. Fortunately the small community is very helpful and will explain everything to you. If you are in doubt there is a fully playable free demo available. Go ahead and try it. You are only limited by no possibility to build your own colonies, but as I mentioned this is more an endgame activity so you really don't need it at the start. If you get the hang of the game, you can also later buy the full version.[hr][/hr] To quickly summarize. Rise is an amazing spaceship/spaceplane simulator focusing mostly on trading and colony management in realistic, player driven economy. The game is difficult but the effort to learn it is well worth it. I highly recommend it to every serious simmer.","timestamp_created":1600301610,"timestamp_updated":1600383340,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541595935821533203","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3vmRz/QCcP2jogI="}
