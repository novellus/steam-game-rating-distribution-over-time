Combine this with unfair enemy placement behind doors and corners, a 5-6 hour game extends to 10 hours for no bloody reason. The last couple of levels introduce really terrible level design and obtuse puzzles and weird scripted events where enemies will not die unless you shoot them from a specific place in the map etc., it becomes tedious.\n\nI can only recommend this game for it's unique setting and it's different design ideas from early 2000's. Maybe if it's played on the Easy setting it becomes more bearable. One other thing to note is that the game received a PS2 port which was ported back into PC, it's sort of a remaster but not really because they are a little different here and there but from what I understand the obtuse level design was cut down, however the ability to quick save was removed, which is a big deal IMO, Iron Storm can be so cruel at times so quick save is the only reason I was able to finish it. If you want to check out the remaster, it's called World War Zero on Steam. Also the screenshots on the store page of Iron Storm are from this remaster version and og Iron Storm has much cruder graphics.","timestamp_created":1605371024,"timestamp_updated":1605371024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqLrk4/UCeeSsrgI="}
