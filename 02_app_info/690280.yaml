      as pleasurable tingling sensations in the head, scalp, back, or anywhere in
      the body in response to visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or cognitive stimuli.<br><br>ASMR
      also aids in relaxation and sleep. Many people experience ASMR differently so
      there are a wide array of sounds included, all sounds can also be pitch-shifted;
      this way virtually any sound can be made into something relaxing. ASMR Universe

    review: Would recommend the software as a quick and easy way to add foley into
