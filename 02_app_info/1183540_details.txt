{"1183540":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"dlc","name":"Trailmakers Skin Pack DLC","steam_appid":1183540,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This DLC includes five beautiful new skins that can be applied to blocks in Trailmakers. The skins are: Camouflage, Brick, Wood, Glow and Metallic. While a block has any of these skins, it can also be colored to change the color of the glow, the sheen of the metal, the type of wood etc.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPurchasing the Skin Pack supports the development of Trailmakers and future games from Flashbulb. Thanks for the support :)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe skins can be applied to the following blocks: Block 1x2, Block 1x3, Block 1x4, Block 2x4, Block 2x2x2, Block 4x8, Cylinder 1x1x2, Shield Plates, and all the blocks in the Aerodynamic Category.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe skins do not change the physical properties of the blocks in the game - it is purely a cosmetic change. Players who do not own this DLC cannot edit a vehicle that uses the skins, but they can still take the vehicle for a drive. To edit a vehicle that uses a block skin you do not own, you must either remove the blocks that uses the block skins, or purchase them for yourself.","about_the_game":"This DLC includes five beautiful new skins that can be applied to blocks in Trailmakers.
