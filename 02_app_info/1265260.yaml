    review: "Very good Shoot Em Up, So far everything works great, smooth controls,\
      \ good music, lots of weapons, right difficulty but also quite challenging because\
      \ the game is sneaky and unexpected lol, 8 big stages with a mid boss and end\
      \ boss, You can play these stages in any order you want, each stage as its own\
      \ different variety of enemies,\noverall i am very impressed and love the pixel/block\
      \ graphics awesome retro style, \nIf you are a big fan of side scrolling retro/modern\
      \ shoot em ups you will love this.\nwell worth more than the asking price.\n\
      Fantastic work guys...Both Thumbs UP!!!...Buy this game...Highly Recommended\
      \ :)"
