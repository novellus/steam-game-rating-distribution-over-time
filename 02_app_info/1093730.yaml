      players. It''s not starting from scratch explaining everything. Standalone would

    review: "This DLC is fantastic. A huge standalone adventure within the Supraland\
      \ universe, adding a GIANT chunk of brilliant, clever content and LOL moments\
      \ to one of my favourite games ever. \n\nI just finished it and I loved it!\
      \ All I can say is don't get hung up on the \"not as good as main game\" talk!\
      \ This DLC is still exceptional entertainment in its own right (and stupidly\
      \ good value right now).\n\nPut it this way: Even without the Supraland main\
      \ game, this Crash DLC alone is one of the most entertaining, intelligent, engaging\
      \ and FUNNY games I've played in the past 10 years. I can't really say more\
      \ than that.\n\nBuy this DLC with the main game and support this genius developer\
      \ to produce the next Supraland games. I can't get enough of this amazing world."
