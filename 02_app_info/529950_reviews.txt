I had it on switch, so I decided to buy it on PC. It's loads of fun for the first 10 minutes of a play session, but it kind of wears out after. Don't get me wrong, it's fun, but it does get kind of repetitive and all. Also, be wary that you can only play with other people.","timestamp_created":1609942388,"timestamp_updated":1609942388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0umC7PYCdqmBwQI="}
