    about_the_game: '<i>An Ensemble of Four Seasons</i> -- An original arrangement
      that chronologically features the four in-game season loops, welding them together
      into one grand musical movement that underlines the grand narrative of the game.
      The official title track tries to bridge the gap between a <i>Chiptune Aesthetic</i>
      and a higher quality <i>Orchestral Production</i>. In this bundle you can hear
      both at the same time, or exclusively listen to the individual versions. All
      versions you hear in-game are included as part of the bundle. Includes two <strong>bonus
      tracks</strong>: <i>An Ensemble of Four Seasons [orchestral version]</i> and
      <i>What Goes Up Must Come Down (Beta Title Theme) [CanPixel remix]</i>.'
