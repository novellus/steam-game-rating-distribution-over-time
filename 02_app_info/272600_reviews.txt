This Game seems way too child-like to take seriously, which isn't a bad thing, but not a great thing either, it's all just very 'Meh' and one notch above mediocrity.\n\nI kind of like the design & visuals, the characters, the voice acting of the cast, the mysterious setting and the soundtrack (even though a song titled 'The Fun Theme' that was from the Game's OST sounds like Bittersweet Symphony for some reason) \n\nThe most Negative thing I can say about this, is that the Game has very little replayablilty value, meaning that if you have already played this Game once, then you've basically seen it all and then you just move on, but to this Game's defence - It is only a very short puzzle Game with a 'Meh' story. And I have yet to see any other relating installments of the Game to better understand the Detective Grimoire Universe, so I have no idea of what direction it's concept is going, either before or after this Game.","timestamp_created":1524659939,"timestamp_updated":1610046119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xcOO7/YCdOT/ngE="}
