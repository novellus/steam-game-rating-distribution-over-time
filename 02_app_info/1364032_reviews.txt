(I prefer to make my own).\n\nYes you do need to learn to drive it properly (as you do all BMG locomotives) and it is an incredibly thirsty locomotive. I tend to drive with the HUD but have now taught myself not to drive with it so I could use this locomotive properly and it is definitely worth it! Anybody wishing to buy it, or any BMG locomotive, should not be put off by any negative comments saying it is too hard. If I can do it then anybody can. The first time I drove it without the HUD or automatic fireman and I got such a buzz when I did it. Personally I prefer that sort of experience then the simple accelerate and brake action that many locomotives/multiple units (diesel and electric) are.\n\nOnly negative is that, apart from the support coach 'Mercator', it doesn't come with any carriages itself. Only an issue if you do Quick Drive. If you are a player who likes to watch the world go by, this might not be the best for you as I find myself constantly playing with the controls in the cab (very realistic). However this might be because I'm not an expert and I'm sure there are plenty of players who can handle all the controls and still enjoy the view out of the cab!\n\nIf you are into steam locomotives and don't mind learning to do somethings properly, then go for it.","timestamp_created":1607108682,"timestamp_updated":1607108682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkYzJl/YCfqyotwI="}
