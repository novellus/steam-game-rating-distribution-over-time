      \ more than 2,000 GP38-2 models were built by General Motors between 1972 and\

      \ some were exported to Canada, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. <br><br>Their modest\
      \ power output of 2,000 horsepower from a 16 cylinder engine saw them classified\

      \ although some were built in high hood variant, as portrayed in the EMD GP38-2\
