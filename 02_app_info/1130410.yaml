    review: 'Cyber Hook has a better sense of speed than any other platformer I''ve
      ever played. It feels incredible to literally fly through the levels at the
      speed of sound. It took me 5-6 hours to get 3 stars on every level, which wasn''t
      especially difficult but was definitely fun.


      Level design can be hit and miss. Most are fine but there are a few with annoyingly
      tight tunnels, or stairs that are awkward to climb. Overall it''s not a big
      deal, and the speed you go through the game really makes the individual issues
      pretty minor.


      There is a small story, surprisingly. It''s not especially gripping but it does
      serve to give character to the world. You won''t miss much if you skip through
      the dialogue. it is somewhat frustrating that story progress is tied to crystals
      collected, instead of levels completed, as it displays story elements and makes
      claims about future levels out of sync of your completion. That is, if you finish
      each level in order.


      Overall Cyber Hook is well worth the price. If you like the demo, buy the game!'
