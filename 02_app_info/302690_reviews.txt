I got serious Shawn of the dead vibes from this game and I had a few good laughs throughout my playthrough, so if you like kinda dark humor, metal music and point and click games, this one is for you!","timestamp_created":1609731894,"timestamp_updated":1609731894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr+3f5fYCfo+kwAI="}
