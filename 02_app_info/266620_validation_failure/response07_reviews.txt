I've played Line of Defense on and off for a while. Here is my honest review of the game and the potential it has.\n\nPros:\n-----\n+ Map design. The maps are big with various terrain and points of interest. \n+ Jet Pack and HAIS Mechanics are actually pretty fun.\n+ Music is good.\n\nCons:\n----\n- Weapon design feels a bit lacking.\n- Graphics look a bit dated.\n- Relies on a healthy number of players to be worth playing.\n\nI will elaborate the cons I have listed a little bit for the developers. The game is an MMORPG, but implements the weapon-systems of traditional shooters which is basically a lot of different guns with different firing modes. I would love to see more complex systems, such as customizing and/or building your own weapons. As I understand it, we are supposed to progress by getting credits and unlocking items in the shop. Is that enough? I don't believe so. For me that is the toughest part with LoD. Why should I play this game for more than a week? Is the world dynamic with events and so forth? Those are things that remain unanswered for me.\n\nThe game definitely has potential as an early-access product, however. It has the potential to be a ton of fun -- providing that players actually log on and stick around, which to me there is no incentive to right now. I will recommend this game based on the potential alone, that further down the development line, progression and weapon systems can be developed on. The core of the game is decent which can lead to many hours of fun times.","timestamp_created":1460880961,"timestamp_updated":1460880991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480418562889099121","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4sdzSkdQCctDcVQ=="}
