I played this while listening to an audio book. It can be played with only the mouse. Mindless isn't exactly the right word, but you do sort of get in a rhythm with it. It is a good game to play while thinking about something else. It was exactly what I was looking for and I enjoyed it. I appreciate that it puts all the mechanics up front and you don't have to wait to unlock things (what you unlock is just how long/how often for power ups)","timestamp_created":1585105965,"timestamp_updated":1585105965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/LHrh/ECctbq+gE="}
