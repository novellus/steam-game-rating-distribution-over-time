NO FUN! People play games to relax, not to rush and worry about an arbitrary timer for each level. Basically unplayable.\n\nGame deleted!","timestamp_created":1609605195,"timestamp_updated":1609605195,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z8T84fYCd6vjvwI="}
