    about_the_game: "Delve deep into this dangerous dungeon, battling deadly monsters\
      \ and discovering epic loot. Cavesweeper is a unique roguelike puzzle game that\
      \ is easy to play but difficult to master. No two playthroughs will ever be\
      \ the same in this addictive, infinitely replayable RPG puzzler! For the competitive\
      \ players, leaderboards exist - can you make it to the top and stay there? Includes\
      \ 40 in-game quests, with corresponding Steam achievements!<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe puzzle battle gameplay works as follows: each of the 25 tiles on the field\
      \ is a certain color. When you correctly reveal a tile, a number will be displayed\
      \ inside that tile. This number tells you how many of the 4 surrounding tiles\
      \ (North, South, East, and West - NO DIAGONALS!) are that same color. When you\
      \ incorrectly guess a tile, you will be hit by the monster you're currently\
      \ battling. Different monsters have different properties, effects, and so on.\
      \ Throughout the dungeon you will find equipment which will aid you in battle,\
      \ for example by allowing you to regenerate hit points or have armor to reduce\
      \ the damage you take from enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConveniently, the game\
      \ auto-saves after each battle. You can exit out of the application and resume\
      \ later. If you enjoy Picross, Sudoku, or Minesweeper, you will love this game!"

    review: It's a minesweeper game that runs at a super low resolution and gets old
      after your first run. It looks like it took less than a week to make. It won't
      stay on your hard-drive longer than 30 minutes.
