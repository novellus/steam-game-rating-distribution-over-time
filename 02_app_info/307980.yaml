    review: 'Thought I would give this game a go.... absolute garbage. Its just sheer
      luck. You set batsman to ultra defensive and they swing for the fences getting
      out, you change the bowlers, their lengths, round the wicket etc absolutely
      sweet nothing. I cant bat out a game to draw it without the other team ripping
      through my middle order yet the CPU finds it a piece of cake. On the off chance
      you are in command, rain stops play or as you are about to win bad light stops
      play! How convenient!


      Avoid this game at all cost and any future versions. Although not very expensive,
      wish I never wasted my money! If you want a game of luck just play a bit of
      blackjack online!'
