    review: This is the perfect mix between an FPS and a Strategy game set in space.
      I played through the tutorial and one custom game (got gobsmacked playing on
      Brutal). The dev has a great sense of humor and there are easter eggs that you
      can easily miss if you aren't paying attention. I can only imagine how amazing
      this game will be once they finish. There's a few things that make you remember
      it's early access but for the majority of the time, it feels like a finished
      game. Thanks to the dev for all their hard work.
