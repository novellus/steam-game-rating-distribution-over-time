    review: A very fun little game which is surprisingly difficult. It offers up a
      large variety of powerups and abilities for the player to combine in whatever
      they please. Playing this game for too long in one sitting will result in some
      serious wrist pain so be warned. But overall a fun game both in design and gameplay.
