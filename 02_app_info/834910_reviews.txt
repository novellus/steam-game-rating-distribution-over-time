While it's fun when you're in, there's a game breaking bug that is STILL there 2 years later. UE4shootergame crash error. This happens randomly in game, but mainly while in the server browser. This has happened on my old computer (while old, it was more than capable of running Atlas), my wife's computer, and my new computer. All 3 have had this issue and it's still not fixed. If you google 'UE4shootergame Atlas', you'll see many with this issue. The Devs refuse to fix it.\n\nOriginal review below:\n\nI honestly don't remember ever reviewing a game before. I always felt the reviews accurately reflected the product. However, in this case I don't, which is why I am  writing a positive review for this game. I hesitantly purchased Atlas after reading all the negative reviews, but also after watching Youtube gameplay. The gameplay I watched looked incredibly entertaining. After downloading Atlas, and trying several times to get into a server, I finally did. I must say it's the most fun I've had in a game since Rust. I joine a public server (highly recommend) because while I love survival games, Atlas is incredibly grind filled. A 5x community server seems like a great balance. Community servers are also far less cancerous and they usually have active admins. I'd highly suggest this if your experience wasn't good.\n\nAnyway, the amount of content is overwhelming. It's been extremely fun just learning what to do and how to do things. Sailing is a great experience. The mechanics are tight. Crafting, exploring, building, treasure hunting, raiding, sailing, farming, manning cannons....there's just so much to do. Of course there are issues. It's EA after all. Some of them can be frustrating such as AI enemy ghost ship spawns and multiplying water spouts at sea. Some animals are far too aggressive, but over all my connectivity beyond the first couple days of playing has been dependable. \n\nI honestly would base your decision to purchase Atlas on whether or not you think the gameplay on Youtube looks fun and not on the overwhelming negative reviews that came in the first couple days when the launch had some major issue. Those seem to be ironed out.","timestamp_created":1546484202,"timestamp_updated":1610080263,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4teOQ8PYCdY+qtwE="}
