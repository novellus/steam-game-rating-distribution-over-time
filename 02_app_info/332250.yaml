    short_description: Set in a futuristic Odyssey, &quot;The Next Penelope&quot;
      is a fast paced action racing game with loud colors, an original story and a
      challenging risk-reward system. Weapons can be mixed and used at any time, but
      all these abilities cost vital energy!

    review: "If I could give a neutral recommendation I would, but you know this is\
      \ Steam. I understand this was made by one guy and I give props to him, he made\
      \ a game that's functional. However, it's mired in some strange quirks and wonky\
      \ design. \n\nSo running down the list of issues I had with this game.\n\nFirst,\
      \ the camera too close in on the vehicle and the fix is an IN-GAME UPGRADE.\
      \ Coupled with no map of the stage (Only a dinky Progress bar at the bottom\
      \ of the screen) it can lead to you failing over and over until you learn the\
      \ stage by memory and the mechanics associated with it. I'm gonna call this\
      \ one a cardinal sin by racing game standards.\n\nSecond, The controls sometimes\
      \ don't work and are needlessly loose. Maybe it's my controller, but I had a\
      \ hell of a time playing this game on it and I play games with it fine all the\
      \ time. I think it's just this title at this rate. I'll give this one a pass,\
      \ but only because it might be my controller.\n\nThird, the Difficulty is another\
      \ issue and only hurts this title. It starts at \"Medium\" and only goes to\
      \ \"Very Hard\" with no in between. Some stages are super-easy, but it's labelled\
      \ as \"Very Hard\". Other stages are labelled as \"Medium\" but will kick your\
      \ teeth in for no reason. This odd curve of difficulty combined with the \"\
      Life as Energy\" system just adds just needless frustration. \n\nFinally, The\
      \ Mechanic of \"Life as Energy\". Your energy is so truncated due to equipment\
      \ usage and the energy costs for them that many stages are hurdles due to it.\
      \ Expend too much or run into a wall enough times and you just might as well\
      \ restart the level. Most of the racer levels have energy recharge pads, but\
      \ other open area zones don't and you only get the \"Mine\" option to recharge\
      \ your energy meter. However, the Mine needs to kill a target to gain energy\
      \ back for you, but the mine itself doesn't have a proximity detonation and\
      \ you can kill yourself with it by running into it or by chunked down by the\
      \ cost. The mechanic adds needless complexity and many pieces of equipment are\
      \ dubious in usefulness which leads to many unneeded restarts.\n\nAll in all,\
      \ I had a bad time playing \"The Next Penelope\". Some of the issues are fixed\
      \ by the in-game upgrade system, but many aren't and lead to a slanted experience.\
      \ However, if you can put up with the odd mechanics and strange layout, give\
      \ it a shot."
