Fans of the Final Fantasy series will likely admire and outlook any outdated qualities for the many references to Square's past works of art, beginning with the diverse job system and classic enemy appearances, as well as the fluid combat system that constantly keeps you on your toes! \n\n       It is Pay to Play however and the sign up process can be a hassle, but with a little bit of patience and a couple of friends to play with, then you definitely pay for what you get.\n\nUpdate: Just recently I hopped back in via a free login campaign. I ended up subscribing, and am having a blast once again. The quality of life changes make travel and almost everything else more accessible, whilst still offerring up quite challenging instances and events. It's definitely the time to get back into the game if you were ever on the fence.","timestamp_created":1348846737,"timestamp_updated":1543049424,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyLW6oucCcPXXGA=="}
