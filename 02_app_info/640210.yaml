    review: I want to like this game but it sucks. I really like the adventurer's
      guild premise, but every quest is filled with arbitrary nonsense and unbeatable
      tasks. I've tried sooo many times to make a mage character, not one time has
      it paid off to have. There is no system for what quests are available at any
      given time. Most of them seem like you're supposed to lose, and the other's
      are deceptively simple. I've had to scrap several characters because I know
      how the available quests are going to go, because I've tried a million times.
      You can't single handedly defeat an enemy with the hardest difficulty with the
      gear you got for $10 at the beginning of the game? Oh well you lose reputation,
      you suck. You need 3 materials but you know that getting those materials will
      get you killed? You suck, EHH. You can't defeat a tribe of goblins by yourself
      and going the diplomatic way just makes things worse even though you have points
      in the diplomatic skill, suck EHHHHHHHH. It's not fun. I get excited about giving
      this game another chance but its the same every time. Make a character, select
      comically impossible quest, die/fail quest.
