    about_the_game: "When you\u2019re out of the kitchen, the rats will dunk.<br><br>DunkRatz\
      \ is a team-based local multiplayer game for 2-4 players. Each player takes\
      \ control of a rat on a kitchen floor, with the goal of feeding a ball of cheese\
      \ to their team\u2019s giant baby rat to score a point. Unique dashing and grabbing\
      \ mechanics mean that teams that work together will have the most success feeding\
      \ their baby. Not only can players grab the cheese and throw it towards their\
      \ baby, but they can pick up ANYTHING and throw it around: their baby, the other\
      \ team\u2019s baby, even other players! Special items periodically spawn into\
      \ the kitchen that players can pick up and use to shake-up the match. First\
      \ team to reach the score limit wins!<br><br><strong>Simple controls with physics-based\
      \ movements:</strong> rotate your rat with the analog stick, and hold down the\
      \ dash button to charge up a dash. Running into objects with your mouth will\
      \ automatically grab them, allowing you to charge up and throw the object instead\
      \ of moving yourself with a dash. <br><strong>Interact with everything:</strong>\
      \ Pick up the cheese to throw it to your baby, or pick up your baby and throw\
      \ it towards the cheese! Want to play defense? Pick up the other team\u2019\
      s baby and move it away from the cheese. Players can even grab other players\
      \ if they manage to get to their rear. But remember: if you are holding an object\
      \ then you cannot dash.<br><strong>Wrestle other players:</strong> Not only\
      \ can players pick up and throw the babies and the cheese, but they can also\
      \ grab other players. Dominate the game by grabbing other players by the rear\
      \ and throwing them far away from the action, or grab them and hold them in\
      \ place right before they dash away with the cheese. <br><strong>5 different\
      \ special items:</strong> Players can bump into special cabinets that periodically\
      \ activate to obtain special items that can help tip the match into their favor:\
      \ get a quick speed boost with a bottle rocket, pull in objects from far away\
      \ with a plunger, lay down mouse-traps to catch your opponents, block off part\
      \ of the arena with Jelly molds, or knock objects out of your opponents hands\
      \ with a well-aimed egg.<br><strong>Cheese cannons never break the flow:</strong>\
      \ Instead of stopping and restarting play after each cheese ball is scored,\
      \ 2 big cheese cannons appear from the refrigerators and allow each team to\
      \ strategically launch the next cheese ball onto the arena.<br><strong>Jazz-inspired\
      \ musical soundscape:</strong> Every action in the game has a musical sound-effect\
      \ that makes for a unique funky tune every match.<br><strong>Customize your\
      \ match:</strong> Choose which items can spawn into the game, and choose what\
      \ score limit to play to (we recommend 10). <br><strong>We cut the fat:</strong>\
      \ Like most sports, DunkRatz has just one game mode and one arena. We focused\
      \ on the fun and designed every mechanic around it. <br><br>DunkRatz requires\
      \ a controller for each player and does not support keyboard/mouse play. <br><br>While\
      \ DunkRatz does not have native online support it does takes full advantage\
      \ of Steam's Remote Play Together feature allowing you and up to 3 friends to\
      \ play together online!<br><br><strong>Controls:</strong><br>Left stick - Rotate\
      \ your rat.<br>A button (while not holding anything) - Hold to charge up a dash\
      \ or tap quickly for smaller steps.<br>A button (while holding an object) -\
      \ Hold to charge up a long throw, or tap to quickly toss the object a small\
      \ distance.<br>B button - Use special item."
