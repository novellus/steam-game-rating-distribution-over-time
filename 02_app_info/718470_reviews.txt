This is a hidden gem. If you want to support devs for making interesting / unique VR games, this one is a fine one to do it. I paid $2.39 for this game during the Steam Summer Sale 2018 and think it's a good deal even at normal price.\n\nI haven't experienced a game quite like this one in VR. It's a simple concept but it's well executed and it's quite the challenge, especially after the first few levels. In fact, I'm stuck on the 12th/13th puzzle. Basically, this is reverse Jenga. You are building rock structures up to the designated height areas which turn into green circles once you've reached them. Get all the circles green to advance to the next level. You get more stars for finishing quickly [spoiler] TWSS [/spoiler]. \n\nHowever, certain circles have X marked on them. You cannot let a rock touch those areas. The limited amount of rocks come in all shapes and colors. It's quite the challenge to solve some of these puzzles. This is not mindless stacking of rocks (after the first few levels). These are actual puzzles to solve. \n\nThere is only 1 environment, but it's a very beautiful environment that makes the puzzle area nice and serene. There's also music on a loop. I did like the music, but I can see it becoming annoying if you have to listen to it for an extended period of time. \n\nThe game has 30 levels with 3 stars possible for each level (although I have no idea how to get 3 stars on the 1st level). You automatically have 4 photos taken when you solve a puzzle. You have to select one to proceed to the next level. Warning though: you do need full roomscale for this game as you'll often be picking up rocks from the ground. You may even want to kneel down on the ground. Rocks are pretty spread out as well. The game says it has leaderboards, but I only saw my scores (I'm not sure if that means I'm the one and only player!)\n\nRate 7/10.","timestamp_created":1533431943,"timestamp_updated":1533432490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572649598121643066","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgd3sg+UCeYjOpwE="}
