      \ fluid physics to describe growing up stories of the main character. We have\
      \ split the whole story to 5-6 episodes. The prologue starts in 2016, when the\
      \ main character just get back home from work and too tired to play any games.\
      \ He started to rethink where his passions are gone. Then he starts to recall\
      \ his childhood memories. The next episodes are about his memories in different\
      \ periods of life. Episode One describes a timeline when he was born in the\
      \ 1980s, he had a brilliant childhood, and grew up little by little. The next\
      \ episodes are about his memories in the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. At the end,\
      \ the memory ends and he wakes up in reality. In each episode, the player would\
      \ have to make some side choices, which will affect side plots in the follow-up\
      \ episodes. Because the whole game focuses on storytelling, we have to make\
      \ some restrictions on the puzzle solving and level designing parts. Our purpose\
      \ is to bring players a continuous gaming experience, without being interrupted\
      \ by some puzzles. But don\u2019t think the game is easy. We have placed all\
      \ the hard parts on the side choices. This is just the same as life itself.\
      \ One who chooses a special path always pays more than those choose an ordinary\
      \ path.<br>If you think you are special, try to make your own choices.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\"><strong>Why we choose to release the game based on episodes? </strong></h2><br>The\
      \ game adopts a relatively new gameplay mode. We hope to bring our creative\
      \ works to more players, and paying by episodes would lower the doorsill for\
      \ many players who want to experience the game. <strong>We will continue to\
      \ update new contents free of charge in the Early Access phase</strong>. After\
      \ the game is formally released, we will release more DLCs which will require\
      \ a certain price. If players don\u2019t like any of the new DLCs, they can\
      \ choose not to buy them. If players still looking forward to more contents,\
      \ then they could pay a relatively little money to enjoy the game and support\
      \ independent studios like us.<br><br>We totally understand that games like\
      \ The Shape of Heart, which gives only a few hours of gameplay, are not quite\
      \ supported by the Steam refund system. But we are confident that even if you\
      \ complete the game within two hours, you could feel the sincerity of our developers.\
      \ The game still has much to optimize, and we are trying our best. We hope the\
      \ new episodes and new games will be better with your support. Thank you again!<br><br>Facebook:\
