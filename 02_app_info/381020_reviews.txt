This is easily one of the most addictive games I've ever played.\n\nSo first things first, what are we dealing with here? Well, I would personally make comparisons to the [i]Ace Combat[/i] franchise; but, if I'm honest, [i]Sky Rogue[/i] makes most other air combat games look [b]slow[/b] in comparison: if [i]Ace Combat[/i] is [i]Call of Duty[/i], [i]Sky Rogue[/i] is basically 90s [i]DooM[/i] by comparison. Seriously, it's [b]that[/b] fast.\n\nSo basically, you're a lone pilot fighting for some nebulous \"Aeroforce\" against some \"Crimson State\" and its poorly defined allies. The thing is, death is not the end: Every time you get shot down, you get to unlock new planes and weapons that can enable you to fight further until you confront this massive boss machine that the enemy forces have been cooking up.\n\nYou've got three roles of aircraft: versatile and agile Fighters, lightning-fast Interceptors that specialize in air-to-air, and slow but durable Bombers that excel in air-to-ground; and they come in the classes of faster but more fragile Lights, well-rounded Mediums, Swing-Wings that give you even [b]more[/b] versatility than the Mediums at the expense of a little durability, tough and heavily armed Heavies, and powerful Experimentals. The weapons on offer cover all the bases, with unguided rockets, bombs and machine guns; various air-to-air and air-to-ground guided missiles; and even a handful of large caliber cannons with high damage but requiring more skill in their use.\n\nIn general, the controls are excellent. The game allows you to completely rebind [b]every[/b] control that you can use, making it easy to set up most gamepads or flight sticks. And as mentioned before, this game is [b]fast[/b]: Especially after upgrading them, every aircraft in the game feels [b]extremely[/b] responsive; and the weapons all feel quite powerful, with the effects for hitting and destroying enemies sending small pieces of material scattering in all directions(though you never actually blast holes in them, sadly).\n\nBut the real rabbit hole with this game isn't the gameplay itself, as crazy as that sounds. No, we need to talk about mod support. If you've got the software and the know-how, you can create almost anything: new playable aircraft [b]including[/b] support for custom aircraft stats, new weapons with custom models and abilities, entire new [b]missions[/b] with their own environmental color palettes. They've got tons of stuff in the Workshop, and the possibilities are almost literally endless here. There are various crafts from various shmups, movies, other games, silly stuff like literal flying tanks, modern and historic real-life aircraft, you name it. If you're ever feeling nostalgic for the old [i]Star Wars: Rogue Squadron[/i] games, they've got multiple [i]Star Wars[/i] starfighters in there waiting for you. Or you could bring the squadrons of [i]Ace Combat[/i] into this game with various skins and aircraft from that.\n\nIn all, [i]Sky Rogue[/i] is an [b]excellent[/b] air combat game, and anyone who likes arcade air combat [b]must[/b] play this game at some point in their lives. I can't praise this game enough.
