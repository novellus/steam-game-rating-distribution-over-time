Now ALL weapons under the listed categories have had their repair cost values increased to 6240, which will cost you 100 WF$ per game of Team Deathmatch, making it impossible to earn money without A: Winning every game, or B: MAKING ADDITIONAL PURCHASES TO GET BOOSTERS\n\nWeapon types that have their repair cost values increased to $6240:\nWinter Camo\nJungle Camo\nMischief/Halloween\nChristmas\nShiny Metal Set\nUrban/City Camo\n\n\nSome would argue:\n\"The weapons have better stats than their normal versions\"\nTrue, but even so, they only have SLIGHT and IRRELEVANT improvements. In fact, the H&K MP5 Jungle Camo is actually WORSE than its normal version, and the AUG A3 9mm XS only has 1 meter of extra range, a difference so slight that it doesn't even matter, making the two weapons not worth using at all.\n\n\"These guns are super OP anyways\"\nFALSE. Statistically speaking, none of these weapons are even as good as the guns that have the same high repair costs (remember how they now have full repair costs of 6240? Well the OTHER guns in the game that have a full repair cost of 6240 are BETTER than these guns, and you can get them FOR FREE).\n\nDon't waste your money on this crap. with 60$ you could buy an actual triple A game that doesn't have greedy publishers, extreme lag, pay to win model, gambling with impossible chances of getting anything, or bad netcode.","timestamp_created":1526558367,"timestamp_updated":1549305270,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.615253031253814697","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw78ny3OgCeo/DoAE="}
