It looks good and plays well, no bugs or glitches, but the horribly high encounter rate is...well, horrible!  You cannot go five steps without yet another encounter, usually with the same creatures that you have fought for the last twenty encounters  If you like fighting and grinding you will like this game; if you want an RPG with more of a story line then you might want to look elsewhere,","timestamp_created":1549149736,"timestamp_updated":1549149736,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxKGh2OgCf5LuuQE="}
