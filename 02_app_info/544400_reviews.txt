Yet if you are in the mood for frantic fun in a small package, this game might just be what you’re looking for. With a title like “GUNGUNGUN,” be ready for a fusillade of fun as you shoot, dodge and rack up a bounty in this title.  \n\n\n\n[h1]STORY[/h1]\nThe Prologue is both a tutorial and the only real story bit you will ever receive in the game. The female protagonist (whom I’ve grown to call GIRLGIRLGIRL) decides to steal from a group of presumed bandits but is caught in the act. The bandits give chase as she scrambles aboard a nearby train to escape her pursuers. This is a just framing device to explain the enemies and level theming.\n\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nIn this game, its all about the guns and shooting. There are 8 different guns to collect and use, ranging from pistols to even a heavy-duty rifle. You start out with your default USP9 pistol and can carry any 1 other gun to fight back against the bandits. There are 4 enemy types to fight in this game:\n[list][*]Bandits who use pistols and shotguns to shoot at you\n[*]Knifers who charge in, swinging knives\n[*]Bombers who carry dangerous TNT payloads\n[*]Heavies who can soak up 2 or more entire magazines before dropping[/list]\nAlone, none are particularly dangerous. However, as an arcade arena shooter, you will have to constantly deal with numerous of these enemy types on screen at once. Each brings a unique threat and coming in groups makes them even more dangerous. The game is thrilling as you try to last as long as you can in a given stage.\n\nEach stage has a varying layout with several platforms/ levels to stand on. Each platform is solid so good positioning is a key as you cannot simply jump up or fall down/ through a platform. Enemies will either parachute in, jump onto the train from horseback or even just fall in from the sky. Each stage is made more engaging as platforms essentially become death traps once enough enemies start pouring onto it and surrounding you. Although holing up in a corner may be safe, can you kill enemies fast enough to keep it that way? \n \nThe game has some neat features as well to help make combat more fun. For example, you have an innate double jump to avoid projectiles or get to higher platforms. You can shoot enemy projectiles to destroy them and it only takes one shot to do so. You can crouch to avoid bullets, but I scarcely used it. \n\nBeing an arcade game, the only real objective is to see how high you can get your score. In that regard, once you play a few rounds you see everything the game has to offer unfortunately.\n\nLikewise, there are a few game design decisions that make gameplay a bit frustrating. Firstly, you cannot switch your default USP9 for any of the other handgun-type guns. It is mostly there as a reserve gun, but it is outclassed by every other gun in the game. I seldom used it outside of the first few seconds of a level or for the related achievements. \n\nReloading is manual only. However, I see this as more of an intentional choice for realism.\n\nNext, you pick up guns by simply walking over them. The headache is that you cannot CHOOSE when to pick up a weapon; you will automatically ditch your equipped gun if you make contact with a new one’s hitbox. This means that you may accidentally throw away a weapon you like because you had to relocate and run over a gun drop (which is very frequent occurrence). Compounding onto this, you must wait out each reload fully, even if you switch weapons mid-reload and the new magazine/ chamber is full. \n\nThe conditions for health pack spawns are also mysterious if not inconsistent. Sometimes I play a level and none spawn at all. Sometimes I get 2-3 within minutes of each other. In a game with limited hitpoints and infinite enemies, it honestly feels like RNG if I would survive longer than 5 minutes. Additionally, health packs despawn over time and are auto-consumed upon contact. Thus, getting a health pack is even more annoying as you can’t properly ration them out.       \n\nNevertheless, GUNGUNGUN is a game I can pick up at anytime and have fun due to the simple yet engaging gameplay loop. This is a game that definitely tests your skills and reflexes.\n\n\n\n[h1]VISUALS[/h1]\nOverall, I think the pixel art is pretty good. It is very abundantly clear who/ where your character is and what type of enemy is on screen. The train cars/ levels are believable and have realistic designs. Backgrounds seem to have received less attention but each is distinct from the others. The gun designs are excellently crafted and truly reflect their real-world counterparts. Bullets are distinct and you can see when one is coming at you. \n\nThere is even a hat store where you can trade in the gold coins you receive at the end of every mission. The hat economy seems unnecessarily grindy for the bottom row as they cost several hundreds of thousands of coins to purchase. To put this in perspective, you usually receive around a thousand gold per level assuming you perform well. \n\nMy biggest complaint is that there isn’t more full art of the characters which is very cute and expressive. \n\n I liked the snow stage the least because the yellow bullets are hard to distinguish against the pure-white background that is constantly scrolling by. \n\nThe game has an innate camera shake to it to simulate firing a real gun, but sometimes it is a bit too much and I start to feel dizzy/ nauseous after extended play. I wish there was an option to toggle it on/off or at least lessen it. \n\n\n\n[h1]AUDIO[/h1]\nThere are only a handful of 8/16-bit musical tracks to listen to, but they are all pretty good and have an energetic feel to them. However, they are all loops and a bit short. \n\nThe gunshot sounds are very well-crafted and I could feel the passion put behind them. They all sound distinct and satisfying to shoot. The other sound effects are also quite good. \n\n\n\n[h1]PERFORMANCE[/h1]\nThe game ran perfectly well for me. However, there isn't a dedicated pause button. Pressing Escape simply terminates the current session and brings you to the main menu without your post-round rewards. As an arcade game, I am split on this decision. \n\nKeys can't be rebound nor can you preview controller layouts. Discovering the controls is purely trial and error.\n\nSteam screenshots also seem to not work for some reason so I unfortunately can't share mine here.\n\n\n\n[h1]OVERALL[/h1]\nAs “a frantic bullet filled 2D arcade arena shooter,” I feel that the game definitely delivers what it is advertised as. Gameplay is very tense yet fun due to the endless hoard of enemies and colorful variety of guns at your disposal. I commend the developer for their vision to keep said guns accurate to their real-world counterparts. Nonetheless, there are some game design blemishes that impacted my overall enjoyment of the game. \n\nYet for a small game at a reasonable price, I can definitely say “give it a whirl” if arcade shooters are your thing. \n\n\n\n[h1][b]7.5/10\nWORTH A LOOK[/b][/h1]\n\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7871885/]Follow our curator page,[b] OCG-Curations[/b], if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/url][/quote]","timestamp_created":1607323939,"timestamp_updated":1607325360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.714058578014373779","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+NODnvYCfL71twI="}
