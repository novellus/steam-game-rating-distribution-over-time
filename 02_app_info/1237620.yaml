    about_the_game: Humans are long gone. Will your society of lumberpunk beavers
      do any better? Lead one of three unique races and see how long your population
      can last!<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Technology is what makes civilization,
      so use ingenious timber-tech for the good of your society. In Timberborn, every
      building and structure is made out of wood, which is the main resource... in
      addition to food, water, science points etc.<br></li><li>Construct a beaver
      settlement using modular, vertical architecture system. Here, space isn't infinite,
      so stack buildings on top of each other, map out future crops and set up a power
      grid for your growing population.<br></li><li>Build a prosperous city with efficient
      production chains and beaverish nighttime activities. Follow the lives of individually
      simulated inhabitants throughout their day and celebrate when Justin Beaver
      Junior is born!<br></li><li>Satisfy the needs of your population to unlock bonuses
      and new races. There's more to a beaver lifestyle than &quot;eat, sleep and
      chomp on wood&quot;! How about a ride on a merry-go-round after a long day of
      work? Some time with a book? Visit to a local temple, maybe?<br></li><li>Play
      on one of the included maps or create your own and share it with the community!
      With hills of different height, resource-rich forests, and twisting rivers that
      you will build dams on, each map can pose a different challenge.<br></li><li>Common
      Beavers enjoy a balanced lifestyle and are great for your first playthrough.
      Eager Beavers require little sleep but consume more food, which increases the
      challenge. And the Fancy Beavers? Refuse to decorate their settlement and they'll
      be gone in no time. By the way, they breed like rabbits.</li></ul><br>We regularly
      add new features and iterate, based on the community's feedback. Together, we'll
      create a dam good game, so stay in the loop and add Timberborn to your wishlist
      today!
