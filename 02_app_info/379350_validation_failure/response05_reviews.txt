However there are issues with this port along with issues that the PS1 port had. For one, this version doesn't allow 2 players which is silly because as some people have pointed out already, it prompts players to PRESS START for a second player. Secondly, although minor, the achievement for the shield powerups are currently broken making this game impossible to perfect game. I ended up powering shields all the way to 15 along with using the defence ring and it still didn't tick off the achievements.\n\nAs for the flaws it had with the PSX port, the game suffers frame freezes in certain points of the game like boss fights and rendering a ton of enemies. On top of that, the Classic/Original mode should definitely have a save feature or at least a password function. It's crazy to go through the entire game in one run.","timestamp_created":1531156007,"timestamp_updated":1534491298,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjeGzo+UCcMvUpQE="}
