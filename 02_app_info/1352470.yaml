    about_the_game: "The game is a rogue-like with 2-players co-op. Players have to\
      \ go through a procedurally generated dungeon fighting enemies on their way\
      \ and a boss at the end.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnemies have assorted abilities\
      \ that can vary and combine so that you have to invent peculiar tactics against\
      \ each of them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nApart from melee and ranged weapons, players\
      \ can use other ways to interact with enemies: they can be set on fire, slowed\
      \ down, receive weaknesses to certain attacks, etc. There are also traps and\
      \ obstacles that require the player's attention and reaction to be safely passed.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the process of exploration, players pick up weapons\
      \ and weapon upgrades, consumables and craft supplies. Craft system allows players\
      \ to create boosting supplies, ammo, traps for enemies, etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThere are blessings that alter certain stats and abilities. Wisely combining\
      \ them, you can receive additional effects. There are curses as well, that can\
      \ be cast by enemies, come as trap events or act as side effects of particular\
      \ items.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNB. Our hero is not a rabbit, as you may think,\
      \ but a hare. Please pay attention to this fact as it will play an important\
      \ part throughout the game."
