So far we are learning the rules and it looks fun to play.  \n\nOne minor thing I noticed while watching a youtube to help learn the rules is the \"Publicity\" points listed on the Tabletop Simulator DLC gameboard are from large to small instead of small to large as the actual gameboard or the board shown on page 10 of the rulebook.\n\nDLC gameboard:  Class A 21/15/10   Class B 15/10/7  ...and so on... Class F 2/1/0\nActual board Pg 10 rulebook:  Class A 2/1/0  Class B 4/2/1 ...and so on... Class F 21/15/10\n\nUPDATE:\nJust finished first game with son.  My son gives it two thumbs up.  It took us a couple hours but we were still figuring out the rules.  By the third round things moved faster.\n\nSince just the two of us were playing, my son easily saw I was increasing publicity of ribs and he lowered the points on his turn and built more ribs in his dino to counter me.  I think it would be more fun with more than two players.\n\nThe best part he enjoyed was the build phase.  One thing I'd like to see is a bigger hidden area to do the build.  By the third round the dinosaurs were hard to hide due to the number of bones.","timestamp_created":1505026785,"timestamp_updated":1505169577,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.704784393310546875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wqLGud4Ce4b7hAE="}
