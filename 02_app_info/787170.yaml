    about_the_game: Choices, The Game is a multiple choice, point and click, choose-your-own
      adventure game. The game has two lines of text at the top, one being the narrator
      and the bottom being what is happening in the scene you're in. At the bottom
      there's ten colored buttons with actions to choose from. Depending on your actions
      the story drastically changes. Between the text at the top and the ten buttons
      to choose from there's an image showing what's going on around you.
