This game seems pretty decently long, but about 4 1/2 hours in, I ran into a bug in the maze dream sequence where there seems to be no option to go forward, the darker colored arrow is in a spot that is inaccessable.\n\nI initially thought it was going to be some take on whale fall communities, but it's more of a RP of that. Anyways, it's mostly cinematiic. As for the english, while the translation is pretty good, it's still weird that the menu stuff wasn't translated.\n\nPlotwise, I had some trouble following it, but it's still pretty entertaining.","timestamp_created":1597100964,"timestamp_updated":1597100964,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1597187228,"developer_response":"I guess you meet difficulties in the second dream - crossing the river. The solution is like this: at the 'T' river mouth, press the 'UP' key, then Ellie can go out of the river and continue the story.\n\nI was going to set up some decryption elements here, but now it looks like I screwed up. But thank you very much for your playing."}],"cursor":"AoJwiteo7fMCfenYmgI="}
