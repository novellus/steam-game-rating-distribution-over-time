I hate refunding games and this one looked too mysterious from the description and the video. I wasn't sure what exactly the game was.\n\nSadly, the best way to describe this game is just lazy. There really is nothing to it. There's like 10 different scenes or so and they all play exactly the same. There's no story. No reason. Just slow motion, bullets flying everywhere, you teleport around, shoot baddies, try not to get hit. There's a generic western theme here, there's a generic office theme there. There's just no point to any of it.\n\nThis is simply a tech demo. Someone completely new to VR might enjoy this. I also experienced some graphical issues, where graphics seemed blurry or curved. Kind of a wobbly effect. \n\nRate 3/10. This should be a free to play game. Charging $9.99 is crazy. That store description you give borders on false advertising ... I'd love to play that game, but this game isn't that.","timestamp_created":1530592530,"timestamp_updated":1530592530,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.669881522655487061","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5ZGbr+QCf9yDpQE="}
