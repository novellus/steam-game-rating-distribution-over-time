It's mostly comprised of character sprite sheets and faces that could have come straight out of Game Character Hub (and many may have) and a handful of very short, simple scripts that do one specific and not particularly challenging thing, like picking random music when you start a level. There are no additional level design sprite sheets (the game itself comes with the standard RPG Maker VX Ace sheets that you already have) and only one tiny sprite sheet with 12 very generic looking items, such as a gun and a first aid kit. \n\nJust so you know, the game's music, which is NOT part of the Resource Toolkit DLC but does come with the game is  NOT included in the license that allows you to reuse the resources for your own projects. That's perfectly fair, but some people might assume otherwise. To the developer: selling the soundtrack under a similar license as the Resource Toolkit DLC might be a good source of additional revenue, assuming the author allows it (he/she will probably want a fair cut of the proceeds).\n\nSince the game is in early access, it may be that the Resource Toolkit DLC will also grow and improve over time and if it does, I will change my review. However, in the state that it's in now, I can't recommend it for any reason other than to encourage the developer or, like me, because you're curious and have hopes that it will grow to a reasonable size, comparable to the usual RPG Maker VX Ace DLCs.","timestamp_created":1433260142,"timestamp_updated":1435859069,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550714969635009766","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hNX3p84CdszGPQ=="}
