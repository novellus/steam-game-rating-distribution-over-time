I have m y brand new Xbox One S Controller all set up in steam and have tested and calibrated it just fine, and this game will just not accept trigger inputs for acceleration and braking. Control of the car and all other buttons work, and since there is no way to remap buttons in the game, it is 100% unplayable. I guess no one else has bought it to notice this? I will try my dual shock 4 controller and if that works I will come back and update the review. Right now, all this game has given me is headaches. First launch was an endless spinning circle.. I waited for 10 ,mins and nothing happened, i.e. it crashed. Now it launches and I can even control the menu perfectly with the controller but it just refuses to accelerate or break. Will be getting a refund if the DS4 doesn't work, ASAP.\n\nEDIT:\nThe Dualshock 4 behaves exactly the same way. The game simply can not accept inputs from the triggers it actually tells you to press LOL.\nI also tried running it in Win7 compatibility mode just in case. So there you have it. This game is completely unplayable with a controller in windows, therefore is completely and utterly useless.","timestamp_created":1589067166,"timestamp_updated":1589068560,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6L73/fECetjdhgI="}
