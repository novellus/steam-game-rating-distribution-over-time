    reviews: "\u201CThe game is a rich and varied Gestalt of top colony activity.\
      \ Strategies must be divined with care, and constantly modified to ride the\
      \ chaotic rapids of the thousands of interactive elements in this opus of creative\
      \ genius. Perhaps. Or it could just be a damn fine game.\u201D<br />\r\n95 \u2013\
      \ Amiga Format<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CColonization offers hours and hours\
      \ of entertainment. I played it for over a week to write this review and it\
      \ commanded my total concentration all the time to play it once through. Because\
      \ the game can be very different every time you play it, this means that Colonization\
      \ is the sort of game you could play for ever.\u201D<br />\r\n93 \u2013 Amiga\

      \ &quot;Do it by Wednesday night&quot;, they said. &quot;And bring us back some\
      \ chips&quot;. Colonization is a fairly simple idea in theory but, thankfully,\
      \ much more involved once you get going. Set sail in your little ship, bump\
      \ into a bit of land that rightfully belongs to someone else, then claim it\
      \ as your own. Ah, the American way...\u201D<br />\r\n91 \u2013 CU Amiga<br\

    review: I love this game (obviously)... still playing it after all these years.
      Don't let the graphics put you off - once you get the mechanics you're in for
      a strategic treat. The Civ4 version was not as good unfortunately.
