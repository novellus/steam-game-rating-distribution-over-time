    review: The laziest effort I have seen so far (and I actually got Klabi). I was
      expecting to have several puzzles with increasing size, but it seems there's
      only the one shown in the screenshots and it's not even hard. At least nothing
      happens when I solve it, and the screen only has Restart and close options.
      Refund requested.
