But, oh, the controls. The hardest thing about the game wasn't the puzzles at all--it was getting the dang camera to move when you wanted, or getting the characters to go where you wanted them to go. Moving around was painstaking. And THE ROCKS. Some puzzles involve meticulously moving rocks from point A to point B. Fine, if the rocks would stop dropping or spinning for no reason. The vast majority of puzzles simply involved getting characters to the right places. Even with the space \"fast forward,\" moving characters around was very. slow. The story is pretty insubstantial (arrive at place. get machine to work. go to new place). It's a shame, because this game has a cute concept, and the puzzles could be fun and challenging at times. However, my frustration at the bouncing camera and too-sensitive controls overpowered my enjoyment of the game.","timestamp_created":1606079081,"timestamp_updated":1606079081,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4or3x+PUCc4D6rwI="}
