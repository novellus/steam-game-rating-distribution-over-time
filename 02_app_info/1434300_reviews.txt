That said, I *have* finished the first world, so here are some early impressions:\n\nIt's fun! The mechanics aren't mind-blowing or anything but they're smart and well implemented. The puzzle design is pretty good from what I've seen so far, and strikes a good balance between teaching you new mechanics and challenging you to use them in head-scratching ways.\n\nI've not encountered any bugs or issues. It's pretty much what it says on the tin. I feel like it would be a really good fit for mobile, too. It's worth picking up if you're looking for a neat lil puzzle game.","timestamp_created":1604604624,"timestamp_updated":1604604624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.590651988983154297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyO/4zPUCctPDrAI="}
