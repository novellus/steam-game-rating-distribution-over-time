    about_the_game: <strong>CROSSNIQ+ (CROSS-neek plus)</strong> is a speed-focused,
      arcade-style puzzle game inspired by &quot;y2k-era&quot; visual design - a tribute
      to highly polished, small-scope Japanese games from the late 90's.<br><br>In
      CROSSNIQ+, the name of the game is re-arranging a grid of tiles to form <strong>&quot;crosses&quot;
      - rows and column of the same color.</strong> You can move tiles up, down, left
      or right - but moving them off the edge of the grid makes them wrap back to
      the other side, offering a unique and brain-bending challenge that's been compared
      to a mix between matching games and a color cube. Unlike other popular puzzle
      games, CROSSNIQ+ focuses on speed and technique rather than chains or combos
      - make crosses quickly and set up multi-crosses to earn bonuses.<br><br>In Endless
      mode, keep making crosses to keep your timer filled - let it hit empty, and
      your game is over. In Time Attack, your time is a set amount - earn as many
      points as you can before the buzzer sounds. Play against a friend in Versus,
      complete with items and special moves... or simply relax to a variety of different,
      aesthetically striking playfields in Chillout mode, where there's no score,
      timer, or game overs. No matter your playstyle, there's a mode in CROSSNIQ+
      for you!<br><br><strong>Let's Cross! Aim for THE TOP!</strong>

    review: 'the game is def worth $8, very addictive, very good at passing time (see:
      my playtime), and it''s fun climbing up the leaderboard! i bought this game
      for dv-i and she delivered and virix dreamcore had bangers in here as well

      the board aesthetic is so clean, and the ingame real-time clock is a cool small
      feature, wish more games did that


      had some minor problems:

      i really don''t like most of the gallery boards, they''re too bright and detailed
      and hard to distinguish colors, especially on bigger boards. the beach one is
      good tho

      also all the item/outfit dialogue isn''t repeatable so i have to clear my data
      when i want to reread those >.>

      also sometimes multiple rows and boards just randomly move when i''n trying
      to move one specific row, and sometimes moving a row is difficult'
