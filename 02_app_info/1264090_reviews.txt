There are two love interests. Zero was a sweet feeling and the second, Miel, had a good ending that made me feel a little uncomfortable.  It just didn't seem to be a relationship based on honesty although it was mostly the MC's fault for being stubborn enough to just go after the guy a bit randomly without all the info. MC is definitely impulsive.  the true ending of Miel's route was better, but also seemed a bit off regarding how much MC sacrificed only to abandon the cause at the last moment. \n\nThe voice acting was good, though a few lines were a bit wonky but nothing immersion breaking. I actually liked Miel's VA best, even if I didn't like his route as much as Zero's. Good  appropriate music and acceptable art.","timestamp_created":1608688102,"timestamp_updated":1608689467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ456fXxvYCfsGpvAI="}
