    review: "A walking simulator that unfortunately doesn't connect or resonate emotionally\
      \ at all.\n\nThe voice acting is good, and the characters within the story are\
      \ interesting, but I found it hard to get invested in the narrative and feel\
      \ what the game wanted me to feel. I believe this is due to a couple of reasons:\n\
      1. Game play, or lack thereof. I described the game above as a walking simulator,\
      \ but it is not that really. It is more of a clicking on items simulator. All\
      \ you do is click on an item in the scene, listen to some lines from one of\
      \ the characters, and then repeat. That is it. There  isn't much room for exploration\
      \ or anything really. Just look around, find what the game wants you to click\
      \ on, and then listen to one of the characters. This really kept me from getting\
      \ immersed in the world and made the whole experience feel more like a slideshow.\
      \ \n2. Art style. The whole game has this desaturated/sepia tone look that makes\
      \ it devoid of any colors at all. This makes all of the scenes in the game feel\
      \ the same, regardless of the action within the scenes of if they are present\
      \ day scenes or memories. Also all of the character models are low poly and\
      \ without any details (specially facial details) or expressions. Which again,\
      \ makes all of the scenes in the game feel the same."
