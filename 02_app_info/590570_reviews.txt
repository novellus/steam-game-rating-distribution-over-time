However, I had lots of troubles acually getting the game to function. First only the menu music would play, and then it closed itself whenever the main menu showed up. (I then asked for and recieved a refund.) I believe that the concept of this game has at least a little potential, if not more, but as it is now it has some troubling bugs that make the game unplayable.","timestamp_created":1491518596,"timestamp_updated":1491518596,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.453308850526809692","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuvTbotsCe8+adg=="}
