    review: 'On paper this is the genesis version with better graphics and sound,
      but one thing this doesn''t have over the genesis is a stable frame rate. The
      game chuggs the whole time. The worst thing about this is when you play as the
      ninja and using the pole to swing, when you are launching yourself and try to
      latch on to the next point, you can''t see the frame that would let you easily
      see if your going to hit it correctly, which doesn''t make it impossible, but
      just more difficult than it should be. While you are very young you can''t perceive
      that sort of thing, but if you are a person that is revisiting it later on you
      will notice it. Still good though. Fun gameplay, good sprite work, nice music.



      Now, on to the version this game was based on, the megadrive/genesis version.
      Obviously the graphics look worse, mainly from everything having strange lines
      and dithering.  All the strange stuff going on with the ingame art was actually
      very purposeful, if you played it through Coaxial/av on the real hardware, everything
      smooths out and actually looks very similar to the PC version. Sound is very
      bad though. Only one sampled sound effect can play at a time and they sound
      terrible. The FM style effects are better, but still a bit flimsy sounding.
      The pc version uses the exact same sound effects as the genesis version, so
      the sampled SE sounds way better, but the FM noises are still there. It seems
      like they reprogrammed some the noises to an FM synth that had more operators,
      they sound way better (read: more complex) than their equivalents on genesis.
      Still, most of the noises are 88kbps wav files, with a few being 176 kbps. You
      can freely swap sounds out which is cool. Aside from those things the games
      are the same between those versions.


      If the core gameplay you play here is enjoyable enough for you but the framerate
      is a dealbreaker, you might want to seek out the genesis version thats more
      consistent if you can deal the downgrades i discussed above. The genesis version
      was is only released in 50 hz format, but if you look online you can find that
      someone modified it to play at 60.


      EDIT

      Get the brazilian version instead, apparently that one is the most complete
      version for genesis and the euro one was rushed out and buggy.'
