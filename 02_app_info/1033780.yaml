    review: "Very good metroidvania with precision platformer mechanics. Great level\
      \ design with lots of different challenges. Levels feel very polished and tested.\n\
      Movement gets really good at mid game and you'll be able to move with sharp\
      \ precision.\n \nThere's a lot of ways to customise the game so you can make\
      \ it very easy or brutally hard.\n\nThe last part was tough, my hands hurt and\
      \ now I'm scared of trying the masochist mode (1 heart and 1 checkpoint). Took\
      \ me 6 hours to beat it the first time (with 2 hearts and 2 checkpoints) and\
      \ I died A LOT of times.\n\nI'm not into precision platformers but decided to\
      \ try the game for the exploration and abilities progression. I really enjoyed\
      \ it and hope there's a sequel."
