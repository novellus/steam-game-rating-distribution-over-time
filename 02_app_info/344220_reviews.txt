No exceptions. \nSecond - you need friends, controllers for each of them, preferably a coach and a big TV.\nThird - like Gang Beast, chaos is a significant element in this game. Much more fun with 8 players than 3 or 2.\n\nMany reviews diss this game for not suiting their need without justifying it's main audience is couch gaming.\n\nSo, here goes the actual review:\n\nGameplay mechanics are good and simple. The UI could use clearer explanations for sure, but everyone knows the control in a minute.\n\nMap / gamemode variety is just enough or at bare minimum, repetitive yes, but doesn't bother us.\n\nGame pacing is *very* good, where the balance between quick reflexes and tactics are strikingly neat.\n\nOne suggestion though - if winning and losing matters more and provide an incentive to players, this game would be fantastic for friends to get together and just casually battle each other. Something like a winnerâ€™s screen with summary of funny stats would suffice. \n\nAlready a very fun game consider the price, just need some more polish here and there.","timestamp_created":1514745904,"timestamp_updated":1549358490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwmcy93ugCe7+3lAE="}
