Couldn't even get through the tutorial. You place an elevator shaft, then it messes up and places a second elevator shaft right next to it. No problem, next step is to delete anyway. Tried to delete, but the game doesn't let me. Restart the tutorial, carefully placing only one shaft, now I can delete the one block I placed. A few steps further the tutorial ignores my zoom/pan/rotation attempts. Devolver put their name on this? \n\nImagine how at least two people must have playtested this and thought: \"Well, this is good enough, can't see any problems here!\" And then went to lunch, apparently.","timestamp_created":1593492173,"timestamp_updated":1593492173,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jJ7igfMCdv7DkQI="}
