    review: 'This DLC story isn''t really about Sirius but more as a way to wrap up
      the story arc started in the earlier DLCs and also give us a LITTLE fan service
      to see how a few folks are handling the aftermath of the main story. Mostly
      Purifier.


      So this is an ending to a story arc where I explicitly have told you the first
      two arcs are a complete waste of your money and time. And worse still, the ending
      is abrupt and rather unsatisfying. Not even specifically sequel bait, just...
      it ends with four lines of "Hooray we did it." and does not want to pay off
      on the setup like the Le Malin DLC did.


      I have to recommend it though as the story isn''t bad unlike the first two,
      but it''s also not something I can recommend you buy except if you actually
      did buy the first two and instead just want to get the whole set of DLCs.'
