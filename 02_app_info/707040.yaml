    developer_response: "Hi Gpd, \n\ndevelopment has not been abandoned at all, but\
      \ unfortunately the lack of updates and communication you can fully blame on\
      \ me.\n\nI have to change that now and honestly, thank you for waking me up.\
      \ I'll pinch me to make much more releases and communicate what is going on.\n\
      \nCurrently I'm at version 0.9.1, I'll upload a new version in the next couple\
      \ of days and will try to summarize what is the roadmap for the next weeks.\n\
      \nAlso, there is sometimes a \"silent\" beta-release when you switch to the\
      \ beta-channel in the games properties.\n\nStay safe"

    review: Okay, I guess, but at this point it really doesn't matter. After a couple
      of quick updates, its been abandoned for over a year. Still buggy, still not
      very polished.
