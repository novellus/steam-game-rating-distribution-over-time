    about_the_game: 'This game is my take on the block-placing puzzle genre. <strong>The
      pieces don''t rotate, but there is no gravity. Place them anywhere!</strong>
      Complete a line or a column and those block pieces disappear. Score bonus points
      for completing multiple lines at once, or for completing combo chains, or both.<br><br>You
      can choose to race against the clock, or take all of the time in the world.
      There are three modes to play: a <strong>Time Attack </strong>(a two minute
      challenge), <strong>Survival </strong>(where you score bonus time for completing
      lines), and <strong>Timeless </strong>(where there is no clock at all, and you
      have a set number of turns instead).<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1098250/extras/animatedgif1.gif?t=1562615971"
      /><br><br>There is a fourth mode, called <strong>The Quest</strong>, which is
      a preview of a story I need to tell. How Grid Magic is real, and how we are
      all players in a game, until we choose to break the rules and make our own.
      I wonder if this description will be read, or understood. I hope so.<br><br>Besides,
      what''s the point of being a technical witch if I can''t wield some magic with
      your game?<br><br>If you want to pretend that all of this is marketing text,
      that''s great. I''ve made a nifty puzzle game that I hope you will enjoy. Or
      maybe, just maybe, this game is the start of something a bit more important.<br><br>Join

    review: The Survival mode is addictive and replayable. I've owned this game for
      24 hours and already sunk more time into it than the last game that I bought
      for $30.
