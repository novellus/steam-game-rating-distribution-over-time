The instruments start to malfunction and soon after, break down. But the worst of it is when all engines are shut down, and both planes are descending rapidly towards the ground. Within a short period of time, both have crashed into the earth, killing all except 8 soldiers. Scattered around both crash sites, the survivors must regroup and find their way back home.  What are they going to encounter in this unknown territory? You’ll found out, in Broken Lines!\n\nBroken Lines is a turn-based strategy game developed by PortaPlay and published by Super(dot)com on the 25th of February 2020 on the Steam platform.\n\nWhat a really interesting and fun game Broken Lines is! As you might know, I am a very big fan of turn-based strategy games, especially those that have a close connection with World War II. Despite being set in an alternative World War II history, the British Army's uniform and most weapons of WWII are well reproduced in Broken Lines.  What really struck me from the start is that instead of having a certain number of movements/action points per character in each turn, you have to plan each of your soldier’s orders; when you are ready, you can see them being executed over a period of 8 seconds. I must say that I was a bit confused early on, but I quickly figured it out. Your goal per mission is to reach the white flag icon (which is generally on the opposite side of the map) as fast as you can, and of course to make sure you are not losing any of your soldiers.\n\nYour first mission will start close by the plane crash site, and you’ll be controlling only one character for a short time until you find a couple of other survivors. This mission is more or less a tutorial which you can switch on and off at your leisure, but I would recommend going through it. \n\nFrom then on, you’ll be introduced to the campfire screen which will appear at the end of each mission, or at the end of each day and before starting a new mission the next day. In this section of the game, some of the characters will interact with each other; the story will unfold and you’ll be asked to choose who you prefer to follow within the discussion. Your choice will impact the relationship between the two characters either positively or negatively, as well as the composure of the entire group. However, when the next day starts, you’ll see a map on the bottom left corner of the campfire screen. By clicking on that map, you’ll be able to choose your next mission from between two or three available to you. You can also choose to visit Izkor shop, buy new weapons and activate random events. These random events can be good, and you might receive additional supplies you need to feed your group of eight soldiers every day, but you might also get one of your soldiers severely injured in the process. In terms of the shop, you need salvage points to purchase new weapons or utilities (grenades, bandages, etc.). You’ll earn salvage points at the end of each mission, depending on whether you managed to finish the mission under the time limit, how many enemy soldiers you’ve killed, and a couple of other things.\n\nSo far, I’ve managed to survive 8 days, and more than half of my soldiers are on the brink of death! Each day is more challenging than the previous one, and that is playing on the medium level of four difficulties: easy, medium, hard and custom.\nRegarding your soldiers, there are only three types:  the soldiers with a shotgun (who are extremely deadly at short range), the rifleman/woman (who inflicts powerful damage from a distance) and the machine gunner (who can shoot several rounds of bullets into medium-range enemies, suppress them, and inflict serious damage). Each soldier will have a primary weapon, two utility slots for other items, and can add up to 3 abilities and traits! You can change all of these options at the campfire screen.\n\nMost levels I played were very well-designed, and in most of them, you can follow a couple of paths, which is good.  The combination of open spaces, buildings and places to hide is well balanced and offers the gamer several options on how to lay out your strategy and orders. As I mentioned previously, I really like the 8-second execution phases, or progressive gameplay. As you start each of the missions, the first 2 or 3 execution phases will usually not produce an encounter with enemies. Still, if one of your soldiers sights for the first time an enemy within the 8 seconds frame of the execution phase, the time will stop. You can re-evaluate each of your soldier’s orders, and you can change them for the remaining execution phase if you need to. Also, make sure to spot the rectangle wooden crates within each level, as they will provide you with additional supplies when opened! \n\nThe comic book style graphics are fabulous! The story is well-written and entertaining. I also like the feel of the unknown atmosphere that Broken Lines portrays. The game runs well, and it has been translated into 7 languages. On top of that, PortaPlay released a free DLC “The Dead and the Drunk” before Xmas 2020! \n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~ \n\n+\tFabulous graphics\n+\tGreat storyline, narration and atmosphere\n+\tGood tutorial\n+\tWell-designed levels\n+\t3 levels of difficulty and the possibility to customise your own level as well\n+\tFun and addictive gameplay\n+\tGood replayability\n+\tAchievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~ \n-\tNo trading cards as yet\n\nBroken Lines: Plan and give your soldiers orders and see them being executed in an 8-second frame at a time! With a few choice matters elements and a fabulous storyline, this game is a must have! \n\n9/10\n\nKey provided by the developer/publisher for review purposes.
