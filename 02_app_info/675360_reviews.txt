Bad grammar, lines repeating themselves, seems like no proofreading was done at all. I expected better...I was let down :(  Still haven't finished all the story lines because its near impossible to figure out where they stop and then continue on because its all a jumbled mess on the main story pages with no sorting by main characters, Gallery is total trash too not many pictures and not all the main love interests are featured. I started playing this game a long time ago, and keep stopping because its so hard to get through because its really bad (but I hate leaving a game with unfinished achievements). I've played alot of other VN's Published by Dongenzaka and enjoyed them. I just think this game needed to have a better team put on it or just trashed from the start.","timestamp_created":1582276857,"timestamp_updated":1582276857,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ypnDs/ACdvrQ8wE="}
