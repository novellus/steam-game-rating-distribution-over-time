    review: 'Review by maps 2.5/3 (explained).

      The first map is fun and different, but short.

      The second map is a timed map, I would prefer maps that aren''t like this but
      the way it''s set up, any little mistake will do you in, it can very easily
      be played to lose 50/50.

      The last map is fun though, very MOBA like.
