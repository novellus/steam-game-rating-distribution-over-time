    review: "[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]\n\n\
      I love music rhythm games in VR. Soundboxing, Air Tone, Audio Shield, Music\
      \ Box (free!), Beats Fever, Holodance, I like them all, and I probably missed\
      \ a few and I didn't even count Rockband VR or the drumming VR games. Beat Ninja\
      \ could be up there with the best of them. However, it has some serious issues\
      \ that make it just recommendable for VR music rhythm fans like me.\n\nThe core\
      \ gameplay is awesome and different from all the other music rhythm games. I'm\
      \ surprised nobody has stolen this formula and improved it. I would buy that\
      \ game in a second. When this game works, it is a lot of fun and quite the workout.\
      \ However, it doesn't always work, at least it doesn't work consistently enough.\
      \ You have to overlook various issues to enjoy this game.\n\nEven on medium\
      \ difficulty playing a local song from my PC that isn't really all that fast\
      \ (Lightning Crashes by Live), it seemed that the notes were going by really\
      \ fast, almost as fast as I could swing at times. And that's when the problems\
      \ start. You do have to align your sword correctly to get a swing to register.\
      \ But it seems that sometimes they just don't register. When it's slow it's\
      \ never a problem. But when one note is right next to another one, it seems\
      \ it's very inconsistent in registering.\n\nAnother big issue is YouTube integration.\
      \ It doesn't work at all. It says error downloading after you pick the song\
      \ and then nothing works. You have to quit the game and restart even to select\
      \ your own songs locally. \n\nI think that medium difficulty needs to be reworked\
      \ with faster songs to go easier on the person. I'm not even sure how anybody\
      \ could get hard difficulty. I coud barely finish 2 songs on medium difficulty\
      \ before starting to break down in sweat and my arms feeling tired.\n\nRate\
      \ 6/10. Buy on sale. I had fun, but I also had a lot of frustration. I hope\
      \ the dev polishes the game because it's a blast to play when it is working\
      \ as intended."
