    about_the_game: "Following the nationalisation of Britain\u2019s railway network,\
      \ which saw the \u201CBig Four\u201D merged into British Railways, the decision\
      \ was made to continue building many steam locomotives to a standardised design.\
      \ This approach would mean a variety of different locomotives, for various duties,\
      \ could share a common range of parts and operate in a similar manner, keeping\
      \ overall costs down.<br><br>Many of the standard locomotive features were based\
      \ on LMS designs, however, the 2-6-0 variant of the BR Standard Class 4 would\
      \ be designed at Doncaster, an ex-LNER Works. 25 were built in Doncaster, and\
      \ in fact the final one was the last steam locomotive to ever be built there;\
      \ an additional 90 locomotives were built between Horwich and Derby Works, bringing\
      \ the total up to 115.<br><br>The BR Standard Class 4 2-6-0 \u201CMogul\u201D\
      \ was built for freight duties first and foremost, however their mixed-traffic\
      \ capabilities would eventually see them on passenger trains as well. They would\
      \ be spread out across the country, allocated to depots in the Eastern, London\
      \ Midland, North Eastern, Scottish and Southern regions, making them a regular\
      \ sight for all workers, commuters and enthusiasts of the era.<br><br>Due to\
      \ their introduction in the sunset years of steam, the class never really got\
      \ a chance to prove itself; modernisation would run rampant in the 1960s and\
      \ many examples wouldn\u2019t even see a decade of service in before being withdrawn\
      \ in favour of diesels. Of the 115 locomotives produced, only 4 would eventually\
      \ survive into preservation.<br><br>While the roaring fires of the Standard\

      I actually wanted to give 9/10, but then I ended up giving 7/10. Why? Simply
      because it can''t even do 1:100 with 4 Mk 1 without rapidly losing speed.  But
      I still recommend it because it''s just fantastic!'
