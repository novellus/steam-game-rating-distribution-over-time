Manual Character creation. If people need to insert homebrew classes or abilities it turns into a mess.\n2. Icons of actions. I'm making a TON of homebrew monsters and copying bestiary's ones (Since you didn't release one). FG doesn't read icons like 1 action or reaction and it's awful.\n3. So we have an option of fast attack in combat tracker, right? WRONG. FG adds \"Melee\" text in front of attack line. That breaks the formula.\n\nBasically, that piece of adaptation is very raw and undertested. Fix things.\n\nUPDATE: I am very grateful for adding icons and fixing the fast attack bug. This is a good system now, released unbaked though. I have one problem still - multiattack on monsters isn't very easy. It would be good to have 3 variants of attack, like in character sheet.","timestamp_created":1584602984,"timestamp_updated":1596080264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtILzzvMCcryT+QE="}
