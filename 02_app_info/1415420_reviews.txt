I am glad to see it was nominated for the Labor of Love award, because it deserves it. The developers clearly put a lot of work into this game. New bosses, new items, updated visuals (at least it looked like it to me. I took a break for a long time playing, and came back to a cleaner looking game).\n\nThe new areas are sort of a mix of new levels and a spin on the older levels. The new enemies are great and actually generally feel more balanced than the base areas. While this makes me want to pick the new areas as their runs are easier, some of the bosses are more challenging. So it sort of depends on if you are feeling lucky.\n\nEven when me and my friends die and inevitably fail to beat the very very final boss on Nightmare difficulty because it is outrageously difficult and requires insane RNG (at least on multiplayer), we still have a lot of fun. A lot of crying and self-reflection as a result of our repeated defeat. But it is fun.\n\nThere are some suggestions I would like to add, or things that I was hoping they might do but did not: I get SOOOOO MANY souls from my inevitable wipe in the very final area, just to see them all flushed down the pooper. It would be nice if there was something you could do with them. For example a vendor, some kind of continuous talent system you could add them into, a buff system for the next run, etc. I have easily wasted a million souls haha. I also think it might help if they added another option for the second area as well, or incorporated occasional side rooms there. New character variations would also be a nice addition.\n\nOverall though, this is a very solid DLC, and if you enjoyed working hard and getting your ass smashed in the first game, you will enjoy it here too.","timestamp_created":1609872941,"timestamp_updated":1609872941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/PP56fYCd9PkwAI="}
