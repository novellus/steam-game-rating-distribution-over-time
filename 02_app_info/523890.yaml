    review: "[h1]Experienced on Windows Mixed Reality[/h1]\n\nYou can view my gameplay\
      \ & initial impressions review here: https://youtu.be/qV7ks_inAs0\n\nSo my first\
      \ impression of the game was not very good. I wasn't having fun and the game\
      \ just didn't look good in VR. The 3D graphics just didn't pop. Plus, on top\
      \ of that the motion controllers are used like laser pointers where you press\
      \ trigger as a one button controller. Finally, there wasn't a tutorial or explanation\
      \ for anything that you were doing.\n\nI switched to an Xbox One controller.\
      \ It was a combination of gaze-based navigation and one button controls. It\
      \ felt very odd at first, but seemed more seamless than the motion controllers.\
      \ I started going further into the levels and I was starting to have some fun.\
      \ The further I went, the trickier the levels got. New elements are introduced\
      \ which change up what you've been doing and the goal isn't always the same\
      \ in every level. \n\nI would get stuck on a level until I figured out some\
      \ of the mechanics. This game does a great job of making the difficulty so it\
      \ seems like something you should be able to get done with just a few tries.\
      \ It just takes a bit of practice. Perfect for that just one more try gameplay\
      \ archetype. I don't know exactly how to explain this game. You basically guide\
      \ this pod around and try to collect some stuff and break some other stuff and\
      \ also avoid some stuff in the least amount of time.\n\nThere are some pinball\
      \ mechanics thrown in. I'm not sure I would use the word breakout or Arkanoid\
      \ to describe this game, but you do break some stuff. There are many levels.\
      \ I think there are close to 50 if I'm not mistaken (several levels unlock once\
      \ you beat the earlier levels). \n\nAnyways, this is a simple arcade game that's\
      \ easy enough to get into, yet can also be very difficult and challenging ...\
      \ especially if you want to get the top score. Not many games use gaze-based\
      \ navigation in an innovative way or fun way, but this game seems to have nailed\
      \ that part down. \n\nMy main criticisms is the lack of a tutorial or even explanation\
      \ of the game mechanics (although they are easy enough to learn after some trial\
      \ and error). Also, the visuals just don't really pop in VR. I hope this game\
      \ gets a better 3D artist to remaster these levels. I think this game could\
      \ be as beautiful as it plays. For right now, it is fun to play but it's definitely\
      \ not eye candy at all.\n\n[b]Rating ?/10. I'm not giving a final score because\
      \ I haven't beaten the game, but I do recommend it. Also, don't get discouraged\
      \ by the start. It does get much better after the first few levels! I got this\
      \ on sale today for $4.49 USD and think it's a great deal at that price.[/b]"
