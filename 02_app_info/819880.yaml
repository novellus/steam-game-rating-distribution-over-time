    review: "This plays much like Audioshield. It is in a very early state but has\
      \ potential I feel. I'm going to give it a thumbs up because it could develop\
      \ into something very good with a few tweaks.\nThey need to rotate the shield\
      \ relative to the controller so it is like holding an actual shield. Right now\
      \ it is 90 degrees off.\nIt needs haptics. There is no controller reaction to\
      \ hitting a ball. That is just unsettling.\nSeems to play music from YouTube\
      \ only right now. I think playing local files should be a given.\nNeeds more\
      \ environments and more levels. I'm a pretty experienced Audioshield player\
      \ and it was strangely hard to play which is weird. \nThe price is certainly\
      \ fair for the current version. Hopefully they will continue to develop it into\
      \ a good Audioshield competitor."
