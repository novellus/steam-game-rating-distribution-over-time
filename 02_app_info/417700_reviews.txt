Matthew McConaughey and Emile Hirsch give especially great performances as to be expected. Frankly, all of the acting is great.\n\nMy one issue is that some of the story lacks any real depth. I would have enjoyed some deeper insight into the characters - some issues are glossed over quickly and therefore character development suffers. But even with this issue, I think the final product does a great job of creating an intentionally unsettling story.\n\nAlso purchased on sale for 3.00 dollars. A steal, all things considering.","timestamp_created":1509978336,"timestamp_updated":1509978336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsJ3uyN8Cf9zHigE="}
