    review: 'I love a Rougelike/lite and for me VILE captures the the Genre pretty
      well.


      PRO''S


      I like the 8 bit art style.

      The control feel pretty good.

      The game overall gets a big thumbs up from me.

      The boss fights get gradually more and more intense such as fighting on the
      corpse of a boss you just killed down a fast moving river or on the back of
      a stage coach.

      I like the variety of characters and the characters that you can unlock.


      CON''S


      There''s a lack of map which is kind of annoying though not overly so as the
      levels aren''t very big.

      The weapon variety while cool lacks some what as a good chunk of them feel under
      powered and practically useless and the same with the spells/items.

      Also while on weapons, the ranges of them is very short which is annoying some
      times especially when the enemies can out range you.

      Oh and when you finish/beat a level don''t immediately go for the chest as you
      can accidentally go through the end of level portal missing out on picking up
      all the souls and the weapon and also the health/mana.

      Can this be fixed please as it''s happened to me a fair few times now.




      Overall I''m really enjoying VILE.

      Definitely worth a buy if you like Rougelikes/lites.'
