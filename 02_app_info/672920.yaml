      /><br>The Bounty is a 4th wall breaking adventure which blends gameplay styles
      from traditional JRPGs, Roguelikes, and puzzle games, while adding a deep score
      system to drive the experience further. Players explore top-down levels full
      of monsters, hazards, secrets, and treasures. Battles are kept simple with an
      ebb and flow resembling the traditional style of Dragon Quest. Your character's
      attributes level up the way you choose; coupled with balanced gear options,
      you get an equally challenging, balanced experience while playing your character
      your way.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/672920/extras/story.png?t=1603997408"
      /><br>In the Story Mode, the player selects their difficulty level, names their
      character (including secret avatars via codes), and begins their journey through
      a concise adventure across four episodes. Some levels, treasures, riddles, and
      monsters are shuffled in each playthrough. This adds variety while retaining
      the experience of learning the game and maps.<br><br>In Casual Mode, the score
      system is disabled, and the player gains the ability to save freely, including
      an autosave feature. This mode lets the player enjoy the game at their own pace,
      and practice to score higher in Competitive Mode.<br>Competitive Mode is the
      more difficult primary game mode, with each monster, puzzle, treasure, and secret
      awarding points. With hundreds of scenarios, secrets, and bonuses, players have
      a virtually endless challenge awaiting them to get the highest score. Furthermore,
      completing the game opens Endless Dungeon +, allowing the player to play in
      the Endless Dungeon with their existing character, pushing their score to never-ending
      heights.<br><br>New to V2 is Adventure Mode.<br><br>In Adventure Mode, you find
      yourself *playtesting* a new and incomplete nonlinear game mode. Tasked with
      piecing together the Blade of Legends so you can enter the castle and defeat
      the final boss. This blade can also be powered up by finding the seven Legendary
      Orbs hidden within the dungeons- but these are completely optional. Will you
      rush the castle as quickly as you can, or take your time finding the orbs and
      boosting your score as high as you can?<br><br>This pushes the envelope a bit
      more on the 4th wall breaking side; with some pretty big surprises. There are
      bound to be a few laughs, but you'll have to wait to play it yourself!<br><br><br><img

      /><br>The Endless Dungeon is also selectable as a separate mode. In this mode,
      players begin with a full loadout of gear and journey through a never-ending,
      always-changing dungeon. This is the perfect mode to play when you want to get
      in a quick game but you're short on time! <br>Also features Endless Dungeon
      +, which when playing on Competitive Mode, allows you to enter an endless dungeon
      after completing the main game, giving endless challenges and opportunities
      to blast your scores into the stratosphere.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/672920/extras/features.png?t=1603997408"

    review: The Bounty has to be one of the most unique games I've ever played. Myself
      coming from Nex Machina and Pacman 256. I needed another high scoring nostalgia
      type of game. And this is where the Bounty comes in. This is not your ordinary
      RPG game. It's a high scoring RPG. A humorous one at that. This is described
      as a Dragon Quest type of game. Which could be true but I've never played those.
      But this game reminds me of nes classics like Zelda, Final Fantasy and Uncle
      fester's quest(music wise). The music is really good in this game. Really captures
      the feel of the 8 bit era. The game is not super hard but challenging enough.
      The puzzles really challenge your common sense. I can even use a Dog whistle
      to signal a partner for my battle. Overall. It's a fun game. I recommend playing
      this especially for $4.99. It's really worth it.
