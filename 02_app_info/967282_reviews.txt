I just bought this and all the items required to run it, and I love them all. This route is really well done, love the scenery, although if your a fast runner this is NOT for you. The speed limit is 40 MPH, but with a heavy train, you'll be lucky to get 25. Right length, adequate yard facility's on either end, an overall just done amazingly. Scenarios are entertaining as well. Recommend to anyone wanting the 1860s/70s,, or for a nice route to run. also, for those of you who don't think there are enough engines, go to Railworks America and you can get repaints for more road numbers.","timestamp_created":1609813660,"timestamp_updated":1609813660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwluKX6PYCc4PKwAI="}
