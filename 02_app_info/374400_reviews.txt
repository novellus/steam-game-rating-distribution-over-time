Elite has so many things to do in game and some of it can be really easily automated. After 2 years of using this software I am done with it. Understand, even though it says I have used it for 14 hours, it is more like 1,700 hours, the same amount I have played Elite.\n\nSo I just spent about 2 hours trying to get this software to do 2 actions at the same time but on different timers. I tried to do it in one macro, I tried to do it in 2 macros that activated by a third. Nothing worked. \n\nI have also occasionally had problems where it would not recognize a command no matter how I said it. I don't know if it is the software or Microsoft's windows speech recognition but it is frustrating when you are trying to stop your ship from being destroyed and it won't do the command you have tried 10 times in every way you can. Even worse is having to contort your mouth towards your headset mic to see if it will recognize it better by speaking like a former Canadian Prime Minister.\n\nIn less than 1/2 an hour I just did what I wanted to do in Voice Attack Demo. This says to me that either, the interface, functionality and capabilities are severely lacking or the publishers ability to fund the creation of those features has ended. I really don't want to spend the money on yet another voice recognition software but honestly, I would rather do that than be continually frustrated.\n\nI was hoping that the \"community\" would have answers to my problems, but it seems that I have been the only one \"developing\" a profile for elite. All the others either are really basic or have borrowed my commands. Additionally I know a profile that is already prebuilt with a lot of the functions for Elite already figured out. I really wish in this instance that I had gone with the crowd a long time ago.\n\nFor anyone thinking of buying this software, don't, go with voice attack.","timestamp_created":1609319323,"timestamp_updated":1609352087,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544235885143280029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43YC32vYCf6fcvgI="}
