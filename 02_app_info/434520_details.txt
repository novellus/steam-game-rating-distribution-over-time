Paksets have a number (64, 128, 192) which stands for the tile size in pixels. The more pixels per tile, the more detailed the graphics are. There is a pakset for every player, as each pakset offers a different play style, theme and level of difficulty. Here is a short description of every pakset available as DLC:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Pak64<\/strong>: Pak64 was the first Pak for Simutrans. It is deliberately kept compact.

Simutrans can have buses, trucks, trains, trams, ships, airplanes, monorails, maglevs and any other vehicle that goes through air, land or water.

They actually have individual destinations: people want to check out attractions, go shopping, or visit friends. Products also have their destinations - factories have contracts with each other and they won't sell or buy from anyone else. If you don't give them the possibility to go where they want, they simply won't use your transport company.<br><\/li><li><strong>Complete the Chain<\/strong><br>Transporting products not only gives you money, but makes the economy roll. As you transport products between factories, they start producing and selling. Every factory receiving the materials it needs starts producing new goods letting you connect more and more factories across the region.<br><\/li><li><strong>Influencing Cities<\/strong><br>Your transportation affects city growth. Every unit of anything you transport will affect the nearby cities making them grow and prosper. Sometimes cities will create new attractions and places of interest, which attract a lot more passengers. Or maybe your service may attract new industries, that give you even more opportunities. But not everything you do leads to good things - as cities grow more cars are on the roads, and you will end up trying to deal with the traffic.
