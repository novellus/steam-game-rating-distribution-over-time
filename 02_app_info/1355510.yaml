      /><br><br><strong>Rogue Summoner</strong> is a turn-based tactics roguelike
      about conjuring creatures to fight for you. It's a game about mastering different
      monster behaviors and using them creatively in combat.<br><br>You will dive
      deep into different types of procedurally-generated dungeons, each with its
      unique difficulty, size and creatures. Death in each one means starting over
      from the very beginning of the dungeon, with no upgrades nor monsters in your
      loadout. But with death comes understanding and hidden knowledge of the dungeons'
      secrets.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1355510/extras/01.gif?t=1599569911"
      /><br><br>As you master each unique creature, you will be able to optimize your
      strategy by exploiting their weaknesses when fighting against them, and leveraging
      their strengths when summoning them. Every creature you defeat can be added
      to your loadout, from a half-witted spider to the great Morthgaal.<br><br><img

    review: A Rogue with the soul of a puzzle game.  Rogue Summoner is a clever easy
      to pick up, hard to master indie game that reminds me of Into the Breach with
      its deterministic approach to combat.  You know exactly how the enemy will behave
      and its up to you to figure out how to best use that to your advantage.  A very
      clever presentation of interesting mechanics.
