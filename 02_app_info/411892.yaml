    about_the_game: The M-2000C is a multi-role, French-designed, 4th generation fighter.
      It was designed in the 1970s as a lightweight fighter and in excess of 600 M-2000C
      aircraft have been built. The M-2000C is a single-engine fighter with a low-set
      delta wing with no horizontal tail. It has excellent manoeuvrability given its
      relaxed stability and fly-by-wire flight control system. The M-2000C also includes
      a multi-mode RDI radar that is capable of tracking and engaging targets at beyond
      visual ranges. In addition to engaging other aircraft with cannon and missiles,
      the M-2000C can also engage ground targets with cannon, rockets and bombs. The
      M-2000C is a perfect fit for the battlefields of DCS World!<br><br>We now bring
      an exacting simulation of the M-2000C to DCS World. The M-2000C is highly optimized
      to work within DCS World and takes advantage of the Digital Combat environment
      that only Eagle Dynamics can offer.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features:</h2><ul

    review: my one issue with this module is that it is in the imperial system why
      is this?? i have no clue but i find it infuriating as i am used to the metric
      system in telling speed and distance. while  i love flying this i still find
      it a bit annoying.
