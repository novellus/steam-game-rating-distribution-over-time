I liked the variety of puzzles, helpfulness of the power-ups, and the easy viewing of the color palette. However, I struggled with the sound effects, remembering the power-up effects, and the possibility of multiple solutions to puzzles. I did not experience it myself, but other users have reported crashes with certain software drivers. I recommend Sudoku Quest to players looking for a simple endless Sudoku game that are willing to forgive it the multiple solutions and do a little investigation into software compatibility.","timestamp_created":1592005692,"timestamp_updated":1592005692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpuG71fICcrfYjQI="}
