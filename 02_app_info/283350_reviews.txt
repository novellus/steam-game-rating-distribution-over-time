I highly recommend getting steam to create the shortcut on your desktop!\n\nA lot of users are asking for the manual so I have uploaded these to my google drive (including a strategy guide). You can find them here:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1w7Tm1SmIHvZ1ZqUXJHVkxNdTA?usp=sharing\n\nIt's a great game. Very complex. The model aircraft and how it handles are stunning, and the sounds in game are excellent for when this game was initially developed. I love the external camera view and you can defiantly hear the doppler effect. I love how you can watch your enemies die by following your missiles to their target. You can provide commands to your wing man and assign them a target whilst you concentrate on another. You can even communicate with the air bases located around the map.\n\nEasy to configure your plane for each mission. Dog fights are really good fun, though hard in places. I highly recommend viewing the manual and strategy guide included in the above link. They will help considerably as the tutorial via the peace game mode doesn't have details on how to fly the aircraft, let alone how to operate it's complex systems on board. Another useful tip, use the autopilot, it is there for a reason!\n\nOverall, a great game for its time. Even now I still enjoy this. Highly recommended; especially if you haven't played this before. I can see myself playing a lot of hours on this again (regardless of what steam says as the game won't run via steam play button, it will only run via the shortcut).","timestamp_created":1484585455,"timestamp_updated":1593850303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.718633294105529785","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4obK4jPMCdaLibw=="}
