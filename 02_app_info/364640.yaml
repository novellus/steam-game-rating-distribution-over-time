    review: This could've been a neat twist on solitaire/freecell but instead is just
      a buggy, unplayable mess.  You're frequently stuck with a stack of cards selected
      that you can't drop anywhere, which forces you to restart your hand.  Cards
      that you should be able to move can't be moved...but then later can for no good
      reason.  It's not worth the frustration.
