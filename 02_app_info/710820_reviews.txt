Minuscule objects are essential to your progression.\n- (of course, no hot spots key.)\n- Timed pixel hunting. Some minuscule objects are only there intermittently. Yep, keep your eyes more peeled than that.\n- Also, you'll need to time your grabs. Devs got confused with the point n' clock genre.\n- More scene transitions, back and forth, than humanly tolerable.\n- (of course, no fast movement key.)\n- Many mandatory day/night changes, all triggered from a unique location, and not a central one.\n- (of course, with unskippable wait.)\n- Expected actions are commonly nonsensical.\n\nSimply put, you'll spend 72% of your game time waiting for your character instead of actually playing. One particularly terrible \"puzzle\" requires you to perform the exact same action 3 times, but on different nights. In effect, a basic repeat but slowly moving back and forth between 3 scenes and waiting 6 times for a sleeping transition. My jaw still hurts from the yawning.\n\nIt's not the worse Pn'C around. It even has a quality, an unusual one: its music. That's hardly a selling point though.","timestamp_created":1604779155,"timestamp_updated":1604779155,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520833313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1606862880,"developer_response":"Hi Corbo,\n\nthank you very much for complimenting our music :-) \n\nalso thanks for your detailed (yet negative) review.\n\nHaving you spent some time in pondering it, we feel we owe you some explanations:\n\n- we were careful not to put in scene 'minuscule' objects. However we based our perception on PCs, the natural environment for our game. it is possible that other devices vehicle other kind of feelings \n- we choose not to put hot spots because we wanted to reproduce the immersion feeling of old and classic adventure games without rushing the user past simplified enigmas, with the only exception of timed ones.\n- there are only a couple of timed enigmas. Again, being the reference classic pnc's this is part of the allowed rule set. Please see King Quest 5 or Monkey Island.\n- If you click quickly the character accelerate. We didn't want to put on teleportation not to ruin the immersion feeling. This is in common with the vast majority of pnc's games out there, even today. Again: because of our reference no skippable waits are there.\n- all the enigmas have been carefully crafted with an underlying logic. As players we really hate when an action doesn't come from a logic deduction and our main effort has been dedicated to avoid this. If you feel this happened I encourage you to give some specifics so to give us a chance to explain.\n\nWe are sorry you didn't like the repeating actions needed for one of our puzzles, but the point of that is exactly what you say: the same action has different consequences that need to be foreseen in advance.\n\nOverall we are very sorry you didn't like our game. \"Belpaese Homecoming\" came by the effort of a team of three people wishing to evoke the feelings of the old times adventure games. Our main motive was never to write an easy game as that is often orthogonal to make an interesting one. Please trust us on the logic driving our plot. If you feel like giving to our game a second chance, we will be very grateful. If you don't, thanks anyway for having given to our game such a deep consideration. \n\n"}],"cursor":"AoJ449OS0vUCd+79rAI="}
