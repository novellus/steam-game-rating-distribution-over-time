Nice chilled out experience with some fantastic mechanics such as; \n\nauto buy and trade \nconvoys - for protection and cargo increase \nreputation system in the form of various ranks to be achieved\nability to become lord mayor and improve towns\nchance to open trading offices in other ports to further improve trade possibilities\nexpeditions to far away lands - will you find trade, new lands or certain death!\nbecome a pirate! \nhunt pirates!\n\nI struggled to get it to run for 20 mins or so when I initially got it, however I'm running a 1080p patch and win 7 compatibility (could try win xp too if in doubt) and launched it via exe in game files folder now it launches perfectly and runs just swell, aside from random unexpected frame drop when a large siege happens for some odd reason but it's nothing much to complain about\n\nsolid 9/10 \n\nONLY BUY  if you're not going to miss the 'thrill' of fast paced action games, this is a sit down and plan your routes and course of action game, and I highly recommend it","timestamp_created":1609782692,"timestamp_updated":1609782692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwitGh5/YCf826wAI="}
