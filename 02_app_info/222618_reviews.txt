I got it on sale today at $10, making this purchase even better. There are a lot of scenarios to choose from, and while I don't have my scenery settings very high, the scenery is definitely pretty even on low game settings. It doesn't run too bad either, sometimes I get frame drops here and there, especially with the Class 801, but other than that, I don't think it impacts your FPS too much unless you are in a big train station. I definitely see me playing more of this in the future and maybe even for years to come, and I strongly recommend this route if you want to have some fun.","timestamp_created":1606527433,"timestamp_updated":1606527433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kuefhvYCf+eKtAI="}
