The gorgeous UI, sound and topography design is also so satisfying to navigate.\n\nThe soundtrack is up there in my top 10 game OST's as well, pure ambient bliss that captures the feeling of the vast unknown depths with a splash of the melancholy and wonder thrown in for good measure.\n\nWell worth checking out if you dig story driven indie games that do things a little differently.","timestamp_created":1609936059,"timestamp_updated":1609953010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.645586192607879639","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlayr7PYCdJr+wAI="}
