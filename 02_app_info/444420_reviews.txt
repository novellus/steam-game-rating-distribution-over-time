What is the most important part of it?\nHopelessness, danger, survival, postapocalypsis. Steam has a lot of really good projects with not necessary 3d graphicts.\nThis is not one of them. Zombies spawns without any logic, shots energyballs... Well, i said it.\nNot recomended to anyone.","timestamp_created":1564342129,"timestamp_updated":1564729766,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh67KqOwCf8+nzwE="}
