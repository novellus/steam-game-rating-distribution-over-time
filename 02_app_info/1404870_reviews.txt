It feels a bit janky doing it with the keyboard but it's alot better with a controller. \n\nGame is hard as fuck on survival. A bit of impossible game vibes there but there are also a campaign where you can get a better feels for the controls before doing survival.","timestamp_created":1606930905,"timestamp_updated":1607002853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1606964561,"developer_response":"Thanks for the feedback!
