    review: 'Update Post (11/12/2017)

      Bugs still preset.

      Got to a higher level zone than normal, quit for the night, log back in to have
      0.0 Gold and to have gotten "0.0 Gold while away"  to make matters worse - no
      gold pick up would work, having to forcefully use the rebirth system to get
      any gold at all.


      No fixes in nearly a yaer?  Unprofessional.  Would be a fun, hard, clicker game
      if not for all the bugs that literally break the game progress and force restarting
      before ready, and reward so little your power never feels like it''s going up.


      Still do not reccomend the game, still has original problems and more. Doesn''t
      look like the company knows what it is doing. Avoiding "Fox Dawn" now, another
      junk Dev/Publisher that is trying to make a quick buck without finishing the
      games they start.




      // Original Post//

      Too many problems to enjoy.

      Balance issue is terrible.

      Away bug not giving/displaying proper gold (forcing to keep playing if you want
      to advance at all)

      Giant Brick wall that can only be avoided if you go to zone 3, ascend, repeatedly
      and use the "free stars" to boost your world STR/Crit so you can do more DPS.
      (very boring process too)  By repeatedly I mean over 100x as each time only
      seems to give 5 stars.


      DPS doesn''t increase past level 150.  Known bug- no fix.

      Skills not working at all - or shutting off early - or not working properly
      in general.  Skill use is also extremely clunky - as you go to another tab/menu,
      scroll down to use it, and if you return to the buy heroes it''s at the top
      again too - very cumbersome to always start at top of scroll lists instead of
      "where you left off"


      This game should NOT have been released as/is - it is a ALPHA game as it is,
      and should be addressed properly. (Alpha means there are core problems being
      worked out or added to it that will shape the entire game, like adding Jumping
      to a platform game)


      Fox Dawn needs to re-think how to balance things for the Gold required to level
      up the heroes VS the damage they dish out - relying too heavily on RNG Equipment
      drops is poor game mechanics.
