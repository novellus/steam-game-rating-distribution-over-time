      is to build a mysterious multicoloured substance known as <strong>tricone</strong>.
      To crack each level, you'll need to figure out the right sequence of interactions
      to bring each coloured piece together, changing the cell structure by breaking
      open walls or creating new divisions. You'll need to unlock resources then use
      catalysts to create the compounds you need. As you progress, new and unusual
      elements emerge and combine together inside shifting cell structures to challenge

    review: "A challenging logic puzzle game. There are 5 levels of difficulty and\
      \ the level is indicated for each puzzle. New bio-logic mechanics are introduced\
      \ as you progress. \n\nEven though there is not much current activity in the\
      \ discussion forum, Josh, the developer, still monitors it and has recently\
      \ provided me with a hint at solving a puzzle I was having particular difficulties\
      \ with. His hints are...cryptic...but then, you don't want the answers handed\
      \ to you on a plate, do you?\n\nAs another reviewer noted, a \"gem\" of a game."
