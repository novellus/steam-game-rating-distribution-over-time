      notes: "This game is NOT suitable for children.\r\n\r\nBillion Beat features\
        \ cartoon violence with blood, black eyes, and knocked-out teeth. It also\
        \ has some drug and alcohol use as well as foul language and some non-sexual\
        \ (alien) nudity. The final boss depicts a large alien penis-man that can\
        \ ejaculate on the player."

    review: "Billion Beat is great. The visuals and music are on point. The gameplay\
      \ follows the Punch-Out formula perfectly: time your punches and dodge or counter\
      \ theirs. If you make a mistake, your character will take a bit to recover and\
      \ that is more than enough time for your opponent to mess you up, so learn from\
      \ coach Baby T and DON'T JUST MASH THE BUTTONS!\n\nThere's also a bunch of stuff\
      \ to keep things fresh like \"hype moves\", items and even progression. Successfully\
      \ landing a hype move rewards you with a bit of energy and you need that energy\
      \ to dish out the heavy punishment, so you quickly start to get into this flow\
      \ of dodging, countering and landing hype moves until you can finally let your\
      \ hands fly. \nIf you lose your focus it's easy to get overwhelmed and lose\
      \ a lot of health, but you can get some back by popping up some DRANX bottles\
      \ during the fight (that's considered a b*tch move, though).\n\n\nAll in all,\
      \ I'm happy with my purchase. It looked cool in the trailers, and it is cool\
      \ when you play it. Also, it's on early access, so it'll probably get even better.\n\
      \ \nPlay this if you want to knock out an ugly alien with a slap."
