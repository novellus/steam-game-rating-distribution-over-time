    about_the_game: This game is great for developing your mindfulness skills. Here
      you have to take a good look at the pictures offered to you and find out how
      they differ among themselves. Whether you are an adult or a child - this may
      not be so easy at all, some differences are very difficult to locate for the
      first time. In this part of the game you have to go straight to the gym.<h2
