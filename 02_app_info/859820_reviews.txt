Despite the simple controls, the game has managed to offer gradually more involved challenges. The game feels familiar due to its controls being similar to rhythm games, and yet manages to feel fresh since its mechanics and the timing are related to the level design, rather than music design.\nSpeaking of music, the music for this game is intoxicating and helps you get in the zone.\nAll the bosses I've encountered so far feel unique and interesting in their own way.\nWhile the graphics might not be top of the line, they serve the desired purpose and if you're used to old-school games, you will quickly forget about them.\n\nConsidering the price, I would definitely recommend buying this game and pop in to spend a few hours on it, it should definitely keep you entertained.","timestamp_created":1572386050,"timestamp_updated":1572386050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/eHgjO4CeZGa1QE="}
