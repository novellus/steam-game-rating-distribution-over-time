I built a wall (of towers), but I couldn't make the zombies pay for it.\n\nI'm playing my first game while writing this (from about level 30 to 96).\n\nPros: It's got a Tower defense version of They are Billions kind of feel.... but more casual.\nIt's kind of simple to play.\nFun kind of quirky game to play for a night when you get it on discount.\n6 Levels of upgrades for towers and mines.\n20x speed play!!!\nWorth getting.\n\nCons: I've been waiting for it to end since Day 20ish. There's not a lot more to do. Everything's maxxed out and things are getting horribly expensive.\nTwo of the upgrades doesn't seem to be accessible.\nThere are little annoying bugs. Nothing too serious though.\nThe user interface is horrible. Clunky would be an understatement. The 90's called and want their UI back.\nIt seems that there's only 1 level.\nDoesn't seem well balanced yet.\nArmor can drop where your player can't get.\nKind of annoying that \"go fast mode\" doesn't pick up again in the next day.\nYou spend too much time clicking to sell gear. (Sell/Delete all button would be nice)\nCPU usage is nuts high for a game like this. I'd expect to be able to run it on a toaster, or at least a fridge.\nNeeds more Crystal mines.... and towers... and/or things to do with resources. Maybe more upgrade paths. More variety.\nSome design choices need rethinking... eg. tech to reduce enemies health by 100%.\n\nI get that it looks like I'm taking a dump on the game. I'm really not. I love tower defense games. Despite all the downsides, it felt like it was a good start to a fun game. It felt like the developer tried to do something a little different. I'd like to see the developer continue to work on the game and see what comes of it and/or comes up with their next game.","timestamp_created":1604493361,"timestamp_updated":1604493361,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49rfQyfUCcdSerAI="}
