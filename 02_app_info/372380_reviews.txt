Plus, who knows how long this game has been abandoned for...?\n\nPicked it up for less than a dollar years ago, only reviewing it now before I file it away in a collection titled \"GAMES TO NEVER PLAY AGAIN\" and hide it from my library.\n\nGood things about this game? You can probably pick it up for less than a dollar every so often. And... it runs? Sort of?\n\nBad things about this game...\n\nWell, play it and you'll see. It's not worth even what I paid for it, and you're better off playing \"Open World Game:  The Open World Game\" -- those who've played that title will have experienced more content than is included in this game. Warriors & Castles has less to offer than most pre-alpha titles I've played.\n\nBut if you really want to experience this... game? Yeah, game. Buy it, play it for fifteen minutes, then order a refund.","timestamp_created":1585124324,"timestamp_updated":1585124324,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523004055023193359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwqraxiPECcfPw+gE="}
