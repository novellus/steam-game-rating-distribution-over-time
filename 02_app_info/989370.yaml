    review: "I'm afraid that as much as I would like to, I cannot give this game a\
      \ good review. The first problem was the language. The English felt like an\
      \ incomplete translation and was riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes\
      \ as well as occasionally being outright nonsense in various places. What few\
      \ in character directions were given were vague, and most of the time there\
      \ was no indication of what to do, where to go, or how to proceed.\n\nI found\
      \ myself trapped several times due to an inability to perceive a boundary I\
      \ was able to cross (mostly in the snow of the mountain top). And no less than\
      \ seven times found myself entirely unable to proceed due to glitches in the\
      \ game. Inability to break barrels from behind, spawning magically outside a\
      \ house while the game was inside the house meaning I was unable to move, frozen\
      \ in the middle of a room for a long inexplicable period of time, trapped by\
      \ what I can only assume was an invisible barrel or tree of some kind, and several\
      \ more variations along this theme.\n\nThe controls, while simple enough once\
      \ I got used to using them, were clunky and didn't always work. I found some\
      \ doors I had to move over multiple times before they would allow me to press\
      \ E and enter through them. The stick didn't always function to remove a barrel\
      \ or to shoot my weapon unless I was in a very specific place or facing the\
      \ right direction, and sometimes did not even work then.\n\nAlso the main character\
      \ moves unbelievably slow. Despite being able to press shift and move him slightly\
      \ faster in certain parts of the overworld (never inside buildings or certain\
      \ challenge areas) he was still so slow moving that it made exploring a chore\
      \ and incredibly painful, especially when I was already having difficulty figuring\
      \ out where to go next.\n\nThere were some good aspects. I found some of the\
      \ puzzles rather clever. Having to move the multiple shadow Freeks and maneuver\
      \ them in order to get Freek or Claire into the proper position was a well done\
      \ puzzle strategy, and I enjoyed that each incarnation of the puzzle made it\
      \ slightly more challenging and different despite it pretty much all being the\
      \ same puzzle again and again.\n\nThe world itself was interesting to look at.\
      \ From a design standpoint the town and surrounding areas were fascinating and\
      \ hinted at many more mysteries and possible puzzles or actions than actually\
      \ showed up in the game. I found myself searching the landscape hoping for more\
      \ worldbuilding information that would give me insight to the story because\
      \ of the interesting way it was set up. The graphics and character design of\
      \ the game are quite lovely and I enjoyed watching the character interactions.\n\
      \nThe Story itself was vastly intriguing, but incredibly difficult to follow\
      \ do to the problems of what I can only assume is linguistic translation. I\
      \ finished the relatively short game after several hours wishing that I understood\
      \ more of what was happening or the fate of my protagonist, or even the nature\
      \ of the enemies which I had just faced. \n\nI bought this game on sale for\
      \ a total of $0.50, and it was maybe worth that price. But I'm afraid that It\
      \ is definitely not worth the full sale price of $2.99, as low as that is. A\
      \ truly valiant and heroic effort considering the creator made it at no budget,\
      \ but it falls far too short of a satisfying game."
