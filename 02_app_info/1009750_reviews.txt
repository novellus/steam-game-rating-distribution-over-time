Loved it. Working on getting 100% achievements as I am writing this. Animation is beautiful. Art style is amazing. Voice acting fits perfectly. Gameplay is constantly fresh as a multitude of new mechanics are added with each chapter while some are simultaneously removed making gameplay feel fresh yet never overwhelming. Proper goon (the hardest difficulty) is genuinely challenging and will give any player a run for their money. The story is unpredictable and enticing with a constant stream of comedy yet none of the main cast's character development is ever undermined by the games comedy. I strongly reccomend you buy this game","timestamp_created":1609780103,"timestamp_updated":1609780103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49eCX5/YCdpa5wAI="}
