      /><br><br>In <i>UpMove</i>, only the power of language can propel your intrepid
      craft as you fly through cities and countrysides and giant factories, dodging
      meteor showers and laser beams and traffic jams as you strive to make that one
      last delivery that you need to move upwards and onwards. Your journey will take
      you through 11 hand-crafted levels, ranging in difficulty from moderate to extreme,
      and will challenge both your typing abilities and your piloting skills.<br><br><img

    review: "It is an honor to find this game. Such a vision that you don't typically\
      \ see now a days.\n\nPros\n- The graphics are so intricate. The art really is\
      \ something else. Like the little flowers sway on the ground and there are little\
      \ elevators. \n- A little lunar lander is always fun. Good core gameplay.\n\
      - Great Developer. This really is a work of art. Nice guy.\n\nCons\n- Be patient.\
      \ There is a definite order of operations you must perform to get of the landing\
      \ pad. Read the directions carefully.\n- You need good vision. My eyes not as\
      \ good as they used to be. Really had to lean close to the monitor to see it.\n"
