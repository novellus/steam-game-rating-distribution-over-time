    review: 'It''s a wonderful little homage to classic top-down racers, with a rather
      cheesy story to boot!


      For the most part I can''t complain. It plays and feels like it''s been lifted
      straight out of 1987! The only real thing I have to say I''m not a fan of -
      and this may well be a personal gripe more than anything - is that you still
      have complete control over the heading of your car whilst in the air. It kinda
      makes the jumps seem a little pointless bar avoiding an obstacle or two.


      I also adore how you can buy alternative body types and then mix and match the
      front/middle/rear ends of ANY of your cars. You want an F1 car with a pick-up
      bed? You got it! You want a supermini with a humongous bonnet big enough for
      a 7-litre HEMI? Sure thing!


      All in all, it''s a fun little game and due to the non-existent loading screens
      and the short, 2-minute races, it''s easily a game you can pick up and play
      especially when you have extremely limited time to play.'
