    about_the_game: 'Guess what, you incarnate a dude that is expert at solving procedural
      mazes into an infinite procedural land. Not only you have infinite stamina and
      run like a horse, but you also have incredible gymnastic skills. Run and jump
      you way ''till the end of the maze to access the next level. Watch out since
      levels are getting bigger and bigger. Oh and another detail, you have no map.
      You have to remember where you are coming from if you don''t want to run for
      hours and lose your mind into these mazes. A last tip : in case you are stuck
      at some level, just start it over, a new one with the same dimension level specs
      will be created.'

    developer_response: Hi zactor99,your opinion is important to us. We watched your
      video and find it really interesting what you had to say about it. We already
      did look at the main game breaker and find quick solutions for it. For the rest,
      you might want to wait since this game is in early release. Until then, cheers!

    review: 'When I saw this game, I thought the asking price of $13.99 USD was extremely
      high considering there is nothing more than trying to find your way through
      3D mazes...


      Once I played the game, I quickly realized that even 99 cents would be way too
      much for this Unity mess..

      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLjyvEV5nh0


      Game breaking bugs including:


      - Starting a maze and beginning on the outside of the maze with no way in!

      - Ridiculously steep blocks and slopes inside the maze that are way too steep
      to jump making traveling impossible!

      - Clipping through walls, the ground, and more!


      Add this to the gaudy and terrible looking animations and nothing else to do
      besides trying to run and jump through the mazes and you have a very bad game
      not even worth a small fraction of its launch asking price of $13.99 USD!


      This game scored a 3% using my indie game scoring system, making this game one
      of my M.I.S.S. games which means it''s one of the worst possible options to
      spend your hard earned money on here on Steam.


      NOT RECOMMENDED.  ..This isn''t a lack of developer skill, this game just shows
      a complete lack of developer effort and care, period.'
