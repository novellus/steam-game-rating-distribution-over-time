It have its own flaws, but the positive impression from it is still outweighs its shortcomings. I can even say, it's a shame that this project still remains unknown for the broad audience.\n\nIts story may seem nonsensical on the first playthrough, but on the second playthrough all the pieces of a puzzle meet together: there is a lot of hints of what's truly going on in the dialogues from the first half of the game - they seem surreal and unclear before you know how the story truly ends, but after that they sort things out perfectly. \n\nDialogues, key scenes and puzzles of \"Later On\" are magnificent, and at the end of two hours of gameplay I was completely charmed by them. These parts of the game are always surprising and they often end in unexpected ways - that's the level of originality that can rarely be seen in modern quests. Witty writing completes the picture perfectly.\n\nIf you're searching for a simple story, \"Later On\" may frustrate you on the first walkthrough, but if you're searching for a good time, it may give you two hours of surprises with happy ending before titles, and it's a rare thing for RPG Maker VX Ace game that costs less than 1.50$. Dark humour, absurdism, trashy horror (1st hour) and \"more serious\" psychological horror (2nd hour) elements included.","timestamp_created":1553533195,"timestamp_updated":1553538141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512325823307037354","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tNmF2+kCd6HnvQE="}
