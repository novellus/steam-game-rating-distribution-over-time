In early access but already promising. Dev says he will add more content. Game base price is 2$ so at worst you can redeem your money with community items xdxd. (2nd game will be 2D rpg, lets see.) Buy this game and support my friend :D","timestamp_created":1570461388,"timestamp_updated":1570461388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525053560733795166","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwzuGy0+0Cd4va0wE="}
