You can convert video files and old DVD's to MKV, MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV, FLV, 3GP, 3G2.\nI like to convert old AVI videos to MP4 or Matroska keeping the same quality but at a much lower file size.\nYou can also convert audio files to popular formats to MP3, M4A, OGG, WAV, FLAC, WMA, WMA Pro, AAC, AIFF, AU, CAF.\nThe converting process is really fast. Most of the 720p movies I converted within 15 minutes and no lost quality.\nThere are also plenty of preset profiles for phones, tablets, etc. for iPhone, iPad, Kindle, Sony & Samsung devices, PS3, PS4, XB1, etc.)\n(All of the settings you need can be found in the Options and Convert & Process tab to set up your desired preset or custom format and quality process)\nAnother cool feature is being able to download or record videos from popular sites like YouTube, Crackle, iTunes, NetFlix, Hulu, Crunchyroll, etc. (Not all sites allow their videos to be downloaded so you can set an automatic video detection and record). I have tested this on several sites including Crunchyroll and it works really well.\n\nThis software is really good and useful. If you are looking to convert your TV shows, movies or music to other file formats, than you should give this a try. :)","timestamp_created":1441112260,"timestamp_updated":1441114640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.668277084827423096","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6InIxM8Cc8mBRA=="}
