It's set in a world where agents in robot bodies run Ministries which control aspects of reality (e.g., Sound, Colour, Light). And administration agencies like the Ministry of Order police them. You are Bixby of the Dept. of Correction Pending; in exchange for your efforts to cut through the Ministry of Order's bureaucracy, you are not only the last agent in your department, but trapped in the Lounge District. The Lounge District is a labyrinth of glossy lobbies, bars, suites, malls, parks, and bus lots -- all abandoned by the Ministry of Order agents when you interfered. It's up to you (and your trusty radio operator Stiggs) to troubleshoot all the weird happenings that go on.\n\nThe game is divided into 'cases', each with a description of the gameplay (e.g., navigation, security evasion) and a time estimate. You are directed from place to place by placard or clues, and the plot moves a step further with each stop. Lore is scattered through the district by radio, info booth, and talk show, but the case storytelling is entirely dialogue. Your time will be spent hovering through the Lounge District (at a good clip) getting lost while you zone out to the pretty great Vangelis-style soundtrack.\n\nThe game is best approached as meditative and atmospheric. Because there IS a real atmosphere here. The Lounge District is a Neo Art Deco delight, with no two rooms alike and many shrouded in shadow or odd corners. The world-building is vague and the District is deserted, but in every room there's a reminder of the backstory (including portraits of the ex-Ministry of Order dictator), so paranoia builds. Later cases go a little farther afield, exploring new areas. As for the cases themselves, the most relative word is 'surreal' (they have names like, 'High Frequency Corn Syrup' and 'Dogs With Shoes.') There is an insistence on analogue, throwback touches, a la Bioshock. You get the feeling all business is conducted by pneumatic tube.\n\nNow for the caveats -- and there are several. Repetition is one; almost all the gameplay is navigation-based (although I guarantee you will NEVER learn your way around -- if getting lost is the point, then the game definitely delivers on that). Some people will find the emptiness of the world off-putting, although some crumbs of backstory explain why the District is abandoned. Some of the clues are unclear, so you will end up wandering around; this is especially difficult when you forget what exactly you're looking for, as the game has no quest information to refer back to. You can skip around the case list, but you cannot save mid-case. The biggest problem, though, is the dialogue -- especially unfortunately, as the plot is built on it. It's cleanly recorded but the actors are often muffled, so you have to crank up the sound to hear. More, it's very dense, and employs a lot of in-house future slang. You MUST pay strict attention. To their credit, the dev responded to comments on this and attempted to install subtitles, but the engine wouldn't allow it. The dev also came back quickly on bug reports.\n\nThe whole game is clearly a labour of love by a single developer. The graphics, the programming, the music, the writing -- all one person. And that really shines through, as the game is undoubtedly a cohesive whole, and infused with the enthusiasm of creation. If you loved Myst's atmosphere but didn't like the puzzles preventing you from wandering around, or if you love dark ambient music and want a surreal way to jam along with it, give it a go!","timestamp_created":1600837988,"timestamp_updated":1600837988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6qXY3PQCdfu+owI="}
