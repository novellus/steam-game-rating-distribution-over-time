While the game starts off fairly trivial, each mission is changed substantially enough to actually benefit from playing strategically. While I wish there was a way to turn up the difficulty a little bit to make this more apparent, terranova affords many different strategies to win a mission. What is extremely surprising (in a good way) is that missions are quite often quite different from what intelligence was able to supply - which makes those missions much more engaging and immersive. There are many small nitpicks I have, such as the AI not listening to your orders 100% of the time, shooting at enemies directly above you, and a very corny story, but the core of the game is fantastic and far surpasses other shooters on the market today.","timestamp_created":1608797256,"timestamp_updated":1608798433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47v32yfYCfNravAI="}
