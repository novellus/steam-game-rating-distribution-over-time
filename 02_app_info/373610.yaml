    review: The negative reviews are not wrong. Yes, there's not much content, but
      it's also cheap. Yes, sometimes it's confusing, but it also has a unique mechanic
      that is worth trying once. I go with a positive instead of a negative because
      it feels like a competent classic shooter, while other indie games don't.
