    review: 'For just a few dollars, this is a pretty scary game. I recorded all 3
      levels of difficulty cause why not, and there are some pretty interesting mechanics
      and scare tactics and the harder levels have added encounters it seems.


      It''s very interesting and worth a look at.


      As far as replayability is concerned, I''m never going to touch it again since
      I''ve beaten all 3 modes, but I am still glad I checked it out to begin with.
      It''s sort of more of a one off game, or if you do all 3 levels, a 3 off.


      Overall, it''s decent.'
