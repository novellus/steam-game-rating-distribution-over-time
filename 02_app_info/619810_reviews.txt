My only issue with this game is that it seems to perpetuate so many stereotypes, like you know the women fighting over the man and so on and so forth. The bitch, the angel, the handsome dude in the middle of it all. It's like playing a high school opera (which it is really) but like I said, it's still fun and engaging and I definitely enjoyed playing it.","timestamp_created":1608479365,"timestamp_updated":1608479365,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+Oq1wPYCfJXeuwI="}
