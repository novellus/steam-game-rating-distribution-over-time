There\nso many technics you can learn to perform takedowns too. The boost is satiystfing as HELL to use, and the game has a rocking soundtrack.\n\nBlur is a racing game that is more slippery than Burnout 3, but the mario kard inspired powerups pick the game right up. Every powerup serves a different purpose, and although it may not be as tight and responsive as Burnout, there certainly is so much to work with, with the track layouts in conjunction with the different power ups. Also, 4 Player split screen! Holy crap that's awesome!\n\nWhat does this game offer? None of that. The cars and the driving physics are very likely to be pre-purchased assets. Now, if they were used in a fun, creative manner, simular to games like the ones I mentioned before, then perhaps I wouldn't be so harsh on this garbage. But, in the end, what can you do in this game? Pretty much nothing. Pick a car, drive in a time trial because nobody else is playing online. There are no computer drivers because most likely the developer doesn't know how to program them. This could've been worked around by making the time trials at least somewhat exciting with bizzare obstacles and speed pickups, or just anything to make it more than just... whatever this is supposed to be.","timestamp_created":1547666488,"timestamp_updated":1577664526,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.721397280693054199","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw68aIqu8CfMDCuAE="}
