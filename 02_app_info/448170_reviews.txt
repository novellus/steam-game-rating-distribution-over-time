It takes place in a different setting than the first, so you don't have to worry too much about continuity.\n\nThat being said, I do not recommend this as your first Last Dream experience. Play the first game first and then work your way over to this. I found it to be a much more rewarding experience.","timestamp_created":1608892425,"timestamp_updated":1608892425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ssTdzPYCc+OBvQI="}
