    review: 'Gronions is one of the most amazing and challenging games, it has great
      playability, very well optimized, visually stunning, with a superb balance between
      the dreamlike landscapes of each planet and the tension of combat. Gronions
      story is mysterious and surprisingly inclusive, constantly challenging you to
      explore, a game with a sense of responsability that invites you to protect life;
      controls work very well, graphics are impressive for an Indie game and It has
      so much action that it keeps you on the edge of excitement, I really enjoyed
      the first person mode.


      The most surprising is the ease of getting on the flying ship, traveling, fighting
      against other spaceships and entering planets; combat music is very exciting
      and contrasts very well with a more subtle soundtrack when traveling through
      space, I was happy to see the new content recently released, and how often the
      game is updated, a nice touch is that water, trees, plants and even rocks have
      excellent interactivity.


      Gronions really stands out from other games, highly recommended!'
