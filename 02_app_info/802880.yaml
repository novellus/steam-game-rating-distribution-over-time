      \ /><br><br>The Muv-Luv series is an epic saga told in three parts: <strong>Muv-Luv\
      \ Extra, Muv-Luv Unlimited, and Muv-Luv Alternative</strong>. What begins as\
      \ a tongue-in-cheek romantic comedy ultimately transforms into an action-packed\
      \ thrill ride in a war-torn alternate reality, and it\u2019s this drastic-yet-methodical\
      \ genre twist that makes the final chapter the most highly-revered visual novel\
      \ of all time. This is a story that will plant seeds in your brain early in\
      \ the first act that you won\u2019t even notice until they sprout in the third\
      \ for maximum narrative payoff and crushing emotional impact. Don\u2019t fall\
      \ for Extra\u2019s cutesy exterior. This series ventures into some of the darkest\
      \ thematic territory you\u2019ll ever see, and when the final curtain closes,\
      \ you\u2019ll likely need a forklift to pick your jaw up off the floor. Make\
      \ no mistake: this is a story that will challenge you in ways few works of fiction\
      \ dare attempt, and an emotional tour de force unlike any other.<br><br>This\
      \ game contains the first two arcs: <strong>Extra, and Unlimited</strong>. <br>The\

      \ and - despite never having met him before - she insists that the two of them\
      \ are destined for one another. This comes much to the chagrin of his childhood\
      \ friend Sumika, the girl next door who\u2019s always had feelings for him,\
      \ who realizes that if she doesn\u2019t act fast, she might just lose him forever.\
      \ All of which begs the question: just who is Meiya? And do his feelings for\
      \ Sumika run deeper than he thought? In the end, he\u2019ll need to decide between\
      \ the girl who\u2019s been with him through thick and thin, or the stranger\
      \ who claims they\u2019re bound together by fate.<br><br>But that\u2019s only\
      \ one side of the story.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Muv-Luv Unlimited</h2><br>Just\

      \ A world infested by alien invaders locked in a war that\u2019s been raging\
      \ on for decades. And yet, all the set pieces are the same - his house is still\
