    review: "10/10 - This game is fucking awesome. \n\nIt might be a matter of taste\
      \ but I found it to be an example of my \"ideal\" game play experience. Story-driven\
      \ dark fantasy that is mechanically challenging as well. There is a particular\
      \ way you have to defeat certain enemies. And there are no \"random encounters\"\
      \ which I always found very annoying, every fight was part of the plot, to say\
      \ the least. No grinding or anything. \n\nDo not let the graphics fool you.\
      \ Although I think that they actually enhance the mood of the game, some may\
      \ skip this title simply because of the graphics. Do not do that. If you are\
      \ interested in narrative-driven RPGs, you must get this game. It has the same\
      \ amount of story and value one would receive from a well written book, making\
      \ it well worth the price. I paid $3.99, since it was on sale, but I may purchase\
      \ a second copy to send to a friend because I feel that this game deserves it.\
      \ \n\nMy favorite part is how well developed the characters seem to be. They\
      \ are used to weave a fascinating world and a unique story. I feel like this\
      \ game is great example of how video games can be used as a narrative art form.\n\
      \nI visited the developer's website, and it says he is a writer. That is certainly\
      \ true. Kyle Muntz is going places with this project. It also says he spent\
      \ seven years to make this game. The effort shows. I hope this game wins a much\
      \ wider audience so the developer can continue to make content.\n\nEdit: I did\
      \ discover a few grammatical errors, though it by no means affects the story\
      \ or playability of the game and I am sure that they will be fixed."
