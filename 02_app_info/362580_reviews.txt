Seriously, the ability to spawn 65 AP units that are tanks at the cost of 140 AP, and most importantly, [i]for free?[/i] Hell yeah, I'll take that!\n[b]--Fanatic Rider(?)--[/b]\nMotorcycle dude that will just crash into enemies. It's a bit costly, but for the damage it can deal the risk could be worth it. Not really worth putting in as a unit unless you just want to go with all Special Forces or.. something.\n[b]--Special Force--[/b]\nThe best unit by far in this pack, and my personal favorite. An absolute tank, having about or over 1000 HP, allowing him to just be flung back by a laser beam of Jupiter King, and able to tank about 3 shots from a Giridia-O (i think). 65 AP and high production rate (or moderate) means you can always use this, and when used in combination with the APC, it has great synergy. The landmine has the capability of stopping projectiles, such as Rebel Riflemen bullets or Bazooka shots, even tank shells as well. \n[b]--Stone Turtle--[/b]\nNot really worth your time or even putting in as a unit due to how slow it is. However, it works extremely effectively as a walking wall, having over 20k health at approximately level 5 or something. 800 AP for a walking slab of health like this doesn't sound bad, until you take into consideration that it's a close range unit only. Its only attack is a stomp and firing rockets via its special, so uh, not too bad, but its stomp deals a lot of damage.\n[b]--SV-001 SLUG VER PM(?)--[/b]\nA mediocre tank unit that's pretty fast and mobile with a tank cannon that.. fires tank shells. Its not too special and its special attack can be something that is pretty mediocre or on par with other tank units, and it doesn't have anything special to bring to the table.\n[b]--TOWER BOWLING BALL TANK THING WITH THEE GUERILLA DUDE--[/b]\nI got lazy and couldn't search up the name of this or even log onto the game to find out myself. Its pretty useless and is on par with the NOP-03 Sauriba(?) and is bassically just a reskin. Less armored and lower profile is all I can most likely say.\n[b]--BLACK HOUND--[/b]\nMediocre and pretty bad tank for its cost. Over 300 AP for a crappy long range attack, bad close range attack and a bad special? Its special can only really mow down infantry, and its close range attack is something that shoulda been its long range. The long range is a mortar which goes over the heads of infantry if they get too close, which just sucks. \n[b]--RESKIN REBEL VEHICLES--[/b]\nThe Bradley is alright I guess, or just plain out bad or on par with the already existing one. its special attack is replaced with more rockets,w hich is neat. It might have longer range or something. Don't bother using it.\nThe DI-COKKA is pretty alright or on par with the actual DI-COKKA if you can't manage to get it. Nothing special to say.\nThe Giridia-O is on par with the actual Giridia O, but might have more health. Its damage output might be the same though.\n\nJust get it for the special forces.","timestamp_created":1580189161,"timestamp_updated":1580189161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44qKn9e8CcKDO7gE="}
