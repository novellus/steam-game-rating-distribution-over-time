    review: "What a beautiful beautiful game. In addition for being on PC it was for\
      \ the Phillips CD-I ANd I believe the best game ever for it. Way better than\
      \ Mario Hotel or Zelda\n\nI got this game when I was 14. Dad found it at a budget\
      \ software place said he thought I might be interested\n\nBoy was I! Its advanced\
      \ for its time! It has real video from the French mini series about Marco Polo\
      \ that had Leonard Nimoy and a few other great actors that was made in the 80s.\
      \ It was great!\n\nThe game is also multiplayer and up to 4 players may play,\
      \ you travel the middle east and the orient visitng famous people from the 13th\
      \ century including Pope Gregory X Yusef Ali THe Lion of An jalut and Kubulai\
      \ Khan among others. \n\nIT also features documentary data on goods places and\
      \ legends at the time and on the life of Marco Polo.\n\nYou play as a merchant\
      \ and travel trading and performing missions. Its a good trading game. Its kinda\
      \ like Starflight 2 and Gazillionaire but better."
