But I liked it very much!\n\nPros\n- Nice pixel style\n- Finding everything out was joyful for me\n- If I had paid 3 bucks I wouldn't be unhappy\n- Hard to master\n- More complex than it seems in the beginning\n\nSome suggestions, maybe the developer will update the game in the future.\nThe building sound has a lot of bass, it was a little bit annoying.\nYou get coins but pay in G like Gold? Why not C?\nOther music for the night instead of no music?\nI had a weird bug where a villager hadn't enough to eat but wouldn't work but also wouldn't eat. The villager turned completely useless.\nEvade seems a bit overpowered.\nScrolling in the menus was very slow.\nIt's a little bit on the slow side.\nMaybe make the intro skippable on the second playthrough.\nTranslation of the little bit of text? Maybe German? I would happily do it :D\n\nBut! I still liked the game and can recommend it, especially for this bargain price :D If there is an update in the future I would be really happy!","timestamp_created":1593064307,"timestamp_updated":1593064307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k4eC9fICcOCBkAI="}
