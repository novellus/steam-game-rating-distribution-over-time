The artbook gives tons of insight into Nowhere Prophet's development cycle, showing off all the iterations of the combat UI and highlighting the design choices behind the world of Soma and each faction within it.\n\nWhile I would highly recommend this artbook to anyone who loved the artstyle of Nowhere Prophet, I [i]was[/i] disappointed by the selection of Avatars they had. I bought this artbook hoping to find a specific one, Con Man, but I suppose they were added post-release. Ah well.","timestamp_created":1607415912,"timestamp_updated":1607415912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5IrdoPYCeNSRuAI="}
