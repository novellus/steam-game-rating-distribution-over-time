      /><br><br><strong>Wanna'' walk on the Moon?</strong><br><br><strong>Tranquility
      Base Mining Colony: The Moon - Explorer Version</strong>, is a <strong>Lunar
      Exploration Simulator</strong>. It is the Early Access version to our <strong>Tranquility
      Base Mining Colony: The Moon - Achiever Version,</strong> which is due to be
      released in July, 2021.<br><br>We''ve been working on the ACHIEVER version for
      three years now, and decided that since we''ve had so much fun running around
      the Moon for the last three years, that we''d share this experience with those
      fellow space-geeks who''d like to geek out, like us, and explore the Moon from
      this unique point of view that very few have ever experienced.<br><br>This is
      an open-world area that encompasses about 17,000 sq kilometers of lunar terrain
      around the Apollo 11 landing site. We''ve taken topographic data from NASA''s
      Lunar Reconnaissance Laser Altimeter (LOLA) which is mounted on the Lunar Reconnaissance
      Orbiter (LRO) to create this 3d map for you to explore. <br><br>You and your
      character can view in first-person or third-person perspective as you explore:<br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Begin at the the Starter Arena, along the southern rim of
      Moltke AC Crater as you learn the fundamentals of Jet-Packing in the Moon''s
      low gravity environment.<br></li><li>Explore Hypatia Rille and visit nearby
      Moltke A Crater and the highlands south of the Sea of Tranquility.<br></li><li>Walk
      or Jet-pack down into the enormous Moltke Crater which is about 6 kilometers
      across.<br></li><li>Head north to visit the Tranquility Base Lunar Reserve Visitor
      Center, gateway to the Apollo 11 landing site. Head further north to Collins
      Crater, or the east to see Armstrong Crater or to the far west to visit Aldrin
      Crater, all named after the Apollo 11 astronauts.</li></ul><br>There is so much
      more to see and explore. You''ll see just how beautiful the Moon actually is
      up close and personal, from the vast Sea of Tranquility to the highlands and
      mountains in the south.<br><br>View a picture map of the area:<br><a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/gfxproxy/gfx/apps/873740/extras/Map2.png?t=1532636576"

    detailed_description: '<h1>Update Notes</h1><p><strong>A major update will be
      released on July 20th. 2020</strong><br>The update will fix the several &quot;glitches&quot;
      or dead-zones within the area. These dead-zones are areas in which the player
      is brought back to the Main Menu. If you have not saved your score you will
      lose any unsaved points. One of these dead-zones lies within the green radiation
      area northwest of the Starter Arena. Others are invisible. Because of this,
      we are lowering the price until the Update is released. Of course, anyone who
      purchases before the update will receive the update for free.<br><strong>REMINDER:</strong>
      This is a very large exploration area. 17,000 sq. km, takes a large file. The
      download file unpacks to about 35 GB.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/873740/extras/TBMC_Red.png?t=1585950897"

    developer_response: "As painful as it was to read this, it was not unfair.\n\n\
      First, I wish to thank you for trying the program, spending a fair amount of\
      \ time running around the world and then comprising a long, thoughtful and fair\
      \ review. I truly appreciate your comments and feedback. I apologize that this\
      \ was not the experience that you were expecting.\n\nSecondly, I would like\
      \ to address several points that you brought up:\n\t\n    Yes. This is a massive\
      \ play area, and, as you stated, is more of a Lunar \n    Exploration Simulator.\
      \ This version is called \u201CExplorer\u201D because it is meant for us \n\
      \    Moon-geeks and explorers to wander and explore this open-world lunar \n\
      \    environment. It is primarily focused upon the terrain and landscape of\
      \ the Moon. I \n    understand that this may not be considered \u201Cfun\u201D\
      \ by most. I will review the store \n    page and update to better communicate\
      \ this going forward.\n\n    Again, this is a massive play area, which accounts\
      \ for the large file size. 17,000 \n    square kilometers is a lot of area,\
      \ which accounts for the 35 GB of space needed \n    to install.\n\n    I am\
      \ working on the glitch. There will be an update.\n\nAgain, I thank you for\
      \ the thoughtful review. I, clearly, have some things to work on\u2026\n"

    review: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnL5KuaPT2s


      Imagine a developer offering a massive lunar landscape so big that it makes
      the download and install on your computer a whopping 35 GB in size. Now imagine
      NOTHING on this landscape asset except for some free spinning gold coins that
      you can collect as you run your astronaut asset endlessly across the surface.  There''s
      nothing to do with the coins and ZERO actual content as well as ZERO fun to
      be had!


      I mean some might find the fact they can run around endlessly on a map of the
      actual moon landscape around the Apollo 11 landing site cool, but trust me when
      I say that this is about the most boring thing I''ve ever experienced!


      NOT RECOMMENDED.  The developer of this is NOT a developer at all.  They simply
      smashed together a huge lunar map with an Astronaut asset with a jet pack as
      well as scattered a few random spinning coins around the massive map and then
      uploaded the unpacked 35 GB mess here to Steam to try and charge $10 for it.'
