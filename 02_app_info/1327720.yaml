    review: "I didn't think I was going to get much from this game based on the title\
      \ art. Felt like it was going to be another college project. I was so wrong!\
      \ This is Missile Command for 2020, in the best way. Unlock all of the upgrades\
      \ to find your perfect playstyle. Great action gameplay, fun choices, and the\
      \ art really grew on me. Seeing ships explode into color clouds, which then\
      \ get cut to pieces as projectiles fly through them, was massively satisfying.\
      \ \n\nThe tutorial interface is a mess, and almost made me reconsider my purchase,\
      \ but after the 30 seconds looking at bad text placement, the game enabled its\
      \ hyperdrive and kicked into high gear.\n\nFor new players, look at the tips\
      \ on how to use the shields. While I got used to the game without them, they\
      \ occasionally saved my life. I also noticed the word \"seasons\" in the menu,\
      \ and really hope we see new content eventually. This game will definitely stay\
      \ in my current roster of games played."
