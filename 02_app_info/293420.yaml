      /><br>Do you enjoy hack-n-slash but longed for a bit more? Maybe you like tower
      defense games but find them a bit boring? Heldric is a unique mix of the same
      old styles of game with a few new twists. A hack-n-slash without endless level
      grinding.  A tower defense game with more action. A game where you don't play
      as an epic hero, but as a humble shoemaker who must work together with his fellow
      villagers to defend their home. <br><br>Build and upgrade the village quickly
      before the attack waves start. Each building you place adds unique abilities
      to not only the player's character, but your fellow villagers as well.  You
      must choose your structures wisely, as there are only a limited amount of plots
      available on each map.  Every villager contributes to your coin income and provides
      essential help in defending the town.    You must help them defend against waves
      of monsters intent on killing everyone.  Do you have what it takes to survive?

    review: IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A RATHER SIMPLE AND RELAXING GAME THIS IT.I finished
      a ripped version from The Pirate Bay some years ago and I liked it so I bought
      the game from Steam.This is what I would like to see in the game if the developer
      is still improving it:the hero gains experience after each kill;after the monsters
      are killed they leave behind random items like armour and weapons that can improve
      your hero's stats;a random map generator;more hero abilities.I do not know if
      any of those additions can be put into the game today or into a DLC or future
      game but they can really transform the game into something special.If some of
      those improvements are in the game please excuse my ignorance.The suggestions
      I made are based on an old ripped version and maybe the newer versions contain
      some of them.
