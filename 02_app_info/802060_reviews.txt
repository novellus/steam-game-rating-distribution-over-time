It starts pretty easy in the 1st world but the challenge ramps up pretty fast after that.\nMany opponents to defeat, no deaths challenges, bonus super gems. There is quite a lot to do if you want to beat the game \"100%\".\n\nThe handling (mainly the jumps) is a little floaty but you get used to it. The only complaint I would have is that the jump is not a reflection of how long you press the button. It is a fixed height, which adds to the general challenge of the game, but you get used to it too.\n\nSo overall, especially for the price, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone, I really dug it myself. It may look clunky and childish but it is way more competent than expected. But the very slick designs and colors were a plus in my book. At least it's a change from all the pixel art games that we see coming these days.\n\nOn a side note: I feel like this game would make a pretty good speedrun because there's actually different routes you can take to beat a level. Plus you can make several categories in the game like no deaths runs (which would be no joke), 100%, any%...","timestamp_created":1563443756,"timestamp_updated":1563443756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571631789207458496","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1586962222,"developer_response":"Hi Felimarsh! \nMany thanks for your review and we are glad that you like our small game ;)\n"}],"cursor":"AoJwvs+gguwCfqfNzgE="}
