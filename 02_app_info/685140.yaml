      /><br><strong>&quot;This game has Bearfelf and its FREE&quot;</strong> - Joe
      David<br>Zoo Strikers is a 3rd person team-based action multiplayer game, featuring
      none other than Bearfelf himself. After years of development, Bearfelf has created
      a video game for you to play with him.<br><br><strong>Your Character, Your Way</strong><br>Choose
      which animal you will play as and customize their weapons, shoes, shirts, hats,
      glasses, and more. Level up and earn some cash from Bearfelf to help you grow
      your collection. <br><br><strong>Team based fighting for FUN</strong><br>Zoo
      Strikers aims to make having fun it's priority, with game modes like Bomb defusal,
      capture the flag, team death match, and gameplay like a classic 3rd person platforming
      game, the matches are fast, confusing, and crazy.<br><br><strong>Build it?!</strong><br>Throughout
      the maps you may come across large blocks that can be picked up, depending on
      how you place these blocks may just determine how the match goes! You can use
      these as cover, block entrances, and many more uses, but watch out! Some blocks
      may be explosive.<br><br><strong>More to come</strong><br>Right now we are only
      in at the alpha stage of development, so theres still lots more to be made,
      changed, rearranged! We hope you stay tuned and stay excited for whats to come.
      <br><i>&quot;Theres a lot more to Bearfelf then you can see with your eye ball.&quot;</i>
