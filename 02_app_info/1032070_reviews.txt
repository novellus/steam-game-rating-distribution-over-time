This type of mature and intelligent game design is lacking in most modern titles from indie, all the way to AAA.\n\nThe \"choose your own adventure\" story line was well written and the varying strategy required to pass each level was fantastic and kept me feeling engaged and rewarded as I worked out how to make it through each night.\n\nOverall I thought it was really well developed from start to finish and at the end of the day it was just great fun to play.","timestamp_created":1609207250,"timestamp_updated":1609207250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxb+O1vYCfsmmvgI="}
