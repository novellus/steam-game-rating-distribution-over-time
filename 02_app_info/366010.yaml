    about_the_game: The aim of the game is very simple; SURVIVE! Try and survive for
      as long as you can, the longer you are alive the harder everything gets. New
      enemies will start spawning, different bosses will spawn, and the older enemies
      will start getting a little more aggressive. The twist is within the powerups
      and spacecrafts. There are a bunch of different powerups that can aid you when
      battling the enemies. Keep playing to figure out what each powerup actually
      does. You can unlock different spacecrafts (30 to unlock), which all have a
      different abilities (apart from the default one) that will enhance the powerups
      in different ways. You also have the ability to slow down time at will. Everything
      apart from the player is slowed down. This is a very useful ability but you
      only have a limited amount of time you can use it for so use it sparingly. Earlier
      versions of the game were very generic, hence the name. However, I do think
      the game provides some very fun and unique gameplay elements.

    review: It took me 5 hours to unlock everything. I played this while listening
      to an audio book. It can be played with only the mouse. Mindless isn't exactly
      the right word, but you do sort of get in a rhythm with it. It is a good game
      to play while thinking about something else. It was exactly what I was looking
      for and I enjoyed it. I appreciate that it puts all the mechanics up front and
      you don't have to wait to unlock things (what you unlock is just how long/how
      often for power ups)
