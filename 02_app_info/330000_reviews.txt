I wanted to keep playing. It has all the wonderful aspects of an addictive CCG. Opening packs, nice card art, interesting gameplay. What is it that finally killed the game for me? Arena Trolls. After you complete the campaign (which isn't finished BTW), there is only guild wars and Arena play left. Guild wars is just 45 quick matches over the course of 36hrs so there isn't enough there to keep an avid player going. So what's left? The Arena. Even if you only play the lowest level which is called \"Limited\". Even if you have mastered tactics and gameplay. You WILL lose more than you win. Why? Because the Arena is rampant with players who have put together the perfect decks. Either by grinding in game currency to buy singles OR they spent real money on the game. Good for them... I'm happy for them, I really am. At the same time, I'm tired of players who are no better than I am, winning everytime because they are bringing unbeatable decks to the Arena. I have 30K wins overall in the game (mostly in Guild Wars) so I know how to play. These players are still unbeatable because of the decks they bring to the lowest of 3 levels of Arena. Anyway, unless you have unbelievable patients, you don't care if you lose all the time OR you are ready to spend a lot of money....stay well clear of this game. This is the ultimate example of pay to win.","timestamp_created":1488300083,"timestamp_updated":1488300083,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ486DmwtoCdLGvcw=="}
