Feels like they should have had two versions of spike because instant death is really out of place in some puzzles.\n\nThe real reason for the fact I don't recommend the game however is the price to playtime ratio. It's about twelve hours if you do all the content. You could double that if you aim for perfection with the Boss Rush mode or try your hand at community content, but even then, that just puts you slightly above a one to one ration with the $20 price tag. I got the game on a 50% discount, so if you are interested, get it during a sale.","timestamp_created":1609123740,"timestamp_updated":1609481340,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxoik3vYCddT7vQI="}
