    review: 'Pros:

      +Cute story


      Cons:

      -Very short

      -Subpar animation and graphics


      Thoughts:

      This is a short anime music video. The music was not all that great and the
      animation and models were a little rough around the edges. The only reason that
      I would recommend this is because it is made by a small studio that I believe
      could produce some higher quality work in the future if they have the funds.
      Also, at this point, VR music videos are fairly unique, so this was a novel
      experience.
