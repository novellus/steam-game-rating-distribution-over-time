I appreciate the attempt by developer Adam Thompson to create something new and different.\n\nPlayers can pick one of four characters, each of which has two unique special abilities. Each character also has a standard grouping ability and clearing ability, although the shape differs by character. For instance, one character might shoot out what looks like a 20 x 5 grid of bubbles. As it approaches enemies, they are pulled into its formation. You can follow it up with an attack that is made up of a 20 x 5 grid of projectiles to clear the enemies.\n\nI preferred to play with Dredrick, who has an ability to knock away swarming enemies and a chain lightning attack. My partner preferred Zica, who can one-shot certain towers and drop a cluster bomb.\n\nAlthough we enjoyed our time with the game at first and liked the music and some of the humorous dialogue, we began to grow fatigued after a few levels. Each level plays more or less identically, with later levels involving more bad platforming and spongier enemies. The movement within the game never began to feel good for me – I just couldn’t get used to moving my character with right click. Although perhaps this would clash with the game’s MOBA roots, I think I’d prefer moving with left click or WASD and using the number keys up top to activate each ability.\n\nThe spongier enemies became tiresome, as you never gain any new abilities and your abilities never get any stronger. The game attempts to explain away your inability to upgrade through the game’s “story,” but this almost served to emphasize the problem. I actually felt while playing the game that I was a villain, and the paltry attempts to humanize Dredrick’s crew fell very flat for me.\n\nAlthough we decided to finish the game, playing two levels per sitting before moving on to something more engaging, I can’t recommend it. Between the static abilities, repetitive levels, poor movement, and weak humor, you’re just better off spending your time elsewhere.","timestamp_created":1561491135,"timestamp_updated":1561491177,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522488057613372803","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44o+IyOsCfqihxAE="}
