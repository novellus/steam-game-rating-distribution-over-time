Take this review with a grain of salt.\n\nThis map is really high quality, it’s clear that the devs spent a lot of time making Chicago as realistic as they can. It is really cool to see the landmarks in Chicago that I have been to. Now, one downside to this map is that since it is Chicago you would want a lot of traffic and people, but this will slow down the FPS. Then add the buildings, and the FPS goes down more. I have been able to get 20-40 frames per second while in downtown. 20 FPS mainly only happens when it needs to load tiles. Anyways, pretty much the map is very high quality. Just be aware that the optimization isn’t very good.\n\nThis map comes with 2 routes, 130 and 127. I haven’t played Chicago too much so I really haven’t experienced all the routes to its fullest. I do think 2 routes are good enough as they are both long routes which I like. \n\nThe Chicago Citybus may have to be one of my favorite buses, the bus is great. \n\nOverall, 9/10","timestamp_created":1571457530,"timestamp_updated":1608878433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rpSozPYCd8Gr1AE="}
