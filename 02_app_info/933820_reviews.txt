If you enjoyed Banished, you will enjoy this game. I have found it easily as enjoyable, if not more so, than Banished, and the game is still in Early Access. As the developers complete more of the game and gradually move it to full release, I have no doubt that I will easily consider it the superior of the two.\n\nMany of the systems are very similar if not outright the same. You can hunt, gather, farm, fish, or raise animals for food. You must concern yourself with tools and clothing. Your people need shelter and medicine. \n\nHowever, I have found many of the systems to either be deeper, more realistic, or entirely new systems that make the game more engaging. \n\nDeeper: In addition to food, your people now also need water, and water is used for many things: drinking, irrigation, producing certain goods, watering animals at your pastures. \n\nMore realistic: In Banished you could easily sustain huge populations on hunting, gathering, and fishing. In Endzone, working fields and orchards is VERY MUCH a key to sustaining food production, rather than just a way to bump food diversity. Success at farming was a key achievement that allowed switching from a nomadic to an agrarian lifestyle.\n\nNew: Dealing with radiation (in addition to disease) in both the soil, rain, water/food supplies. There's a tech tree that you must progress through in order to unlock more buildings. There are side-quests/goals that citizens will occasionally give you (and a building you can construct to more reliably access these). Electricity use and production is a thing. You can send folks out to scout old world ruins and explore them with teams to recover goods.\n\nThere's a pretty robust tutorial to explain how everything works, as well as scenarios (which I have not yet attempted, myself) and survival mode, which is effectively how one always played Banished: Your goal is to survive and thrive, not complete specific objectives (outside of achievement hunting I suppose).\n\nIf I had to say anything negative, I'm not a huge fan of the sound track. Parts of it are pretty good, but I find it a bit too repetitive, and certain parts are simply jarring to listen to, nevermind when they repeat frequently. I've also encountered a few minor issues such as a \"missing string\" error when an explorer was supposed to say something to me on an expedition.","timestamp_created":1610092251,"timestamp_updated":1610092251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ498C+8PYCftW9wQI="}
