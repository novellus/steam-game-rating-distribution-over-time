Trying to look for answers to questions in the Steam discussions wouldn't lead anywhere most of the time. I was becoming quite desperate until I coincidentally became aware of the existence of a Noisz Discord server and found the invite link in the Noisz news here: https://store.steampowered.com/newshub/app/681530/view/4039122238476742084. If you want to get into the game, I highly recommend joining it as it is the best source of information at this time thanks to dedicated players in it. I would also recommend the devs to invite players more aggressively to it. Had I not found out about it (by accident), I'd certainly still be desperate for a lot of basic info at this time!\n\nNoisz is a bullet hell shmup and rhythm game hybrid, though I'd say that the former genre has a stronger presence. The game doesn't feature stages but instead it consists of bosses only with individual songs. The significance of the music is that the boss's patterns are designed after the song and you can only shoot or activate your shield to absorb light blue bullets and become immune to light blue lasers in the rhythm of the song. You can choose between different styles and the equipped core to make use of their properties or abilities. They're very powerful and the right combination can make achieving whatever goal you have much easier.\n\nMost of your experience will revolve around this gameplay concept and Free Mode lets you play any song on any difficulty at any time. However, there's also the Story mode which is a Visual Novel where you fight said bosses very frequently. Now, I don't have much to say about the story itself as I've barely read it and will most likely not do so in the future either (you can skip through text with the shield button). However, it is a significant part of the game regardless as the bosses you encounter will depend on the choices you make throughout the VN. Playing this mode is mandatory if you want to experience the full game as certain songs and styles/cores are locked behind it. \n\nWhatever difficulty you chose to play Story mode on: if you play for the first time, I wouldn't recommend playing on hardcore mode. On Hardcore mode you only have a limited amount of credits. Credits are used if you fail and need to restart a song or want to skip a song (you can not skip the last one). As many songs later in the story are very difficult and require memorization and preferably a good style-core combination, you'd most likely restart the entire story and play through the comparitively easy songs of the first few chapters for a while before fighting the harder bosses again. You also obtain more credits you can spend per story mode run as you play the game. Thus, hardcore mode is more suited as a challenge for those experienced with all songs you get on the route you chose.\n\nOccasionally, I've experienced slight hiccups in the game. It doesn't occur that often on my PC, so I'm not too worried about it personally. However, keep in mind that the game is a shmup (usually a frame based game genre) and a rhythm game (with its time based on the music). Thus, hiccups can compromise the game experience not just visually: They can cause you to miss the beat and therefore your chance to shoot or activate your shield which may result in failure.\n\nI purchased this product alongside the following DLC: NOISZ DM Ashura Level Pack, NOISZ HyuN Level Pack and NOISZ re:||VERSE. At this point, I haven't played or even seen/heard every song in the game yet, but if you enjoy the game concept, I also recommend the DLCs. They all contain more songs which are listed on their respective shop list. The re:||VERSE DLC mentioned also adds more routes (with some insanely difficult songs) to the story and more styles as well.\n\nSummary: I find the game very fun to play, even though I don't necessarily like a lot of the music used in the game. It has much to offer in terms of challenge but fails to convey some of the basic information you wish it did, so do consider joining the Discord server if you decide to get serious with it!","timestamp_created":1606252788,"timestamp_updated":1606588347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p5aIiPYCfO6nsAI="}
