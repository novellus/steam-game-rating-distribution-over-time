    reviews: "\u201CLexip Games has introduced another atmospheric, puzzle-horror\
      \ title that requires the player to find clues that gradually thread the main\
      \ story together. Wall markings and keys within safes are all pretty standard\
      \ within puzzle games. However, the title's haunting setting is intriguing.\
      \ A Victorian house full of memories and secrets to be uncovered seems to be\
      \ the main objective. As your character suffers from amnesia, the many clues\
      \ that lie around the house will eventually\_explain their reason for being\
      \ there.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.thegamer.com/point-click-horror-dark-room-saw-game/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >thegamer</a><br><br>\u201CDark Room operates\
      \ via an interesting art style that borders the line between photorealism and\
      \ pencilling. Seriously, every single item, with the exception of preexisting\
      \ paintings, looks like it was drawn by a talented sketch artist translating\
      \ photographs into a pencilled form. Small details like the brownish rust of\
      \ metal, breaks on a rotting table, the pepperjack tinge of an old suitcase,\
      \ the yellow fade of a book\u2019s pages, mold on a wall, and dust bunnies gathered\
      \ up in corners is perfectly depicted in the game as though these were real\
      \ rooms in a rundown building that someone decided to replicate to a tee.\u201D\
