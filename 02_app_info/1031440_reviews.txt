I do wish that the world and character models had a more realistic scale to them, but it wasn't a huge deal. The animations were just enough to give a good sense of immersion and connection to the story and the narrative was already great on it's own. Overall an amazing experience and really looking forward to the future of VR visual novels like Tokyo Chronos.","timestamp_created":1610095853,"timestamp_updated":1610095853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43J/M8PYCceO+wQI="}
