It's a really packed DLC.\nOverall: I am just satisfied with my purchase.\nAnd I really do recommend this perfect DLC.","timestamp_created":1608914217,"timestamp_updated":1608914217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482003122568130493","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gtWwzfYCeOOMvQI="}
