I recommend the entire PuppetShow series. I've loved all of them.\n\nPros: Many different kinds of little hidden object-type scenes. Decent enough story for my tastes, lots and lots of things to find. The actual hidden object scenes were pretty good and some were quite fun.\n\nSome of the puzzles/scenes didn't make complete sense, but I'm okay with that for this kind of game. It was fairly linear (not a lot of back and forth or hunting around). Usually that bothers me a bit because I love having to hunt for things, but this game was so fun I didn't mind. (Some people might prefer it.) It didn't have a ton of the standard mini-puzzles, but lots of little mini-mini-puzzles. The Mini-puzzles it did have were for the most part not just the same ones that some developers use over and over (though some might have been similar)\n\nFor me about the only cons were: If you zoom into something and there is an item you can pick up, it basically makes sure you pick it up. I like having to find them for myself. The other was that some things were a bit too easy, like a little jigsaw puzzle that shows the outline of the pieces as you hover over. (I was playing in easy mode - perhaps they don't show that with more advanced mode.)","timestamp_created":1599540771,"timestamp_updated":1599540771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i+eDtvQCeanBoAI="}
