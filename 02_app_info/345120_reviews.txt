There are SO MANY obstacles in which you have to stop and wait for it to go away, along with sometimes having to learn a pattern for 10 seconds just to progress, only to die on the next spot were you have to learn ANOTHER pattern to continue.\n\n\nThe game also has bosses for some reason, i don't have too much problems with them they're pretty O K , except for the fact that some of these bosses require you to go on some platform that's constantly moving, there was also the tree boss which had these stupid platforms that moved whenever they felt like it, which got super annoying.\n\n\nThey even remove one of the original mechanics from the first game too, but it isn't somewhere near the end, or even mid section of the game, they remove it near the beginning after the first boss, ( which doesn't take long to get to ) hell they barely even use it too.\n\nThe new mechanics are fucking terrible, such as this one level in which you're in the sky and have to shoot enemies on a bird. The bird controls SLIGHTLY better then the main character, but it has a delay whenever you're about to move in a different direction which can get you killed a bunch.\n\nThere's also this other one that i wont spoil but jesus christ fuck that level.\n\nI had a better time taking a giant shit yesterday then playing this pile of Mole feces, the toilet clogged too and i bet my mom found plunging the toilet a better experience then this Pixel diahrea of a sequel.\n\n\nI feel as if the game should've focused more on some kind of puzzles, since i believe platforming was only a minimal part of the original and plus the game itself was NOT made to be a platformer due to the characters Slippy Sliddy walking.\n\n\nAnyways i hope the next game might be better since i found this to be a frustrating dissapointment since I've been waiting since i was a kid for Vox 1's cliffhanger ending to be resolved...","timestamp_created":1606258719,"timestamp_updated":1606339958,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz9LUgPYCeL6psAI="}
