    review: 'I actually bought game and it was so clunky that I had to request a refund.
      You have to use an Xbox controller to navigate. I couldn''t figure out even
      how to do basic things. Game needs lots of polish.


      I was able to mess around and move things around. Change shape sizes and even
      add some items. But when it came to playing my song and animating objects to
      them. Well, all I could do was play my song. I couldn''t even figure out if
      there was a template to use. The store videos look cool and I''d love to be
      able to do something even remotely close to that. I just couldn''t figure out
      where to start.


      Sorry, but it''s way too clunky / complicated to use in its current form. You
      definitely need a tutorial or a more intuitive interface. I know the app is
      only $5 and I shouldn''t expect much. But it was useless to me. And nothing
      made me want to even try to figure it out since I was getting nowhere fast.'
