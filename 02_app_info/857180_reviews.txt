I practiced on one level out of pure determination wanting to 100% the game, and managed to get second place on the leaderboards for the level, and got 1 star.","timestamp_created":1609889951,"timestamp_updated":1609889951,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ40eW66vYCeZbtwAI="}
