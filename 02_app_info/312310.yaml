    about_the_game: "The Ensign-1 was supposed to be your ticket out of this god forsaken\
      \ solar system. You signed up in hopes of a new life, a chance to be part of\
      \ humanities first extra solar colonization mission. Things were cut short however,\
      \ when, after a couple of years into the mission, a distress signal was received\
      \ from Earth. They were under attack by an unknown alien force, and then all\
      \ went silent. Now, having had to cancel its mission, the Ensign-1 turns around,\
      \ possibly as Earth's last defense against this new threat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nPlay the role of Leon Deckard, one of Ensign-1's finest in it's space forces.\
      \ Through a series of missions, it will be up to you to take back our solar\
      \ system from the enemy, and you won't need to stay in your fighter to do it.\
      \ You'll have the freedom to board other ships and stations, plant bombs, and\
      \ man turrets. Ensign-1 is a tough as nails space combat game built around the\
      \ idea of being able to leave your space fighter. You'll need to think creatively\
      \ to make it back alive."
