    short_description: Toymaker is a roleplaying game that takes place in a dark,
      snow-filled world, where life is harsh and the people living there have become
      hard and cold. In this land, the darkness has eyes, the winter wind whispers
      with a piercing voice and the frost hungers for warm flesh.

    review: 'Alright, I just finished the game and it took me 18 hours to!

      This game is 10000% WORTH THE MONEY AND THE HOURS YOU SPEND ON IT! It was done
      with a  lot of love and a lot of patience, and it took the dev 3 YEARS to make
      it! the game has an amazing intro you can only do by spending hours on rpg maker
      2003! The graphics are all well done and very beautiful, the characters are
      really well written, and the story is original and touching, i was brought to
      tears twice, no lie! haha, and my little 4 years old sis always asks me if she
      could fight the monsters whenever she sees me playing it XD

      This is one unique RPG maker 2003 game, so if you like this kind of games, get
      this one!

      And the developer of this game is also a very nice, helpful and supportive person
      and is very fun to talk with, support them by purchasing this amazing game,
      because like I said before it''s worth the price!

      The soundtrack is also very calming and quiet, I like that about it too, and
      omg Sakeh is bae <3

      I am very happy with my purchase.

      I hope red skald makes another game, I will definitely purchase again!'
