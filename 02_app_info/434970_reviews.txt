Oh, I was supposed to say something about it redeeming itself.  Nope.  It's just that.  I guess you get upgrades, but how does that change anytehing if you still die in the seaweed every time?  Well, anyways.  I can beat the dam level in TMNT every time, with only sacrificing Raph (cause his weapons suck) but this I don't even care that much about.  I'll beat it here in a few minutes when I'm ready and I'll update this if anything cool happens.","timestamp_created":1467672540,"timestamp_updated":1467672540,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":37,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.722760379314422607","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtraG3NUCcKL1Ww=="}
