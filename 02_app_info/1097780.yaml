    about_the_game: <strong><u><i>We met in May</i> and went on a lot of dates.</u>
      This is a collection of vignette games about those dates, and the comedy that
      comes with getting to know someone.</strong><br><br><u>What the heck do you
      DO in these games?</u><br>In <i>We Met in May</i>, you play as Nina while she's
      hanging out with her love interest, Jake. Nina and Jake get into various shenanigans
      together, which you play through as Nina. On one date, you may end up burying
      Jake in sand, chips and wine. On another, he may cook dinner for you! Each game
      is unique, and explores a different date between the two characters.<br><br><u>What
      do we mean by &quot;vignette games&quot;?</u><br>In our case, the vignette games
      contained in this collection are very short, focused games. Each one illustrates
      a different moment in the characters relationship (drawing on the developers
      own experiences!). The vignette games in <i>We met in May</i> are meant to be
      brief and memorable. <br><br>These aren't massive 400 hour RPGs, so don't expect
      bazillions of hours of gameplay. In fact, only expect... an hour or less! Unless
      you want to share these at a party--then you can get lots of hours out of the
      collection by watching your friends try to pour sand directly into Jake's mouth
      in one of the vignettes called Beach Date. ;) <br><br><u>Who are these games
      for?</u><br>Everyone! But specifically, people who enjoy romantic comedy, small
      games, character-driven stories and just... funny stuff in general will probably
      enjoy this collection.
