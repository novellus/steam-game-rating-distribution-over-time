    review: "A deeply tactical and challenging roguelike that leads you through the\
      \ Aztec underworld to the realms of the gods.\n\n* Fascinating mythology and\
      \ stone-age combat aesthetic\n\n* Multiple viable combat and survival strategies.\
      \  \n\n* Highly lethal combat system that may be frustrating for the casual\
      \ gamer.  Most deaths past the very beginning will occur from incapacitating\
      \ crits (and sometimes critical fumbles); successful strategies will revolve\
      \ around mitigating risk and/or playing rocket tag with certain enemies so they\
      \ can't fight back.  Unlike many other games, hit points or health is a very\
      \ poor measure of character survivability - in comparison with defensive skills,\
      \ armor, etc.  Control of distance, visibility, light levels, and cover are\
      \ very important.  Personally, I like it; but not for everyone.\n\n* Fairly\
      \ linear game world, with one optional offshoot (to my knowledge anyway, have\
      \ gotten far but not completed the game).  HOWEVER there is ultimately a wide\
      \ variety of terrain types within that line.  Every single game level provides\
      \ a new and unique challenge (sometimes in the form of new enemy types rather\
      \ than new terrain).  Cope with freezing cold areas, sweltering heat, rivers\
      \ filled with deadly salamanders, crushing earthquakes, ferocious winds that\
      \ batter you against razor-edged rocks, giant owls with incapacitating cries.\n\
      \n* UI somewhat awkward and inconvenient - multiple key strokes needed to light\
      \ or extinguish a torch or swap weapons around; buff spells may have a short\
      \ duration and need to be manually refreshed on a frequent basis.\n\n"
