If you are a bullet hell expert this game probably won't challenge you, but otherwise the lack of bombs, boost etc. and the simple controls makes this a good option for entry to mid skill levels, especially if you're new to twin stick shooters, have limited movement or just don't have the twitch skills of a teenager anymore.\n\nApart from multipliers and points, the only pickups I've seen are weapon up, a one-hit shield (like Super Stardust) and the occasional 'temporary rapid stream'. The pickups spawn randomly at regular intervals, regardless of if you've shot anything, and enemies don't appear until you shoot the asteroids which may be exploited by playing 'pacifist' until powered up, which can be seen as good or bad depending on your skill and whether a pure high score attack appeals to you, i.e. the game is harder if you try to shoot everything straight away.\n\nMy only real gripe is the pause menu doesn't actually pause the game, but just lets you quit or restart, and the menu controls with the left stick (no D-Pad) feels a bit loose like a steam/DS4 input mapper but in game it's fine. The music is very limited, but put on something from Mixcloud in the background and you can get in the zone with this game, if only it was in HDR for that authentic high contrast vector look.","timestamp_created":1593294207,"timestamp_updated":1593294207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gYfv+/ICc+/qkAI="}
