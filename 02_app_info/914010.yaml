      give you a lot of fun!</h2><br><strong><i>In Train Station Renovation you play
      as a renovation company specialised in restoring railway stations. The game
      is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small
      rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations
      in metropolitan areas. The game is divided into 10 maps (stations) which gradually
      teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments.
      Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment
      to bring it back to life. </i></strong><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/914010/extras/map.gif?t=1608752315"

      difficulty depends on the player's commitment. The game can be very demanding
      if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be
      perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply
      have a good time. In such a case, you only need to complete half the planned
      tasks to advance to the next stage.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/914010/extras/scanning.gif?t=1608752315"

      are many tools and options for repairing and decorating the station. Work with
      basic items such as paint rollers, spray cans, crowbars and repair wrenches
      or use your in-game tablet to order new materials and items. Some stations will
      even allow you to repair and renovate the old trains. This means you will be
      able to take care of the technical condition of those vehicles yourself.<br><br><br><img
