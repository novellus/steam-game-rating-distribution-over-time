{"1266410":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Climb","steam_appid":1266410,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"In Climb, you take control of a semi aware ball whose sole purpose is to reach the glowing objective at the end of each level. The idea is simple, but the physics present unforeseen challenges. After the learning curve, you'll take on increasingly challenging levels across multiple stages. Each stage is unique in theme and contains multiple levels. Start with the tutorial to learn the controls, and then you’re off! Replay the levels to beat your high score. Take on one challenge after another and try not to get frustrated in the process. The first stage is “The Basics”. There are ten levels to challenge you and many ways to reach the end. Then comes the next stage, “Light Out”, which will challenge your ability to navigate the environment when light becomes a more valuable resource. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAs my first ever game I’m not sure how to present it other than to say that I enjoy it and my friends say it’s great.","about_the_game":"In Climb, you take control of a semi aware ball whose sole purpose is to reach the glowing objective at the end of each level.

However, the physics have been tweaked to make it more interesting. Most likely falling under the category of simple but aggravating, this game will have you repeatedly clicking restart in an attempt to score better.","supported_languages":"English","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1266410\/header.jpg?t=1596657354","website":"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/view\/climbgame\/home","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7 or Higher<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 1.7GHz Dual Core CPU<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Intel Iris Graphics 540<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 1 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"developers":["Travis Biancardi"],"publishers":["Travis Biancardi"],"price_overview":{"currency":"USD","initial":99,"final":99,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"$0.99"},"packages":[440467],"package_groups":[{"name":"default","title":"Buy Climb","description":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","save_text":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","subs":[{"packageid":440467,"percent_savings_text":" ","percent_savings":0,"option_text":"Climb - $0.99","option_description":"","can_get_free_license":"0","is_free_license":false,"price_in_cents_with_discount":99}]}],"platforms":{"windows":true,"mac":false,"linux":false},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"}],"genres":[{"id":"4","description":"Casual"},{"id":"23","description":"Indie"}],"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1266410\/ss_d4e3674fdf1420f6454b02c860933acc764e2876.600x338.jpg?t=1596657354","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1266410\/ss_d4e3674fdf1420f6454b02c860933acc764e2876.1920x1080.jpg?t=1596657354"},{"id":1,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1266410\/ss_c73fef69089037b056092ae70cdbfc73713bf74a.600x338.jpg?t=1596657354","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1266410\/ss_c73fef69089037b056092ae70cdbfc73713bf74a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1596657354"},{"id":2,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1266410\/ss_830df31667a3a034b73f9229546c5e580b49f881.600x338.jpg?t=1596657354","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1266410\/ss_830df31667a3a034b73f9229546c5e580b49f881.1920x1080.jpg?t=1596657354"},{"id":3,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1266410\/ss_99c6bb888afd8c294e6106375fa75ffbaf2edec5.600x338.jpg?t=1596657354","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1266410\/ss_99c6bb888afd8c294e6106375fa75ffbaf2edec5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1596657354"},{"id":4,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1266410\/ss_1cb51f4ce434c6211ee82e03645b390b846b93f3.600x338.jpg?t=1596657354","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1266410\/ss_1cb51f4ce434c6211ee82e03645b390b846b93f3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1596657354"}],"movies":[{"id":256778703,"name":"Trailer","thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256778703\/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1596073598","webm":{"480":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256778703\/movie480_vp9.webm?t=1596073598","max":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256778703\/movie_max_vp9.webm?t=1596073598"},"mp4":{"480":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256778703\/movie480.mp4?t=1596073598","max":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256778703\/movie_max.mp4?t=1596073598"},"highlight":true}],"release_date":{"coming_soon":false,"date":"Jul 29, 2020"},"support_info":{"url":"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/view\/climbgame\/home","email":""},"background":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1266410\/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1596657354","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null}}}}
