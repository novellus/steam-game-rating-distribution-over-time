    review: 'I''m always looking for a new card game to play. I came across this right
      as it was being launch. I was not impressed. You have zero choices in the cards
      coming into play. You Build a deck and then its an auto play, As in the computer
      plays the cards from your deck not you. There is a lot of Luck involved in this
      game. After every battle that you lose you will be forced to wait a period of
      time before you will be able to play again. The artwork is nice and some of
      the cards have special abilities but i see too many problems coming from other
      players in the long run for me to be able to continue to play this for very
      long. It has Potential to be good but its not there at this time. Im thankful
      this was a free game. Good luck to the other players. 3/10 rating


      Please follow me at One on One Gamers. As a curator I am looking for help from
      you wonderful people on steam to make my reviews better. Follow, comment, support,
      win games.'
