    review: 'I actually kind of enjoyed my time with this game. It has an interesting
      overworld system not usually seen in RPGs that allows for some alright puzzles,
      and the RPG elements, though very standard, are still fun.


      That said, I can''t recommend it. I liked it a bit because I like RPGs, but
      the average player probably will not. The first thing of note is that the gameplay
      is sort of eclipsed by everything else. The story is okay, if a little confusing
      and cliche, but a lot of players will probably be put off by the cringeworthy
      dialogue, terrible art, stolen monster designs, and wholly unnecessary sexual
      themes. I mean, I get it if you want to play a porn game, but this isn''t even
      a porn game. There''s no sex, there''s just a developer who inserts his own
      sexual desires and fantasies into a video game. If you''re embarrassed by that
      one socially awkward weeb kid in high school, this game will make you cringe.


      A lot of players will be made uncomfortable enough by all of that they won''t
      be able to enjoy the gameplay, which is why I consider it secondary. If the
      above doesn''t bother you, though, then you''ll find a game with alright gameplay.
      There was clearly not much effort put into design. There are only a few monsters
      you can fight in each level, but there''s no distinction in the way you approach
      them. You will fight them all the exact same way. The difference is that some
      are radically easier than others, so once you''ve learned their patterns, the
      game basically becomes learning how to only encounter the right enemies so you
      can repeat the exact same process enough to grind for the boss. The bosses are
      usually challenging enough that fighting them is actually exciting and pretty
      fun, but the rest of the gameplay is very samey. Unless you''re a hardcore RPG
      fan, I wouldn''t recommend this one.'
