    review: 'tl;dr This is a phenomenal game with a lazy, low-effort port. If you
      look past the lack of options, a pause button, and other conveniences often
      given to other FMV ported games, you''ll find that the actual game itself is
      a very memorable experience.


      While it shows on here that I don''t have much playtime, I actually played the
      original cabinet at Galloping Ghost Arcade (GGA) many times. I genuinely think
      it''s a one of a kind experience, and I''m very grateful for all the work people
      put into resurrecting this game and giving it new life.


      Most of my bitterness regarding this port comes from just an overall lack of
      effort. After playing the cabinet at GGA, it''s abundantly clear that the devs
      put as little effort as possible to simply get this on the store. There are
      no options to change volume levels, resolution, or include subtitles. Furthermore,
      there is NO pause button whatsoever in the game. If something comes up and you
      gotta pause, your run is as good as dead.


      GGA had a great opportunity here to take the original material and really spruce
      it up with some quality of life features, but rather, the port just seems like
      a cash grab used to exploit the previous arcade exclusive nature of the game.
      Given the nature of choose your own adventure-esque games like this, it SORELY
      needed a restart feature or some form of save states. You have to go through
      the drawn out ending sequence every time,  making it take upwards of a minute
      simply to just restart the game.


      All these complaints aside, credit REALLY needs to be given to Brian Colin for
      creating this one of a kind experience. The whole thing reeks of B-movie vibes,
      and it''s certainly a good thing. The writing and loads of possibilities will
      keep you coming back for more, and each encounter you make in the mansion REALLY
      stands out from each other.


      If you get past the lazy port efforts made by GGA, I''m sure you''ll find this
      to be quite the gem of a game.'
