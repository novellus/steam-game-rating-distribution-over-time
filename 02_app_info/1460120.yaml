    short_description: In Torchance 6, up to 4 players can take on the task of managing
      all aspects of a football club.Unlike other football management games, you can
      easily complete a season in less than 60 minutes if you wish. This makes this
      game ideal for a quick round or two when you only have a few spare minutes.
