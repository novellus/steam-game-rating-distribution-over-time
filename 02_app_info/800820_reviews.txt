This VN is overflown with sexual violence in all forms, mostly played for laughs, or at least taken as if it’s not a big deal. And all the “deep philosophical meaning” it supposed to have (which is of course an incomprehensible mess of early 20-th centaury ”emotions are corporeal!!” occult parapsychology and poorly red  \n[strike] Wittgenstein [/strike] wiki article about Wittgenstein, covered under 999+ layers of sci fi-ish technobabble) couldn’t – and, honestly, shouldn’t – change that. \nAnd that is honestly even not the worst thing about this VN.\nWhat actually scares the hell out of me, is that literally non of the other reviewers cared to mention this in their reviews. Including the guy from “Christ Centered Gamer”.","timestamp_created":1606956759,"timestamp_updated":1606957548,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.455769628286361694","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnsiIk/YCfaLxtgI="}
