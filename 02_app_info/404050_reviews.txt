Take 2 minutes to learn the controls, then take the rest of the day to master killing your friends.  Not hard.  Just very, very fun.  A fantastic couch party game.  My kids and I have more fun with this than with stick fight.","timestamp_created":1609370590,"timestamp_updated":1609370590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws8v92vYCe7j3vgI="}
