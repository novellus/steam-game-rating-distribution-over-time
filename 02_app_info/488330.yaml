    review: 'The game itself is decent, it is a scrolling twin stick shooter, the
      graphics and overall polish of the game are a little on the cheap side, but
      nothing that can''t be overlooked.  The premise is simple enough, one stick
      moves, one strick aims and you have a shot, super shot(that charges pretty quickly),
      a dash, and a phase.  When you are phasing you are totally invincible but you
      cannot damage enemies so you will phase through bullets and have to phase back
      in in order to damage the enemies.


      Each level is decently long, roughly 20-25 minutes and have several bosses with
      an end boss consisting of several phases.  I enjoyed my short time with this
      game, but I cannot recommend it because of one simple fatal flaw:  no save feature.  The
      game has 5 levels, the 2 I played each took about 25 minutes, so assuming you
      don''t die(and assuming all levels are roughly the same length) you could beat
      the game in roughly 2 hours.  I did not know there was no save feature when
      I started, so I played campaign, beat the first level and went off to do other
      things.


      I came back later, hit campaign and was put back to level 1, I noticed there
      was a level select option so I checked that out.  Level 1 and 2 were unlocked,
      no big deal, I figured I could start at level 2 and go from there.  So I select
      level 2, play through the whole thing and upon beating the level I am put back
      in the level select screen with nothing else unlocked.  At that point I lost
      all desire to play this game.


      This is 2017, there is no excuse to not have a save feature in a game like this.  I
      played the game for about an hour, did not die once, and all of that progress
      just seems wasted.'
