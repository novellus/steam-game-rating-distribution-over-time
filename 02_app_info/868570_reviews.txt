Three crashes later only 40 mins into me playing it, enemies taking way to many hits (even on normal) with little ammo to be found, and the fact that I have to shoot the cats to save my game, I think I will have to pass on this title.  With a little more polish, balancing and a different save system, this came can be great.","timestamp_created":1603083208,"timestamp_updated":1603083208,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538369297981262207","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1JDNn/UCeMLiqAI="}
