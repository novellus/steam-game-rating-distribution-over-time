    about_the_game: "Melody is a musical VR experience in which the user plays the\
      \ African / Central American instrument: marimba, in different environments;\
      \ merging creativity with the presence of VR simulation.  A low latency audio\
      \ engine allows for players to experience very little lag and jitter in their\
      \ audio experience.  We focused on creating a simulation instrument that is\
      \ both expressive and realistic.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike with the physical\
      \ instrument, players can play with a combination of soft and hard mallets and\
      \ currently the experiences supports play with up to 4 mallets (two per hand).\
      \   There are also other features common to a musical workstation including\
      \ a metronome, 4 track recording / playback, velocity and resonance sensitivity\
      \ in the keys.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are currently 3 levels to choose from.\
      \  The Enchanted Forest is a fanciful forest scene where musical play generates\
      \ excitement in the wildlife and the trees.  The Practice Room is a true-to-life\
      \ music room that serves a great sterile environment where one can focus and\
      \ hone their skills.  Lastly, The Tron Room is a futuristic environment that\
      \ makes for a dynamic performance arena."

    short_description: Melody currently features one of the most expressive instruments
      in VR. From resonance sensitivity to 4 track audio recording, this experience
      pushes the boundaries on what we expect from performance / composition in VR.

    review: Melody is awesome!  A gorgeous colorful environment with a responsive
      Marimba setup, great fun for kids and adults.  Really impressed with the ergonomic
      and accessibility tweaks the dev made to ensure it's comfortably playable for
      all.
