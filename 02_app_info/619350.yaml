    review: 'Sandra and Woo in the Cursed Adventure is a massive pain in the ass.
      It looks like a fun adventure game, but it is very much from the bad old days
      of adventure games where the puzzles are pretty much impossible without a walkthrough.
      Good news, you can get the walkthrough as free DLC! Bad news, that still doesn''t
      help you get past the infuriating minigames and several other trial and error
      puzzles whose solutions are not documented.


      This is not a fun game. Some adventures (notably Daedalic) can get away with
      having very obscure puzzles because the comedy is so good that it becomes part
      of the game to combine all the things with all the other things and hear the
      amusing responses. If the dialog is really good, you can get hints about how
      to actually solve the puzzle from the failed attempts. But that is not the case
      here. There are no hints what to do. Even something as simple as combining the
      right items in the wrong order doesn''t provide a custom response saying "maybe
      you should combine X with Y first", it just gives some iteration of "you can''t
      do that". What little comedy is there doesn''t work for me at all. The dialog
      is tedious to click through and it never comes up with any clever or unique
      gags.


      I persisted for almost 7 hours on this game hoping it might get funnier or less
      frustrating, but it really didn''t. Finally, near the end, when I was presented
      with yet another trial and error section that the walkthrough didn''t explain
      how to pass, I gave up. I am a hardcore point and click adventure fan but I
      can''t really see how anyone would enjoy this game. Maybe if you dig the comic
      that it''s based on then the comedy will work for you, but the puzzles are really
      too much. Nowadays there are so many better adventure games, this one isn''t
      really worth the time or money.'
