    about_the_game: "Chaos Dwarfs are the twisted descendants of Dwarf explorers who\
      \ have been terribly affected by the forces of Chaos, turning them into evil,\
      \ self-centered creatures. In one way they haven\u2019t changed at all, they\
      \ still love playing Blood Bowl! They are joined by the legendary star-player\
      \ Zzharg Madeye.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chaos Dwarfs are defence-oriented team,\
      \ benefiting from the great velocity of their bull centaur retrievers and from\
      \ a very powerful front line that can endure (and apply) a lot of pressure.\
      \ Also, one of their strongest characteristics is that powerful players, like\
      \ bull centaurs, unlock their powerful skills very quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe main weakness of the Chaos Dwarfs stands in their poor ball-handling skills.\
      \ Indeed, due to their tiny size and low agility, they have to rely on hobgoblins\
      \ in order to push the game forward. Hobgoblins are quite agile, but are also\
      \ very prone to getting crushed by any opponent."

    review: "I was skeptical at first cause I just didn't know if I'd like em. But\
      \ after playing a few matches, they're beasts on the field. The game says they're\
      \ difficult but in reality they're super easy and fun to play. They hit hard,\
      \ and can take a hit like a champ. I got 22 armor breaks and a Hob Gob leveled\
      \ up on my first match with no outs.  (Course it was against Vampires so that\
      \ isn't too much to brag about.) \n\nIf you're wondering if this is a good enjoyable\
      \ team, it is. And you're gonna be bashing heads like no tomorrow."
