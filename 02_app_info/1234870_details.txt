You are the law here and only your game rules apply.<br>Create elaborate traps, fake accidents, provoke fights and develop your empire. Don’t be afraid to think outside the box and don’t blow your cover! Your shady customers are just waiting for a mistake.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Undercover killer<\/h2>You’re a professional assassin working both as a freelancer and on your own initiative. The hotel you run is your cover, and no one has any idea what awaits them there. Every customer is a dangerous individual, unfit to live in a society. As the head of the hotel, you can play cat and mouse by hunting criminals and psychos and arranging inventive accidents. Be efficient. It’s your job.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gather information<\/h2>A good hotel boss always knows how to take care of his guests. Receive them at the reception, learn about them using the System and assign them to appropriate rooms. Observe their daily routines, find out when they leave their room and what routines they follow. Choose from many possible approaches to make the most accurate action plan possible. As the owner of your establishment, you have access to its every corner. Use it to your advantage.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Be swift<\/h2>The sooner the better. Create your action plan and get to work. Customers don't stay at the hotel forever, so you need to terminate them before they leave. When time is of the essence, you need to keep a cool head. You’ll find various useful items in the area, but you will also encounter less functional ones, which will needlessly grab your attention. Want to set a trap for a gangster inside his room? You need to know when you can get in without raising suspicion. Often every moment counts.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Workshop<\/h2>As the boss, you have an office and hidden spots no one else can access. Once in your workshop, you can feel at ease. You’ll be able to plan your every step, build the needed traps and order items online, all without suspicion. What's more, you have free access to the System, which allows you to learn every customer’s secrets.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The System<\/h2>A real professional knows where to find useful information and identify the weaknesses in his goals. When using your computer, you'll have access to police files, psychological profiles and other information on criminals staying under your roof.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stay cautious<\/h2>Not every guest is predictable. Some may act instinctively and break out of their routines. If you’re caught red-handed during a murder, others will know. Then they may escape or attack you in a group.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plan and build<\/h2>You are free to decide how to get rid of your targets. Your workshop guarantees many options for building useful items and traps - silent, loud and explosive contraptions. Once you learn your customer’s routines, you need to decide how to act. Will, you set a snare trap in their own room? Push them off the stairs and pretend it was an accident? Silently eliminate them in their sleep, or blow them to bits using a grenade hidden in the bedside table? Or maybe you’ll decide to incite a gang war and watch your masterpiece of destruction from a safe distance?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Main features:<\/h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Absurd humour. Observe the daily quirks of your customers and initiate your own crazy scenarios.<br><\/li><li>Unconventional gameplay combining elements from several genres.
