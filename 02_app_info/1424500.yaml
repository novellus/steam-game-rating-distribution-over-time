    review: 'The game is great, After reading the intro, that yes, it is a bit long,
      but I do feel curious about finding out more. The gameplay is really enjoyable,
      the game mechanics are very well implemented, and the controls feel responsive,
      which is important because it is not an easy platformer as it might seem from
      the trailer.


      The graphics are a tad unrefined, even compared to similar graphic styles like
      Stardew Valley. What''s interesting is the soundtrack which sounds 16bit, I''m
      pretty sure is by design, and it works so well with the game.'
