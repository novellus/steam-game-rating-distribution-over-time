    review: 'Dear Steam,


      Please remove this game from my account and refund my money.

      I did not realize this game is a vr only game.

      And I do not own a oculus rift.


      Please point out to all customers that this games is VR ONLY!!


      Thanks in advance!


      Raymond'
