    review: "This is an old-school hidden object game, meaning that it's a collection\
      \ of repeated scenes with random assortment of objects and a very rudimentary\
      \ story. These games are meant to play as a casual relaxing experience, and\
      \ this is where this game fails, since it imposes a time limit (which is very\
      \ easy to circumvent with screenshots, etc, so it's annoying and ultimately\
      \ meaningless). Using time limits is a game design failure in my book -- I don't\
      \ play games to have another deadline-related stress (I've got work for that),\
      \ so this game gets a No from me. \n\nPS. BTW, if you happen to click through\
      \ all items on a level too fast, you might get stuck without ability to invoke\
      \ the mini-game that gets you another puzzle peace, and there's no solution\
      \ for this. Sucks if you completed almost the whole game already (which happened\
      \ to me)."
