It's a shame they couldn't include it as it was one of my favorite levels from the Sega version. \nAside from that, game is good, I would still recommend buying or emulating the Playstation / Saturn version of Earthworm Jim 2. But if you don't have enough money to order an old CD online or don't want to resort to piracy then get this game on Steam.","timestamp_created":1609712124,"timestamp_updated":1609712124,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhriU5fYCd6SbwAI="}
