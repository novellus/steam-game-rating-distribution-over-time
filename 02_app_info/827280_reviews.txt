Much to explore and do around the lab. I learned about what can be made with 3D printers and other machines. My favorite part was flying the drone, it was realistic in how it flies, almost like my real drone!\n\nIt really enjoyed the web browser inside the game because I can put videos on youtube on the big screen, so I could watch them and listen to music while playing.\n\nLooks like a useful tool for educators, I look forward to seeing what's to come next.\n\nI recommend!","timestamp_created":1537419425,"timestamp_updated":1537469628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5peV/OUCf5iCqwE="}
