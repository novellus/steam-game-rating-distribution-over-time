    about_the_game: "Welcome to Demonic Guest VR.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayer position\
      \ should be sorted out from current update, if not please let us know! NOTE:\
      \ It is important with the HTC Vive to stay within the blue circle in the headset\
      \ for the best experience <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDGVR is designed to be an horror\
      \ experience, this means there are NO controls, you enter the game a look around\
      \ and try to survive the night.<br />\r\nCreated in VR for the HTC Vive and\
      \ Oculus Rift we put you in the room, where things are happening and there is\
      \ nothing you can do about it!.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story : <br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nYou wake in the night, strange things have been happening around your\
      \ house and you have no idea what is lurking, is something coming for you? you\
      \ have no idea.<br />\r\nTonight is the night, you are locked in your room what\
      \ will happen, is there an escape? so many unanswered questions and so little\
      \ time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe experience is in Early Access at the moment and\
      \ runs for around 8 minutes. Although this time is short we are committed to\
      \ updating on a regular basis adding new content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn each\
      \ update we move closer to adding controller support and a means of physically\
      \ moving around the house essentially creating 2 games for a low price.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nWe would like to thank everyone who has purchased this experience\
      \ and welcome any reviews good or bad as its YOU who will help shape this experience\
      \ and upcoming game."
