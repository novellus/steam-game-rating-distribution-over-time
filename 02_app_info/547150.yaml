    review: 'Not being able to save a game and come back to it is an automatic thumbs
      down. Yeah, interesting graphics and a few interesting elements, but it''s light
      on puzzles and did I mention that you can''t save it? It''s almost worth the
      99 cents I paid for it.


      Update: Fatal flaw no. 2 is that the "puzzle" that opens the door to Chapter
      2 is, for me, impossible. The puzzle, like all the rest (few as they are) is
      simplistic and obvious, but it turns out that not only must one figure out the
      order, one must be able to do it within an extremely short period of time. That
      makes it not a puzzle, but a test of manual dexterity. I''ve come across other
      such games made with this horrible Unity software, where the developer thinks
      it''s amusing to make performing the solution to the puzzle nearly impossible.
      Please, developers, make solving the puzzle the hurdle, not whether one can
      move one''s mouse quick enough. And even if I were able to get the solution
      performed, there''s no way to save this game, so if I had to quit for a while,
      I''d have to suffer through the whole thing again.


      Another issue I have this Unity thing is that the little tiny dot with which
      you aim the cursor is all but invisible. Why is that necessary?'
