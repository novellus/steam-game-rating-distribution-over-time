The review is based on current gameplay (It will be updated later).\n\nA young teenager named Kazuya Nanami lies on a snowy ground, reminiscing about his dull life and his closest friends while he tries to escape the forest. The boy’s leg is in perfect condition, but how is that possible? Kazuya knows the place is fictional because he’s supposed to be somewhere else. AT HOME. A trail of footprints leads him to a lake where he sees a beautiful girl singing with a single cloth. The unnamed person recognizes Kazuya, kisses him, and disappears. Is she human?\n\nKazuya’s world Episode 1- Waking up in his bed, Kazuya can’t remember whether it was a dream. He checks his computer and discovers people are committing suicide in his town. What’s causing them to die? You are introduced to Kazuya’s friends: Playboy Rei and Childish Miu. Childhood crush Ibuki hasn’t been in school due to medical reasons. There isn’t much information about those deaths either. In this episode, you’ll learn what happened to Kazuya’s leg and how he has changed since the incident. Some comedic scenes were uninteresting because it dragged. There are several scenes without any sound. It seems to be intentional according to the developer. \n\nI completed the first episode. In my opinion, I thought this wasn’t a good start. The visual novel has a great prologue, but it tends to fall flat with unnecessary boring scenes. I kept reading to give it a chance. I still want to know who the mystery girl is. Features include Japanese voice acting, decent artwork, and background music. You can’t make choices. Would I recommend it? No. My review might change once I finish it.\n\nEdit Review: After reading a bit further into the visual novel, I decided to keep the negative review. There are different perspectives of the characters' stories. You will encounter references from famous works, but it's rather awkward. I felt like it wasn't needed, and I was losing interest. You don't want to bore your audience with dull scenes. I can’t give it a positive rating. Definitely not recommended.","timestamp_created":1593321841,"timestamp_updated":1594611580,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.630692780017852783","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxreQo/MCfYb2kAI="}
