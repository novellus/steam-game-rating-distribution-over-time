The reward/upgrade system really limits what you can play without feeling like you're playing a chore.\n\nEDIT: Having played a bit more since my review (which I stand by), I have two suggestions to improve the game (and would change my review to a recommend). (1) Improve score to pearls ratio. (2) Increase the conversion rate options between pearls and gold (100 is too small when you're expected to farm 1000s of pearls).\n\nEDIT 2 (this will be my last, I promise): Having played a bit of survival now, I've noticed two things, which I think are bad for the game. (1) As you buy upgrades for your fish, your rewards get WORSE each game. (2) There is zero difference in reward between survival mode difficulties.\n\nIt's a nice game, but the demoralising grind hampers the purpose.","timestamp_created":1575872690,"timestamp_updated":1576564279,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47bijie8CfrWR4wE="}
