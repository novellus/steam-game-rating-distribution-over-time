Unfortunately there is a mini-game with the random events that is nearly impossible to play. These have resulted in frustration, and inevitable game failure when the negative consequences of those failures resolve in the main game. Until those mini-games are fixed or replaced with a better mechanic, I can't recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1589138060,"timestamp_updated":1589138060,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrs6AgPICeOzzhgI="}
