I suspect if the fan base picks up we should see mods expand this game further. And speaking of expanding what I would like to see is more end game content, like say build a rocket on the surface and fly home or to a different planet or moon.\nThe possibilities are there and I bet this game in its finished state will be just as enjoyable, if not more.\n","timestamp_created":1609346791,"timestamp_updated":1609406459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4x7WG3PYCcObpvgI="}
