I think it was listed as compatible back when I purchased it. I got in the game normally, and couldn't get past the main menu; for some reason the buttons just don't work. I'd be angrier if I didn't know the struggle of testing many different expensive platforms for such an inexpensive & apparently simple game. I will definitely update this review if I'm made aware the Oculus situation changes.","timestamp_created":1583647120,"timestamp_updated":1583647120,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqKuu3PACf9/i9gE="}
