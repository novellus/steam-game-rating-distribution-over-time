    review: 'This is an OK game.

      You play as an Arbiter...some sort of godly judge. So you must judge different
      cases from execution to stalker.

      Sounds interesting....now comes the downside. For judgement you have to interview
      2 or 3 persons. Still intersting....only that the results of your judgement
      have little influence to the game.

      In fact there are only a few cases with impact to the game. The other just drop
      or rise your fame, the peace or the economy..consequences? A few coins less
      for items you buy and

      the items may on sale.

      The world...you travel via waypoints on the worldmap. Each waypoint you must
      first visit and fight your way to the exit. After that you can skip it or visit
      it again for grinding.

      Now for fighting. Your party consist of up to 3 members. During your judgements
      some people join your crusade.

      You can change them at any time. Even those not active gain exp...but not much.

      Evert person has one weapon *not changeable*  one armor and 2 support items.
      Also each member has 3 skills.

      You can enchant the skill with up to 2 orbs. And if you chose the right skills
      in a fight you can get a chain combo at you next turn. The fights are usually
      not very demanding. Of course you level up....stats+ but not your skill points.

      After each level up you get full health and skill points.

      Money....you will need it...lots of it. Because you must pay for updating your
      weapon. Each weapon can be updated 50 times....some new members comes with leveled
      up weapons.


      And finally you can get differnt endings...because of the few choices that matters.

      After that you can play the new game+ with the equipment and level of your characters.

      edit:

      ok, I did it....played the game till every ending....and it was real boring.

      The path is just a little different each time and you can fight some extra bosses.

      But they are easy. Just use sleep and poisen and they don''t even get a single
      hit on you.'
