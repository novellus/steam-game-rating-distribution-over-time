    short_description: Faceted Flight is a stylized stunt flight game designed to
      deliver the thrill of flight. Take control of the Hover Jet and challenge ghost
      racers in Ring Attack or just relax and explore Free Flight....or you could
      always hop into the cockpit of the Jump Seat and give Target Practice a try.
      What are you waiting for? Do a barrel roll.

    review: "This game is fantastic, but still Early Access. \n\nThere is not yet\
      \ support for the touch devices, just Xbox pad for now. The pad controls are\
      \ perfect though.\n\nThe GFX and sound are old-school, but that's what I like.\
      \ The 3D immersion is fantastic, you can really make use of full cockpit view\
      \ when you need to roll, loop and else in order to catch balls. It's a genuine\
      \ pleasure to swerve between trees, and to feel sick when you manoeuver close\
      \ to a mountain. You really feel volumes, that's what VR was meant for, and\
      \ few VR games give you such good feelings.\n\nThe early access part is the\
      \ big drawback for this game. You may either fly freely in a few maps, or 'race'\
      \ in some others. The race part seems unfinished and pointless for now, let's\
      \ hope it will develop, and the whole game as well.\n\nFor this price, I'm still\
      \ happy to have what I have, but let's hope it will grow on this very encouraging\
      \ basis."
