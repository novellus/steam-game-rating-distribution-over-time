      \ the \u201Cpotion\u201D but accidentally used it on himself because he was\
      \ testing his suit and is now stuck in the microworld. Sonya uses his notes\
      \ to recreate the \u201Cpotion\u201D as well as 2 additional doses for bringing\
      \ him back to normal size. The only problem that bothers her is that she doesn\u2019\

      \ small, and goes into the carpet on the floor..."
