As this is the last part of the alternative story I will summarize the whole thing. Overall the abilities are fun and balanced as they drain your health and you need to calculate when to use what. But even with these the fighting is inevitable and becomes grindy. While in the main game you fight smaller groups, you will always have a big bunch coming at you here and it gets repetitive. The third DLC is a bit more polished than the second but it still is buggy and glitchy. The story itself does not take that much time, even with 100% constraints. There are side-missions and chests to collect but these do not add really much to the game. I liked the idea of the story but the poor implementation of mechanics apart from a few moments makes this DLC a sale item and not really worth the full price. You get the BEAR special ability in this DLC and it is set in the New York, it has an Aquila missions and that is always great. But buying this DLC separately is nonsense because you have to buy the other 2 DLCs to make sense of the story. This DLC is part of both the Season Pass and the Deluxe Edition of AC3 so you could possibly get it through there.\n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] To activate the DLC, write down the CD-key Steam shows you (you cannot copy+paste it), start the game, go to Extras and then to Redeem Code (if it does not work go to uPlay and redeem the code there too), restart the game.\n\n[b][u]*Note: No longer possible to buy.
