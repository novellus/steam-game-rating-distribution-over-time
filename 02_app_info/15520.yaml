      [quote] PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if
      the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended
      it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing
      this game [/quote]


      AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity is a game developed and published
      by Dejobaan Games, LLC


      The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there,
      it is pleasant all the same


      AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity overall, however, is an okay game
      to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is an okay-ish
      to meh casual action game and to play in short bursts


      [h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]
