    review: "Unplayable mess. I can live with plain ugly graphics but not when it's\
      \ the best part of the game nevertheless.\n\nIt's not souls-like at all (it\
      \ was the reason why I bought it) because there are no souls/experience, no\
      \ leveling, no char stats, no inventory, no stamina, no death run ... no nothing.\n\
      \nThere are parcur elements which you will repeat tens of times each because\
      \ of how poorly they are designed. It's necessary to hit very small objects\
      \ during jumps, double jumps and/or free fall, hit them under very specific\
      \ angle and at the same time rotate camera in three dimensions (while the screen\
      \ is shaking and/or tilting). And you have to hit several objects in a row (sometimes\
      \ around the corner) or repeat the whole sequence from beginning. And no, it's\
      \ not getting any better using mouse+keyboard instead of gamepad.\n\nCombat\
      \ is also bad. At least during Chapter 1 (there are three Chapters total but\
      \ I have no intention to go on) there are only two weapons. When there is only\
      \ one enemy you can stun-lock him to death using basic attack. When there are\
      \ more you can theoretically kill them almost instantly using special attacks\
      \ (which drain your health and also replenish it) but the controls are unnecessarily\
      \ complicated. One key to draw a weapon (which drains fixed portion of life,\
      \ brilliant idea which leads to automatic sheath of weapon during fights, which\
      \ is also brilliant idea), another one to power it up (which immediately constantly\
      \ drains your health) another one for locking opponent (which sometimes works\
      \ and sometimes not and when not you are almost instantly killed by your own\
      \ weapon when it's powered up), yet another one for special attack. The second\
      \ big problem is how unresponsive main character is (especially dodging is completely\
      \ useless during fights).\n\nGame is also plagued with lots of glitches. Sometimes\
      \ during parcur it's possible to stand on objects you clearly should not be\
      \ able to stand on, sometimes controls lock up and you are unable to move or\
      \ camera is locked on some object behind the wall, sometimes main character\
      \ respawns with drawn weapon and sometimes with sheathed weapon and so on. \n\
      \n2/10\n\nEDIT: Finished, mainly thanks to the speedrun video at\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Va7Xrl4yeY&t=1580s\n\
      \nOne of the worst games I played in last couple of years."
