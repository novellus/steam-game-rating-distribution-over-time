The game is pretty straight foward it has a lot of choices that leds to many different love interests, but other than that it doesn't have many other things like puzzles, I think there was only one or two in the whole game, which isn't much becuase the story itself it's quite long.","timestamp_created":1608136236,"timestamp_updated":1608136236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvvOYtvYCdsXeugI="}
