    review: "For NF1 players, gotta keep hoping. I'm an old Jedi member from Navyfield\
      \ 1 and was excited to play Navyfield 2 since they first announced they were\
      \ working on it. I really enjoy fast pace strategic games, like Starcraft and\
      \ such so NF2 was on the list. \n\nTwo days into it, I have a tier 3 BB with\
      \ tier 2 DD. The complexity of NF1 is gone, same with the common public player\
      \ strategies. Everyone rushes in to the middle and it creates a bloodbath, even\
      \ ships that have far enough ranges to kite rushes in and sinks within seconds.\
      \ No one hardly speaks on chat but when someone finally did, it was to call\
      \ me a \"noob bb\" because I was the last one left vs 4 and I was kiting, I\
      \ was able to sink 3 with lots of hits on others, racking up a simple 98k damage\
      \ and coming in first place on my team at the end when I was sunk. \n\nThats\
      \ how we played in NF1(200k dmg+), with other like minded players it became\
      \ an amazingly fun mental battle. The fact that even the majority of the high\
      \ tier ships rush in to die in seconds, no dodging or weaving, probably auto\
      \ aim, possibly bots (no chat or common sense), and some just dont even shoot\
      \ back makes this games gameplay lame.  The freedom of customized ships is gone\
      \ and the community feels dead. If you miss NF1 and wanted to play like the\
      \ old times with just updated graphics, this game is not it."
