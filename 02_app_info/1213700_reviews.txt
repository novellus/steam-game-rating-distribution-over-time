The puzzles are at times difficult, especially when having to use the abilities you acquire later on in the game. I love the idea of this game, and the fox is adorable. The only thing I don't really like is that you can't save in the middle of a chapter, unless you hit a checkpoint. But overall I've really enjoyed playing it so far and may consider playing a second time to find all the hidden achievements.","timestamp_created":1609807865,"timestamp_updated":1609807865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ytSB6PYCfNDHwAI="}
