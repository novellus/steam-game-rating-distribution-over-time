When I was younger I had written a small game in Visual Basic similar to this about managing a movie theater: Buying movies, keeping snack bar stocked up, managing personnel, advertising etc.\n\nBut this game goes beyond all that incorporating elements from “The Movies” or maybe more accurately the BBS door game “Movie Mogul” (producing your own movies) and of course the fact that it visually looks like Sim Tower is kind of nice as well.\n\nI’ve only played for a short while so this review isn’t comprehensive but first impressions are good.  As with any business management game it’s slow and repetitive which some people don’t care for and sometimes I don’t care for it either but sometimes it’s exactly what I need.\n\nOne technical improvement that could be made is to have the game window (when in windowed mode with CTRL+Enter) be resizable.  I normally have my PC set up with three screens but using a driver that let’s Windows see it as all one wide screen.  Also there are monitors that are “ultra-wide”.  By default the game is full screen taking the full width and the top & bottom of the display is cut off if it’s too wide.  You can easily go into and out of windowed mode but the window is the same size as the game was when full screen and the window is not resizable.  I was able to get going by disabling my driver but other people who have one ultra-wide monitor may have an issue with this unless this is fixed.\n\nAlso note that the min. requirements says Windows 10 but I am running it fine on Windows 7.\n\nThere aren't a lot of gamers that like business management games but if you do then this one is definitely worth checking out.\n","timestamp_created":1607521149,"timestamp_updated":1607521149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hMTuo/YCfaeyuAI="}
