I Think The Timing Minigame Is Really 50/50, People Either Like It, Or Hate It. Lots Of T Posing NPC's, Animation errors, Etc. Changes to Camera Angle Would Also Be Enjoyable. Character Customization Is Quite Limited as well. If You're Looking For A Basic RPG, Look Elsewhere, This is a unique spin on it, and i love the idea, however it seems to have been executed a bit sloppily, however I do enjoy the game in it's present state, despite all the bugs and issues. As far as i can tell, the devs are working on it, and are looking to improve it. And i'll support Them! But the most glaring issue here is the janky movement / no functioning minimap outside of combat, i think if that were improved, it would be a much better game.","timestamp_created":1598611329,"timestamp_updated":1598611329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510556638240814209","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4/qGqmvQCdvSkngI="}
