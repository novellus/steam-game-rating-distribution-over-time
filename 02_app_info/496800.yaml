    review: I have to say I rather enjoyed this movie.  I dont usually watch a movie
      in a different langauge but the captions were very easy to follow and the story
      was great.  The picture quality was better than my HD tv.  If it had of been
      in english for me it would have been super.  If you like a good scare you will
      like this!
