[b]120 levels[/b] unlocked one by one, sorted into 12 packs, unlocked with a certain amount of roses. there are [b]3 difficulty settings for a change, no explanation though[/b] and couldn't find any differences either. [b]levels can be replayed separately[/b] and prices and goals are the same on each. instead of the usual interactive tutorial, a help screen can be brought up, explaining what's what on the screen.\n\ncompletion is based on two goals: [b]getting enough roses and clearing the special cards[/b]. roses are the local equivalent of stars and I couldn't figure out what's on the special cards. the level is failed if you can't manage, but whatever money got collected during the attempt is not lost. no need to clear every card, in fact, the level ends immediately when the last goal card is gone, so keep an eye on the progress bar on top if you don't want to finish prematurely with fewer roses. a minor complaint: the bar only changes after reaching a rose, not card by card, and it's not always easy to tell if the final goal card should be clicked yet or not, hoping it'd trigger the final star.\n\nmoney is only visible in the shop and can be spent on [b]power-ups[/b]. the usual +1 undo, show number of cards left, wildcard, etc. no story, and they broke the tradition, [b]backgrounds can't be viewed separately here[/b], which is a bummer, but [b]you can play dress-up in your boudoir[/b] with the items awarded for completing level packs. separate volume settings, some card customization, windowed mode and a widescreen toggle, which very elegantly expands the background to fill the screen instead of stretching everything. nice.\n\nthe presentation is fine (the curly font is a bit much), the music is repetitive again and this time a bit ill-fitting, I think. it's already kind of a poor man's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/351090]regency solitiare[/url], they could've used similarly excellent piano music too. otherwise the usual affair, nothing special but not bad, [b]took less than 3 hours[/b] to 3-star every level.","timestamp_created":1608575323,"timestamp_updated":1608575323,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60340350866317749","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t/Gjw/YCctT/uwI="}
