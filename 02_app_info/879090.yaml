    review: This is advertised as a 'mini sequel' to Existential Kitty Cat RPG and
      tbh I preferred Existential Kitty Cat RPG. While it starts out interesting and
      isn't too bad overall, I don't like how long the fights take, the music feels
      a little watered down, the controller acts even more janky and the SPAG needs
      even more work. Also less random bizarre names for things.
