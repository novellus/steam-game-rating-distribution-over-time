    review: 'I''m sure I played this many years ago directly from Big Fish, and that
      it ended up back in my Steam collection as part of a bundle, because it had
      a played time of nothing.


      But it''s still a very solid HoG. I actually found some of the puzzles rather
      hard; back then they expected you to work a bit more to earn progress! Fortunately,
      with a few hints from the Strategy Guide even the hardest ones are solvable
      without a skip. Although putting the skip button so close the the Guide button
      led to me skipping more than one by accident.


      I also kept forgetting (literally every time I restarted the game) that [spoiler]you
      sometimes need to use items from your inventory to complete the hidden object
      puzzles[/spoiler]. This is pretty unusual, and can lead to a few situations
      where progress seems completely blocked.


      The story is better than many of the genre, with the dialog and voice acting
      (mostly) pretty decent too. The protagonists especially is quite well-rounded
      and shows a fair bit of emotion (for the genre; the bar has been set pretty
      low by a lot of other HoGs).


      The graphics seemed slightly blurry in places, and certainly there are prettier
      games out there. But they never fell below ''easily good enough''. The cut-scenes
      were the only bits I felt were sub-par, but this is forgivable; I''d rather
      more time/resources be spent on the rest of the game.


      The bonus chapter is pretty solid too, and for a change seems more than just
      a bolt-on afterthought knocked up just so there can be a ''collectors edition.''


      Overall; definitely a worthy addition to any HoG fan''s collection.'
