While I was satisfied with how things ended, I wish there was more.\nAlmost no voice acting.\n\nLong explanation:\nI really liked the story. While the typos did show up here and there, and there was practically non-existent voice acting, I still enjoyed the story, and the graphics (along with the music) were a definite bonus to that; seeing the characters changing their expressions according to what is being said rather than only changing their expression when they start talking is very nice. The only real complaint (the typos are a minor complaint, I could deal with them as I was reading) is that it felt too short, and while I enjoyed the romance, I wish there were more routes available (Youmu Konpaku fan here). \nSomething I noticed, you can actually see things happen that the characters themselves don't notice, as in something happens that they don't realize until later, but you get to see happen as they are traveling, a touch that I didn't always see in the games I've played. \n\nI won't give a something/10, but I still really liked the story, and can feel that I will come back to it even after having seen the end just to see some of the funnier scenes again (along with that final scene, really heart warming). If only the developers could add routes for some of the other characters, and maybe add some more content to Reimu's route, like after the final scene. Still, this makes me wish even more to be able to see Gensokyo with my own eyes at least once, if not get to live a happy life there.","timestamp_created":1609623791,"timestamp_updated":1609644930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvY6U4/YCcc3uvwI="}
