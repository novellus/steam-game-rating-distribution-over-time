    review: "After completion of journey mode and getting all the achievements, I\
      \ will recommend this one!\nSome say that there are some re-used sounds and\
      \ other minor details that DTG missed, but from the perspective of gameplay,\
      \ I would mark this DLC good. Because it simply makes LIRR more diverse. You\
      \ can operate the Budd in same timetable as M7, in all three car setups. (For\
      \ those who don't know how to change the car setups, you can do it via \"Q\"\
      \ - livery switch.) The cab looks nice, controls seem to work properly and only\
      \ one thing you need to be aware of is the door opening system being blocked\
      \ via brake settings. \nAnyway, if you like LIRR, buy this one! \n\n7/10"
