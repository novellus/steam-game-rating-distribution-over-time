So you may miss something and stuck.\n- There's a mouse smoothing which you can't disable. It's really irritating.\n- Puzzles doesn't make sense. I played many adventure games, this is one of the worst. For example, even after looking a walkthrough I still don't get [spoiler] frequency / organ puzzle. Pillar puzzle at chapter 2 was really bad too. [/spoiler]\n- No first person hands / feets etc, no animations / cutscenes. Game's intro basically showing you logos with sounds / voice overs. This is cheap / lazy or whatever you prefer to call it.","timestamp_created":1609973694,"timestamp_updated":1610015627,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ475qa7vYCdIGRwQI="}
