Good, this has nothing to do with it. Thankfully, like Quake, it has plenty of rock-solid shooting and a hell of a soundtrack (that you will need to patch in.) Run it in a good source port and you'll find a pretty enjoyable campaign with a fairly novel hub system. It hasn't aged as well as its predecessor in a lot of ways, and you may find yourself tiring of the industrial environments, but it's a solid game all around. It kind of embodies that late 90s industrial metal aesthetic you just can't find anymore. Also, its Super Shotgun is incredibly satisfying. Pick it up!","timestamp_created":1610139953,"timestamp_updated":1610139953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49rz08fYCcr3RwQI="}
