    review: "Episode 3 is another emotional journey with the best (and only) park\
      \ girls and Eve the grumpy/relatable ranger. It's really the best episode till\
      \ now with amazing artworks, nice music, convincing voice acting and a satisfying/tearful\
      \ story about memories, forgetting, desperation and change mixed with cuteness\
      \ and humor. \n\nIf you liked Episode 1/2 you definitely will get your moneys\
      \ worth and if the devs can keep up the established standard, well then there\
      \ is probably much more to come in the future and I'm positive that Studio Coattails\
      \ won't dissapoint."
