Almost gave up on it until I verified files. It's a rare thing when games that use mouse aiming boast \"Full Controller Support\" and mean it. It all works great on a controller. My preferred way to play. \n\nOh yeah the game. It's pretty damn fun. You can be a By The Books, No Nonsense Cop. Or...you can just waltz in RoboCop style and plug away at all suspects. I love that you can be graded on whether or not you react to the perps who surrender and NOT kill or beat them.\n\nAP Rounds and Magnum Bullets for days. \nAlways headbutt.\nUse cover even when point blank. \n\nGive it a try. You'll be glad you did.","timestamp_created":1609999722,"timestamp_updated":1609999722,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4cTd7fYCeeqZwQI="}
