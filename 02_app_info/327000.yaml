    review: "Well, this \u201Cearly access\u201D VN has been abandoned for sure (at\
      \ least on the day I last played it, 11/09/2016). Missing sprites (right in\
      \ the beginning of the game), uninteresting and barely developed characters,\
      \ wasted concept. Like Infinite Game Works Ep 0, it had a certain potential,\
      \ but the execution of this project failed. It\u2019s sad, the art style is\
      \ lovely and the BGM is much better than the first game, and when things start\
      \ to get somewhat interesting, it ends. Just like that. \n\nI don\u2019t know\
      \ if the developers still read reviews (probably not), but I really hope that\
      \ they can start working on this project again. At least add just a bit more\
      \ of content and finish the story. Leaving it in EA for almost a year without\
      \ any news is a really mean thing to do to the players.\n\n2/10. Avoid these\
      \ two games, even on sale."
