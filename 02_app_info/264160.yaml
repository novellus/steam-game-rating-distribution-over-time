    about_the_game: <strong>Time moves forward only when you do</strong> in the dungeons
      of WazHack, so you can take your time to solve problems instead of just spamming
      'attack' and 'drink healing potion'.<br><br>With over <strong>300 unique items</strong>
      to be found, you will invent your own solutions to sticky situations. With over
      <strong>150 different monsters</strong>, many with unusual attacks, you will
      find plenty of sticky situations!<br><br>The <strong>procedurally-generated
      dungeon</strong> and vast array of possible items gives immense replay value.
      Some games you'll find a good weapon early, other times you'll rely on wands
      or potions or spells.<br><br>You don't see it much in the all-action video above,
      but some of the most fun is had just standing still trying to work out how to
      get out of a sticky situation. Should you try that unknown potion? Maybe it's
      Healing? What about that wand? Maybe it's Magic Missile... or maybe it's a Wand
      of Create Monster, and it'll get even stickier!<br><br>You start with your choice
      from <strong>16 character classes</strong>, each with different starting equipment,
      stats, belief system, and available talents. The game you play also depends
      very much on what interesting loot you find. Maybe you'll find a great spellbook
      and put all your efforts into turning your uneducated knight into a master battle
      mage!

    review: This game is beautiful in its simplicity and difficulty curve. Almost
      all of your deaths are your fault and you'll learn from your mistakes fairly
      quickly. The deeper you go, the harder it gets, and boy does it get hard. I
      don't think I'll ever 'beat' it (if there is a win condition), but boy am I
      glad I bought this one as it's easily worth the sticker price.
