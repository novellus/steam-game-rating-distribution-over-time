      /><br><i>Griftlands</i> is a deck-building rogue-like where you fight and negotiate
      your way through a broken-down sci-fi world. Every decision is important, be
      it the jobs you take, the friends you make, or the cards you collect. Death
      comes quickly, but each play offers new situations and strategies to explore.<br><br>At
      this stage of development you can play as Sal or Rook, with a third character
      and campaign in development. Sal is an adventurer out for profit and revenge.
      Rook is an aging spy working his own agenda. Expect regular updates, including
      new cards, quests and characters as we work on the game with community feedback!<h2

    review: 'I was looking for a game with deckbuilding and card battles, and this
      game delivered so good!


      IT has a nice story to keep you playing and mechanics are good


      Normal battles are pretty standard, they are good, but I must say the hightlight
      for me is the negotiation battles! Those are actually very fun! Totally recomend
      if you want a game with rogelike elements in the deck building side and engaging
      battles that doesn''t need you to hit people physically'
