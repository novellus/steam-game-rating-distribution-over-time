So the developer pulled any further development of the game from that point on.  Funny thing is, the whistle-blower was actually a player who brought this news to light.... the developer clearly did not post anything regarding this \"important\" bit of news to anyone.\n\nSo the game is definitely abandoned.   You have a bit to do in it, but really, perhaps a few hours at best...
