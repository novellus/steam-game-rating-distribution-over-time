    review: Did you like Quake? Good, this has nothing to do with it. Thankfully,
      like Quake, it has plenty of rock-solid shooting and a hell of a soundtrack
      (that you will need to patch in.) Run it in a good source port and you'll find
      a pretty enjoyable campaign with a fairly novel hub system. It hasn't aged as
      well as its predecessor in a lot of ways, and you may find yourself tiring of
      the industrial environments, but it's a solid game all around. It kind of embodies
      that late 90s industrial metal aesthetic you just can't find anymore. Also,
      its Super Shotgun is incredibly satisfying. Pick it up!
