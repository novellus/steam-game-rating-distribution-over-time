Love the idea around this.\n\nBut in all honesty this game is low quality garbage.. which is quite apparent after watching the gameplay video. I had a pretty rough time even getting through the first level. Too easy & boring. That being said, I knew what I was getting in to and still want to reward the devs for good behavior (the idea not the execution).\n\nThis game needs:\n\nMultiplayer - Everything bad about this experience would be excusable if you could play with others, Bonus: Let us yell insults as we ride by each other.\n\nBetter physics/gameplay - At least let me physically whip the horses to speed them up with my offhand instead of simply hearing the sound when you boost (I respect horses irl & don't condone whipping them).\n\nBetter UI - The UI rectangle stuck to the offhand really puts a damper on my experience as I wave to the Plebs in the audience.\n\nBetter Immersion - What's with team 'red', 'blue', 'green', etc? Why not make it Romans, Gauls Thracians, Numidians, etc.\n\nSound - This might be my biggest issue: What the hell is up with the music.. It's terrible. Not even remotely evocative of ancient Rome. Let's get some drums, horns, flutes, or something. The music is trash and makes me very sad.\n\nThumbs up for chariots","timestamp_created":1605419180,"timestamp_updated":1605419180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.620142698287963867","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/pOc5fUCe4W8rgI="}
