Its a very good game and i kinda love it but I cant play it for more than 10 minutes without it crashing. Im serious this game crashes when getting in combat, when getting out of combat, when you play a card, when in dialogue etc.. It even once crashed because i wanted to save so badly that i pressed esc as soon as i came out of combat but it triggered a decision phase where youd have to decide for a policy for the year. It turned out to overlay the esc menu and i was stuck and couldnt press anything. 10/10 game but unplayable. Sad that this is how the game seems to be fine to the developers","timestamp_created":1609945638,"timestamp_updated":1609945638,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx5yP7PYCdoeDwQI="}
