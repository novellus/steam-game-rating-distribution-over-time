While Sonic 1 started the series, Sonic 2 truly got it going. It expanded on everything that made the first game a \"blast\" to play while also refining most the unnecessary slowness. 2=Not a perfect game - there's quite a bit of \"retro BS\" in there, but a good game nonetheless.","timestamp_created":1597954545,"timestamp_updated":1597954545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.645615816116333008","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41urghvQCe7vZnAI="}
