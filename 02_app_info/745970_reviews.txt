I haven't played the game 'Twilight Struggle' myself, but I hear it is quite like that game and I reckon if you like that game chances are good you'll like Terminal Conflict too.\n\nI think game captures the essence of the cold war quite well - USSR vs USA, proxy wars and managing the home front while you're trying to achieve your goals. Intelligence is a big part of the game, especially with the Eyes Only DLC. War is abstracted, but still challenging.\n\nYou go through ten timelines, from 1946 to 1991. In these timelines, you and your opponent in turn pick a focus that decides the main area of the world the action takes place, even though you can still be active in any other theater at the same time. There are 5 domestic needs you will have to manage throughout the game: finance, people, elites, army and government, as mismanaging these can cut your game short early on. The mentioned focuses also affect these needs. Next to all this, there are policies which will grant you victory points required to achieve a major victory, but also can affect the domestic needs.\n\nVictory is achieved by getting 100 victory points more than your opponent, winning the space race of by simply surviving until the end of 1991.\n\nThe interaction from the developers is very good. Be sure to check out their Discord to find a multiplayer challenge, and give feedback! Every Thursday they organize 'Terminal Thursday' and between 18:00 and 22:00 CET you can challenge the developers.\n\nNot everything is perfect. Multiplayer is awesome I think, but once you get the mechanics under control you will find the AI to be a bit lackluster. Although this has also improved quite a bit, it is still some way off from the same challenge as a human player. This is always a difficult aspect in any game though, and doesn't stop me from practicing my skills against 'Mirvin' as the AI is called. The game truly shines in multiplayer though!\n\nIn my opinion the in-game tutorial could still be improved. Although the developers have recently released an update to this system. I still would prefer to have a linear tutorial which goes through all the aspects of the game. The current tutorial system tries to 'unlock' the aspects one by one, but it doesn't work if you ask me.. new players don't know where to click yet, so don't know what to unlock. I have made a YT vid myself which is already outdated a bit since I learned a lot since then, and also some systems have changed. I still have plans to update that video though, so hopefully that can help new players!","timestamp_created":1601318426,"timestamp_updated":1609613974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528985500335693359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn4Oe4vYCdNvXpAI="}
