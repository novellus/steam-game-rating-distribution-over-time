It plays in real-time with pause and fast-forward, to allow players to play at their own pace (similar to other management sims). Players should be able to take a break when they need to, and resume later. Similarly, players can fast-forward if they get bored, with the game auto-stopping when something requires the player's attention.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Original Soundtrack by Josh Culler<\/h2><br>Josh Culler, composer of the haunting NEO Scavenger soundtrack, is back again with an all-new body of work, specifically crafted for Ostranauts.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Modding Support<\/h2><br>Most of the game's data is in plain-text files for easy access.
