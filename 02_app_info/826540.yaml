    review: "I own several dance/rhythm games and this is the one I come back to for\
      \ my workouts.  Audio Trip on expert has enough movement to really get you sweating\
      \ and the choreography generally feels nice.  The other games seem to have decent\
      \ choreography - but it almost feels auto-generated and isn't the challenge\
      \ that I get from AT.\n \nI actually put away my Valve Index for over a year,\
      \ and now I play 3+ times a week.\n \nI will say, the content is drastically\
      \ lacking (there really aren't enough songs) but the content that is there is\
      \ solid.\n \nI held off on putting in this review until I tried using my own\
      \ music.  While the journey was a little intimidating at first, after less than\
      \ an hour I had made my first primitive ATS file and was able to fine tune it\
      \ to my tastes.  That, to me, does solve a bit of the content issue - as now\
      \ my entire music library can be used as long as I'm willing to build the levels.\
      \  Since you can basically allow it to record while dancing - this isn't as\
      \ hard as you'd think."
