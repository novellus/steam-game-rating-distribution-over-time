I have yet to experience Cabin Stay. Below is a review for The Pact, which is my first experience with Amaze VR's premium content. I'll work on adding a review of Cabin Stay at a later time.\n\nThe Pact is an interactive VR film for Amaze VR, starring Lorynn York (Rachel) and Seri DeYoung (Emily). This is a thriller with supernatural elements, in which the viewer takes on the point of view (POV) of a male (I think?) friend who is out with Rachel and Emily. The Pact doesn't spend much time getting things moving before you and your friends are abducted by a creepy, mask-wearing, knife-wielding, person. Maybe there's more to the plot setup, but it felt rushed into the action, so the setup didn't stick with me. \nNot divulging further details of the plot, as the film moves forward there are multiple moments in which you can choose what you or others will do next. These choose-your-own-next-step elements don't have any lasting impact on the plot, but they do support immersion as they change how things move forward. That said, don't try to 'game' the experience with the best choice. Make the choice you want to make to get the best version of the film you want to see (If you're worried about missing content, there's a 'skip 15 seconds ahead' and 'skip to next branching choice' feature that you can use on repeated viewings). At the end of the film, the viewer does get some genuine control over where the story goes. The final choice you make will determine the ending of the story. I went through all four endings, and each play through, with different choices each time, uses about fifteen to twenty minutes of the thirty-eight minute runtime listed for the film. So, that's how things work in terms of mechanics. Let's move on to content.\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Film Quality[/td]\n        [td]Smooth framerate, hi-res live action VR. The tracking shots where your character is moving are slick. I've seen comments elsewhere complaining about scaling--people look smaller than they would in real life. It's true. But this is also the best quality live action VR I've seen so far, and I like the FOV it offers. Standard film and TV are generally too large in scaling to be realistic, anyway--as if we're all right up in people's faces when we interact with them.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Acting[/td]\n        [td]Lorynn and Seri are the primary actresses here. Each have a history in various shorts, TV movies, and series. No lead roles in anything major that I recognize. That said, their acting is solid, they are attractive people, and they only add value to the film. DeYoung is given one line that is awkward and redundant. Other than that, the writer didn't disadvantage them with weak dialogue. [/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Storytelling[/td]\n        [td]The film could use some more dialogue overall, as the plot in general feels very light. As mentioned earlier, things get moving quick and it feels more like you're getting a VR 'experience' that doesn't neccessarily equate to getting a story. You get little pieces of story that allow for creepiness as things move along, but it's light compared to a standard non-VR film. More exposition, whether introducing the characters or focusing on plot, somewhere in the beginning would have made it easier to connect with the experience. The tension just isn't what it could be without that. I believe it does pass the Bechdel test.\n[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Language[/td]\n        [td]R-rated due to a few F-bombs in one scene. Minor. As someone who likes some dark horror, it's nice to know the VR filmmakers aren't going for a PG-13 tone.\n[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Violence[/td]\n        [td]For my fellow horror fans and gorehounds, that is where the tone falls short. If there was a rating from the MPAA between PG and PG-13, that's where the violence would be. One scene has, literally, a tiny bit of gore. But, hey, some is better than none!\nI have to say, the violence that is here feels pretty visceral. I'm really impressed how well it works in POV. With very low expectations for gore, my only real disappointment is with the climax. It could have used some blood effects. Who knows, if they did try to add some blood, maybe it would have been CG. While CGI blood can look effective, when it's bad I tend to wish it wasn't there at all. So, maybe we dodged a bullet in the finale.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b]My advice for the best experience the first time around[/b]: I know I said to make whatever choices you want to make, but I'm going to add a couple suggestions. \n[b]Suggestion one[/b], don't \"forget Rachel.\" When that comes up as an option, do not choose it. It's cooler and creepier if you don't \"forget Rachel.\"\n[b]Suggestion two[/b], the last interactive scene will offer you four choices. Don't be timid with your choice, but don't over do it, either. If you do, you get the most boring endings. So, really, you should be picking from only two of the four options at the end.\n\nOverall, The Pact is pretty cool for a VR film experience and the unfamiliar actresses do a solid job. I hope to see more of these offerings with better exposition and some intense stuff for the gorehounds. Not particularly scary for myself, but I think this is due to the limited exposition. I found myself more connected to the characters through the sheer familiarity that came with a third and fourth playthrough. However, at that point it's all too familiar for jump scares and tension to be effective. Cabin Stay has a much longer runtime for content, hopefully that will deliver an experience that's easier to connect to.","timestamp_created":1549615745,"timestamp_updated":1549644062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553571403026580811","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0/v+5ugCcbaougE="}
