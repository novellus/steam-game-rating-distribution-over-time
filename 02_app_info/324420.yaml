    review: "Ultimately I recommend Desert Ashes because it's a competent Advance\
      \ Wars style game and you could do far worse spending $5 on Steam. But it's\
      \ a very difficult game to review. Variety is both this game's greatest strength\
      \ and weakness. The art style is this absurd, ultra fantasy thing and all the\
      \ units have unique or interesting attacks. Like the dragon who can damage two\
      \ enemies in a line. It's fun but I can't keep the units straight most of the\
      \ time. Maybe other people will have better luck with this but with every unit\
      \ having slightly different range, attack style and, attack type while also\
      \ being wacky, mega fantasy just makes planning my strategy damned near impossible.\n\
      \nI don't like doing this but, because it's so tough to review, I decided to\
      \ just make the rest of this in list format. The good and the bad. Things I\
      \ loved about the game and things I hated. I hope this helps someone.\n\nThe\
      \ Good\n - Over the top fantasy art. Like if Tim Burton and Jim Henson made\
      \ all the art.\n - Fun and unique units that all look and play differently.\n\
      \ - Interesting mechanics like bodies of water that freeze allowing ground units\
      \ to pass.\n - Decently crafted single player campaign that eases you into the\
      \ game.\n - Very clear info boxes telling you exactly what you need to know\
      \ at a glance.\n - Excellent controller support.\n - Great price! Only $5 average.\
      \ (I got it for $1.50 during a sale)\n - Small download\n - Works great on any\
      \ system. Even tablets since it has touch screen support.\n\nThe Bad\n - Confusing\
      \ units make it difficult to plan effective strategies... in a strategy game.\n\
      \ - Lack of color coding makes things confusing sometimes and severely limits\
      \ multiplayer.\n - Multiplayer requires account creation. Meh.\n - 1v1 only\
      \ even in single player skirmishes.\n - No making your own maps so the only\
      \ skirmish maps are the campaign missions. Lame.\n - Menus are designed for\
      \ touch screen and/or controller which makes using a mouse frustrating at times.\n\
      \ - No cloud support although, this could be good or bad depending on how you\
      \ feel.\n - Depressing music and visuals. *see below*\n\nDesert Ashes takes\
      \ the Advance Wars formula and turns it on its head. It has a deliberately ugly\
      \ art style and gameplay that is unique and can even surprise you at times.\
      \ It won't last long but is well worth the asking price for what it gives you\
      \ and frequently goes on sale for a lot less.\n\nIf you love Advance Wars and\
      \ are looking for something different, absolutely give this a try.\n\n\n\n*Below*\n\
      Special Note: The music and art style, while unassuming, provide an exceptionally\
      \ depressing atmosphere. If you have serious depression (like me) then chances\
      \ are you won't be able to play for very long. I know it sounds silly but because\
      \ of how light the game is it can actually sneak up on you. I personally was\
      \ only able to play for about 45 minutes to an hour at a time. Not a deal breaker\
      \ by any means but, just something to consider."
