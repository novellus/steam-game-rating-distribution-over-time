So it's certainly not a lengthy listen, and not especially good value at two dollars. \n\n   It [i]is[/i] f-ing cool \"music\", though, if you like creepy ambient crap as much as I do. Suffice it to say, a sale is certainly advised...unless you're filthy frickin' rich, in which case you may as well just buy every horror game on Steam with a soundtrack, throw 'em all on a USB, and wallow in no end of eeriness 'til the crows come home.\n\n   Verdict: 9/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1540643126,"timestamp_updated":1566276402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567485153675079346","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtafW1uwCeI23rQE="}
