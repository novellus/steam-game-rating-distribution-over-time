But after playing a few matches, they're beasts on the field. The game says they're difficult but in reality they're super easy and fun to play. They hit hard, and can take a hit like a champ. I got 22 armor breaks and a Hob Gob leveled up on my first match with no outs.  (Course it was against Vampires so that isn't too much to brag about.) \n\nIf you're wondering if this is a good enjoyable team, it is. And you're gonna be bashing heads like no tomorrow.","timestamp_created":1582198550,"timestamp_updated":1582198550,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw372YsfACePi68wE="}
