    short_description: Squad 1 is in dire straits, but luckily Akari and Michelle
      are there to drive back the threat from the crew's most terrifyingly elusive
      foe yet. When Squad 1 is joined by Squad 2, a breakdown from within the team
      threatens to divert what seem to be steps to victory.
