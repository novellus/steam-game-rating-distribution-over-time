A confused, sick and ultimately volatile virus that does not care about the player. But maybe that's the purpose behind [b]Please?[/b] I am not here to recommend this game, because it is incomplete and has its fair share of control issues and graphic bugs. The walls have a moving static texture that is incompatible with most resolutions and causes minor crashes. The game is short (about 10mins or so) and there really is no cohesive narrative -- just a Jean Paul Satre quote on the protagonists' journal. The abridged version of this review is functionally: [b]don't buy it[/b] or [b]do buy it but expect a flawed and desolated horror game that may have set the stage for [i]the deep-web sub genre[/i][/b].\n\nThe graphics are grimey, the music is some off-beat, anti-aesthetic dubstep that is triggered when you have an enemy near but then never goes away. The controls are also a mess. Your mouse bugs out most times you inspect a puzzle and you have to kind of right-click and drag the camera back into view. There is no cohesive narrative, just random mumblings, disparate ruminations and one or two journal entries. This title actually reminded me a lot of [b]Sad Satan,[/b] an alleged authentic deep-web game that not only is a virus, but has a similar nihilistic playstyle -- devoid of the gore and sexual assault porn of course. There is a new sub-genre brewing, or maybe it already exists; nevertheless, this title along with Sad Satan belong to it. \n\nIt's a genre I believe could be done well. In film theory, for instance, The Room by Tommy Wiseau is considered to be the worst film of all time -- but it's still taught in film school. Why? Because you can learn so much from the misunderstandings and mistakes of others. For the purpose of a fair review, I am going to list a few things that I believe [b]Please[/b] got right in the context of placing it in the \"deep web\" subgenre:\n\n[list]\n[*]Gritty grayscale, black and white color scheme\n[*]Grimey textures that you can almost unfortunately feel\n[*]Off-beat, off-thematic, irrational music that is hard to play through\n[*]An overall lack of care for the player. Items you pick up seem to serve no purpose, events trigger for apparently no reason, and so forth.\n[/list]\n\nI geniunely do not know how I finished the game. I just kept playing until I was bombarded with flashing lights, images and jump scares until I unlocked the achievement for finishing the game. I felt cheated out of time. No clear purpose, a lack of akwoledgement from the game -- in a way, it truly felt like I had just entered an incomplete hell maze. And I mean incomplete in a very literal sense. I walked to the edge of one of the levels and the walls were not finished. There was an empty black gap that started into the abyss of Please. All in all, not a good game. At least by traditional standards and the binary choice of \"Yes\" or \"No\". I would not recommend this game to the public, but I know one or two people who could make something out of it.\n\n[h1]If you enjoy the way I review games, consider joining and following my curator group!
