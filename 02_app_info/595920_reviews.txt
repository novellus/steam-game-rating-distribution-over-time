Also the movement is too slow and crouched doesnt do much. play other stealth games instead","timestamp_created":1595465458,"timestamp_updated":1595638851,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ425TfwfMCdfr/lgI="}
