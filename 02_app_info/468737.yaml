    review: "Overall, it's a very well produced DLC. It makes an otherwise complicated\
      \ setup and tracking mod, into one that makes things simpler and less of a headache\
      \ to manage. It's also intuitive in the way the user areas are presented. It's\
      \ definitely attractive! \n\nThat said, it is a little outdated compared to\
      \ where TTS is in 2020. The rulebook is a simple import of the actual rulebook\
      \ and with it being vertical and dense, it's hard to read it within the mod\
      \ due to limited zoom space and resolution. From a scripting perspective, you\
      \ could feel the lack of a \"Start Game\" button, to help get the game going\
      \ once all players have their dashboards setup. I also felt it odd (nitpick)\
      \ there wasn't bank/wallet for credits on the dashboard anywhere, considering\
      \ the credits don't stack. \n\nAll that said, the game itself being fun really\
      \ caries this mod home! There are user mod's which contains the Embers expansion;\
      \ it's essential at this point. In fact, don't bother buying this DLC unless\
      \ you intend to use one on top of this mod. \n\nNow that I think about it, It's\
      \ actually a quite disappointing the expansion hasn't been integrated into the\
      \ official DLC yet. The main reason I say that is due to the fact that the Embers\
      \ expansion exists mainly to address/fix several of the major issues players\
      \ were having with the base game rule set, and significantly improves the immersion.\
      \ \n\nI still recommend this DLC, but not without the caveat of using a user\
      \ mod to include the Embers expansion. On it's own 6/10; with the rule improvements\
      \ from the Embers expansion via user mods 8/10. Would've given either an extra\
      \ point if there was \"Start Game\" scripting."
