    review: "Great game so far, looking forward to see how it develops. I am a very\
      \ casual annual holiday skier, and not getting away this year. I have to say\
      \ this will help scratch the itch. The graphics are ok I have it on Ultra settings\
      \ working on a Acer predator laptop i7 with RTX2070 Maxq. I\u2019m using a Quest\
      \ 2 with Virtual Desktop. I hope the graphics do get better. The gameplay is\
      \ really intuitive, the only thing is going to be all the medal unlocking (boring)\U0001F604\
      \ I saw earlier videos of players getting on to ski lifts, but can\u2019t seem\
      \ to find that in the game yet. Also I get a bit lost on the mountains, but\
      \ practice and memory should help that. Now to add to the realism(I am not suggesting\
      \ anybody do this) I used a fitness vibrating plate machine, while playing,\
      \ it\u2019s total immersion and you will feel the burn, but please don\u2019\
      t try to parallel with your feet, like what I did, thankfully nobody saw that.\n\
      I hope any skiers or wannabe skiers with VR will buy this and support the dev\
      \ team to turn this into a total VR gem."
