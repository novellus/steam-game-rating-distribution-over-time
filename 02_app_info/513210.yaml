    about_the_game: "Rescue Bear Operation is: a one-level, all ages, child friendly,\
      \ free to play, mini game designed to create awareness about wildfires. We'll\
      \ be donating at least 30% of our net proceeds to charitable causes. <br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nThis game is intentionally kept simple and accessible. There are\
      \ two objectives.  One: save as many friendly critters as you can! Two: save\
      \ as many trees by putting out the wild fires! By doing this you will accumulate\
      \ acorns that can be used as in-game currency to purchase unique cosmetic items\
      \ in the game. (E.g. hats, shirts, etc) Or; if you want to help good causes\
      \ in giving back to real world charities and organizations for the victims of\
      \ wildfires; we also offer unique downloadable content (DLC) that can be purchased\
      \ with real world currency as well. The option is yours!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      Most of all, please have fun playing the game!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you!"
