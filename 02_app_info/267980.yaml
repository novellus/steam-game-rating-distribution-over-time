      \ of Earth did a fine job of destroying nearly everything in one final struggle\
      \ for power by the politicians and military leaders. Twenty years have been\

      \ a planet without hunger or poverty. All weapons have been destroyed to ensure\
      \ peace. But hidden away in an archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, a cabal of\
      \ old-world magnates: ex-leaders, financiers, politicians, and despots, are\
      \ planning a return to the greed fueled, hate filled past. And there in no way\

      \ Antaeus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAntaeus Rising combines explosive action with\
      \ powerful real-time strategy. Take command of powerful aircraft carrier/manufacturing\
      \ platform. Create military units with your carrier using the most advanced\
      \ nano-technology known by the modern world and lead an army against the forces\
      \ of the Old World Cabal. Plan your assault from within your carrier and than\
      \ enter your units for some third-person mayhem! The fate of world is in your\
      \ hands, are you able to hold it?"
