    review: "This is yet nothing more than a DEMO being exported and sold \"as is\"\
      \ from the GameGuru software kit.  It's as lazy and effortless trash ..and a\
      \ complete SCAM from this corrupt developer.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5K-dmv_TjI&feature=youtu.be\n\
      \n..And this isn't the only time this developer has done this.  I've covered\
      \ other demos from GameGuru also being uploaded as is and being sold for ridiculously\
      \ high prices here on Steam just under DIFFERENT DEVELOPER NAMES.  It's certainly\
      \ the same developer, but he/she is just trying to hide what they are doing\
      \ using different developer names.\n\nI submit this evidence as my proof for\
      \ my claims above: (evidence is also in my review video above)\n\n1) https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240830/Psychedelic_world/\n\
      \n2) https://store.steampowered.com/app/1362450/lualu/\n\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED!\
      \  (Unless you want to pay money for nothing more than a DEMO from the GameGuru\
      \ kit)\n\nMy Score:  -1,599 out of 1 to 100.  Nothing more than a scam.  This\
      \ should be removed from Steam ASAP!"
