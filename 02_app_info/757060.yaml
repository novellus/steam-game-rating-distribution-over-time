    review: 'DoubleTap is a perfect recreation of the arcade game Point Blank in VR.
      A series of different types of fast-paced minigames, all involving a pistol,
      that scores you after you''ve done them and gives you a final bonus stage at
      the end.


      This is not to be confused with your run of the mill VR zombie shooters or shooting
      ranges. While technically the game is made up of shooting ranges, the game plays
      to challenge you, and to make it fun at the same time, and that''s the difference.


      I bought this on sale, but it''s worth full price. Can''t wait to see what they
      bring out of early access. This does not feel like an early access game at all
      - I can''t fault it. Maybe lack of multiplayer? I don''t know. I''m nitpicking.


      Edit: HOWEVER, this game has been in early access since December 2017 and says
      it''s only going to be there a few months. I''ve created a thread in the steam
      discussions asking for an update now that it''s April 2019. The game is short-lived
      and needs to be honest about whether it''s done or not.'
