It is the poop.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  It has ok sound fx. It had some major  lag, when it starts a round of diarrhea.  Game play was very short, like 10 rounds, so it seems like a shittty demo.  If you played Space Invaders, you will do well on this game.  Full of toilet humor.  Very easy to play crap.  Would make a good joke game.\n\nSit on it, drop it and Flush it.\n\nFor more info:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyMGfolpw0k\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izENYk3H2M\n\nhttp://www.indiedb.com/company/fergatroid-studios","timestamp_created":1487646279,"timestamp_updated":1487647188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494536280632019043","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwtSrr9oCcY/bcg=="}
