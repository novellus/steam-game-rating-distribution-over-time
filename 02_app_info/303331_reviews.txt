This ruleset/mod was written for an older version of FG (2.x) and doesn't seem likely to get updates to make it work better with 3.x builds of FG. $24 for an FG ruleset isn't exactly nothing and I'm not sure who I should be annoyed with, Chaosium or Smiteworks?\n\nThat being said, if these guys ever get their act together and update the ruleset to be less broken (images/maps can't be resized to a useable resolution, and there is some weird corruption in the display of notes, lists, etc.) then I'd happily use it to run my VTT games; FG has a lot going for it as a VTT. For now I've had to switch to Roll20 which also has a terribly broken BRP character sheet, but at least it has a more useable mapping component.","timestamp_created":1535081736,"timestamp_updated":1535081736,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.669571042060852051","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9IyAteUCdvKTqQE="}
