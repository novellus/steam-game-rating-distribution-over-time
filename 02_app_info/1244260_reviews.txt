The plot doesn't not surprise you much - it is not difficult to guess most of the \"twists and turns\", per say, and the characters are nice (though I find the goth ic protagonist being unnecessary in that sense - she could belong to any other subculture and it would hardly make an impact on the story and character development). A bit too cliche for my tastes.\nThe art style is neat (nothing too splendid yet satisfying in its own way with cuteness). Same can be said about the music in the background. \nIf you look for action though - you would be disappointed. Very few fighting scenes. Not that it is a con for this VN. \nOverall impression - 7,5 out of 10. It made me happy and I enjoyed reading it. Simple as that.\nP.S. - not another yuri pron project, which is a breath of fresh air.","timestamp_created":1609466205,"timestamp_updated":1609466205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.451127827167510986","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tKrq3fYCdrqivwI="}
