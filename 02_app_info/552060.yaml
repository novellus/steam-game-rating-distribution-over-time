    review: "Gute R\xE4tsel, mehrere R\xE4ume, viel anzuschauen und zu entdecken.\n\
      Ca 30min Spielspass pro Run, aber man kann man zum Gl\xFCck ja noch anderen\
      \ Familienmitgliedern die M\xF6glichkeit geben, es zu spielen, um mehr aus dem\
      \ Geld herauszubekommen.\n\nAch ja und kleine Kritik: Eine Testperson war zu\
      \ klein, um die Vasen und die Gl\xFChbirnenhalterung zu erreichen, evtl n\xE4\
