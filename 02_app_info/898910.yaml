      /><br><br>Welcome to the simple and ever changing world of creative tools, tiles
      and challenges. <strong>DASH: Danger Action Speed Heroes</strong> is a 2D platformer
      which serves one goal: to make players create levels and clear them as fast
      as possible. There is no story. Just the right tools to create it!<br>The players
      create the levels, playlists and worlds for others to explore. The leaderboard
      will indicate which runners and creators are the best, the smartest and fastest
      among all. With a monthly update cycle, the game will expand as new game modes,
      heroes and tilesets will be integrated. The DASHers have already created well
      over 250 levels (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://dashworld.online"
