You compete in short time challenges and can be knocked off your bike by a variety of obstacles. Game takes about a half hour, a little more of less depending on how bad you are at steering (and trying to figure how to disable motion blur).  Not the best Sokpop but not bad either.","timestamp_created":1609101723,"timestamp_updated":1609101723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528301894664764404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41/j70vYCc9zvvQI="}
