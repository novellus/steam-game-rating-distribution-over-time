    reviews: "\u201CDeception Island is truly the game that Nancy Drew and mystery\
      \ fans have been waiting for. The puzzles are better, the concept is better,\
      \ and the historical piece of the puzzle is intriguing, as well.\u201D<br>Just\
      \ Adventure<br><br>\u201CDeception Island to me has it all: a wide range of\
      \ game environments, a host of credible characters, well-crafted graphics and\
      \ ambiance, and a great plot that weaves the curiosities of the past with the\
      \ present day mysteries into one entertaining package. Then they threw in some\
      \ diverting side events just for fun. Toss it all together and you have one\
      \ charming game, sure to give adventure players their money\u2019s worth and\
      \ more. So without any reservations, I highly recommend this game.\u201D<br><a\

      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GameBoomers</a><br><br>\u201CIn short,\
      \ there is much to recommend Nancy Drew: Danger on Deception Island. Unless\
      \ you\u2019re already something of a nautical buff, you\u2019ll learn a lot\
      \ about sailing and whales. It\u2019s a very creative game, and I can\u2019\
      t imagine a better title for your child to enjoy.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.armchairarcade.com/neo/node/199\"\

    review: Great story and world building. It was a pretty linear adventure as there
      is not much you are able to do much out of order. The puzzles were fairly easy
      in this one tho.
