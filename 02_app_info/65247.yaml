    review: It is under $4 when it is on sale, so for that price, it is pretty decent.
      The cab is atrocious, but the exterior look is acceptable and the sounds are
      fine. It is also one of the few American steam locomotives available for the
      game and is much better quality than the Big Boy and Challenger, which can be
      bought for a similar price on sale.
