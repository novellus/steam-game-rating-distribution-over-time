It's quite simple, there's a green rectangle on your screen and in this rectangle you can draw a line, curve, anything really, as long as you can get the sled across the track. The game also has some nice clean graphics. All in all a worthy puzzle game.\n\n[Rating: 71/100]","timestamp_created":1309643195,"timestamp_updated":1402263936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509366631507873535","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwLPcvsYCe5CMAw=="}
