This is to the ancient game HnefTafl what Battle Chess is to Chess.  It gives a game played like HnefTafl with some variations on what you choose for special pieces, table, etc, but gives you little animated battles between the pieces.  However it is from the same time period as the original Battle Chess so very pixelated and at times difficult to see clearly on a modern screen.  But I enjoyed the game and appreciate having a Battle Chess version of this ancient game as well.  I look forward to trying it more.\n\nI would recommend this for those interested in games like Battle Chess that don't mind the aged graphics and it running in Dosbox.","timestamp_created":1526945897,"timestamp_updated":1526945897,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.650452852249145508","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oqvEwuMCfoHuoAE="}
