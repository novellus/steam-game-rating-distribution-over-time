    review: 'A good cyberpunk game about a girl who is locked up in a secret complex
      and is forced to fight not only for her life, but also for the lives of many
      innocent people ...

      This is how the game we see begins, which evokes a lot of emotions. Among all
      these good effects and atmosphere, attention to detail is visible, starting
      with short tracks and other sounds, ending with the backgrounds of this wonderful
      game, for which I would like to thank the developers, I recommend you to familiarize
      yourself and use'
