I'm playing wirelessly on a Quest 2, and I can't use my Quest controllers, having to tether myself to a PC using a controller. I also can't swivel around in my seat, the game hitting me with a 'tilt your head to more comfortably turn' message every time I try to play the way any other VR game allows you to. No, game, tilting my head makes me feel queasy.\n\nWith an update that allowed me to play by turning 360 degrees while using my Quest controllers, I'm sure I would recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1609415787,"timestamp_updated":1609415787,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n4Cq3PYCeqmKvwI="}
