    review: 'Bad game,a seriously bad game.

      I really don''t like to pressure indie developers like these because its probably
      their first time making games but this...The only thing I''d say is it''ll make
      more sense if this was on the Apps Store or Google Play Store.

      This markets as a quote on quote ''''Hack and Slash" but this has probably been
      the worst one I''ve played yet.

      Lets start,

      Jumping in,the settings are simple,I will give props to the dev for this because
      some people really don''t like going through all those settings and it''s excusable,especially
      when this game can be run on a potato,so graphics settings isn''t really a thing.

      Second thing I would like to cover is the controls,this game does not allow
      controllers (It does not support them) but the controls are completely horrendous,''''W''''
      to open your inventory,''''A'''' to move left,''''D'''' to move right and ''''S''''
      for the map.This will be extremely confusing for players who play any sort of
      FPS or know the basic controls of PC gaming.Finding yourself opening your inventory
      while in a fight isn''t uncommon as the controls are simply that.You can''t
      even change them for gods sake!

      (My inital third point was the graphics but again,this is a small indie game)

      Fourth point,the gameplay itself.

      Bad,extremely bad.The controls are already simple enough and the gameplay just
      seemed like what my 7 year old cousin plays on his phone.Lacks any sort of diversity,the
      same mechanics are prone to repeat themselves every time.It''s just ''''click
      the opponent first and keep clicking him till he dies'''' sort of thing.Also
      to mention the music is a 3 second loop.

      In conclusion,don''t buy this.The dev actually already lowered the price of
      this game,(apparently in his mind it was worth the past amount) but anyway,you
      can''t judge a man''s way of doing business.I am getting a refund as we speak
      and the last thing I want to cover is that the devs are very insecure about
      what you say,not even trying to fix the problem,the dev tries to publically
      humilliate those who speaks against him.

      [h1] NEVER BUY [/h1]'
