    short_description: When Burgerwise finds his home broken into, his friends murdered,
      weird monsters roaming the halls, and his BURGERS taken, he does what any sensible
      puppy-smashing clown would; he takes advantage of the situation to kill the
      rest of his roommates. And take their stuff!

    review: '(UPDATE - June17, 2018)

      The controller works great now, the buttons and sticks are remapped in a way
      that works. The enemies are now a lot slower which helps but if you allow them
      to they will still move inside your character. It''s an okay fix for the previous
      problem but it really sort of just hides it rather than fix it. It''s better
      than before although it could use further improvement. The game is still a bit
      clunky and there is still some trial and error type of areas that quickly become
      frustrating due to there being no checkpoints. The platforming can be hard to
      judge when jumping and very punishing as missing a jump can often be an instant
      death. Great job on the update, I love how a bit of information on what you
      are supposed to do was added, that''s great. The game is slightly better overall
      now but it still isn''t where I''d need it to be to give it a positive recommend.
      It definitely feels better though, that''s for sure.

      (End Of Update)


      I bought this because I liked the art style and the fact that it had something
      to do with burgers. Unfortunately, it isn''t quite up par in many ways. I wish
      the controls were better but they are pretty bad. There were a lot of mistakes
      made with this game, I think these developers are fairly new but it seems like
      they tried.


      The story is pretty cool, at least what''s written here on the Steam description.
      There is a bit of a cutscene before the game starts to give a tiny bit of the
      story but i wish it had the whole story, also that it was skipable because it
      doesn''t seem to be.


      The controls are probably the worst feature of this game. On the xbox 360 type
      controller for PC, the right analog stick is move and X is attack with A for
      jumping. This means you have to use both hands on the right side of the controller
      in a very awkward way. The keyboard is much better but still not very good with
      E being attack but when using wasd, pressing E is awkward. Unfortunately there
      is also no possible way to remap your keys or buttons so you are forced to play
      with these brutal controls.


      The hit detection is pretty weak. Your hits register most of the time but enemies
      will move inside of you causing constant damage over time and it feels very
      wrong. Because of this the game is extremely hard in a way that it shouldn''t
      be.


      There is no tutorial or instructions on how to play at all. You can pick up
      bullets bu there is no mention of a gun and none of the buttons on the keyboard
      or controller fire these bullets. I have no idea what they are for.

      I like the art style and the story. I hope the devs can update this to make
      it better. I wasn''t able to make it past the first level or even get to the
      boss. The controls really are that terrible and I can''t recommend this in it''s
      current state unfortunately.'
