It does have a lot of elements that I have liked in other games and which remind me of some classic games.  However, the gameplay itself  feels like a chore to me - it just isn't very fun or entertaining for me.  It sat in my library for a couple of years with 14 mins of gameplay.  I didn't know why, so I installed it, and soon found out why.  I might reinstall it in the future when I forget again and wonder why it has ~75 mins of play.","timestamp_created":1610220728,"timestamp_updated":1610220728,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7M2o9PYCeorxwQI="}
