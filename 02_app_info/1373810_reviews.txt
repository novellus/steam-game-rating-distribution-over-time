Knuckles are not supported - but are shown as Wands. While I might be able to live with that, thumbstick locomotion IS REVERSED!!! I have to go backward to go forward (again this is a fun park, but there are limits, right?!). And left to go right!!! Devs must be out of their minds to sell such garbage. Note, I bought all DLC for like $30, but I'm refunding everything. \n\nPerformance isn't even good using Index res 100 % - this game IS NOT OPTIMIZED AT ALL! This game has so few polys and low-res textures that res 200% must work in solid 90 fps using Index and GTX 1080, just like Boneworks. Surely this game is incredibly far from such quality. \n\nNow, this game has great potential - but not at all in its current state. Avoid like the plague - or Covid-19, lol. \n\nOr enter knowing that you have been warned. \n\nFree isn't cheap enough - I need the devs to pay me for wasting my time in this misarable game! And no, I'm not joking.","timestamp_created":1598097356,"timestamp_updated":1598098453,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1598635242,"developer_response":"Hello!
