      \ spend on it I wanted to release what I could for now. There WILL be updates\

      \ the first in the 'The End of an Age' Trilogy. The game is being developed\
      \ to fill the huge void left behind by one of RPG's greatest sons, designed\

      \ JRPG Genre as well as art style. Of course, many aspects of RPGMaker can be\

    review: I paid for this game and there is only around 20 minutes of game play
      then it says thank you for trying the demo.  I didnt know i was paying for a
      demo and i would never spend money on a demo that is only 20 minutes long. what
      is up with that? very disappointed and would like a refund.
