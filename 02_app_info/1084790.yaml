    review: "WarPlan is the best WWII strategic game I have played so far... I enjoy\
      \ it more than games like HoI IV or War in the East which are too tedious and\
      \ complicated and Strategic Command WWII which is too simple and not realistic\
      \ to my taste.\n\nI think WarPlan strikes the right balance between realism\
      \ and playability. There are all the main mechanisms under the hood to make\
      \ it realistic without the need to micromanage things that won't change the\
      \ course of the war. I think it makes a lot of sense to apply different mechanics\
      \ for land and naval and it works really well in WarPlan, the goal being to\
      \ try to simulate as best as possible the look and feel of actual engagement...\
      \ Supply is another element very important that I think is working very well.\
      \ \n"
