    review: Where has wizard crime scene investigation been all my life? Love the
      lowkey D&D-type references and character banter, love the fourth wall breaks,
      love the amount of sass Seeker manages to compact into their one smol body.
      The jokes are great, as are the character designs and interactions. The goat
      really does say maa! Seeker's pronouns default to they/them and can be customized
      to your liking, a revelation that absolutely floored me!!! Trying to puzzle
      out the mystery was a blast for myself and my partner. Excellent game, only
      wish there were more and/or that it were longer!
