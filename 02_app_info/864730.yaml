      \ deliver the new update any sooner. Even with all the setbacks, we had to endure\
      \ with corona, I can tell you that we are still working really hard on the new\
      \ update. :3 It means a lot to us that you still see the same potential in the\
      \ game as we see. \n\nThe new update is a complete overhaul of the core mechanics\
      \ and took with a 2 man team, more time than expected. But we are coming close\
      \ to the release of the new update, and there are many more to come! We are\
      \ not abandoning this game, and we can't wait for you to come back once we have\

    review: 'I bought this game 5 months ago, played the two levels (same map, same
      objective, but one is a little harder than the other) and thought to myself
      "well, this is kinda boring, but has a lot of potential. Lets see how it is
      after a couple of updates"


      ...Yeah, about that.


      5 months without updates. 5 months without a single thing. Game is still janky,
      still takes about 60 minutes to complete, still has untapped potential. But
      until the devs do something with that potential, my review stays negative. A
      shame.'
