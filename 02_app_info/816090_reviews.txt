Its a little rough around the edges in some places and the AI teammates aren't quite as smart as I want them to be sometimes but they're not impossible to work around once you learn their quirks.\n\n-Game has amazing lighting and atmosphere appropriate for the grimdark setting.\n-You really feel like a Terminator. Some weapon feedback is wishy washy but they all do their job\n-There are fun game mechanics that keep you on your toes such as locking doors to prevent ambushes, hacking turrets and occasional weapon jams. \n-There are 9 chapters in the game and each level is honestly pretty damn huge and daunting\n-Outside of the campaign mode there's also a thing called \"Special Missions\" which lets you revisit old areas and complete various mission objectives that are different on every playthrough offering some replayability.\n\nMy final verdict? Love the game but there's some things about it that could have been better. I am thankful to have this title though and do enjoy it because 40k is quite lacking in the First & Third Person Shooter department.","timestamp_created":1586838700,"timestamp_updated":1609825469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pOjE6PYCdNTPgAI="}
