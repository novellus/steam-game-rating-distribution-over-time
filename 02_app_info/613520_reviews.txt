Those are excellent tables that are easy to pickup and play, Magic Pixel should give newcomers some of those tables instead of promoting the Retro Pack (which is made mostly for pinball enthusiasts). Table design is great, they are all pretty and great fun to play. Sound is mediocre tho.\n\n10 tables you should not miss!","timestamp_created":1572897424,"timestamp_updated":1572897424,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqMD/m+4CfvrI1wE="}
