I have only played the demo and it seems to be on the right track. The rules are not too complex, you can judge what is wrong with people with a visual assessment, and you can earn a few dollars on the side with risky deals. It would be nice if I could let people in just a little faster, but that is only a minor irritant. The biggest irritation is the gameâ€™s poor grammar, spelling and typos, which is unacceptable for a game that relies so heavily on text. Give the game a polish, and I will buy it.","timestamp_created":1486832918,"timestamp_updated":1486832918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw37uJl9oCdLTwcQ=="}
