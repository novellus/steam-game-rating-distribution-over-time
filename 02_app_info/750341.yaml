    review: "The best value for money here would be to purchase the Tales from Candlekeep\
      \ Complete Edition.\n\nThis quick review covers the basics for each of these\
      \ DLC\u2019s\n\nThis will give you the game plus all five the DLC\u2019s that\
      \ the game has to offer.\nThe game can be played without the DLC\u2019s, having\
      \ them however does make the game somewhat easier.\n\nThese DLC\u2019s all offer\
      \ some unique rewards along with other bonuses. What truly makes these DLC\u2019\
      s so amazing is the Reinforced Legendary Chest that comes packed full of legendary\
      \ crafting materials allowing us to craft some mighty find equipment right off\
      \ the bat, and that is not all, there are some permanent passive bonuses as\
      \ well such as a +1 to your Healing surges or a percentage increase in gold\
      \ and xp.\n\nThese DLC\u2019s offers this and more, making them must buys, even\
      \ if its just to support the Developers."
