It follows the classic fun point-and-click adventure game structure. What you'll find different from the rest of the point-and-click games though are the spectacular graphics, and the way the designers have simplified the way you interact with different objects in the game.  You simply left-click an object to pick it up or interact with it, and a quick right click brings up your inventory. \n\nThis game is very creative, and unique. It has a little bit of everything: mystery, humor, adventure, and plenty of puzzles that'll keep you thinking. The game becomes more and more fun as you begin to explore and open up new areas of the map.\n\nI was hesitant to purchase this game because I don't know any Italian. However, Aigor's premise and objectives are intuitively laid-out and extremely clear; I haven't had any problems. The studio has gone above-and-beyond anything I expected too by taking the time to communicate with me in English to answer questions, offer up hints and other advice. This is much appreciated- grazie!\n\nOverall, this game is a top-notch creation, and well worth the money!","timestamp_created":1579659864,"timestamp_updated":1579727904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550172984600067139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0NvH5+8CfNSn7QE="}
