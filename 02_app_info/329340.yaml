    review: "As you can see from my playtime, I've played this game quite a bit. I\
      \ first played this game many years ago when a demo version with the first stage\
      \ was included in a computer game magazine. Then I forgot about it for a long\
      \ time until I stumbled upon [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRyPqyrZbR0]\
      \ a trailer for this game on Youtube [/url]. I liked the trailer and bought\
      \ this game after a while and well, here we are.\n\n----\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe\
      \ main gameplay idea is this: On one hand, you cannot let too many enemies pass\
      \ or else the mothership gets destroyed. But on the other hand if you take too\
      \ much time destroying each enemy, you cannot finish the stage within the time\
      \ limit, so it's necessary to find the right balance and often make sacrifices\
      \ on one of these sides (for example, by boosting and ignoring some enemies).\
      \ I think this is a pretty cool idea, but it can be quite stressful if you're\
      \ striving for perfection, like when you play for a high score.\n\nMy favorite\
      \ thing in this game is the boost. I just like the feeling when everything (enemies,\
      \ bullets, the background) accelerates when you boost and I think speedruns\
      \ of this game would be cool to watch if some people were to go for it.\n\n\
      The two weapon types (rifle and blade) each have quite different properties\
      \ and require you to play in a different style. It's also really cool how some\
      \ parts were designed such that one weapon has a clear advantage over another.\
      \ Though in total I prefer the rifle. If you play with the blade weapon it's\
      \ always necessary to get close to an enemy just to deal damage making it easy\
      \ to get hit. With the rifle you can keep a safe distance and if you need to\
      \ go for high DPS, point-blanking with the rifle is almost as good as repeatedly\
      \ doing the 1-2-slash with the blade. In addition, repeatedly doing the 1-2-slash\
      \ with the blade (which I think has the highest DPS) requires you to press the\
      \ attack button with a specific timing which is a bit annoying. If you mess\
      \ up the timing, you'll start the sword spinning attack which has low DPS and\
      \ is useless for stronger enemies. It's also hard to set up bosses for the 16x\
      \ score multiplier if you use the blade and on Hard difficulty enemies sometimes\
      \ still fire suicide bullets even if they are in melee range. So yeah, in total\
      \ I found the blade to be much harder to use and maybe it could have been balanced\
      \ a bit differently on that side.\n\nEach stage is fairly short with a time\
      \ limit of 180 seconds (3 minutes) and a full playthrough takes no longer than\
      \ 15 minutes. For some people this might be too short, but I actually liked\
      \ the brevity a lot. It allows you to play short sessions, and it's not too\
      \ annoying if you fail an 1CC attempt. I had a lot of fun replaying and practicing\
      \ the stages because of that.\n\nThe one big thing I don't like about this game\
      \ is the stun animation whenever you get hit. You can't control your character\
      \ during the animation, you get pushed in a direction and it lasts way too long.\
      \ Because of that it happens quite often that getting hit messes up your strategy:\
      \ Smaller enemies on the screen cannot be destroyed in time and leave the screen\
      \ and more often than not you're left in a bad position where you have to take\
      \ even more hits unless you fire missiles for invincibility (this happens even\
      \ more when you play on Hard). I think this really could have been done better.\n\
      \n----\n\nStory:\n\nThe story is pretty much non-existent in the game. There\
      \ are some explanatory texts in the manual and on the [url=http://www.dwahan.net/Marsbound/cloudphobia/manual/index.htm]Japanese\
      \ website[/url] of Marsbound for Stage 1, but the game itself only contains\
      \ like 3 simple lines of text and some more or less cryptic images. I still\
      \ don't really have an idea what happens storywise in the stages and how they\
      \ are connected. But well, it's a shoot 'em up first and foremost, so this is\
      \ probably not that important to most people. \n\n----\n\nDifficulty:\n\nI've\
      \ just managed to 1CC this game on the highest difficulty (Hard) with both rifle\
      \ and blade (after ~25 hours of total playtime, you can find replays of the\
      \ 1CC runs on Hard if you look at the game's online leaderboards, sorted by\
      \ score (rifle) or time (blade)). Though I have to say that my shoot 'em up\
      \ skills aren't very good, so if you frequently play this type of games, you'll\
      \ probably be able to do the same in less time.\n\nThe game is quite easy to\
      \ pick up on Easy and becomes a bit challenging on Normal requiring a bit of\
      \ memorization. However, when you play on Hard, there is a large jump in difficulty.\
      \ Even after getting 1CCs on Normal, I couldn't get past the first stage on\
      \ hard on my first attempts. Especially on Hard it is necessary to use the scoring\
      \ system as good as you can (the most important rules being \"get the 16x multiplier\
      \ by destroying red enemies and bosses with missiles\", \"destroy red enemies\
      \ after white enemies\" and \"use the invincibility after firing missiles to\
      \ avoid damage\") since the amount of health replenished after each stage directly\
      \ depends on your score. So for me during the Hard difficulty 1CC, it was pretty\
      \ much necessary to memorize all enemy spawns and sometimes even devise routes\
      \ and strategies for bosses. But it is satisfying to see how you improve and\
      \ survive longer with each 1CC attempt.\n\nIt should be noted that there are\
      \ no continues in this game. If your mech gets destroyed, it's Game Over and\
      \ stages are only unlocked for practice mode at a certain difficulty if you\
      \ beat them during a playthrough on that difficulty. Though I guess this is\
      \ not uncommon. \n\nSo in total the game is easy to pick up but becomes quite\
      \ memorization-focused on Hard. I would have preferred if there was not such\
      \ a large gap between Normal and Hard.\n\n----\n\nGraphics:\n\nOf course the\
      \ graphics are behind the times when you compare the game to more recent shoot\
      \ 'em ups, but I think for its age (even before it released on Steam) the game\
      \ looks quite good. Some of the extra effects (like the rain drops in Stage\
      \ 1) are pretty to look at (although Stage 4 might have been better without\
      \ the screen shaking) and the design of the stages is pretty cool. My favorite\
      \ stage in that regard is Stage 2 with the purple, sunset-like atmosphere, especially\
      \ when you're boosting.\n\n----\n\nMusic:\n\nThe music is also pretty nice,\
      \ you can even download the soundtrack for free when you get the game. My favorites\
      \ are the music for Stage 1, 2 and 4 (which contains some nice musical references\
      \ to Stage 1). Not too fond of the Stage 3 music though because it sounds very\
      \ different from the rest of the soundtrack.\n\nIn total, the game has its quirks,\
      \ but looking back on my time playing it, I had lots of fun and enjoyed playing\
      \ this game. It's a pretty cool game, so it gets my thumbs-up."
