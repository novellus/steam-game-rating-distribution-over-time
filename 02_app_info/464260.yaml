      /><br>A port of the successfully crowdfunded Sega Mega Drive / Genesis title,
      Xeno Crisis is an arena shooter that can be played solo or in local co-op mode.
      Take control of battle-hardened marines embarking on a deadly mission to confront
      an alien menace and get home alive! Run and gun your way through thousands of
      adversaries as you explore the devastated research outpost, searching for survivors,
      and ultimately facing the origin of the outpost's demise.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/464260/extras/xc_steam_0.gif?t=1592932356"
      /><br><br>Outpost 88 is divided into seven distinct areas, each being randomly
      generated with each play, meaning that your strategy must evolve on the fly
      if you're to succeed in your mission. Collect dog-tags from vanquished enemies
      to upgrade your equipment between areas and look out for special weapons which
      will give you a momentary advantage.<br><br>There are several weapons at your
      disposal, each with their own characteristics. Although your standard issue
      pulse rifle is perfectly capable of taking on the enemy, other weapons can give
      you advantages in certain situations, so picking them up is generally advisable
      - just don't run out of ammo!<br><br>As you progress through the colony you
      will come across many different enemies, each with their own traits and means
      of attack. Many of them can be gunned down without too much thought, but others
      will require the player to outflank them, attack them within a certain time
      window, or be avoided altogether!<br><br>At the end of each area you will be
      given the chance to exchange any dog-tags you've collected for upgrades ranging
      from extra health to weapon power-ups to extra continues. Which upgrades you
      go for will depend on your style of play.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/464260/extras/xenocrisis_kickstarter_section_features.png?t=1592932356"
