For two dollars sure. I don't know why we cant rebind controls as on keyboard the control set up is a bit uncomfortable. As someone else has said controlling all the players at once does not make sense for this game. Your opponents are able to strategically place their players while you are basically stuck controlling one. It is very hard to position your teammates for a shot or a pass while also trying to fend off the entire opposing team. Really fun concept and I wish the devs could just fix those few problems. Those chances are slim considering it appears they've moved past this little hobby","timestamp_created":1577138266,"timestamp_updated":1577138266,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+YOxmu8CdMy85gE="}
