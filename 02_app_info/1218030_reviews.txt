The cryptanalysis techniques utilized in this are actual, real-life techniques used in academic cryptography and spy alike.\n\nHow do I know this? I'm a cryptographer. :)\n\nBy playing this game and learning how these techniques work, you will gain an understanding of how these attacks are performed. If you're not familiar with the basics of cryptography, this game is likely too difficult for you, but there's no better time to start than _right now_,\n\nThe UX and UI definitely needs work, but this is a early-access game. As such, you should expect bugs and UX failures. I do think the price of $50 is far too much to ask for what is essentially a major technical demo, but as a cryptographer I couldn't help but see this and say \"wow someone made a game for me\".\n\nFrom a cryptographer's perspective, this game is realistic. This ain't your average puzzle game - this is modern code breaking.","timestamp_created":1587075460,"timestamp_updated":1587075519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.656326353549957275","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4odLEwvECd/eqgQI="}
