There's some funny moments and a few random puzzles, but if you're expecting something more along the lines of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/734890/The_Francy_Droo__Friends_Collection/]Francy Droo,[/url] you'll be disappointed.\n\nApparently the dev made [i]Mermaid Mission: Titanic[/i] because his kids wanted a mermaid game, and it definitely shows; it's cute, sincere, and kid-friendly. I wouldn't recommend it to a general audience -- the premise and design are unusual, and that's interesting, but the \"developer art\" and meandering story make it a hard sell when the end result isn't particularly memorable -- but if you're gaming with children, it's maybe worth checking out.","timestamp_created":1558515588,"timestamp_updated":1558515657,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.663983404636383057","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4krWx7+oCfMvSwQE="}
