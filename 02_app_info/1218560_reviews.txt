Aim them at other disks for combo shots and interesting ricochets. It's laid back and pretty, but can also get exciting and challenging. Works great with low end computers and low end wallets. The art is lovely and the music relaxing.","timestamp_created":1590970402,"timestamp_updated":1590970402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzbjOtvICfY6/iwI="}
