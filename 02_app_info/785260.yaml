    review: 'I can''t really say anything about this without reiterating on what other
      people have said, but I''ll say it anyway.


      The Good:

      - Team mechanics are interesting

      - Graphics look nice

      - Music doesn''t make me want to jump off a cliff

      - Might actually be a fun experience with other players

      - King Boom Boo shows up


      The Bad:

      - Very slim selection of actually good tracks

      - Awful roster

      - Expect physics to bug out at least once every half hour or so

      - All items are wisps and their designs are so un-intuitive that it''s hard
      to know what any of them do without rote memorisation

      - Single player mode is repetitive and lacking in interesting content

      - Progression is based off of loot boxes that you roll with in-game currency,
      so gaining improvements to your preferred character is a crapshoot at best

      - Only six options to choose from for each vehicle part and half of them are
      literally just the first three but [i]~*gold*~[/i]

      - Driving mechanics don''t have enough going on to carry the weight of the entire
      game on their shoulders

      - Nobody is playing this game, so you won''t be playing with other people

      - AI rubberbands like crazy

      - AI teammates will get stuck on terrain and there''s nothing that can be done
      about it, costing you a 1st place win

      - Has some truly awful VA

      - Could have literally copy pasted the mechanics of All-Stars Racing Transformed
      and it would have been a more enjoyable experience


      Don''t bother buying this one. All-Stars Racing Transformed, while dead in multiplayer,
      has enough single player content to make it worth the purchase, and is a much,
      much better game. This game has almost no redeeming qualities and probably isn''t
      even worth it on sale.'
