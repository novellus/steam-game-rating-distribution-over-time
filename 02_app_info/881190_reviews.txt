The principle of the game is pretty simple - electrify an enemy robot, spray water on it so it short circuits, do this with all robots per level. If you touch an enemy or a shot, you die instantly.\n3 lives, infinite continues. If you lose all 3 lives, the current level and enemies will be reset.\n\nIs it fun?\nYes, levels are short and varied enough to make it fun to play. Level difficulty varies a bit, but after defeating a boss (they are a bit tricky, as they should be), getting a slightly easier level is a treat.\n\nWorth noting about movement etc, the game has a pixel graphics aesthetic but you can move \"sub pixel\".","timestamp_created":1536255567,"timestamp_updated":1536255567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.637531578540802002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yfT91+UCeduSqgE="}
