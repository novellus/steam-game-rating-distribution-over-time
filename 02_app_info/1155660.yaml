      Story So Far</strong></h2><br><i>In 1925, Kenneth Miller found himself committed
      to a mental asylum. Far from enjoying a period of psychological recovery, however,
      he and the other patients were tortured and abused every night by a group of
      sadistic orderlies.<br><br>Eight years later, during a trip to Paris, Miller
      is shocked when he recognises the very worst of those men - <strong>Frank Graceman</strong>

      notes: This game deals heavily with the theme of vengeful, violent murder. Most
        of the story takes place in a 1930s brothel, so it contains sexual references
        as well as semi-nudity. There are also references to drug abuse, sadomasochism,
        torture and self-harm.
