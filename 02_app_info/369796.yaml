    review: The highlight of this game or arrangement or whatever you want to call
      it seems to be the transcription of the sax solo for guitar. I'm not sure that
      it's 100% accurate, but it's close. Guitar is not capable of the same kind of
      sustain as a sax, so that's a problem. I like it, but some riffs feel unnatural
      - not native to the guitar - and will be difficult to memorize. Still they are
      goods riffs to spice up your blues and Latin rock vocabulary. The alternate
      lead part is challenging, too, and follows somewhat the palm muted lead guitar
      part on the original, acting as sort of counterpoint to the sax. The tune uses
      a couple of relatively unusual chords jazz chords. I just got it a few days
      ago, and it's now a favorite.
