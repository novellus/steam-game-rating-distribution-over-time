    review: "Overall I recommend this game. It is one of the better hobbyist indie\
      \ rpgs out here on steam that I have played, and the developer's passion and\
      \ care for it shines through. That being said, it does have its flaws. I'll\
      \ go into more detail below, where there will be spoilers, so be warned.\n\n\
      --- SPOILERS BELOW HERE ---\n\nThis game improves significantly upon the original\
      \ version (which I've also played a couple years ago). The combat is somewhat\
      \ more balanced and more content has been added, in terms of story, exploration\
      \ and gameplay. However if you have played the original, do be advised: some\
      \ previously optional areas seem to have been made mandatory, and the game does\
      \ not necessarily hint at that very well, like the fire cavern. \n\nThere are\
      \ a couple of new additions that will impede progression if you miss the one\
      \ vague hint the game throws at you from random NPCs, such as the necessity\
      \ to upgrade the pickaxe you eventually get. For the longest time, the story\
      \ does not require an upgraded pickaxe to progress, as most of the obstacles\
      \ hide treasures and extra abilities, so by the time it's required to actually\
      \ complete the game, you forget how and what you're supposed to do to upgrade\
      \ it in the first place, if you even had a hint of that to begin with. I myself\
      \ needed a guide to figure this out (Janice smith -> ship haven smith, incidentally)\n\
      \nSpeaking of things that show up too late to be relevant: the two side characters\
      \ who join the party. They appear far too late in the game to have time for\
      \ their stories to develop organically. You get a plot dump backstory cutscene\
      \ for each of them as soon as they join, which would have worked much better\
      \ if it was revealed over the course of the game, had they joined earlier. There\
      \ is also the issue of the frankly silly and hilarious love subplot between\
      \ the main character and one of the characters that joins. Again, this character\
      \ shows up and joins so late into the plot, the game can do nothing but shove\
      \ saccharine love at first sight cliches down your throat to maintain even an\
      \ ounce of credibility.\n\nThe writing itself is not the best, and makes me\
      \ think the writer either doesn't practice creative writing often or english\
      \ isn't their first language. The plot beats are easily understandable and there\
      \ are no confusions, thankfully, it's just the dialogue and narration quality\
      \ that leaves to be desired.\n\nThere are also the two open areas, the desert\
      \ and the snowfields. The desert gets a map, thankfully, though you cannot carry\
      \ it with you so better screenshot it when you do get to view it, however the\
      \ snowfields offer no such luxury. These two areas are confusing to navigate\
      \ unless you go to great lengths to memorize where all the landmarks are in\
      \ relation to each other. Add this to the fact that they both have their own\
      \ time limits, one a literal countdown, the other ticking down your health every\
      \ couple steps. This added grievance turns the wandery mess these areas are\
      \ into a frustrating experience.\n\nMy final issue is with the exploration aiding\
      \ accessories. They take up the character's accessory slot, so you can only\
      \ use one at a time, as only the main character can even equip them. This wouldn't\
      \ be too much of an issue if there weren't the occasional places that require\
      \ the use of at least two of them, which ends up in a lot of menu hopping. If\
      \ it was up to me, I would have made these accessories key items instead and\
      \ have the obstacles automatically passable once they are in your inventory.\n\
      \nThe combat is significantly improved in this version of the game. When I played\
      \ the first one, it was an unbalanced mess of creatures that could oneshot you\
      \ early on to zero threat after a certain level. While the latter is still somewhat\
      \ a concern after a certain level in this version of the game, it is now much\
      \ better balanced. My only gripe would be the endgame bosses in relation to\
      \ the creatures that populate their dungeons. The random encounters are incredibly\
      \ weak by the time you're prepared to face the disproportionately deadly bosses.\
      \ And then there are bosses that aren't a threat, but just take forever to kill\
      \ due to their massive health pool.\n\nThe game world is interesting, and there\
      \ is definitely a great amount of effort put into worldbuilding. Exploring it\
      \ is mostly fun, especially when you're looking for all the optional extra abilities,\
      \ though the fact that you cannot get them all until you have all the characters\
      \ in the party is yet another argument against how late they join. some of these\
      \ extra abilities also prompt some dialog from the party, which makes me think\
      \ it was a missed opportunity for character building to not include scenes for\
      \ more, if not all of them.\n\nThe simplicity of the story (defeat four elemental\
      \ monsters, get their crystals, find out the truth about yourself) serves the\
      \ scope of the game well. It's no grandiose convoluted plot and I can appreciate\
      \ that. The main character, though bland and without much development, is a\
      \ good player insert to experience this world for the first time, making this\
      \ a good introductory title to the Labyronia series. You receive the traditional\
      \ jRPG airship just in time for the backtracking to start getting old (though\
      \ i question the necessity of the seaship, as you only need it to get a small\
      \ number of treasures out of the ocean, equipment that by the time you're getting\
      \ would realistically already be outdated by your current equipment anyway).\n\
      \nI really appreciate the encounters in the dungeons being physical creatures\
      \ you can see on the map, rather than invisible random encounters a la final\
      \ fantasy. Thi does not apply to the more traditional approach on the overworld,\
      \ but I prefer it this way.\n\nThe cue system through which you gain new abilities\
      \ is a wonderful core mechanic, and is the backbone of this game in its latter\
      \ half, as some of them will make your life much easier. I only have the two\
      \ aforementioned issues with it: you can find many of them early but you can\
      \ only obtain character specific ones once those characters are in your party,\
      \ which happens very late into the game., and the cues themselves are a wasted\
      \ opportunity for more character interactions.\n\nIf I sound overly critical\
      \ in tone to the point where my recommendation surprises you, it's because I\
      \ enjoyed my time with it despite its flaws. All in all, it is a charming indie\
      \ title. Passion went into this and it shows. It's far from being a polished\
      \ product, but the developer took the time to create a complete experience.\
      \ For the price, I'd recommend it, especially since few indie jRPGs here on\
      \ steam are of this level of quality."
