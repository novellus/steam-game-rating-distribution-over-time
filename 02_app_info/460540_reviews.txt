But I would say it's a fun little\ntime waster at present and I look forward to seeing\nwhat the developer does with further updates.\n\nConstrutive Criticism - If the character or enemy goes behind a wall\nthere is no ghosting or the like to keep the player visible. This can\nlead to the player getting hit by enemies they can not see.","timestamp_created":1540410962,"timestamp_updated":1540411044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.672585666179656982","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwiubp0+YCfcGjrQE="}
