The dialogue can be a mixed bag; however, the characters- Desdemona herself in particular- manage to be oddly endearing and likable, and while it does likely harken to anime tropes (I don't know the genre well enough to say), I can say the characters manage to be interesting, likeable, and unique in a way that anime generally fails to make happen.\n\n[spoiler]Except for Marcus. We need an update with a plot line where he dies. Make it happen, Brandon; it should qualify as an additional happy ending.[/spoiler]\n\nThe game takes a nigh-pure slice-of-life approach, which definitely differs from my own preference of an overarcing \"mission\"-oriented plot. This gives an interesting take on subplots and mini-arcs that compose the experience. I admit I'm still trying to find words to describe this, but I can say it's not without its appeal in some cases.\n\nBetter yet it's worth it for pushing forward.\n\nEventually I probably will finalize the review I've written, and while it will have plenty of criticism, it will remain positive. This game may not quite be my favorite RhinoGearz title, but it's still an experience I'm eager to enjoy, and remains an exception to my usual anti-VN opinions.","timestamp_created":1605658886,"timestamp_updated":1605658886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw98eu7PUCd4mErwI="}
