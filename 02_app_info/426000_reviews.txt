The art isn't nearly as good as HunieCam and the only character you talk to for the most part is Kyu.  I find the gameplay a bit boring because it's so repetitive, though there was enough humor in it to keep me interested for a little while at least.  If you like these types of games you might be interested, but it's not my cup of tea.","timestamp_created":1610000104,"timestamp_updated":1610000104,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpP/e7fYCePmZwQI="}
