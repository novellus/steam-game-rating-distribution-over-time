There's guns in the game, at least I'm assuming so, but I couldn't be fucked trying to find them\n\n\"Explore Mount Moira Hospital without limitations, a full immersive world.\"\n\nNo idea what this is suppose to mean. There are plenty of places you cannot go and you cant interact with almost anything so I don't get the full immersion and without limitations part.\n\n\"Flashlight mechanics are realistic and use a battery system, be sure to stock up on batteries.\"\n\nOh get fucked! Have you ever used a flash light? How is it realistic to have the batteries run dead every 2 minutes. Not to mention changing the bastards are a pain in the ass.\n\n\"Immersive Graphics: AAA-quality graphics give players a detailed, terrifying realistic world to explore by taking full advantage of Unity’s HDRP render engine.\"\n\nFuck, I had to restart the game several times and fuck with the settings to even get the game to work right. After that there was still plenty of dropped frames and clipping textures on top of having a super obnoxious motion blur that wouldn't go away even after I toggled it off. It seems you cant even edit most of the settings from in game but instead have to do it all from the main menu.\n\n\"Unpredictable Enemies: Players cannot know when – and from where – one of the hospital’s inhabitants will catch you.\"\n\nMost of the times the enemies are just standing in the hall not doing anything so you definitely know when and where they are coming. They wait till you get close and then slowly walk towards you and somehow have the ability to clip through walls and doors. These aren't frightening enemies they are just slow moving annoyances.\n\n\"Search the facility for information and resources to help you complete your objectives and come out of this alive.\"\n\nIts such a dark cluttered mess that's its hard to pick out what's important and what's not so basically you get to wander around in circles while enemies slowly follow you.\n\n\"Real Horror: Awoken, Mount Moira Hospital, all of its creatures, and its setting are inspired by real asylum, cases of criminal insanity, and folk lore.\"\n\nI doubt it.\n\nThis game is a giant mess of \"Things that might be scary\" thrown in together and called a game. Slow moving enemies, jump scares, a mannequin, psycho patient stuck in cell. It feels like the dev googled top 10 things that are spoopy then  found some free assists and called it a game. 50$ (29.99 on sale) Is an insane rip off for this game and I suggest everyone stay away.","timestamp_created":1599507745,"timestamp_updated":1599507745,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.701719880104064941","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4jumFtfQCeba4oAI="}
