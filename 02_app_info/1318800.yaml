    review: 'ESC is an amazing game, but also an outstanding experience.


      Great soundtrack, visuals, story, just everything is stellar. The moment you
      open it and begin the story, you don''t want to put it down. It keeps you thinking
      about what is going to happen next.


      And, in my personal experience, it also makes you think about irl stuff an awful
      lot.
