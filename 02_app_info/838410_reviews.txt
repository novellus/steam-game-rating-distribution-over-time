You can even add your own models to the game. Very user friendly and much easier to use in comparison to TTS. I think the graphics are better too. They are still in Early Access, so there is still a need for additional features. I'm not crazy about the mod.io vs the Steam workshop. Hopefully they will change that over in the future. All in all though, I think personally like this a LOT better than TTS. I'm really hoping to be able to edit or create my own virtual room themes in the future! Right now they have a small list like (Victorian, Wild west saloon, etc.)","timestamp_created":1610138518,"timestamp_updated":1610138616,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwjLDv8fYCd+nQwQI="}
