Writing is about high schooler fanfic level. Voice acting is, more often than not, atrocious. I've had to mute the game multiple times to get through it.

Throughout my play-through, my pervading thought was how much I'd rather play BG2 instead.","timestamp_created":1609695032,"timestamp_updated":1609786852,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqsCx5/YCcpuRwAI="}
