    review: Picked this soundtrack up on a whim, along with Ultratron, the game. The
      music is very intense, and blends fast-paced electronic drums with some ambient
      synths as well as some retro synth bass. It feels like it's from the 80's, but
      also it feels very modern too. I think the composer did a great job and really
      hit the mark with the musical direction. It's perfect post-apocalyptic robot
      killing music. The way the music works in-game is really cool too. It sounds
      like it adds layers of intensity as you progress through the levels. It's really
      well done. The soundtrack is a great companion to the game, and vice versa.
      They are both high quality products that reflect the high level of care that
      the team put into them. Worth picking up if you are a fan of this kind of stuff.
