The game mechanic is simple, you create words using letters from a top row and left row. The aim is to fill the box with words. The mechanic however doesn't really evolve from this point from what I can tell, so it really is just a game to play for 5-10 mins. I generally don't feel the urge to keep going after doing one board. I do wish it had achievements though (and I hate that I wish a game had achievements, but oh well).","timestamp_created":1609276286,"timestamp_updated":1609276286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww+yV2PYCf+rIvgI="}
