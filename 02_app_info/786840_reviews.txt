This game is not good, at all. It supposedly does one thing: RC track racing, and some other surprises in this sandbox 90's style bedroom. Unfortunately, this game gets absolutely nothing right.\n\nSad, because I think there might be a good game idea here, but it's executed poorly, even for EA. The RC racing is terrible. You basically remote control your racer around the track, highlight all the areas of the track, and boom you get a spray can. That might sound fun, but it isn't in this game. See, the controls are awful. \n\nIf you want a fun RC racer in VR, try My RC Buggy! VR. Those are the types of controls that you want. Not this crap. It's hard to even do one lap. You go as slow as possible as to not run off the track as the controls are way too sensitive. It's boring, frustrating, and not fun at all. \n\nYou have to put a cartridge in the OG Nintendo to get the tracks to show up. A chair is in the way of the track by design for reasons unknown. You teleport around the small room into 5-6 nodes. So you need a full roomscale setup just to reach everything. I think you can also shoot a basketball at a hoop which is also pretty awful. I think you can also throw trash into the trash bin. Turn on the radio. Grab the coffee cup. Did I miss something?\n\nOh well, probably doesn't matter. I had low expectations and since I only paid $1.59 I won't refund. But I hope the devs truly work on updating this game and make it a pleasant experience. I would love to change my No recommendation because I think there's a good, relaxing VR experience here to be had. But I won't be holding my breath, it seems like the entire game needs to be reworked. Game needs full locomotion, more stuff to do, better RC controls ... a reason to play. \n\nRate 4/10. Good idea, poorly executed.","timestamp_created":1530395267,"timestamp_updated":1530395267,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555375874042510986","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4+9GqqeQCcI/lpAE="}
