    review: By watching the videos and reading some of the reviews this game looks
      like lots of fun. I'm really into designing things and being creative but this
      game was just not it for me. I started it up and it was extremely glitchy the
      island bugged out and so I started it up again and the same things happened,
      a few more tires and I got it to work and it wasn't as much fun as I originally
      thought and it wasn't worth redownloading five times just for it to bug and
      lag.
