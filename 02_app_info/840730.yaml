    about_the_game: "As you look down upon the empty planet, you find a set of tools\
      \ on the top right of the screen, ready to be used. A bolt of lightning, or\
      \ perhaps a flood, or seedlings for trees\u2026even the option to create man.\
      \ And rabbits.<br><br>As you progress through the eons of time, you\u2019ll\
      \ notice that your actions have directly affected the shape of the world simply\
      \ by the order in which you chose them. By creating the earthquake first, for\
      \ example, you created a crack in the earth that you could then fill with the\
      \ flood, which lead to a vast river spanning the planet. But had you done the\
      \ flood before the earthquake, the ground would not have been dry enough to\
      \ create the crack, and would have lead to an entirely different landscape.\
      \ This is just a small example of what your actions do in the Sandbox of God:\
      \ Remastered Edition, as you start with a selection of actions (such as rain,\
      \ earthquake, etc.) and must choose the order they are unleashed upon the Earth.\
      \ Doing these actions in different order can yield new results, and it's up\
      \ to you to find new ways to shape your world.<br><br>But your actions don\u2019\
      t go unnoticed. Create man and give them the tools necessary to thrive, and\
      \ they will pray to you for guidance\u2026which you can then deliver or ignore,\
      \ allowing them to choose their own destiny. And rabbits could even learn to\
      \ pray, too. Whether you listen to them or not is up to you.<br><br><strong><i>NOTE:\

    review: I remember playing the original version of this back on YoYoGames. The
      nostalgia definitely is there. Plus, now I get to try the new game modes I never
      did before. It's still a fun clever puzzle with some silly and interesting ideas.
      Worth it!
