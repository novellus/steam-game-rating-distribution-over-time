    review: 'This game needs a tutorial or something. I have no clue what to do. I
      moved my crew around by right clicking and then clicked the cannonball to shoot,
      and that''s pretty much it.  I never actually won a combat because it felt like
      it was going to take a half hour of simply clicking one button. So I surrendered.
      Then on the world map I had no idea what to do but a few seconds later I was
      in another combat and lost my cannon. So I lose?


      Then in another battle both my crew died, but I was able to surrender and sail
      around again until I got into combat and could do nothing.


      Refunded.


      Was hoping for a game similar to the naval combat in Pillars of Eternity 2.
      This is not that.'
