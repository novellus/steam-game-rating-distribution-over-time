    review: "Clever idea, poorly executed. \nThe concept of a tower defense game where\
      \ you get to take over a gun yourself is pretty sweet. Sadly the controls are\
      \ awkward at best, and the perspective is claustrophobic and limited.\nThe maps\
      \ are way too small for a decent tower defense game. I suspect this is a legacy\
      \ of it having been a mobile game, but there was no reason not to open things\
      \ up a bit when porting it to PC.\nOdd that right off the bat the game gifted\
      \ me with so many coins I could buy just about everything up to the max level,\
      \ seems like something a developer would do who had given up on trying to make\
      \ it actually a better game.\nThe graphics are pretty nice, the aliens look\
      \ cool and the overall visual presentation is pretty good. The music is also\
      \ decent, if somewhat repetitive. \nI think most players will also find the\
      \ game a bit under-explained, the common ability to hover over a button to get\
      \ some idea of what it does does not exist here. Not my idea of fun having to\
      \ guess what so many of the buttons do.\nFor two bucks or less, might be worth\
      \ the purchase, but keep your expectations low."
