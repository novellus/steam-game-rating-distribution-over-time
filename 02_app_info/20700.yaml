    review: 'A good game from what feels like long ago. It''s rough around the edges
      compared to more modern games; it doesn''t have 1080p resolution and the mouse
      navigation is a bit clumsy. But it''s a quality game from before the era of
      early access, where you got a shareware peek at the full game and paid for the
      rest of it if you liked it.


      It also seems ahead of its time with its basic mining and crafting, but also
      it doesn''t go too far with it, which a lot of newer games do. However, may
      I recommend you save often. There doesn''t appear to be an autosave and you
      might not realize it, but if your escape pod gets destroyed, it''s a complete
      game over!'
