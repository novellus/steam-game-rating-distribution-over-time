I've only played about an hour of the game but it's a cool little 2D beat-em-up with a nice story. I have some issues with the controls via keyboard, which seem like the inputs are delayed before the character strikes, but maybe if I connect my controller to it I'll have a better time with it. It is not bad, I do recommend the game if you love 2D fighting games & dig unique artwork.\n\n6.5/10 for me!!!","timestamp_created":1481075815,"timestamp_updated":1481075815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.419720321893692017","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pe6/69gCfNvXaw=="}
