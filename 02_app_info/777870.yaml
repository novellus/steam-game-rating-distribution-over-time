    short_description: A room. A lab. A simple test. Nothing unusual. Nothing lurks.
      If you stay in the room too long, you may experience periodic instability. This
      is normal. Nothing to worry about.

    review: I can't tell if I just had a fever dream or not, but either way this was
      a great game. The aesthetics along with the small challenges and different approach
      to storytelling all made this worthwhile. I definitely think it has replay value
      because I already know I missed some parts throughout. Highly recommended.
