      two of the most magically gifted wizards on this (or any other) planet set out
      on a quiet stroll one evening, neither of them are aware of the terrifying adventure
      that awaits them.</strong><br><br>They only have themselves to blame for bringing
      it on, however, as they fail to see a giant hole in the ground and take an absent-minded
      wander straight into it, leading them to a cave of unspeakably horrible monsters.
      Their only way out is to navigate through 100 deviously dangerous levels...
