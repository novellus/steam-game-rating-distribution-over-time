    review: "Summery at the end if you don't feel like listening to my thoughts...\n\
      \nOkay first of all... this game rocks. It's a fun western style, steampunk,\
      \ wave based shootout with robots. If one of those words doesn't convince you\
      \ to try this game ( assuming you own a compatible headset ) then you're probably\
      \ as lifeless as the robots I turned to scrap in this game. This first person\
      \ shooter is, as I said above, a wave based shooting gallery, taking place in\
      \ a western town dominated by no-good ROBOTS! And it's your job to... well...\
      \ DESTROY THEM! It's that simple. Your guns are on your waist, you point said\
      \ guns... then you shoot. Movement is done via a teleportation system (Point\
      \ and click using the touch pad) that slows down time for a brief moment when\
      \ used, adding even more to the shoot em up feel I assume the developers were\
      \ going for. This game is very simplistic but has a lot of charm. For instance\
      \ when a robot has a hat on, you can shoot the hat off! That doesn't sound like\
      \ a lot, but believe me it's fun doing it yourself in game. But this also holds\
      \ an actual game play element, as you soon discover that hats act as an extra\
      \ hit for the robots. Soon every enemy has a hat and I'm frantically (and quite\
      \ comically) shooting dozens of hats of of the mechanical enemies. Another fun\
      \ mechanic is the ability to remove enemy limbs. By shooting the robots arms\
      \ or head or even lower body, you can remove weapons and armor. However removing\
      \ the head will cause the foe to blindly shoot everywhere not just you as they\
      \ attempt to end you before they explode! Removing both arms causes the robots\
      \ to go \"Screw this\" and running into you and exploding taking a chunk out\
      \ of your health. Let me tell you, there are few things in my day to day life\
      \ that mach the terror of a giant robot running towards me ready to take us\
      \ both out.\n\nThere's a lot of other things to praise but I don't want to spoil\
      \ everything. No lets hurry and talk about some... Problems...\n\nThe reload\
      \ mechanic is a bit finicky when you aren't actively looking at your holsters.\
      \ This may be on purpose but if not then some fine-tuning would be nice.\n\n\
      The boss (Who I won't spoil ) is a tad bit dull, as all three versions of him\
      \ are seemingly the same. Perhaps implementing some new attacks in each level\
      \ that have something to do with the theme would make it better. Like in the\
      \ town level, have enemies rush out of the bar with no weapons, making it seem\
      \ as though they are drunk, or in the mine level, have a mine cart circling\
      \ around the arena with enemies in them, etc, etc. That's just about it, one\
      \ more thing in just a second, this game is simple yet fun, all I can really\
      \ ask for is... well more levels. I know the theme is a western shootout, but\
      \ I think you can do more, Imagine like an underwater level in an old shipwreck,\
      \ or even a level on the moon. But if you stick to western that's still cool.\
      \ Just continue to make content an all will be good.\n\nThe last thing I want\
      \ to say is pretty bad though. The teleport feature has a major bug! If I get\
      \ close to a gate (these gates are usually closed until you complete the area\
      \ you are in) I clip through the gate and teleport into the checkpoint room.\
      \ As you can imagine... this is BAD! I experimented with this bug and was able\
      \ to complete the first level (not including the boss.) in ruffly 30-45 seconds.\
      \ This is game breaking as you could probably beat the entire game in about\
      \ 10-15 minutes. whereas not using this bug has the game running around an hour\
      \ to 2 hours depending on how you play. PLEASE DEVELOPERS! You must fix this\
      \ or this game will most likely not see as much success as you or I or any other\
      \ fans want it too! Seriously it took me ten minutes to find this glitch because\
      \ like most people when playing a VR game, the first thing I did was see what\
      \ happens when I clip through the wall. This would not be a tiny but that no\
      \ one would notice. \n\nMy suggestion, another VR title, Budget cuts, would\
      \ have a similar problem if this was possible as the game has you navigate maze\
      \ like offices to escape a building. To combat this problem the designed it\
      \ so that everything in the players vision when walking into a wall or solid\
      \ object, to become a sort of wire frame X-ray version of the model, along with\
      \ this, everything freezes and the player can no longer use Items or the teleport\
      \ gun to navigate until they step out. Attempting to walk through walls doesn't\
      \ work either as the game will remain like this until you return back through\
      \ the wall or object you initially stepped through. \n\nI believe implementing\
      \ something like this is the best way to combat this rather nasty bug.\n\nOver\
      \ all the Copper Canyon shootout is a rather hidden gem on the Steam VR store.\
      \ (I say hidden gem as I haven't seen many talk about this game to much which\
      \ is a real shame.) If you own a headset, Give this one a shot as even with\
      \ the problems I mentioned, \"speedrunning\" this game doesn't net you any real\
      \ rewards (except for the par time steam achievement.) and you'll enjoy it a\
      \ whole lot more buy just playing the dang game correctly. \n\nTo sum it up.\
      \ \n\nGame good, very fun, stylistic and lots of replay value. \nBad bug allows\
      \ THE WHOLE GAME TO BE SKIPPED!\nOverall check this game out as it deserves\
      \ FAR more attention then it is actually getting. \n\n9/10, fix that bug."
