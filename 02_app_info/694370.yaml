    review: '[h1]Overview[/h1]


      [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Year 1[/i] is the beginning of the second series of
      the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i]  (fifth installment in the saga) which takes place
      eight years after the events of [i]Space Pilgrim Episode IV: Sol[/i].  After
      a period of peace, Gail Pilgrim now lives the good life as an Ambassador of
      the Galactic Union and Chancellor of the Gail Pilgrim Space Academy who simply
      cannot overcome her adventuresome spirit as the game starts with Gail and the
      new crew of the starship Quicksilver investigating an attack on Latona Station
      in which the only survivor is a young girl named Maggie Dale whom Gail takes
      custody of until Maggie''s mother can be located.  Continuing the [i]Space Pilgrim
      Academy[/i] tradition of splitting time between Gail Pilgrim and somebody else,
      this time the adventure is divided between Gail and her personal quest to investigate
      the attack on Latona Station while trying to locate Maggie''s mother, and Maggie
      Dale as she attends classes and spends time between classes by socializing with
      fellow first year cadets.


      [h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]


      Anyone who has played any of the first four [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] games
      can expect similar graphics that are simple yet aesthetically pleasing.  Only
      the graphics have improved somewhat despite the series still being made with
      RPGMaker.  (For some odd reason, no AAA publisher or developer has purchased
      [i]Pilgrim Adventures[/i] despite the ultra high quality of story writing and
      dialogue.)


      Taking place eight years in the future from the previous installment in the
      [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i], the returning characters in the [i]Space Pilgrim
      Saga[/i] do look older than before.


      https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1435715630


      The sound, however, remains unchanged, but this may be good for players who
      would rather mute the game sounds and music so that they can either play their
      own brand of music or have their TV playing in the background.


      [h1]Positives[/h1]


      Everything players loved about the first four games in the [i]Space Pilgrim
      Saga[/i] is back.  The story has surprisingly gotten even better, the new (and
      even returning) cast of characters are more interesting than before, and there''s
      still plenty of laughs to be had.


      Featuring a story line that spends some time in the life of a girl in her early
      teens, Maggie''s story features the sort of trouble making that occurs naturally
      in youth culture involving prank-pulling, snooping, and going into places where
      the people in question do not have permission to be, and this makes for a fun
      experience for people who enjoy teenage characters.


      Unlike the first four games of the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i], [i]Space Pilgrim
      Academy: Year 1[/i] now allows for conversation choices.  Only instead of the
      choices affecting the story line, the choices are answers to questions from
      agents and professors teaching at the academy in Maggie''s story line.  (Although
      providing the incorrect answer can have an effect. [spoiler]This effect is on
      Maggie''s grades at the end of the game.[/spoiler])  Every possible response
      to professors also contain at least one silly response which adds to the replay
      value of the games in the [i]Space Pilgrim Academy[/i] series.


      With classes to be had in Maggie''s story line, the classes are very fascinating.  Cadets
      receive a liberal arts education that involves history, culture, science, art,
      philosophy, engineering, and military instruction, and players are likely to
      enjoy at least one course more than another.


      [h1]Negatives[/h1]


      It is really lame that trading cards were not continued for the [i]Space Pilgrim
      Academy [/i] series.  But who can blame the developer?  The trading cards in
      the four [i]Space Pilgrim Episodes[/i] hardly commanded any demand, but this
      is good for card collectors to not only get themselves an easy Level 5 badge,
      but also even a foil badge for really cheap!  (Aspiring Steam card collectors
      should know that a user does not have to own a game in order to buy trading
      cards to a game.)


      Like all of the other games in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i], [i]Space Pilgrim
      Academy: Year 1[/i] does not support the Steam overlay, so unless the player
      is one of the chosen few people on Steam that were granted magical powers to
      do so, the player won''t be able to show off all of the silly quotes and bad
      puns to their friends.


      [h1]Conclusion[/h1]


      First the author finds himself writing a review for a game in the [i]Space Pilgrim
      Saga[/i] for the fun of writing a review.  Then the author writes a review to
      help satisfy Steam''s algorithm so that achievements earned in-game will be
      counted on the player''s profile.  Then the author writes a review because a
      friend wanted to read the review.  (Sadly, that person unfriended the author.  The
      friend must not have liked being accused of "blasphemy" for not yet owning every
      game in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i].)  Now the author finds himself writing
      a review for a game in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] because [i]Pilgrim Adventures[/i]
      specifically asked the fans to write reviews. (As much as it peeves the author
      to write reviews for games that he didn''t receive for free.)


      Indie gold?  Try indie platinum!  The author is a lifelong lover of management
      games and has an ooey-gooey soft spot for trashy visual novels with anime girls,
      so it should speak volumes that the author considers himself a huge fan of a
      game that isn''t in either of the two aforementioned genres.
