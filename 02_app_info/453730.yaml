    review: 'For the price, this is a fairly interesting game.


      When I first purchased Borstal, it was still in an early stage of development
      and had many glitches.  The mountain scenario, especially, felt very random,
      and certain events made absolutely no sense.  For instance, I recall when if
      I simply moved, I would die suddenly and without any prior warning; essentially
      for no reason at all.


      While there are still some random events in each scenario, you are not always
      destined to doom or success based on how the map generates during a round of
      play.  I think that aspect of the game could be fine tuned even further, but
      then, this is a game about survival.  Sometimes, despite our best efforts, things
      happen.  The real question is that of how you will adapt to your environment
      and which resources you will choose in order to face the expected and the unexpected
      challenges ahead of you.


      Both scenarios are short and can be completed in less than 10 minutes, but you
      will not discover everything about each scenario in one round, or even two rounds.  Until
      this week, I encountered storylines that I had not previously seen, having already
      played each scenario dozens of times.  So replay value is high.


      This game will not appeal to everyone, but if you are a casual gamer or you
      need a short game to play everyday before work/school/bed, Borstal may be just
      what you are looking for.'
