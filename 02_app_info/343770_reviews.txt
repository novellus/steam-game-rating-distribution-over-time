I don't think that's been done before, which is why it was on my wishlist.\n\nWhile I only played the game for 4 minutes, the experience was unbearable and had enough bugs to make this game \"definitely not worth your money\".\n\n1. Player movement is extremely slow. We're definitely talking \"turtle speed\" here, in comparison to how fast the player drops due to gravity.\n\n2. Stars and other items (even the exit!) can only be collected when standing on solid ground, making some stars uncollectable (and I'd hazard a guess at \"some levels unbeatable\") as well.\n\n3. A lives mechanic in a puzzle game?! No thank you.\n\nThree counter-puzzle-experience drawbacks in the first 4 minutes; is it any wonder why I would consider this an insult to the whole puzzle genre? Definitely don't buy this. Hell, at this point, I'd have to ask the developer to pay me money to keep me playing (under the guise of \"bug-testing\").\n\nA lesson to you, developers: Make sure your game's actually designed right. Don't just release your game and forget about it; listen to the feedback of the community (or hire some playtesters to make sure the game is alright!). I could certainly wait, at least, if the developer showed any signs of listening to feedback, but given that this game's been out for a whole year and it's still this buggy, I don't think the developer even remembers that he made this.\n\nI'd refund this, but like [i]Rolling Shapes[/i], I had bought the game long before I had started playing it, during one of Steam's many sales. Still, even [i]Rolling Shapes[/i] is worse than this, because this game actually starts off with puzzles. Just not very good ones.\n\nAll in all, a piece of garbage that deserves NO money.\n\nEDIT: It looks like Steam actually requires you to play the game for 5 minutes before you can review it. Amazing. I literally have to slog through more of this game just to tell people that it's junk. My previous comment about the developer having to pay me to play it no longer stands for the next minute I need to play the game.","timestamp_created":1472414772,"timestamp_updated":1472414772,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530611336231231689","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwss2w6dYCd9qXYA=="}
