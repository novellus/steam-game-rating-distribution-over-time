My 2nd SRW series game after the old GBA SRW D, which was like decades ago. The V inherited all the epic strength of D, and added new elements like more user-friendly control and bonus scenario, skill setting based on blood-type and birthday, secret stages and surely many things not discovered yet, needless to mention high-quality and detailed graphics and animation. Be ready for some surprise though, esp the final stage, for a moment I thought I was done for, but press on and \"miracle\" do happen sometimes and gives hope ... all in all, good story, good character and good game!","timestamp_created":1610261557,"timestamp_updated":1610261557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48K3E9fYCfMSAwgI="}
