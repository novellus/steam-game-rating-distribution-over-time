You start outnumbered and outclassed. Your british Chieftains are heavily outnumbered and you cant expect to hold the line with them forever. So you give ground slowly...then faster...then most your tanks are getting destroyed. Round after round. Loosing ground and giving it freely so you can retreat.\nAnd when you think all is lost...enemy around you...cant hold anymore....BAM THE REINFORCEMENTS! THE RAGGED IRANIAN 92nd with new M 60 TANKS !!!\nAnd the winds of war change direction. The soviets give ground but for each casualty of their own they try to make us pay with blood. Yet they cant hold. They fall back and in the end the operation is ours !\n\n\nSo yeah this DLC is worth every cent. Its great.\nWhile this game is set in a fictional history ( Iran vs Soviets in afghanistan 79), you can easily imagine this as one of the operations in the Iraq Iran war.\n\nBUY IT!","timestamp_created":1562961058,"timestamp_updated":1562961058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543739259243011475","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjaPv8+sCfbiczgE="}
