    about_the_game: Angry Arrows is a cooperative archery game about rescuing hostages
      from enemy strongholds using nothing but bows and arrows.<br><br>Angry Arrows
      will leave you excited, eager for more, and probably a little miffed. Remember,
      just one fatal mistake and it's back to square one. With a team of up to four
      players, communication is the key to victory. Use stealth to sneak around enemies
      and pick them off one at a time. Or rush in, arrows-first, and pray things go
      according to plan. With such open and dynamic gameplay, the possibilities are
      endless.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Four intense
      game modes<br></li><li> Tough enemies, leaving you dead in your tracks<br></li><li>
      Experience the entire game with up to 4 players<br></li><li> In-Game Store featuring
      unlocks to spice up gameplay<br></li><li> Full Controller Support, with simple,
      yet responsive controls</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Game Modes</h2><strong>Campaign
      Mode</strong><br>Make your way through 25 demanding levels designed to test
      your skills and accuracy. Be warned, these levels are guaranteed to cause yelling
      and anger (no pun intended).<br><br><strong>Gladiator Mode</strong> <br>Enter
      the Colosseum and work together to fight off increasingly difficult waves of
      enemies coming from all directions. When fighting in the Colosseum, players
      have the option to revive their fallen teammates, if clear from any crossfire.
      Or, the last remaining player can defeat the rest of the wave alone, if they
      are brave enough.<br><br><strong>Rogue Mode</strong><br>Rescue a hostage hidden
      deep in a randomly generated forest. A player can either enter their own level
      seed or let the game create one. Pausing the game while playing in Rogue Mode
      will allow players to see the seed. This is useful for any player who wants
      to write it down and play the same level again in the future. Rogue mode provides
      players with an infinite number of challenging missions sure to test even the
      best player's abilities.<br><br><strong>Versus Mode (2 player minimum)</strong><br>Tired
      of working together? Shoot your friends! Brawl with your friends on the Versus
      Island, featuring four various modes:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <u>Extraction</u>
      - Retrieve the hostage from the center and bring her back to your spawn while
      defending her from the other players.<br></li><li><u> King of the Key</u> -
      Grab the key from the center and hold on to it for a total of 45 seconds.<br></li><li>
      <u>Deathmatch</u> - Good old-fashioned deathmatch. First to 15 kills wins.<br></li><li>
      <u>Mine Game</u> - Deathmatch with a twist. Players now hurdle landmines at
      each other instead of shooting arrows.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">The Store</h2>Whenever
      a player kills an enemy in the game, that enemy will drop gold coins for any
      player to pick up. Players compete to see who can collect the most coins during
      a level. Though, at the end of any level, win or lose, all coins from each player
      will pile together and add to the overall collective stash. Using this stash,
      players can unlock and purchase a variety of arrows, such as <i>Medusa Arrows</i>.<br><br>The
