    short_description: Play as the Grim Reaper in an FPS that draws huge inspiration
      from Retro FPS mechanics. You'll fight your way through the levels funded by
      the souls of your enemies where one bullet could be the difference between a
      well deserved victory or a broken 'R' key.
