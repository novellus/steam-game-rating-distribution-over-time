    review: "Well here\u2019s my 5 years late review of Kyn.\n\nIts not a bad game,\
      \ its not a good game either. Sort of an action RPG of sorts but I didn\u2019\
      t get far enough to say any more.\n\nI had the usual 4k monitor problems. Game\
      \ runs at 3840x2160 looks nice enough, except the interface is so small as to\
      \ be unreadable. Positively microscopic. So back to 1920x1080 we go. It was\
      \ written in 2015 after all.\n\nGameplay feels a bit clunky, character movement\
      \ especially. R-Click, R-Click, R-Click, R-Click, and R-Click, again.\n\nIn\
      \ my 1 hour gametime, I had one crash to desktop. Playing on Normal I couldn\u2019\
      t get past the first \u201Cmission\u201D or very early combat where you face\
      \ 4 enemies. Tried twice. There is no AutoSave so you have to start at very\
      \ beginning.\n\nLike so many people have said it\u2019s a shame Steam don\u2019\
      t have a Neutral vote. But they don\u2019t so im saying this game is worth a\
      \ 49% meaning it just about gets the thumbs down.\n\nSome games hook you in\
      \ and you can\u2019t wait for more, im afraid this one didn\u2019t. Hour 2,3,4,5\
      \ might be amazing but if you aren\u2019t hooked in the first hour your never\
      \ gonna see it. I  wonder if this was the devs first game, and if it was they\
      \ did very well, but its not quite there.\n\n\n"
