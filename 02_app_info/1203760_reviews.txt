I also don't like that the pieces don't stay together. when building something complex ( more than three + pieces) the pieces detach and fall to the ground. My 8 year old, who loves building things (self proclaimed minecraft master) lost interest in this game in about 30 minutes. his reason \" the pieces don't do what i want them to do\" When the logic of the game is to build something then the pieces should stay together. Should have a glue or lock function so they don't come apart. At this point I can't recommend this  game to anyone it needs some work.","timestamp_created":1606074448,"timestamp_updated":1606074448,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542522013187408447","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiOff+PUCe8P4rwI="}
