    review: "This DLC gives you access to the Resource Collector and it's really good\
      \ for new players to collect the different types of drops by monsters like RC,\
      \ GC, BC, TC, BS, IE, PE, EE, FE automatically without having to do it yourself\
      \ while playing or afk. Once you unlock each pet in-game and get them leveled\
      \ to about level 30 this DLC becomes pretty worthless since the in-game pets\
      \ will start collecting much faster with each level. \n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=873140323]Steam\
