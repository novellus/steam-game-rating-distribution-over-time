I was one of the people who actually really liked 1/2 Genie Hero's attempt to shake up the typical Shantae formula with stages instead of the more traditional metroidvania dungeons and regions, but this game returns to something a little more typical for Shantae's method of interacting with the world. It does reuse a lot of 1/2 Genie Hero assets which, honestly, I'm fine with, I don't need a new image of what a Crab looks like every new game. My one complaint, though, is that I want it to be just a pinch harder. I've faced down against three dungeon bosses so far without running into any real problems, and I have nearly every upgrade in the game's shops. Maybe I'm on the cusp of meeting some truly taxing bosses, and maybe there's more upgrades coming around the corner, but so far I feel like I'm running out of core mechanics to explore and am hitting that old adventure-game standby of going to every room in sequence and trying out every item and power to see if I can find new interactions (here's to the Metroidvania and Adventure Game formats!) All in all, though, the game's funny, the mystery's mysterious, and while all of the cutscenes keep breaking into crazy artifacts I'm still having a good time anyway.","timestamp_created":1609846795,"timestamp_updated":1609846795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r5WW6fYCc6DWwAI="}
