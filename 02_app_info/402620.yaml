    reviews: "\u201CKindred Spirits on the Roof is an excellent visual novel, yuri\
      \ romance focused or otherwise. Every character is imbued with a fantastic personality\
      \ and the story is both light and heavy in proper measure. Reading through the\
      \ main storyline is an absolute joy. It is fairly pricey at $35, but the quality\
      \ and potential time spent is more than worth it. You\u2019ll be extremely hard-pressed\
      \ to find something more heartfelt than Kindred Spirits on the Roof.\u201D<br>4/5\
