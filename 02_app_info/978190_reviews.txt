The game has its flaws, but is still worth the price tag.\n\nWhen it was over after about two hours I wished there was more. The game has four levels divided into several section, where at the level end a boss awaits. You have your basic sword attack, a magic fireball, that consumes mana and a healing potion, that you can use a few time. All these mechanics can be upgraded by items you find in chests though the game. There are a few other mechanics you can buy, like a double jump.\n\nSome technical issue I noticed are button presses, that are not registered sometimes (e.g. the double jump) and some minor slow downs. If you read the forum the slowdowns can be much more serious, as other people reported. Another issue are the settings, which are quite limited (no v-sync, no button remapping) and are presented in an overlay UI, that doesn't fit the pixel style and feel out of place.\n\nI hope the developer someday revisits its games, like they did for 1001 Spikes, to turn the \"neat\" from the beginning into a \"great\".","timestamp_created":1609180835,"timestamp_updated":1609180835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y92p1fYCdIOYvgI="}
