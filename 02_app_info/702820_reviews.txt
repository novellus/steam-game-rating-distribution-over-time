And even if there aren‘t a lot of areas, there‘s much to see and you are getting rewarded for exploring.\nYou play 6 different characters, which you can interchange within battle. Every characters has a unique set of skills, while there‘s still room for customization by using scrolls, that give them additional skills or attributes. You find the scrolls by exploring or doing side-quests.\nAs the description says, there are no usable items within battle, so you have to rely on tatics and use the skills of your characters. This is done really well and makes you to learn about your characters skills and how to use them properly.\nThe developer is very responsive and seems to put a lot of passion in his work. There were some minor points that disturbed me about his game, and he was very accessible to critisism. I'm looking forward to see more of his work.\nIf you are a fan of RPGs with turn-based combat, i can really recommend this game. I spent about 20 hours, never got bored and still miss one achievement that I‘m willing to find.\nTherefore, if you like the genre, I can whole-heartedly recommend it.","timestamp_created":1560810095,"timestamp_updated":1560811336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5325203537940979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlN7ms+sCeKDPwwE="}
