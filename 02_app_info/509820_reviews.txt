A few tricks missed in the variety of scenery and enemies, and the movement is not as free-flowing as the original. Otherwise great fun with heaps of great play modes and upgrades. Particularly good in two player mode.","timestamp_created":1593398841,"timestamp_updated":1593398925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504132270812988281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47ML+/vICfPeakQI="}
