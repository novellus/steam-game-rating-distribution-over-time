    review: ' Foxfolk is a case study for indie game dev time eficiancy. The amount
      of time that probalby went into this vs the amount of time and enjoyment someone
      can get out of it is amazing. This is what you need to do for a first game in
      the indie scene. There is no fullscreen function, no controller functionality.
      The main menu is very barebones, Its done in a lowres pixelart style, and the
      main character has a very limited spriteset There isnt even an up or down sprite
      even though you spend about half the time going north or south. All of this
      saves devtime which is what you want when you are putting out your first game.
      That being said it was an enjoyable expirence. The pixelart graphics were A
      strong point. The trees look very realistic. These arent your normal lollypop
      every tree is the same type things no. They actually look like they were modeled
      off of real trees in wintertime and there are many different types. As the day
      goes on there are various lighting effects that happen with the snow and trees
      that look like they must have been done by hand instead of some particle shader.
      In foxfolk you are a fox just trying to survive the winter mostly by looking
      for sticks and hunting animals. Wood can be a hastle to find. You dont know
      how many times I wished my fox could use an axe. They have a fireplace and a
      stove you would think they would be smart enough to use an axe. So many times
      the wifefox and kidfoxes are freezing in the burrow because I cant find any
      wood while Im surrounded by trees.  In order to win in this game I had to constantly
      jump to go faster. Its a cheat you know well if you have played games like skyrim.
      I dont know if its possible to win without spam-jumping.'
