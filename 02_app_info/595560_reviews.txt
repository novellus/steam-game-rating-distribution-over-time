One of the most unique games on its roster by far has to be the ambitiously oddball Legend of Hand.  You play as a rising and rather goofy Kung-Fu journeyman whose fellow men & women as well as their lands are falling into disarray.  Off you go on a colorful quest to find the elusive Grandmaster Hand; a mythical legend with the powers on *hand (broke the game with this lousy pun, sorry)* to restore order.  \n\nWithout giving too, too much away, I feel like Cloak and Dagger spent about a month meditating in some remote cabin with electricity, doing nothing but watching old Kung-Fu movies, playing Earthbound and 90s point n' click adventures and ingesting platefuls of raw San Pedro.  \n\nAt the length in which I like to keep my reviews there's far too much going on in the Legend of Hand to explain and have a snowball's chance in hell of making any sense to anybody skimming these words.  There's puzzling, point n' click fetch n' find, mini-games, RPG elements including the trading of goods/talking to NPCs in town settings, I mean Hesus Christo there's even a somewhat raw n' barebones role-playing combat system with turn-based battle coming into play...  Not everything that you do is cooked up fully in terms of gameplay elements but even with some of the quirks and shortcomings the gameplay is original and keeps you guessing as to what you might get up to next.  \n\nThe game looks and sounds great with colorful graphics that feel like a Far East version of Earthbound that took place solely in meditative martial arts master Pu's place of origin.  There's great attention to details in the towns and as simple as the combat is I had a good time with it.  I mean this is a game where not only do you get to do some fishing to help acquire needed items, you also get to become a fish as well.  I'm making sense?  Right, I sure as hell am not.  \n\nOverall, Legend of Hand has to be experienced to truly understand what rabbits it's pulling out of its gui sleeves.  The game is also surprisingly long and packed with content for its meager price.  If you're looking for a combination of point n' click and role-playing I think this is a great pick but be warned there's a chance you're going to love it for its originality or be completely turned off by its host of oddities.  It's a tough call but for my money this still might be my favorite Cloak and Dagger game.","timestamp_created":1601150180,"timestamp_updated":1601150180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqpv/5fQCeMyipAI="}
