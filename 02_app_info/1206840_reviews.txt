We are working on both this project and another one that I assure you that if you are going to love it, this game has been running since after August, but you just have to remember that we are a small studio, in fact, there is only one person behind all this , however, thanks for trying our game. Greetings and we regret each of the problems you might have."}],"cursor":"AoJw+ILixu8Cetaa6gE="}
