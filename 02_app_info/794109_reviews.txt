The aircraft flew well and realistic flight response . Only real disapointment was the sound , how could you mess up a  P-51 merlin engine but they did , engine sounds awful like a sports car not a Mustang Like I said its looks and flies wonderful just turn down the sound \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1598669014,"timestamp_updated":1598669014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv6iGnPQCd+q3ngI="}
