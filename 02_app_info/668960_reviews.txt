I have played probably more than a hundred visual novels so I play these games all the time.  It may seem generic but it's really good with special effects too. \n\nThe middle is tedious but the beginning and especially the end was amazing. \n\nIt's a unique story with good art and music plus a lot of special effects. \n\nIt's really not short especially for only $8 - great value for the money and a great way to spend around 4 hours.","timestamp_created":1560120430,"timestamp_updated":1560120457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.657766103744506836","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48p6bn+sCffGNwwE="}
