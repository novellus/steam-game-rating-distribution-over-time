It kicks the ass of most other steam DLCs in pretty much all regards.\n\nThe detail is very nice and everything is well animated. The firebox casts flickering orange light into the cab as you add coal. Very nice.\n\nThe sounds are incredible, and you can press Shift+Space to turn the HUD brake lever into an incremental whistle lever, enabling some very pretty and very realistic whistle patterns.\n\nComes in a bajillion versions, from the Alaska Railroad in North America to the Soviet national railway, and literally everything in between (that used S160s).  With the large variety of loco versions comes a large variety of rolling stock featuring many bits of military equipment on flatcars (Soviet, British, French, and American equipment), tank cars for oil and aircraft fuel, and brake vans (including one with US couplers, making for a neat sight on American rails!)\n\nI can't stress enough how fantastic this DLC is. It drives very well, and isn't prohibitively finicky like some steam DLCs.  Simple yet realistic, and a very powerful locomotive for its size. The S160 is a surefire hit for anybody regardless of regional preference, simply due to the diversity of the loco and the pleasure it is to drive. I'd even go as far as to say it's worth the full price, if only to support the dev (Victory Works)\n\nOh, and there's more than one whistle. It varies from loco to loco. There's a lot of features, its hard to remember them all! stop reading this, get it!!","timestamp_created":1598860470,"timestamp_updated":1598860470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw79TgofQCe4rzngI="}
