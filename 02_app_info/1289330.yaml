    review: 'Nice graphics, very smooth textures.

      The levels are passed in one go. I went through them all very easily and with
      pleasure.

      The game itself is not difficult, but for fans of this genre it is very suitable.

      Let me remind you that this is the second game from this developer and he is
      very generous, he made an excellent sale of his games with big discounts.'
