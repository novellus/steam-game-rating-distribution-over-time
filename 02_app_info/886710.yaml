    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">What is Lavender</h2>Lavender is a community
      driven social sandbox centered around users expressing themselves and having
      a great time. We want our users to be able to create and share their ideas in
      an easy and intuitive manner. We support both VR and Desktop players together
      on the same server. We are working hard to make sure you can create exactly
      what you imagine with ease. Personal expression is one of the cornerstones of
      VR. In order to satisfy this requirement, we pack a full customizable avatar
      system with outfits, physics, gestures and visemes. <br><br><strong>We want
      you to be whatever you want to create.</strong><br><br>One of our goals with
      Lavender was to make the smoothest possible VR experience for our users. To
      accomplish this Lavender is built on the newest version of Unity: Unity 2019.3.0b12,
      using Unity''s newest ECS and DOTS technology. This gives us amazing performance,
      while also pushing what''s possible in a video game like this. We provide an
      experience that can scale from a few players to hundreds in a single server,
      VR ''Full-body'' and Desktop players alike.<h2 class="bb_tag">Current key Features</h2><ul

      notes: This game contains users created content that may contain mature content.
        We do have a content filtering and flagging system that allows you to only
        see what you want to. Most of the mature content should be behind an age gate
        but because the system is automated there may be some things that slip through.
        To remedy this we have a flagging system in place for users to flag content
        that is not labeled as mature but really is.

    review: This "game" is the equivalent of a IKEA furniture that is missing a few
      screws and bolts and that you have to completely assemble by yourself without
      any proper instructions. The community just consists of disappointed VRChat
      refugees, you can always hear them complaining about "how things will get better
      with time". Save yourself some time and just make an empty VR Unity project
      with a mirror, it would be the same experience.Their website and description
      is hyping up this project as if it is the next big social VR game. There is
      absolutely nothing original about this. This is a pure cashgrab.The controls:What
      utter shite to play this with Vive wands. A simple touch on the trackpad sends
      you flying across the room. Vive trackers also seem not to work and there is
      no description on how to make them work.The UI:As soon as you start the game,
      you get greeted with the default Unity message and get thrown into a green scenery
      and a mirror. From there on, you're on your own. You are also not allowed to
      log in unless you link your steam account.The SDK:It is just barebones. You
      make a unity project, you set an avatar component on your model, define the
      visemes, viewpoint, click a button and take the exported file to their website
      and upload it.Simple enough, though again, no working full body tracking, no
      eye tracking and it also tends to break certain models for some reason and there
      is absolutely no option to debug. Everything about it is bugged.The pricetag
      on this junk is just the biggest middle finger and insult.
