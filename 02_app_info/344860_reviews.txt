This version boasts two new, huge never before seen, updates that add extra monsters, quests, bosses and a variety of extras! This also includes the first Crystal Story for those looking to have the full story to this point. It's a linear turn-based RPG that has just the right amount of charm to keep you hooked to see you through the end. I highly recommend this game to the returning fans coming from NG/Kong who've played the browser based versions and I can't recommend it enough to anyone who enjoys a flash game made with a lot of love. Taking both games into consideration, you've got yourself yourself at least 10-12 hrs of game (minus grinding equips to max) with a rather silly cast of heroes as they embark on a journey to discover who is behind the invasion of the Dargons! (yes, Dargons!)\n\nTwo great games for under $5.00? Great! Plenty of achievements? Awesome! Trading Cards? Awesome! What are you waiting for?!\n\nAnd as if you couldn't get enough, Crystal Story: The Hero and the Evil Witch is available now!","timestamp_created":1423277681,"timestamp_updated":1608573905,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":84,"votes_funny":10,"weighted_vote_score":"0.842650890350341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hr2ew/YCe+LkNg=="}
