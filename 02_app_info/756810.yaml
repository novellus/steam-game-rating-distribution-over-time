    review: "I'e always liked this game. I've played it +1000 hours on a different\
      \ account. \n\nIt's very simple, easy to learn, a lifetime to master. \n\n5\
      \ different types of humans, plus a pod species much like Alien(s). You can\
      \ choose or do it random. Six different maps. 1-on-1 up to 5-on-1. You can call\
      \ it a city builder, but then again, you could call Napoleon an adventurer.\n\
      \nNever plays the same way twice."
