    review: "This game is not worth $10. However, there was a good amount of care\
      \ put into it for the small amount of people who worked on it. It is a COMPLETE\
      \ game, but it still feels as though it is missing something. It only took maybe\
      \ an hour or so to beat, it went a lot faster once I realized killing the enemies\
      \ has no purpose whatosever and you can just run past them. Its got a small\
      \ story told through found logs, 4 bosses, and maybe 5 weapons.\n\nAll the weapons\
      \ suck except for 2, the fireball and the rocket. They are slow, clunky, and\
      \ the accuracy is abysmal which really describes the movement entirely since\
      \ there's no run button and you walk and jump at such a leisurely pace despite\
      \ being in mortal danger. \n\nThe enemy variety is relatively high for such\
      \ a short game, and they are pretty well created as well, however their attacks\
      \ range from annoying to useless as projectiles are easily dodged. I was not\
      \ \"worried\" about any of the enemies since they pose little actual threat,\
      \ just a time sink mostly.\n\nBosses were great! Each had at least 2 attacks,\
      \ and while they trivially were easy, I really didn't expect this game to have\
      \ such well done animations and attacks, this is a big plus.\n\nWorld design\
      \ was good as well, despite the simple pixel palette they used, its enough to\
      \ signify where you are in the map just by looking at the walls, this was a\
      \ really good choice and a the overall maze/metroidvania style of how you progress\
      \ through it was kind of cool. It was just complex enough so you'll remember\
      \ *most* of the previously inaccessible passages by the time you get a new item\
      \ to open them.\n\nStory was kind of ehh, I didn't really expect much from this\
      \ and really didn't get much. Not very compelling but I think that's also a\
      \ symptom of the meaningless gameplay. The only real progress you get is when\
      \ you get a new gun, when you die, and god forbid you do, you are reset to the\
      \ last checkpoint and all enemies respawn. This wouldn't be so bad if they weren't\
      \ agonizingly long distances apart sometimes.\n\nI will give this game a gold\
      \ star for being a 100% complete game with all the features a game should have,\
      \ I ran into no glitches and I was able to complete it and get everything the\
      \ game had to offer me without too much issue. It's sad that I have to say that\
      \ because a lot of games that look like this end up being gigantic messes or\
      \ asset flips, but this is not that. It had a very reasonable scope and accomplished\
      \ everything it set out to do.\n\nMy biggest complaint about the game is that\
      \ killing enemies doesn't do anything for you other than get them out of the\
      \ way, in Metroid they would occasionally drop items, in this there is no reason\
      \ not to run right past them if you are able to. I see that some of the game\
      \ level features were designed with you having to kill the enemies in mind,\
      \ I was able to completely ignore these once I realized it was optional. Maybe\
      \ a score or something?\n\nThis is NOT a bad game for being a crappy quality\
      \ game, this is a subpar game with a very tiny scope that doesn't do anything\
      \ wrong, but isn't particularly noteworthy either. For $10, hell no, your money\
      \ is better spent. However I would pay attention to this dev in the future as\
      \ this seems like it's their first game and they might improve in another one."
