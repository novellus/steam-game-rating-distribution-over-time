    review: 'Note: Don''t be fooled by the playtime. I played the majority of the
      game in offline mode because of a glitch that could crash the game in online
      mode. As proof of my actual playtime, look for my LP of the game on Youtube.


      [h1]Intro[/h1]


      [i]The Great Gaias[/i] is a RPG Maker game based on the developers'' Tenat D&D
      campaign, and as such has a lot of worldbuilding concerning the gods, different
      races, and countries. The main protagonist is Pots, a thief guild member who
      quits after a mission forces him to do something he regrets. After escaping
      from a slave ship with some new party members, Pots and his new friends discover
      they''re actually the chosen ones of a prophecy, which may be the chance for
      redemption that he''s looking for.



      [h1]Writing Quality[/h1]


      Like I mentioned in a forum post, Pots''s sinful deed feels awkwardly written,
      since he regrets the deed while he''s in the middle of it. His completion of
      the deed is necessary for a villainous character''s development, but I feel
      like there should have been an additional factor to incentivize Pots into betraying
      his conscience and finishing the deed.


      While Pots is the main character, many other characters get their chance to
      shine with their own inner conflicts and personal sidequests, but some of them,
      such as Hiro and Caelia, get left with little to no meaningful character arcs.
      It just feels like they exist merely to ensure that we can fill out all the
      slots in the character selection map. I feel like Hiro in particular had a lot
      of potential due to his blood relations with one of the major villains, but
      the two don''t seem to acknowledge their blood relation at all.


      My favorite part of the game is when where we explore the main enemy nation,
      which does a good job of showing how the fascist government uses propaganda,
      military worship, and secretly enforces famine to manipulate citizens against
      the elves. Additionally, it''s shown that the citizens are otherwise normal
      people and some of them can see through their government''s BS, though some
      like Eldromus are beyond redemption. I find that a lot of games that try to
      make their bad guys racist and fascist often skip the important developments
      that lead to such ideas being normalized, so I''m glad this game put effort
      into covering that. That said, I wish we could see what life is like for the
      second-class, non-military associated members of the empire.


      Also, the fascist part isn''t hyperbole, since one of the military school teachers
      quotes the Norsefire from V for Vendetta.


      [h1]Gameplay[/h1]


      tl;dr play easy or normal instead of Core Rules for the most consistent experience,
      unless you want bragging rights for Youtube.


      In most games, skills and normal attacks tend to have similar accuracy unless
      stated otherwise. On Core Rules, physical skills have accuracy penalties while
      having fairly powerful effects. Personally, I would have preferred weaker but
      more accurate skills so that there''s still some challenge while reducing the
      RNG factor, since I''m the type of person who is nettled by wasted turns and
      resources. The accuracy rate is saner on the easier difficulties, so I recommend
      going for those if you have a similar mindset.


      For resource management, AP is random and rather low at the start of each battle,
      which is understandable because some of the later AP skills are too powerful
      to use at the start of battle. The MP situation is pretty bad in the beginning
      though, since your mages have low starting MP and therefore won''t benefit much
      from their equipment''s passive MP regen. Like with physical skills, this is
      supposed to be balanced by how magic skills are powerful enough to justify their
      cost. However, the mages really need to have an even lower tier of magic spells
      that do less damage and cost less than 5 MP, since the 5 MP spells are overkill
      for early enemies. Again, the lower difficulties alleviate this by giving you
      more starting MP.


      Like [i]Nocturne: Rebirth[/i], you can change equipment in the middle of battle
      without using up a turn, which really helps if you''re playing blind and don''t
      know what ailments the enemies will use. You can also do 1000 IQ maneuvers like
      equipping a new auto-revive accessory after using the old one up.


      The bosses are balanced with the expectation that you''re using buffs and debuffs
      wisely. Some of them also have interesting mechanics, like the bonus bosses
      of the final sidequest, though some mechanics will take a lot of trial and error
      to figure out unless you read the Steam guide. Still, it''s better than simply
      fighting vanilla beatsticks all the time.


      The game is really grindy, since you have to manage 16 characters by the end
      of the game. In such a situation, you''d expect that maybe the inactive party
      members would get half or quarter EXP, but they get absolutely no EXP. Oh, and
      there are story events that will force you to use specific characters or exclude
      specific characters, which means you cannot just bet everything on your favorite
      party. I get that the developers want players to use all the characters and
      watch them grow in levels, but according to the forum posts, people are trying
      to stick to only their faves, only to be frustrated when they run into events
      that force them to use their neglected party members. The only thing that makes
      up for this is that you will find situations where some characters are better
      suited than others, but there''s also a very obvious tier list in terms of their
      overall usefulness and some characters feel like Masters of None, making it
      tempting to play favorites in leveling them.


      There is a lot of equipment with special effects, and everyone has their own
      unique green/purple text gear. However, mid-to-late game enemies are very spammy
      with very game-changing status effects, making it feel like you can''t really
      equip any Jewel other than status resist ones. There really needs to be a second
      jewel slot, allowing players to try out other types of jewels without fearing
      divine retribution from the enemy.


      The New City portion of the game is a town building minigame, but it''s implemented
      in the worst way possible. Instead of recruiting unique, meaningful, and interesting
      NPCs, you just enter and exit specific type of buildings to recruit anonymous
      NPCs of specific walks of life. Since every iteration of the town has its own
      Celestium Shards, you will have to spend quite a lot of time evicting and recruiting
      people just to get everything.


      [h1]Verdict[/h1]


      7/10, an average but long game. There''s interesting plot elements the further
      you go, but some early game writing and balancing could leave a bad first impression.
      Also, I feel like having a huge cast of characters hurts the game more than
      helps it, since not all of them are sufficiently developed and the EXP system
      and endgame crafting situation can''t really handle them all.'
