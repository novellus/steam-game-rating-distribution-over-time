You only have your bow to defend with. You do get to pick a upgrade/spell after a few waves which you can use if you hold an arrow pulled at max strength for a few seconds, but besides that you don't get anything else. The village has it's own HP along with you having separate HP as well. The game ends once you get hit enough, or enough minions reach the villagers.\n\nControls:\nPressing the A button on your right controller switches which hand is holding the bow, while you use the other hand to pull an arrow back with the other hand via the trigger button. You only stand in one spot, so there's no movement or teleportation, and you also can't rotate in-game.\n\nPros:\n- Variety of different enemies to kill, with some running straight at the entrance to your village, some summoning more minions and others that will attack you directly via projectiles or flying into you.\n- Some upgrades do make it easier to deal with groups of enemies or aims arrows for you\n- It's cheap at only $3 AU.\n\nNeutral:\n- Nothing really stood out either in sound or music\n- Some upgrades aren't that good, like the multi-shot upgrade.\n- You only stand in one spot, so it can be hard to hit some enemies\n\nCons:\n- Aiming the bow is weird/bad because it mainly follows the hand holding the bow, and it would regularly lose track from time to time or aim in a slightly or completely different direction. I've haven't had this issue in other archery games.\n- Once shot, the arrow is pretty quick at the beginning of the shot, then loses alot of it's speed near the end. It wasn't fun to shoot the bow.\n- There are no in-game options to change, nor is there any menu. I can't even quit the game unless I access the Oculus menu. (Oculus platforms can't access the steam VR menu in games when the bottom left button is disabled, like this one)\n- You can't re-centre where you are in-game, and there are no ways to rotate the camera so you have to rotate IRL.\n- It was quite common for the enemy remaining counter to display an extra 1 or 2 minions even though I couldn't find any others.\n- If you die and then start again, you'll get this afternoon like glow that doesn't go away.\n- The game did bug out on me and fully crash on me, with me having to take my headset off to close the game via desktop.\n\nSummary:\nEven though the game is sold for a very cheap price, the amount of issues annoys me too much, even if it was for free I wouldn't recommend it. It's a simple wave based VR Archery game held back by it's aiming issues, bugs and lack of any options.","timestamp_created":1608377899,"timestamp_updated":1608377899,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/+KyvfYCfeq0uwI="}
