    review: This game is a must-have for everyone who likes platformer games involving
      magnetism. What makes this game stand out among other similar titles is, that
      both electric fields and magnetic fields are present. The Shocktopus is charged
      positively, so it is repelled by positive electric field, whereas magnetic fields
      spin the Shocktopus.
