    review: "To be honest - you probably won't be able to make this one run, but it\
      \ seems like compatibility mode for Windows XP (Service pack 3) and 640x480\
      \ resolution works. \n\nIf you wonder wheter to by this or not - yes. Even though\
      \ it's a brutal old-school RTS where you might fail pretty soon, you will get\
      \ an access to an awesome soundtrack, which is worth the money alone :)"
