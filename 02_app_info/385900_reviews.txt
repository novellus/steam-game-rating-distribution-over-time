The world are wide and there are lot of things and places to explore. The story is deep and twisted. Even tho sometimes it was hard to find the quest items, but u can finish them all by doing some exploring and talking to a lot of NPC because their quests sometimes solve other quest. Overall it was a fun experience with this game.","timestamp_created":1605957468,"timestamp_updated":1605957468,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9seh9fUCcpDTrwI="}
