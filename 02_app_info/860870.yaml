    review: "I rarely give bad reviews for games, but I have to this time due to the\
      \ terrible controls for the Oculus Rift Touch controllers. Next to impossible\
      \ to pick up anything. If you find that you finally do, it's clunky.  Fix the\
      \ controls and I I'll try again.\n\nReview Update - 22-2-2019:\n\nSo I gave\
      \ this game another try after the developer posted an update.  \n\nPROS:  \n\
      \n1) The update definitely improved game play for the Oculus Rift.  The game\
      \ seems far more stable now.\n2) I found picking up items FAR easier to do.\
      \  \n3) Interacting with the world was really nice.  More interaction with the\
      \ world would be nice.\n\nCONS:\n\n1) I'm still not sure why it's called \"\
      Bully Store\".  It doesn't quite translate.  It's just a cooking sim.  Should\
      \ rename it to something more appropriate.  The name just doesn't fit, in my\
      \ opinion.  It's actually a bit misleading.\n2) Not a lot of interaction with\
      \ the world & not a lot of food combinations.  Which, in turn, makes the game\
      \ fun for about 20 minutes and it's over.\n\nWishes:\n\n1) More interaction\
      \ with the world with more food ingredient combos.\n2) Add the ability for a\
      \ 2nd player to help.\n\nI have to say that I am quite happy with the update.\
      \  Well done.  Keep up w/ the updates."
