Boss fights can also be fairly RNG-dependent, but that's another way of saying they're short and painful, which I don't dislike.\n\nThis one is a tossup for me. Some parts of it were pretty good, like the amount of options for dealing with the final conflict, and the amount of times the game remembers optional things you did earlier, enough that I'd give it a thumbs-up for being an amusing short game, but then there was that second continent...\n\n...eh, I'm feeling kind of merciful. Recommended, but with a warning that if you hate hugging up to a recovery point and grinding as much as I do, you might be very displeased with Broken Ties.","timestamp_created":1605468678,"timestamp_updated":1605468678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552128732204437256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9/zY5vUCf6LMrgI="}
