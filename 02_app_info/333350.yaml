    review: 'This is a great game! Cults and Daggers is a rare example of this sort
      of game being designed well, where it is actually engaging, fun to play, and
      true to the themes it involves. There are not many games of this genre of "Cult
      Simulation" around. I can only think of one other, called "Evil Cult" which
      is a free browser game that is also very fun and well designed, but much simpler
      than this. I highly recommend this game, especially if you ever wanted a good
      strategy game that simulates cult management and the religious, occult and supernatural
      themes involved. Along with this, the Classical Age setting and aesthetics,
      as well as the art design are marvellous.


      I really like this game and it has great potential to be expanded upon. I hope
      with future updates, the game mechanics are made more complex and fine-tuned.
      I also would love to see an expansion with a campaign setting in contemporary
      times.


      I finished the game recently. I saw from this that the game needs further development.
      Regardless, this programme is the kernel of a great game that needs more development
      for the game to properly flourish.'
