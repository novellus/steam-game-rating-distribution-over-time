    review: This is for the Weebos. Also fans of the old Double Dragon or Battle toads
      games, music included. Create a very limited character ( manga /anime, style
      but only like a dozen options and few colors. Don't expect too much ) with pixel
      graphics and off to your Shonen adventure. Create a Shonen character and get
      outfits and pets to help personalize him and sometimes get perks. Train in Shonen
      ways and journey a map beating up pixel baddies and bosses. All working for
      a End Game Boss called Kurowashi. Level up the Shonen skills in training like
      PUNCH and KICK and RUN with Kai you gain from defeating baddies. The more training
      the better you get.  Like actual training....DUH and travel the map like I said,
      beating one area to another. The pixel art is funny and neat sometimes for the
      baddies. Music is where I think if they had more of it and a rotation of different
      type songs, it would be solid to run on my computer in the background all the
      time. Catchy and old school. So if you like to stay idle and not even have to
      click here, and run a nifty Shonen through levels to head bop-ing music to defeat
      a pixel army and bad guy named Kurowashi,.. play young grasshopper.
