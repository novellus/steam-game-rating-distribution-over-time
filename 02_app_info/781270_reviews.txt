Back then this game was jaw dropping to look at compared to a lot of other games. I remember feeling like it was the pinnacle of graphics technology and there wasn't much else to go at that point. (I was a kid cut me some slack :) )\nFor me this is just a wonderful trip down nostalgia lane. But this will not be for everyone.\nIf you like on rails shooters and retro games, then give it shot. The campy cheese-ball story line and cut scenes just adds to its charm. \nThe level variation is nice, being that you only see a city in the screen shots. But there are levels that take place inside a computer, space, and even on a giant spaceship itself.\nHeck when I found out this gem got re-released I managed to get it on sale for less than $3. For that price I don't see how you can complain.\nThis game is not easy, but I did find myself getting better and farther with each play through. \nIf you are struggling there are ways to make it easier. You can lower cpu cycles in dosbox to the point where it doesn't register you are taking damage. There are also cheat codes.\nThe only thing I don't like is the muffled \"fire\" being yelled every time an enemy is in your crosshairs. But that's just a nitpick.","timestamp_created":1595694994,"timestamp_updated":1595694994,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpaq1w/MCf8K/lwI="}
