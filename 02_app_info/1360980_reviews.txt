What can be said about Fetish Locator week one that hasn't already been said... or spewed.. This wonderful game was made in the same vein as games like Being a Dik, Acting Lessons, man of the house and quite a few others..  While it doesn't really bring anything new or innovative to the table, it's a nice 4 - 5 hour experience for people with a more exotic palette.  While the aforementioned games (save Man of the house) were more vanilla experiences Fetish Located decides to do the full menu of extremes, exploring many different fetishes (except BBW, come on man, would it kill you to model a bigger girl for us BBW fans..  we can hope in week 2)  \n\nThe Story\n\nIn the story you play as (default name) Mike, a college student who gets introduced to a new sex app that is all the rage in his college..  The app rewards you with points for doing various sexual things and posting pictures to the app to earn points.. The points can be used for various things, viewing adult photos, buying tickets to a party, and I guess other things???  It's like Pokemon Go, but with less walking and more banging...   Mike downloads the app and immediately turns into a degenerate sex addict who bangs, plows, slurps, boofs, and generally slaps (you'll see) anything that walks..  I won't spoil the story for you but the game is totally worth the point of purchase for the Enemy scene alone.. \n\nGameplay \n\nWhile this game won't reinvent the wheel, it holds up as a good adult visual novel..  unlike many adult visual novels which just throw you right into the plowing, this game has a story, the story is pretty good. while not as emotionally invested as people were in a game like Acting Lessons, this game still manages to be engaging while at the same time making your flat fly at half mast most of the time. \n\nPro's \nGood story for an AVN\nexcellent art work\nnice flow...  major props for multiple redheads\n4 out of 5 on the fap o meter\nFairly easy and straightforward achievements (after all we play these games for the +1 right?)\n\nCon's\nLength of game (not shaft) \nNone???\n\nRecommendation \nWhile getting people with short attention spans to buy and play visual novels is alot like trying to get a kid to eat their green veggies, people who put aside their doubts and jump right in will be greeted with a nice 4 - 5 hour experience.  If you're like me you hunt achievements (Not Pixel Pussycats) so these games are necessary evils, least that's what you tell your gaming bros..   Should you buy this game,, yeah, it will leave you excited in many ways, and longing for more.. Plus redheads are hot... so...","timestamp_created":1609952219,"timestamp_updated":1609952219,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.663332939147949219","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ496mo7PYCd7uGwQI="}
