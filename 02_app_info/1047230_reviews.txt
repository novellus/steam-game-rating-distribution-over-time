I mean, I love ALL games, but card games really keep my attention far longer than a random FPS might. Beyond that, I love movies. As long as they take me to a place far away and the story is decent, I am there! Get where I am going with this? The Lord of the Rings ACG was an easy purchase to make as it combines all that I love. So it was a no brainer to pick up the expansion, The Shadow's Fall and dive in. The new heroes and cards made it totally worth the price.\n\nShadows Fall and its base game do not do anything different than most other card games. The concept, as always, is to outdamage your rival and survive to victory, which even in the single player can be a daunting feat at times. But I do love the challenge and this game brings it! Not only are you competing against the many denizens that  populate Middle-Earth, you are also always under the watchful eye of Sauron as well and although you may win the battle, you could certainly lost the war to The Dark Lord himself, as you see in my accompanied video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xMXhMzIL5w&feature=youtu.be","timestamp_created":1562711062,"timestamp_updated":1562711062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw38617OsCccT/zQE="}
