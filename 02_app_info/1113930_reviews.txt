[/spoiler] It took me 5.5 hrs to do this.  I had no desire to try to tackle the nightmare difficulty. Some mobs were massive bullet sponges already. \n5 levels total, with one being a wave/destroy all enemies stage. \nThe only bug was that after a death your hands could/will change positions. This is solved by just going back to the main menu.\n\nThe price was right and I had fun. If you can stomach some low budget indie with your RE, then perhaps this is right up yer alley.","timestamp_created":1572796511,"timestamp_updated":1572805903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541641712188720703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qbCime4CffmX1wE="}
