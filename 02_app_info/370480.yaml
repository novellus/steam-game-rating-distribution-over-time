      this non-shooting shoot ''em up, you are a single white pixel who can absorb
      the bodies, abilities, and weapons of every enemy pixel you collect. It''s up
      to you to stay either a small and nimble ship, or turn large and powerful. Just
      remember: protect your core white pixel, because every mistake could be your
      last. <br><br><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">INFINITE POSSIBILITIES</h2></strong><br>Every
      single enemy wave is randomized, and your size and power changes for every pixel
      you collect and destroy. There''s never one strategy that works for very long,
      because every playthrough is an entirely new experience. <br><br><strong><h2
      class="bb_tag">SIX DIFFICULTY MODES, UNFORGETTABLE BOSSES, and CO-OP</h2></strong><br>Each
      difficulty has new enemies, weapons, and bosses! Change your strategies and
      push your limits in each mode. See how you match up against friends and other
      players in the online leaderboards. <br><br>Two pixels are better than one.
      In local co-op mode, you and a friend can both collect enemy pixels independently.
      When one of you dies, the other can revive you simply by touching your pixel.
      <br><br>For an unforgettable challenge, Boss Rush mode will bombard you with
      all the bosses you''ve encountered throughout the game. How many can you survive?'

    review: 'Admittedly, I am no bullet haven sensi. This comes from a casual gamer
      who usually plays other less intensive shooters.


      Liked: Immensely enjoyed the absorbing not only other pixels, but also placement
      and rotation of the said pixels. This gives an avenue for less skilled bullet
      haven gamers (like myself). Flashing pixels help pinpoint projectiles. The tutorials
      are very helpful such as stating pixels that add not only structure but also
      speed.


      Disliked: Trouble discerning between friends and foes. Maybe use a specific
      color or aura to know if/when the pixel to use will fire pixels at you. Otherwise,
      hoped co-op would be available at least after the easiest so shooters like myself
      can survive.


      Overall, the price (especially at discount) is worth it with the innovative
      tetris-like element to change the bullet haven genre for some casual gamers
      (similar to the game that uses light or darkness to absorb same color projectiles).
      Right now, I would recommend other games like THOTH or geometry wars if you
      are a more casual gamer.


      If updated with either of the dislikes, I would update my review to recommend
      the game.'
