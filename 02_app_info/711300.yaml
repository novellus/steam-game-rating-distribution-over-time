    review: "[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]\n\n\
      I do recommend this game on sale. I got it for $3.59 USD and if you can find\
      \ it at the price or lower then you should definitely pull the trigger. Make\
      \ no mistake about it, this game is hard even on normal. I didn't try the game\
      \ on easy, but on normal difficulty you will die a lot just to get past the\
      \ first level.\n\nUnless you're an expert shot and a master at avoiding damage,\
      \ you will need to upgrade your weapons before you can successfully clear the\
      \ area. There's just an endless onslaught of enemies that spawn from everywhere.\
      \ It is not rare that you die because you ran out of bullets. \n\nI used free\
      \ locomotion to run around. However, you do need to set up full roomscale because\
      \ you can't turn with the joystick. And you need to be accurate to quickly take\
      \ down enemies, in front, behind, and to your sides. So you need to be able\
      \ to quickly turn and run in that direction. \n\nBe warned, there is a lot of\
      \ backtracking. I think this is to artificially inflate the length of the game.\
      \ Even after upgrading my guns, I found that I was going back to a place that\
      \ I had just been to collect another item in that same area. However, I found\
      \ the fast-paced action to be fun, even it was frustratingly difficult at times.\
      \ \n\nLuckily, upgrading isn't too difficult and easy especially after you upgrade\
      \ the first few times. Then you're able to kill more enemies and killing more\
      \ enemies leads to more upgrades. So it's slow at the start, but then you're\
      \ able to upgrade several things, making life all that much easier and more\
      \ fun as well. \n\nSo you do need patience to play this game. I enjoyed the\
      \ Duke Nuke'em style voiceover. It's an arcadey, action bullet hell story FPS\
      \ game. Heavy emphasis on the action part. The graphics were just okay but on\
      \ the bright side there was a nice variety of enemy types and weapons to unlock.\
      \ You also get special abilities you can unlock and upgrade as well.\n\nRate\
      \ 6/10. Buy on sale and enjoy the challenging arcade action shoot em up fun."
