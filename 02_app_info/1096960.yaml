    short_description: Escape a house caught in a tornado, before the gas ignites
      and the house is blown up with you in it. Oh, did we say that you also have
      to do this whilst the housing is spinning around, and in VR?

    review: "For only a few dollars, i'd say it was worth it!\n\nThis game will definitely\
      \ mess with your senses and that makes it worth it for me. It's a very short\
      \ game if you know where to go. The controls are funky, but manageable. \n\n\
