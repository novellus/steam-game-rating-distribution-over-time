Same old principle is present in Amber's Airline. This time you work at the airport and your dream is to become a stewardess. The game is very simple but pretty well written for such a small mobile-like game(is this on mobile too?).\n\nYou start your career at the airport gates. You check passengers, check their bag content, help people to put stuff into their bags, search people at the gate and so on. Some actions require to play a 3 second mini-game. You just do the simplified version of actions you'd do in the airport. \nThere are of course other levels with slightly different jobs so it won't be boring and repetitive since locations, story and your job are constantly changing.\nYou get a cut-scene before and after each level where the story is told. There also are challenges you need to keep an eye for while playing.\n\nThe biggest change comes with a completely new graphics engine. The game is now in 3D and it's for the best. The game still retains the old art-style and looks extremely cute only now the graphics a more clear, it feels like a proper PC game, not a low res mobile port.\nGameplay feels smoother too. There's less waiting, people request your assistance instantly so no more waiting fro 10 seconds until people make up their minds.\n\nThere's not a lot of bad things I could think of. Maybe sometimes the mouse click doesn't register if you do everything very quickly after the past action. Other than that i'm enjoying this improved version.\n\nGraphics are really pretty, this new engine works wonderfully and performs very well.\nSadly there are some issues with resolution. I'm on ultrawide monitor. While gameplay scenes seems acceptable (only black borders on both sides) the map is displayed in fullscreen which leads to some portions of the map cut off. There's no real windowed mode for some reason. If I put the game in windowed mode it displays the game at the same resolution in a window which leads to even bigger part of the screen being cut off.\nJust let me play it in 1080p window please.\n\nThis game reminds me of one of those TV movies women watch at Sundays. It's a good casual game with pretty graphics and interesting story. Worth getting for the fans of the franchise.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Good graphics\n[*]Fun gameplay\n[*]Interesting story\n[*]Good variety\n[*]Smooth gameplay\n[/list]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Can't choose a resolution\n[*]Sometimes clicks do not register\n[/list]\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32930811-Kosmos%27s-Cosmic-reviews/?appid=704030][h1]Follow my curator page for more[/h1][/url]","timestamp_created":1609341972,"timestamp_updated":1609341972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":37,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.805052101612091064","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4rWQ2vYCeILnvgI="}
