    review: 'I gave this a thumbs down when it released, but I''m glad to say that
      all the issues I faced before have gone. The graphics are not an eyesore anymore.
      There is a nice, almost cell-shaded look to them. The environment is stable,
      the droids are far less quirky to handle and the map, setup and weapons give
      it a ''Drone Unreal'' feel.


      Yeah, I''m really liking the direction it''s going in now. Well done guys for
      turning this into a fun game! :D


      So for the sake of clarity, this is my old review, which was a thumbs down:


      Ok, I don''t want to sound mean, and if there was a thumbs sideways option,
      I''d choose that one, not a thumbs down.


      The game needs work. It''s a fun concept, but at the moment the execution is
      choppy. I played this on my own against bots and then on local multiplayer with
      friends, and both times quit early due to all of us just not being able to take
      the crazy amount of flipping/tilting/spinning that goes on. The screen rotates
      when you do, pretty much like the old Alien game when you run on walls and ceilings,
      and it is visually overpowering. It''s so fast, with choppy scrolling inprecise
      aiming that at the moment it''s just chaos - not fun chaos like STICKFIGHT or
      ROCKET LEAGUE, but annoying, headache-inducing chaos.


      It needs to be slowed down slightly, and the players given a bit more weight
      or the scrolling made smoother - *something* to just give it that polish. Too
      scrappy right now, but keep an eye on development, it might turn into something
      better in time.


      Best of luck guys.'
