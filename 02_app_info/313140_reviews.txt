Well I can clearly say that it has nothing to do with them.\n-\tIt is some type of psycho-funny thriller with some gore elements. It is nice. At least not ordinary.\n-\tIt is fun, it is short but it is not a big deal.\n-\tYou will be curious to find out what happens at the end of the game.\n-\tBut you will forget its existence right after finishing it.\n-\tConsidering that it is an indie game, it is s good game actually, Fort the price it provides some good time.\n-\tOld Gamers: Do not expect something like sanitarium!\n-\tNo! The puzzles are not at mind shattering level. They can be mind shattering for limbecille racing and sport gamers though.\n","timestamp_created":1609249577,"timestamp_updated":1609249577,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535483837127685547","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gvuv1/YCcoi5vgI="}
