    review: '[h1]First of all, thank you...[/h1]


      Aaah.. All these memories, I had missed this universe sooo much.

      These games are my childhood.


      I literally cried when I heard that a new Drawn to life was coming out.


      I thought this story was over.

      Suddenly, 11 years later... BOOM! Here''s the sequel! Hard to believe, but it''s
      reality! Oh my..

      Wilfre had been defeated, Mike had woken up, so it wasn''t over yet?


      Well... like many, this game left me skeptical.


      The gameplay isn''t that bad. But...

      We don''t expect a puzzle game playing a Drawn to life so yes, it changes, why
      not, but I find that it does not fit well with the story.

      The story is unfortunately not as good as in previous games.

      Travel the human world, the return of the shadows!

      The plot looks interesting!

      But the way we experience it is bad.

      It''s strange (I think) to face Aldark by doing puzzles...

      I find it sad that there is no boss fights.

      And that''s why I''m not a huge fan of the gameplay.

      I had a lot of fun on some levels, the Mario Maker side is nice, the problem
      is that it does not work with the story...


      Also, I like that they followed the original ending of "The Next Chapter"

      it adds drama that makes the story more interesting despite everything.


      Let''s end with the music wich is very good, I don''t regret buying the OSTs!

      The music seems more modern but keep this orchestral aspect, I love it!


      The end of the game suggests a sequel is planned!

      "Two Realms" will unfortunately not be appreciated too much...

      I really hope the dev team doesn''t get demoralized by the feedback...

      As I wrote at the beginning, [b]thank you[/b] for continuing Drawn to life and
      I am sure you will make a better game in the future!'
