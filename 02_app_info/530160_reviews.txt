I was sorely disappointed. It looks similar, but as soon as you start playing it falls apart. It just doesn't play or control anything like the original. This engine just doesn't even come close. I quit playing after 5 or 10 minutes, it was so bad. If this was free, I wouldn't be too upset, but as a paid game it's just not up to scratch. You could get an actual Battlefield game for that price. I would recommend getting the original mod if you can, or get Forgotten Hope 2 instead. It's free and it runs rings around this mess.","timestamp_created":1595224180,"timestamp_updated":1595224180,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0qixtfMCeMW1lgI="}
