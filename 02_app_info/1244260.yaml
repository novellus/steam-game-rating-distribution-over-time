    review: "Greetings to all and may the Sun shine upon Thou in such uneasy times.\n\
      There is not much to tell - the idea is laid out straightforwardly. The plot\
      \ doesn't not surprise you much - it is not difficult to guess most of the \"\
      twists and turns\", per say, and the characters are nice (though I find the\
      \ goth ic protagonist being unnecessary in that sense - she could belong to\
      \ any other subculture and it would hardly make an impact on the story and character\
      \ development). A bit too cliche for my tastes.\nThe art style is neat (nothing\
      \ too splendid yet satisfying in its own way with cuteness). Same can be said\
      \ about the music in the background. \nIf you look for action though - you would\
      \ be disappointed. Very few fighting scenes. Not that it is a con for this VN.\
      \ \nOverall impression - 7,5 out of 10. It made me happy and I enjoyed reading\
      \ it. Simple as that.\nP.S. - not another yuri pron project, which is a breath\
      \ of fresh air."
