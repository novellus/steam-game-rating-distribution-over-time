I was eliminated from the Desperate Game -- basically a Game Over that takes you to the Title Menu -- the first night because I failed to secure a Base, which I wasn't aware was a requirement. The worst thing is, nothing exciting happened, like being attacked by the other players in the game. It was just like \"You failed to get a base. You lost the game\" and that's it.\n\nThere's elements of fighting, \"ghosts\", two battlefields, and loads of dialogue in the first ten minutes that made my head spin trying to understand. Without spoilers, all I could decipher was the main character was blind, in the Hunger Games, kind of a dimwit, and partnered with someone who doesn't seem to belong in this game to begin with. Which is interesting, but there's not enough motivation here to make me keep playing and figure out his story.\n\nIt's unspeakably frustrating that a game as interesting-sounding as this is so unplayable because of the severe lack of English-translated and English-language otome/otoge games there are in existence, especially when you compare it to the amount of hentai/eroge/male-geared games that are made in English, translated excellently into English, or fanpatched into English. This game sounded like it had a lot of potential, more interesting than the snooze fest that is Code: Realize, but it's bogged down by an easily-solved problem.\n\nHire a translator! If you're cheap, don't worry - no one is buying this game as it is with all the negative reviews, so it really can't hurt to fix your mess for a fee, and do a bit of marketing/advertising (especially to the curators) that your product is up to snuff.\n\nI'm going to TRY to get through this one some other time, but right now my brain hurts from so many other things (shoutout to COVID) that I don't need this in my life. I really DO want to know what happens to Ning, if that is her name, and enjoy the story and beautiful art. Because the art IS fairly well done.","timestamp_created":1595734187,"timestamp_updated":1595734187,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v+vKxPMCdcPKlwI="}
