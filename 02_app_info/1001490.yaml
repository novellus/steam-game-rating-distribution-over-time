    review: "I should have listened to the critical reviews... The game starts well,\
      \ with an interesting world and characters. But roughly in the last third of\
      \ the game, everything felt disconnected, stats changed randomly and the descriptions\
      \ of progress and relationships did not reflect what was actually happening\
      \ in the story. Supposedly important achievements on the way to ascension, such\
      \ as special items and revealed mysteries etc. neve have any relevance and can\xB4\
      t be used at the critical moments you'd think they should. In essence, the last\
      \ third felt random and railroaded at the same time, to a point that made me\
      \ give the game a thumbs down in frustration."
