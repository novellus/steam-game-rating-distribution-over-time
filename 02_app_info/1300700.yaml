      \ /><br><br>It's 1347, the time of the Hundred Years' War. You take on a role\
      \ of one of 200 Minor Lords or Kings from the time period. Be a minor noble\
      \ in Ottomans court, an earl in Ireland, or Emperor of Byzantium, and rewrite\
      \ history by fighting to preserve your empire, and prevent the spread of the\
      \ Black Death across Europe.<br><br>You bear the burden of leadership, and must\
      \ decide how to keep your people safe. Act swiftly, using diplomacy or military\
      \ might, but do not hesitate or the consequences will be dire. History has shown\
      \ the critical importance of sound leadership in times of great crisis, even\
      \ as we face these dangers now.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1300700/extras/finalplague6.gif?t=1607969886\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Redefining the Genre</h2>The Plague: Kingdom Wars is\
      \ the first historical strategy game to feature a full scale pandemic, as well\
      \ as the optional undead mode, with millions of infected and undead potentially\
      \ roaming the world map. Gameplay is ever evolving from lordship or kingdom\
      \ management, to fighting a pandemic, or stopping an undead apocalypse.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Battle the Plague</h2>The black death is here, and as it sweeps through\
      \ your empire your focus will quickly shift from conquering your rivals to surviving\
      \ the pandemic. Utilize primitive medieval medicine, quarantine your cities,\
      \ cut trade with distant lands, whatever it takes to stem the tide of death.\
      \ Millions of people across Europe will get infected and die, and very soon\
      \ it's the human resources and not silver coins that will become the most sparse\
      \ resource.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1300700/extras/finalplague7.gif?t=1607969886\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Brutal Epic Battles</h2>Battles are truly epic - with\
      \ several thousands units on all sides of battle. Bloody sieges, pitched field\
      \ battles, and naval warfare unfolds with brutal historical realism and survival\
      \ elements. When the battle is won, loot corpses or take apart towns to replenish\
      \ your much needed resources.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enormous World Map</h2>The\
      \ entirety of greater Europe and beyond is your playground \u2013 from the sultanates\
      \ of North Africa to Byzantium, the Russian states and the Golden Horde, and\
      \ all the Kingdoms of the Western and Central Europe. You can start the game\
      \ as a minor noble with a small demesne or as a King ruling a great nation.\
      \ There are dozens of Kingdoms for you to choose from and over 300 Lords and\
      \ Kings whose role you can play.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1300700/extras/finalplague4.gif?t=1607969886\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">From the makers of Medieval Kingdom Wars</h2>The Plague:\
      \ Kingdom Wars builds upon the success of Medieval Kingdom Wars and takes things\
      \ further. As we enter Early Access, however, almost everything has been redone\
      \ from the ground up, and gameplay has completely changed. Only some of the\
      \ art and level assets remain (for now). A greatly expanded world map and new\
      \ plague mechanics are just the beginning, with hundreds of new lords to play\
      \ as and many new nations and cities to conquer and control.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Build an Empire</h2>Build your cities and hamlets, engage in trade, economy\
      \ and diplomacy, and in this time of great conflict in Europe \u2013 partake\
      \ in almost non-stop warfare \u2013 from epic sieges to naval combat and bloody\
      \ field battles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manage Towns Up-close</h2>You have the\
      \ freedom to manage everything up-close and personal by entering towns in RTS\
      \ mode. Construct buildings and walls, and position your troops. At the same\
      \ time, you can also manage everything on the world map.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Undead Mode</h2>In the optional Undead mode, the millions infected will soon\
      \ turn into an even deadlier plague, hordes of undead aimlessly roaming Europe,\
      \ destroying everything in their path. Will you isolate yourself on one of the\
      \ islands, or attempt to unite Europe through diplomacy as you try to stop thousands\
      \ of undead at your castle walls?<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1300700/extras/finalplague8.gif?t=1607969886\"\

    developer_response: "Hi Jay, \nI hope you're doing well. I'm really sorry to hear\
      \ that The Plague left such a bad impression. I'd really appreciate it if you\
      \ could add some details-- specific feedback is helpful to our development team.\
      \ \n\nI'm guessing that your criticism is a result of the recent announcement\
      \ about The Plague. It's true, we considered going in a different direction\
      \ with the game due to the negative associations with COVID-19. However, many\
      \ of our players (like yourself) were really unhappy with that decision. We're\
      \ going to listen to you guys. \n\nWe don't want to disappoint our players,\
      \ so we're going to release The Plague in full as intended. We may still create\
      \ Renaissance Kingdom Wars in the future, but it will be a completely seperate\
      \ game. \n\nI really hope you'll continue playing The Plague and give us another\
      \ chance. I promise that zombies are coming soon! \n\nThanks for your time,\
      \ feel free to message me with any questions. "
