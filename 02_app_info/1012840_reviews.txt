But, even without taking those into account, the story needed to be much tighter.  It seemed to be a jumble of scary tropes thrown together.  I was very much looking forward to this game, but in the end felt unsatisfied.  I admit it may be because I feel the intersect of stellar and lovecraftian horror is rich with opportunity, but ultimately I felt let down.","timestamp_created":1610077387,"timestamp_updated":1610077387,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j+eF8PYCdKO5wQI="}
