Paired with the one-hit kills, and the excessive fall damage, making a simple mistake can lose you you all progress. Also the game refused to work with my controller.\nI paid 50 cents for this game and I didn't get my money's worth.","timestamp_created":1608902659,"timestamp_updated":1608902704,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1608947046,"developer_response":"Hi, I'm sorry the game wasn't to your liking. Judging from the time played, you probably didn't make it past the tutorial? The tutorial should take about 15-20 seconds to complete once you understand the controls fully.\n\nWe don't have checkpoints, as the game is based around time trial and skill. Most levels take 25-40 seconds to complete (once you've learnt the controls), it makes little sense to have checkpoints then (other than for practice runs I guess).\n\nIf you could give us the model name of your controller so that we may see if we can debug it and make a fix for it, please do so!"}],"cursor":"AoJwuN+EzfYCf7qGvQI="}
