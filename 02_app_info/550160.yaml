    review: "\nKomentarz + translator.\nComment + translator.\n\nGra, cho\u0107 prosta,\
      \ jest niesamowicie intensywna.\nJest przyjemnie w\u0142\u0105czy\u0107 j\u0105\
      \ raz na jaki\u015B czas.\nOszuka\u0107 m\xF3zg, i poczu\u0107 dawk\u0119 adrenaliny.\n\
      Je\u017Celi kto\u015B pami\u0119ta to przypomina gr\u0119 Frogger z Atari 800xl.\n\
      Za pomys\u0142 i stosunek jako\u015Bci do ceny daje 7/10.\n\nThe game, though\
      \ simple, is incredibly intense.\nIt's nice to turn it on once in a while.\n\
      Fool your brain, and feel a dose of adrenaline.\nIf anyone remembers it resembles\
      \ a game Frogger with Atari 800xl.\nFor the idea and value for money I give\
      \ 7/10.\n\nPolecam.\nRecommend.\n"
