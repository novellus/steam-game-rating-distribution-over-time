    review: Not sure how I found this game, but it was without a doubt that most frustratingly
      amazing decision I have made to this point; I cannot even begin to describe
      the number of times I have rage quit this game, ready to throw my keyboard through
      the window while cursing whoever made this demon-seed of a platformer. Yet every
      time I put the game down I find myself called to come back, as if a siren sings
      out in the night begging me to seal my own fate once again. Challenging, frustrating,
      rewarding and well made this is an indie game that pushes the boundaries of
      my sanity in all of the right ways. 9/10.
