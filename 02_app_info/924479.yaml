    short_description: Itachi accompanies his friend Shisui on a three-part training
      exercise. The two come across a battle between the Hokage's ANBU and the Foundation.
      Itachi is confused by their motives and can't discern which side is right or
      wrong. But Shisui is unwavering in his determination to stop the fighting.
