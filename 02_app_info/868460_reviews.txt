Can't pause the game, neither can I quit it from in-game. The only way to quit is by minimizing and force quittting.\n- You die once and restart the whole game.\n- The game is beyond glitchy, it's completely unplayable. You can get stuck on ladders, the enemies can literally fly sometimes. You may dig holes at random locations instead of nearby, the enemies instantly respawn after death and you may die by the enemy spawning on you, you can't fall through hole, you fall down at the end of the some pipes...\n\n\n1/10","timestamp_created":1593152968,"timestamp_updated":1594655864,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzK65pPMCe7iikAI="}
