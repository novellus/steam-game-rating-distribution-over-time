    review: 'Despite it being only two years old it''s due for some much needed tune
      ups. The whistle is not the best but could be much worse but the sounds of the
      loco are aweful and once a certain speed is reached it sounds like a completely
      second sound source is used to cover the first making the loco look like a rush
      job.


      The 4MT comes in a black BR scheme and looks a bit scruffy which would look
      right at home as tidiness would''ve fell away by the time the 4MT was around.
      Since this pack comes from the TS marketplace all you get is the loco and tender
      so no scenarios, coaches or wagons and like some marketplace items no manual
      either. It comes equipped with AWS so you no longer have to fear those yellows
      or reds and the headlamps can be swapped by holding CTRL and making you''re
      way through the 1, 2, 3 key and etc.


      Now since the regulator goes to 100% instead of the usual 75% I did a test run
      to compare speeds and regulator settings


      Regulator:              Speed:

      100%                      0-11mph

      90%                        11-13mph

      80%                        13-16mph

      70%                        16-20mph

      60%                        20-26mph

      50%                        26-34mph

      40%                        34-46mph

      30%                        46-62mph

      20%                        62-84mph


      This is just a rough guide and was tested on level track and no coaches/wagons
      so results will differ with load and gradient.


      Overall it''s a nice loco and will do nicely for those wanting to add more to
      their scenarios even as background Ai. There is a sound pack from Steam Sounds
      Supreme for the 4MT but the site states it only works for the Just Trains version
      of the 4MT but who knows it might change one day.'
