    review: "Its a very fun game, and alot of fun with a friend. Sadly its kinda short\
      \ and i completed it within an hour. The vibe is kinda scary, wich i like alot.\
      \ And the puzzles are kinda hard, but not too hard. It sometimes takes a little\
      \ bit to figure out what to do with the puzzles, but it doesnt take hours. \n\
      \n8/10"
