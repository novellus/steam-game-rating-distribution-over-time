    review: '[ EDIT: I have gotten into contact with the author of the original Time
      Tenshi. His words are here and he provides his own damning insights on Silver
      Cow''s nefarious business practices.

      https://www.deviantart.com/mysteryguy9215/journal/Hey-Silver-Cow-855450980 ]


      I''m a woman who writes erotica. I''m asexual, but sex-positive. As someone
      who played and loved the original, this is my take.


      I believe that sexuality is beautiful. Sex can be cute, kinks can be great for
      story elements. Breast expansion is a rare fetish that I feel needs more positive
      portrayal. The original Time Tenshi was this. It had a great story that flaunted
      its sexuality while still being a good tale to follow.


      I don''t know why Silver Cow felt the need to remove the heart from their game.
      Perhaps they were misguided in believing the sexual elements were holding them
      back... Perhaps they didn''t like them in the first place and they were only
      added for a reason out of their control. Perhaps they felt they wanted to be
      more respected as game makers who didn''t make sexy games. Either way, I feel
      they were misguided.


      As someone who writes erotic stories, I like to focus on how the sexuality can
      be part of the story. The world isn''t a children''s show. Red light districts,
      brothels, sex shops. They exist. But what would they be like in another world?
      What is the potential for perversion for this power? What is a story element
      that might make someone feel their sexual interest isn''t so shameful? What
      things can the character get into that is sexy, but can also be fun, cute, and
      a story?


      Stories can be sexy. That''s nothing to be ashamed of. I enjoy putting lewd
      elements in my stories to make them wider. I also enjoy making those stories
      and worlds deeper and heavier even though they have lewdness in them.


      Silver Cow removed the beautiful sex-positivity from this game. They replaced
      it with very little. Some slightly expanded story, romance routes, and some
      extra animations, but... At what cost? The game lost its heart. And what was
      added in doesn''t actually make up for what was removed. More importantly, what
      was added doesn''t justify the price compared to the original when the original
      still has its heart, even though Silver Cow crudely plastered a "(2015)" retroactively
      on the original, a crass act of defilement of their old work to show clear favoritism
      to the neutered remake.


      Does it have some things improved? Yes. But the desecration its emotional heart
      wasn''t worth it. The original had an amazing story with some beautiful sexuality
      to it. Now it''s just an above-average story that was gutted in a misguided
      attempt to make it better or more respectable...


      I enjoyed Silver Cow''s work. Now I can''t actually support them as a game studio
      who I thought had true artistic integrity when they''re going to spit on their
      older work with a poorly-priced remake that retroactively stains the title of
      the original and removes far more than it adds.


      There''s also the dodgy Kickstarter behind this and the rather sketchy lack
      of transparency. Nowhere does this Steam page clearly state that it removed
      the sexuality of the original. They''re not lying, but they''re clearly being
      misleading through withholding information. It''s entirely possible they may
      get a few extra bucks from people going in expecting a faithful and expanded
      remake, rather than a shadow of its former self made through misguided vanity.


      I''ll end this with a quote from the Kickstater campaign.


      "Our goal with Time Tenshi is to create an entertaining, high-quality and well-told
      story-driven experience with a focus on character building, romance and a gripping
      plot. The focus this time will not be on breast expansion."


      Not only with this quote squirreled away at the bottom of an FAQ section, but...
      This proves they''re either lying or just incredibly misguided. Their game WAS
      story focused with character building and a gripping plot. Breast expansion
      wasn''t even the focus, and you can have a breast expansion story with character
      building, romance, and gripping plot. In fact, that''s part of what made the
      original Time Tenshi great: It had ALL of that. To mutilate their game while
      claiming it''s better in every way... I would call it despicable if it weren''t
      so pitiable to see them do something so misguided.


      It''s worth noting the team made videos for the remake advertising features
      that weren''t in the final game, like voice acting. However, these features
      were relegated to stretch goals which weren''t met, which suggests they intentionally
      removed features they''d already worked on to try and paywall them, and then
      when the paywalls weren''t meant, they kept them out. I should also note that
      "Switch release" was a stretch goal, and even though it wasn''t met, it still
      came out on the Switch.


      I should also note how shady it is that Silver Cow refuses to speak to fans,
      not even Kickstater backers. They''re an indie development studio. Transparency
      is their greatest tool, and they refuse to use it.


      I''m sorry, Silver Cow. It was fun while it lasted. I only hope that your current
      path is worth the cost for whatever you hope to gain from it. Goodbye.


      [ EDIT: Word from the author of the original game, again, may be found here.
