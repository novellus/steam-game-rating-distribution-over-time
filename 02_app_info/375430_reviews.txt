Logomancer is very well spoken with great world lore and character development. The puzzles were way too high level for me but I used a guide made by the developer to get through the really tough ones (the creepy basement was my favorite part of the game and I didn't need a guide to solve it woot). If you're a fan of rpgmaker, tough puzzles, turned based combat, and great atmosphere then this is the game for you.\n\nP.S: I highly suggest getting the \"true ending\". It's very well written, mind blowing ending!!","timestamp_created":1474339198,"timestamp_updated":1474339198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54161149263381958","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww9rdotcCdtPSYQ=="}
