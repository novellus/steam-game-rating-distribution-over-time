    review: "After playing the game for 2 hours there is no way to save to game to\
      \ be able to pick up where you left off... as well at a certain spot after you\
      \ are killed, you lose all of  your inventory items and playing blindly without\
      \ anything to defend yourself and the items that you have collected previously.\
      \ \n\nOverall a good game but would like to be able to play where i left off\
      \ if i want to turn it off and be able to keep the inventory collected."
