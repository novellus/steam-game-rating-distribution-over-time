    review: "great game for just about $1.5 on sale.\n\nthe zombie is not scary, so\
      \ u dont have to be afraid to play this at night.\nthe weapons have lots of\
      \ variety and interesting enough.\nthe aim is good too. and this is one hectic\
      \ games because the enemies would surround u from 360 degrees.\n\nthe easy and\
      \ normal stage feels right, just not satisfying enough because it's a timed\
      \ mission, so they cut it when the time ran out instead of letting us clear\
      \ all the enemies.\n\nhavent played it much, but the hard stage is pretty unfair,\
      \ I still dont know if I'd be able to pass it someday.\nstill save this game\
      \ to play for serious later as I bought lots of vr games on sale, but I like\
      \ what I play so far. \nfor $1.5 this beats lots of other of the more expensive\
      \ games that I bought.\n"
