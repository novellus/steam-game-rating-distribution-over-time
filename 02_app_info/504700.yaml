      \ is a game about building the biggest baddest ship by blasting your buddies\u2019\
      \ to bits and stealing their blocks - a local multiplayer party-arena game that\
      \ challenges you to strike the right balance between speed, power, maneuverability,\

      \ ram them head on and expose their weaknesses. Or bolster your ship with Power\
      \ Cells and grow to enormous size. Protect your Core at all costs! <br><br>Each\
      \ ship configuration has strengths and weaknesses and is almost infinitely reconfigurable.\
      \ Experiment with multiple different strategies and rapid reconfigurations to\
      \ overcome enemy tactics. Beat their firepower with speed, and their speed with\

      With so many different blocks and strategies, Blockships is a super-fun party\
