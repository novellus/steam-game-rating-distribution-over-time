It's a tad more difficult than that game, but only a tad- certainly not as much as its spartan aesthetic would suggest. The ruleset is interesting and different enough to feel fresh, and watching your solutions go is as satisfying as ever. In my opinion it gets a little bit repetitive by the later puzzles, but only after several hours of play, so no big deal.\n\nMost importantly of course, the solitaire is good, if quite difficult.","timestamp_created":1609738093,"timestamp_updated":1609738093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nMD35fYCcbamwAI="}
