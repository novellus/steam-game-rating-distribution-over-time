The game forces you to be a rebel and that somewhat took me out of the experience. Yes, the new classes are fine (except the servile which I doubt any self-respecting person will roleplay as), even those lifecrafters are basically shapers. New creations were good too, not as original as the ones from G2, but nicely designed and efficient (as all real Shaper work). But, as plot went on I enjoyed it a lot more. Being a double agent is an interesting experience, even though it wasn't always handled well (in my humble opinion) and the returning characters (namely Alwan and Greta) are nice too see. \nThe overall gameplay had a few minor improvements again and while the story is not that original (Shapers vs Rebellion again, albeit on a bigger scale) this game was well-worth those 33.9 hours it took me on the first walkthrough (the shortest so far, even though I, once again, skipped some side quests and probably missed few hidden places).  Also, it has some replayability, a bit less then G3 though.","timestamp_created":1603704709,"timestamp_updated":1603704709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+PuPsvUCesebqgI="}
