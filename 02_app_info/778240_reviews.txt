Lots and lots of rough edges.\n\nThe guns feel odd, sort of spacey knock offs of the typical military load out.\n\nReloading is a pain, if you have anything left in your clip you need to throw it out and put in a new one - which sounds fine, but then you randomly grab your swipe card instead of your ammo.\n\nPicking up items is a pain, ammo clip into corpses and scenery. And you randomly grab your swipe card, or pistol (if you have another weapon in your hand).\n\nKilling enemies is a pain. They sometimes fire thru objects, they sometimes fire at you when you are well tucked out of the way - that bit is fine, its just you get a 1 second slow down effect every time a bullet comes at you, even if you are in zero danger and the bullet is in another room.\n\nThe bottom line is, the game feels like it has a lot of work needed. It recently got a huge price drop, so I gave it a try, and I was finding it a bit annoying, but OKAY for the money up til a certain point. Mild spoiler [spoiler]You find yourself in a cave level getting teleported into the middle of a bunch of mobs, a bit like old school quake on a really high difficulty, and the things I mentioned (and more) which are a \"pain\" get upgraded to outright \"frustrating\" [/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1540098390,"timestamp_updated":1540098390,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531823098659515381","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/47ByuYCfPeIrQE="}
