When a new title on Steam announces it has VR support, I normally investigate and see if it will work with the DK2 (Yes, beware as Valve is too incompetent to properly label VR titles; you must do your own verifications in order to make sure the game actually works with VR, even if Steam says it should... it may very well not - Steam just want to take your money)\n\nWhile this title worked virtually perfectly with the DK2, content-wise it fell short. Very short. Don't get me wrong, it looks fairly good in there (fairly, not incredibly... I was more impressed with the visuals in Frontiers) but it just doesn't seem right. The scales are off, the LOD lacks and as a showstopper, some basics like camera clipping values are wrong.\n\nI stopped my run when I recognized something I learned in Unity on day 1: I could see a big diamond-shaped hole in the skybox. So we didn't change our default Oculus camera rig values. Hum. Quit.\n\nI regret this purchase. I find it alarming to read things like \"must own for DK2 users\". Your bar must be so low in the must have department.","timestamp_created":1432667307,"timestamp_updated":1511580845,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.432173848152160645","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1432704392,"developer_response":"Hi and thanks for your feedback.\n\nFirst of all,we've checked more time the scale trying to make the most perfect one,sometimes could seems wrong because we've tried to acheive an epic style for our game,and that's why sometime some stuff could seems bigger than normal,but that's a desired thing,we want the player being immersed in a never seen place before.\n\nHowever,one of the basic thing to know on Unity is definitely the clipping plane.. however i don't think it's \"right\" to quit the game just because some issue with it.\n\nActually it's just a bug as could be some other,even if seems more simple or basic doesn't mean we didn't know how to fix it or what is the bug. Infact if there is some issue is just because we were trying to achieve the sweet spot between perfomance and no-glich visuals but of course eventually there could be still bugs in some positions of the map.. and that's a possible reason why we're on Early Access.. bugs.\n\nI can understand every points of your disappointment and we're all sorry about it,it's of course a reason to improve us and improve the game.\n\nFinally i do not feel it's really right to say also \"Your bar must be so low\",there are different kind of games and different kind of people,what could be cool for you couldn't be so for some other.\n\nThanks for your time and your feedback,and sorry for any disappointment,we're always try to improve.\n\n"}],"cursor":"AoJ4vKjP+N8Ce/uLPQ=="}
