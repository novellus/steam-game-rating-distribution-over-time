    about_the_game: Syko Swinger is an <i>abstract</i> game which gives the player
      an experience of a <i>connection</i> with a type of rhythmic motion under the
      influence of increasing <i>psychedelic</i> effects.<br><br>Unravel a visual
      journey that unfolds with your movement and skill.<i> The higher you score,
      the higher you get!</i><h2 class="bb_tag">How to Play</h2>Use the mouse to move
      the center sphere in a consistent circular motion and avoid the circular obstacles.<br>The
      five yellow circles on the top right are your lives.<br>You lose a life when
      you hit a spiky red sphere.<br>You lose all lives if you swing outside the screen's
      bounds.<br>You must also circle around obstacles. This will get you more points.<br>If
      you fail to move around obstacles for some time, you will start losing points.<br>You
      must regain your momentum by circling around the circular obstacle.<br><br>Collecting
      a multi colored sphere will gain you <strong>+40</strong> points. Also this
      will add a <i>visual distortion effect</i>. The higher your score, the higher
      is the intensity of the effect. There are about <strong>20</strong> such visual
      distortion effects. You will get to see all of them by the score of ~<strong>3000</strong>
      if you collect all.<br><br>The wider your circling radius, the more colorful
      the sounds get. Also, the more colorful the screen gets. Having a small radius
      will make the screen almost black and white.<br><br>Use headphones for best
      experience.

    review: 'Good looking game! The audio effects are also very well done.

      Couple of tips that helped me finally break the 1000 mark

      - Swinging counter clockwise felt better as a right-handed person. Might just
      be me

      - Taking time to slow down when the circles disappear'
