    review: I'm usually an advocate for early access games. I like getting into games
      early and seeing how they progress, but c'mon guys. I can't believe you released
      this game in this state. It's simply unplayable right now. You can only pick
      up things after you moving them, most things that tell you to press E on do
      not work. There's literally nothing to do. The mechanic to open doors "hold
      left click then swipe your mouse" is atrocious. I don't think I'd play this
      game simply for that. CLOSE this game until it's a bit more ready. It gives
      zero value at the moment.
