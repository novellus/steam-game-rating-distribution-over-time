Magix software in general is one of those things that you either click with or you don't. I like it because it allows me to do some the things the big expensive software does at a much smaller price tag (Hitfile, vegas etc). Overall Video Deluxe 2020 is a improvement from the version 2018 I am coming from. It still has issues and its still a bit of a dog on playback even at 8 times faster???? But it is improved somewhat. Overall I would give it a solid 4.5 stars outta five. Just beware Magix will make you work for the quality this is no simple one button push to get what you want. \n\nThe software does what I need it to and that is what matters most to me. Overall it's a decent video software package and this version should work well for your basic video needs (youtube, family vidoes, etc). I would once again warn against longer movie length editing with it (over 1+ hour or so).","timestamp_created":1601311507,"timestamp_updated":1601311507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o9Dm6vQCfvrUpAI="}
