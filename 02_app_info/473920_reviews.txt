The story is delightful, telling of Corinne's coming to terms with her status as a medium to the ghostly inhabitants of the B&B she finds herself taking care of for a week. In that time, you are tasked with taking care of said ghosts by looking after their needs, each in a slightly different way. There is an \"action point management\" element to it, as everything makes the player character more tired, but I never went below 50% in my standard play - I believe NG+ is harder.  I completed a \"standard\" game in just under 2.5 hours, with New Game+ mode opening up after that, so I suspect the game is 100%able in about 5-6 hours.\n\nThe game is consistently upbeat and, as it says, not scary. It does take some fairly heavy subject matter and slide over it a little freely, but that suits the nature of what the game wants to be.\n\nThe art style is great, and the music is perfect for the length of the game. I also think the controls have been updated since some reviews, as I had no difficulty with them. The only thing that seemed a little odd to me is that one of the later rooms that you can unlock has an exit that is different to that which you expect, and I found myself entering (or trying to enter) another room more often than leaving the room itself. I understand the design choice, but in a game I find little issue with, it was oddly frustrating.\n\nI highly recommend this game, and hope that you get the same enjoyment from it that I did.","timestamp_created":1600920173,"timestamp_updated":1600920173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nOeR3/QCcabXowI="}
