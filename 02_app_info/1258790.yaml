    about_the_game: 'The year 8000. Life among the stars has evolved to host hundreds
      of rare and intelligent creatures. Bird people, fruit people, tree people, and
      even amorphous blob people exist together and explore their passions. Earth
      has all but been forgotten save for the galactic effort to preserve two of its
      most valuable contributions: horses and analog video. On a suburban asteroid
      in the outer reaches of the galaxy, you work as a salesperson at the last video
      store in the known galaxy. No job could be more prestigious! Not all is as it
      seems however. The mysterious video hole that lies beneath the store is the
      source of all video, and whoever controls it will have the power to make their
      fiction a reality. Left in the hands of your boss, it could spell the end of
      good movies for the entire galaxy! Venture into the video hole and face danger,
      excitement, and predictable plot points around every turn.'
