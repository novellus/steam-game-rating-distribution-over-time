It really brings the dark fantasy Victorian setting to life.\n\nControls (the most important part of a brawler imo) are good and tight, I got into them in no time. Sadly enemy AI still need to get better.\n\nGame is far from finished, and I've [b]found a bunch of glitches.[/b] Let's hope this game keeps up in the direction it's going, and doesn't fall short of the big promise the devs are making. If you want a finished game, I'd recommend you to wait and see how the game develops.\n\n[b]I appreciate this running natively on Linux[/b], I really do.","timestamp_created":1552630062,"timestamp_updated":1594265959,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.64647376537322998","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4pf/pmPMCe9mLvQE="}
