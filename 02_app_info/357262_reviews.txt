Good enough for your own take on the Man With No Name, a good Saloon scene, or gun duel at high noon. A couple tracks offer some more Native American elements to the sound, which work regardless if you're an Indian or Cowboy. As a whole, these tracks can work in Sci-Fi and Fantasy worlds with mercenaries, bounty hunters, and vast expanses of wilderness.","timestamp_created":1435778176,"timestamp_updated":1435778176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584664523601531982","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwIrDpc4CdMeaQA=="}
