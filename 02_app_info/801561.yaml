    review: Great artwork. But if you want to strictly follow four element type monster,
      you may need to do some adjustment to the image. I'm buying this DLC for the
      hope that it can fulfill the requirement since i'm really bad at art and stuff.
      Unfortunately it did't work the way I hope it for. Anyway, still a good piece
      of art that you can use for your project. Cheers.
