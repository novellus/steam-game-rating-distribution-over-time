Combine this with said enemies having 2HP meaning you end up scrambling to  remove as many as possible and especially if you're trying to 100% the game via \"Hard\" difficulty you're likely going to end up dying from it.\n\nOh but as soon as I started the second world, the game starts to spawn enemies anyway. Like on top of the already mass horde of enemies you see on the map the game decides to spawn even MORE on top of it and the fact you have to blow through walls to get to the exit just reeks of pure bullshit. Hell I actually had an instance an enemy spawned at the EXIT and I didnt even notice.\n\nThe real insult to injury is what the developer decided to do in terms of difficulty. Die too many times? The game locks you out of Hard all the way down to what's essentially casual and the worse part? You literally have to repeat the same level on Easy and Normal in order to get Hard back. So no LFG, as much as I wanted to like this game this kind of stupidity convinced me to drop it entirely. Do I recommend it? Only if you're REALLY big on Bomberman but otherwise I dont advise this.","timestamp_created":1602299953,"timestamp_updated":1602299953,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49p+hiPUCfoj4pgI="}
