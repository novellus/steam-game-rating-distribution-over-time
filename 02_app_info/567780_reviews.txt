Your only resource is time (but it always not enough.\n\nThe game still have problems: not support high-DPI screen, not support windows 10 zoom in/out. You need to set DPI zoom for this game to fix this. The UX of this game is cr@p, it still uses arrow keys. It's not flying a plane or piloting an orbital transfer vehicle!\n\nNot recommend for casual players and hardcore spacecraft fans.\n\nWE NEED CHINESE!","timestamp_created":1573750445,"timestamp_updated":1573751802,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwidm6te4Cfa+K2gE="}
