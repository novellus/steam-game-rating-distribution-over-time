    review: "What if there's happiness other than a happy ending?\n\nI highly recommend\
      \ this game to all fans of studio Overdrive. \nHonestly, it's not really a depression\
      \ game, it's bittersweet, sure, yet hopeful.\nTomoe is one of the best MCs I've\
      \ seen in visual novels and Naruko's route is top-notch."
