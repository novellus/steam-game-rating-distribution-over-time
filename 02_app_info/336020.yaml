    short_description: A delightful adventure featuring exploration and puzzle solving.
      Long ago, the ancient book of legend, Pahelika, was used to defeat an evil warrior-king.
      In order to protect the book from misuse it was later hidden in a sacred temple
      guarded by six magical portals.
