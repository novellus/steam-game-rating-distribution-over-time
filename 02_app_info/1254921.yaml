    review: 'A lot of factors, greed especially, have come together to allow these
      devs to sell you a third shotoclone in a game already with at least two shotoclones
      as DLC.


      I''m rating it up but I don''t like it. Only in a franchise game like Granblue
      could they get away with that insane amount of greed and laziness.'
