I gave it two tries and then I was finished with it. Here is why: \n\nWhen the game begins you start with a pistol, and a wave of aliens insects attack you from the front. You are stationary. There is limited movement but you are essentially a turret. It took me a few tries to get past the first wave. With the pistol these insect aliens take many shots. They move slowly but because they take so many hits to kill every shot counts, so you need to score dozens of hits and hope to kill them before they reach you. It is all very monotonous and boring. \n\nOnce they reach you they stand around the crate thing that represents your body, and your life starts slowly draining. You will eventually die from this obviously. After figuring this out getting to wave 2 wasn't difficult, just boring. I could not find many options as far as switching weapons or finding power ups. Just the one weak pistol. If someone explains how to choose different weapons a la Space Pirate Simulator I will revisit the game, but this is effectively space pilot simulator minus the ability to move and dodge, ability to choose multiple weapons and shields, enemies that are a challenge to hit, ranged attacks, and cool backgrounjd atmosphere.\n\nThe best I can say about this game is that the graphics are pretty good, although the levels I played were cramped and bland. I always feel bad giving a game a negative review, and always trie to find something good to say about a game because I buy games based on positive reviews and I understand that games that don't appeal to me aren't necessarily bad, but this game has no saving graces.","timestamp_created":1521919333,"timestamp_updated":1521919363,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+9DdrOICd8m/nAE="}
