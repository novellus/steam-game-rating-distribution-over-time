The game mechanics in themselves seem to be pretty simple, just like walking, jumping and shooting, but it makes me always smile when the skillfully modelled Donald says or does something crazy in the game.\n\nWhen we treat this as mainly a satire (game), it's easy to say that the creator has done wonderful work! I hope there is even more content to come to the game in the form of new courses, and I believe it is, because it clearly looks like the game is made with a lot of passion!","timestamp_created":1589315663,"timestamp_updated":1594471316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwoq/5nvMCeIyqhwI="}
