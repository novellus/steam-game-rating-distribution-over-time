    review: 'I was looking for a female ninja game and I picked this one to play.
      Because the options are not many Although it wasn''t what I was hoping for and
      was looking for, it was enough to make me feel some fun. The game does not take
      long to complete, if you understand the game system well it may take time. Two
      to three hours to complete At the end of the game, there was nothing more than
      going back to unlocking CG H, at least I think the heroine skin will be unlocked,
      used for playing around two or three. To change the atmosphere Or perhaps for
      a little game quest after the story, for example Rescue young women who are
      raped and assassinated (if updates are available).

      CG is beautiful, it looks good, but unfortunately some of the characters don''t
      have CG, making the heroine seem like talking to the air. But that''s not a
      problem Also, Repeated use of supporting character CG, just changing colors
      confused me the character a little. It doesn''t seem important but I pick up
      the details.

      The game does not have a system in the world. Most of the content is carried
      out with the characters without the opportunity to return to their original
      location or to wander the world. So if you stay in a village or some place and
      can walk to training Should be done to keep the level and should save the game
      first every time.

      The character''s voice sounds good but only Only heroine

      All in all, this looks like a game with more Ninja warrior content than Ninja
      assassin (much more) 7.5 / 10, the price is reasonable.

      I am waiting to see the sequel if the Dev does it or DLC.'
