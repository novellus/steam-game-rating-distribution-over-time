Anime sucks it, large.\n   The girls are doing everyday things... not flying or wielding big swords or shooting magic.\n   The characters don't have animal heads or even animal ears. Hentai blows goats.\n   It was cheap enough... about a buck for 90 minutes of challenge.\n   The women & girls look like women & girls. Futonari is for fagmatics.\n   Not really nasty; you won't go to hell for playing this.\n\n\nCons:\n   The puzzles are all about 10x10 in puzzle piece size.\n   There's no skill levels. Stand on your head or get drunk if you need a challenge.\n   Is this the same as Volume 1, just more puzzles?\n   There's no real need to do any of these twice.\n   If breasts are your thing, a C-cup is the largest we're seeing. \n   No timers. You could upload this at a nursing home, and they would thank you.\n\n\nSummary: You could buy Vol I & II, costing less than a soda at an airport or hospital.","timestamp_created":1555944919,"timestamp_updated":1555945032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512280702590942383","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlKHjouoCdpLhvwE="}
