I imagine that the trigger warning on this game is not to be taken lightly.\nFor me this was one of the best game experiences I have had, and to me it truly show what VR will be able to achieve.\n\nThat said I experienced significant problems with broken lighting effects in the cut scenes that broke some of the immersion.\nI loved the combat system, as it was not too complex, and not to simple for the purpose of this game.\nThe story and the audio of the game is absolutely top quality.\nThe visuals in VR were good, but not excellent.\nI did experience some visual discomfort from lightning effects and other very bright screens in the game, but a minor discomfort.\nI did find the puzzles to be a bit grindy in the end, but as the experience was only 8 hours I did not find this to be a big problem.\n","timestamp_created":1610049311,"timestamp_updated":1610049311,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kdqa7/YCdo+uwQI="}
