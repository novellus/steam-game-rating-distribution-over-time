The rest of my opinions on this game are in my main game review so concerning this scenario only:\n\nI thought it was the best of all the stand alone scenarios the game has. Leave it for last, if you intend to play them all. There is something about this game that makes an emotional impact that very few other games make. To me at least. Its just a roller coaster of emotions.  Don't wanna spoil that bit though. But really, you go in expecting one thing and then...\n\nOne of those wow-what-did-I-just-play games. Oh hell.. HUGE spoilers ahead:\n\n[spoiler]You set out for the iron forest and all the time I was expecting it to be a physical place. And the game was rolling and rolling and I kept wondering when I'll get off the map. There is just one map. I don't know at what point it hit me that maybe the 'iron forest' is just an allegory (??? wrong word maybe. I suck at lit) At any rate then toward the end after -I SAID HUGE SPOILERS- after I bled to save my three brothers and then lost two off them, I'm standing waiting for the battle of my life and the incoming army is described (with pretty words that I lack) as an iron forest. It was perfect. And then your only remaining brother challenges the bad guy and DIES. And do you know what I was doing? Healing and changing equipment! Cause I was dead in the water and it felt so much like...  yeah, like I watched the kid die and could do nothing. It was perfect. And when in the end you finally get the arrowhead that has been lodged and paining you through the game removed and you open the handkerchief and its an iron leaf. DAMN! Yeah! Perfect![/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1604690680,"timestamp_updated":1604690962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528301894664764404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5ZzCz/UCd4zfrAI="}
