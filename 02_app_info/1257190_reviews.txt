Thus forcing you to restart. If it happened rarely I could ignore it, but it happens fairly constantly; Even when I tried to avoid it by waiting for the bowling ball to fully reload to attempt to pick it up.","timestamp_created":1610044721,"timestamp_updated":1610044772,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6rGJ7/YCcdGrwQI="}
