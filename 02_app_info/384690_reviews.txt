With the lastest entry in the franchise being such a departure from the core gameplay, I am afraid people will be turned off from the series which is a shame. I only have a few hours on the steam release, but plenty more on it's original release console, the super famicom. It has the best grappling mechanics in any game I've ever played even 20+ years after it's release. For such a low price, it is criminal to not give this game a chance for those that love platformers.\n\nUmihara Kawase is a game that has a low barrier of entry, but a high skill ceiling for those that want to master it's mechanics (just watch speedruns to see the crazy maneuvers you can do). It is set up as an arcade game of sort, where you have a limited time to clear as many levels as possible with ten lives. Each level is full of bright visuals, wonderful music and challenging obstacles and enemies to overcome. Each level has one or many exit doors that take you to different stages, until you reach an ending door that ends the game for you. This gives the game tons of replayability, as you won't see every level in each playthrough. The biggest problem with the game that might be a turn off for some people is the annoying boss fights and frequent enemy respawn rate. These two problems can be managed, as you can technically choose a route that has no boss fights and you get used to the enemy respawn rates eventually. Some of the later levels become very challenging and will be run killers for you early on, but there is a handy practice mode that gives you infinite tries to beat a level.\n\nI personally haven't had any problems with the pc port, and I actually feel it runs better here than on it's original hardware. I also had no problem with setting up controller support, but I can't speak for every person here. This game is a fantastic gem that should not be skipped. The other two Umihara Kawase games in the trilogy pack (Umihara Kawase Shun and Sayonara Umihara Kawase) are also pretty good, but my favorite is the first game and is the best place to start with the series.","timestamp_created":1609750755,"timestamp_updated":1609750755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46+an5vYCe+KqwAI="}
