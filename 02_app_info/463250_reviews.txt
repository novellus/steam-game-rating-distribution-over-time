Hopefully people try it out. Just tried this game today, and it's a very fun 1v1. I love 1v1. Considering it is early access, it has lot's of potential. Especially if it ever expanded to 2v2. I don't see a reason for this game to ever go over 2v2. If it stays 1v1 and possibly goes 2v2 max I don't see why this game couldn't end up having a huge player base. \n\nThe only cons I had seen while playing is player base. Which could be helped with more promoting. Also while doing dmg the dmg didn't seem to be exact with the swing. If they could just tweek the timing a little bit it would be perfect. That's just my 2 cents though. I love the main scree. I love the graphics. I love the idea. Keep up the good work!","timestamp_created":1486688512,"timestamp_updated":1486688512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwgM3iktoCerLdcQ=="}
