      to build.<h2 class="bb_tag">World view</h2>This game envisions a world named
      &quot;ShenZhou&quot; with demons, human beings and gods in it and its surrounding
      islands. The human beings are ruled by God and are in long-term confrontation
      with the demon. The player is a demon with no power, he need to be study magic,
      make friend with other demon kings, conquer cities, in order to cope with the
