    review: 'This is simply not a commercial product. The game works as a first, personal
      effort in learning GameMaker, but is in no way something that is ready to offer
      to someone else in exchange for money.


      That said, I''ll give the benefit of the doubt and pass on requesting a refund.  This
      could indeed be someone''s very first sincere effort. :)'
