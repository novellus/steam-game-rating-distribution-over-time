    review: "[h1][b]Nothing to play here, move on[/b][/h1]\n\n[h1][b]Full Review at\
      \ [url=http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=115]GameDragons.Net[/url][/b][/h1]\n\
      \n[b]Presentation[/b]\nLunnye Devitsy wants to tell us the story of an alien\
      \ that inexplicably falls from the moon onto a huge mountainside on the planet\
      \ below each time you make him fall, only to then spend the next few minutes\
      \ finding a way back up. The problem is: there is no story, the only known thing\
      \ about the alien is the fact that he needs to return to the moon, and yet each\
      \ time he does he will fall again only to do the same thing all over again.\
      \ The entire point of the game is to explore the map and find six different\
      \ ways to make it back to the moon in one piece, only to unlock the seventh\
      \ way, but since even then nothing new will happen, achievements are probably\
      \ your best motivation to make it that far. \n\nApart from that, you know absolutely\
      \ nothing about the alien's life, the planet, the random creatures you will\
      \ find on the planet or even the purpose of the entire game; aside from two\
      \ or three easter eggs that will award you with an achievement each once you\
      \ get to them, the entire map is a empty maze in which your only purpose is\
      \ to get to the other end in order to collect a part for something that should\
      \ take you to the moon. As much as the game focuses on exploration, as it leaves\
      \ menus, instructions or quests behind, there really isn't much out there to\
      \ explore and without looking it up online you will have a hard time figuring\
      \ out what you're supposed to do with those random pieces you find scattered\
      \ around the map. \n\nEven with seven different ways to make it back to the\
      \ moon, the entire experience feels repetitive and mediocre, as almost all the\
      \ routes will require you to collect a number of items from around the map,\
      \ not knowing in what direction they might be, bringing them back to an NPC\
      \ which will then present you with another way to make it back. This is one\
      \ of those games that it's painful to watch or play as nothing interesting ever\
      \ happens and even when the challenge is supposed to make it better, there will\
      \ be issues that will stop it from being enjoyable.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nLunnye\
      \ Devitsy fails to follow the first rule of any platformer: being fun to play;\
      \ instead of that you get a boring, frustrating and luck-based experience that\
      \ you won't miss once you press the escape button. For the first bit, Lunnye\
      \ Devitsy wants to give you freedom of exploration, giving you the choice to\
      \ take on the six different endings at your own phase and theoretically figuring\
      \ out each one of them on your own. However, the game has absolutely no instructions\
      \ whatsoever and even though you will bump into an engine part or a moon piece\
      \ frequently, it will take a while to piece them all together and figure out\
      \ where you're supposed to go once you have collected them all, time in which\
      \ you will simply move from one edge of the world to the opposite one trying\
      \ to find that object that you're supposed to interact with, as there is no\
      \ hint to the whereabouts of that object or NPC, or the action you're supposed\
      \ to perform in order to interact with that object / NPC.\n\nOnce you do eventually\
      \ get back to the moon six times, a seventh ending will be unlocked which is\
      \ supposed to be longer and more challenging, but ended up being nothing like\
      \ that. In order to get back to the moon the seventh time you must collect all\
      \ the coins scattered around the map, some of them in almost unreachable areas,\
      \ so this is where your abilities were supposed to interfere, making use of\
      \ the double jump techniques and the cannons, which were useless before, however\
      \ the cannon shooting mechanic is completely broken, sending you way off track\
      \ from where you're supposed to be and in different directions each time, no\
      \ matter if the cannon is positioned at the same angle it was a try before,\
      \ making reaching those hard areas a game of luck rather than skill; combine\
      \ that with the double jump mechanic which randomly stops working at times after\
      \ you come out of the cannon, even though you obviously need it to reach the\
      \ ledge near you, and you've got yourself an almost impossible to finish game.\
      \ Believe it or not, that was only the core of the problem, as there are many\
      \ more issues such as your character randomly being transported on the other\
      \ side of a wall or getting stuck for a few moments in the floor.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\n\
      The resolution is for some reason fixed, which works fine if you play the entire\
      \ game in window mode using only a portion of your screen, but if you do decide\
      \ to go fullscreen, then that becomes a problem since the resolution is nowhere\
      \ near HD. The map is relatively small and even though it's somehow divided\
      \ into different areas, they all look alike; the black is always dominant and\
      \ there are little things to differentiate one area from another, and because\
      \ of that until you get familiar with the layout, it will be easy to get lost.\
      \ The visual effects will always be around in some way, whether it's rain, fog\
      \ or a combination of both, but they only make it harder to see, something that\
      \ can become extremely annoying later in the game when you you have to jump\
      \ from one platform to another and the fog or rain effects will cause you to\
      \ miss your target.\n\n[b]Audio[/b]\nThis game sounds just as mediocre as it\
      \ looks, there are few sound effects and the ones that are there feel like they've\
      \ been extracted from a 90's basic effects pack. While that song playing the\
      \ background as you jump around isn't necessarily bad, you will eventually grow\
      \ tired of hearing it, and after the four or five hours you'll spend with the\
      \ game if you're into getting all the achievements for returning to the moon\
      \ seven times you will be glad it's over. Even though the game has a lot of\
      \ issues aside from audio related ones, it would've been nice to have a background\
      \ story narrated while playing, at least offering some details on why the alien\
      \ that you control keeps jumping from the surface of the moon, or at least make\
      \ some jokes about it.\n\n[b]Extras[/b]\nCompleting the game takes around 3-4\
      \ hours depending on how long you take to find everything and if you're using\
      \ a guide or not, something that you will probably do at some point since there\
      \ are no indications to what your objective is or where you should start looking\
      \ for something, but even so most of the players will probably give up on this\
      \ game in less than an hour, leaving you with a question if you really do want\
      \ to complete it or not; I did, and I already regret wasting 4 hours of my life\
      \ with this.\n\n[b]Verdict[/b]\nLunnye Devitsy is a bad idea with a worse execution,\
      \ and that's the kind way to say it; the story or the purpose of the game makes\
      \ no sense, the bugs and technical issues will sometimes make the game impossible\
      \ to play and on top of that most of the players won't even know what to do\
      \ without a guide since there are no indications whatsoever. You can, however,\
      \ grab the game for only a few bucks, so if you're still interested you can\
      \ try it without spending too much and give it your verdict.\n\n[u]Rating: 2.9[/u]"
