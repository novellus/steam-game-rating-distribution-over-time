      /><br><strong>HINGE</strong> is a VR horror that takes place in a nightmarish
      building filled with high-quality graphics and sound effects. The game creates
      an environment of suspense as you struggle for survival in an oppressive atmosphere
      of horror that chases you wherever you go. Every step is filled with fear, as
      the heart races in anticipation of the next ghoulish creature to face.<br><br>The
      game is set in an American metropolis of the early 20th century right after
      the Spanish flu epidemic. It takes place in a skyscraper full of fashionable
      Art Deco apartments, built by an eccentric millionaire (who is actually an occultist
      and the head of a mysterious cult).<br><br>Once the skyscraper is built and
      finally opened, its owner runs the great ceremony and invites many different
      people. But on that night, something mystical happens and transfers the building
      with all its inhabitants into a nightmarish reality, where the laws of physics,
      chemistry, and space are broken and time is collapsed.<br><br>Five different
      characters who, by the will of fate, find themselves in the building, have to
      unravel the mystery of what happened, survive and try to get out of that terrible
      trap.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key features of the game:</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>High-quality

      /><br>We did a lot of research overall on the scariest things usually found
      in the horror genre, and we made our own combination of scares that works perfectly.
      Highly detailed and realistic environment makes the game extremely frightening.</p><br><h1>Discord</h1><p><a

    review: "Played on a full Index kit, 2080ti, 9900k, 32GB RAM\n\nWhile I do recommend\
      \ the game, it comes with some current issues that I hope gets fixed.\n\nThe\
      \ game is gorgeous and the visuals are impressive. Very unique environment designs\
      \ that were well thought out by the devs. Does not have finger tracking but\
      \ controls just fine on the knuckles. Smooth turning is in the game and you\
      \ can disable all the safety settings. Very atmospheric and creepy.\n\nNow for\
      \ the bad stuff.. The game needs better optimization. Im getting on average\
      \ 60fps and thats with SS turned to just 100%. Sometimes it dips down to the\
      \ 40s and my reprojection rate is somewhere around 40% for some reason, never\
      \ had this problem before. I wouldn't even touch this game if you have anything\
      \ less then a 2080. \n\nWhile the game is gorgeous to look at, it can be draining\
      \ to figure out. I don't mind when a game doesn't hold your hand but this game\
      \ feels extremely disjointed and loosely put together with its mechanics. Once\
      \ you figure them out it makes the game better, but only just a bit. I died\
      \ 10+ times on the first puzzle simply because I couldn't figure out what to\
      \ do. This game feels like a AAA horror game with shotty direction.\n\nI recommend\
      \ this only to the hardest of VR Horror fans."
