You can gather but cannot use any of it so you're stuck with the equipement provided. You have acces to a couple of regions and the regular monsters are there, but they don't give much experience and with the gear you have, it is difficult for no reward. It is pretty much run to the boss at the end, kill it and that's it.\n\nNot much of a story and it is too short.","timestamp_created":1607470710,"timestamp_updated":1607470710,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz4+uovYCdeOkuAI="}
