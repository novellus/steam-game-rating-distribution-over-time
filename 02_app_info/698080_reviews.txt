It requires a lot more work and the way you search for things and places to progress, without any indication, is not to my taste. Nevertheless, it reminds me of the flash games I played a long time ago.\nThe price tag isn't outrageous, by any means, and I hope  putting a price on this means the developer wishes to put the time in and improve. However, I am not willing to put the money down just yet, especially while I can't progress.\n\nTL:DR A supposed game-breaking bug, in a good concept of a game, that still needs to, and more importantly, can improve.","timestamp_created":1587573396,"timestamp_updated":1587573396,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwovKv0fECfKTeggI="}
