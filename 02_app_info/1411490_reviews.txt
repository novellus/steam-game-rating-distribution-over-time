I love walking sims but this is a broken game don't buy.  No matter what setting I was on it was choppy, made me seasick to play.  Doors are locked and you need to find keys.  Well that would be great but the first key I picked up was not in my inventory when I went to the correct door. Also the inventory you have to scroll through everything to find your item...including pages you pick up..really just don't buy this at all not even on sale, because this is a broken game.  I didn't experience the darkness like the other reviewer did but I didn't even make it past the first key since it wasn't in my inventory after pick up, you do pick up a flashlight before that.","timestamp_created":1607284928,"timestamp_updated":1607284928,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4LXpnPYCccPqtwI="}
