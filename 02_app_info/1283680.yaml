    about_the_game: "You wake up in a bright, but mysterious room. You don't know\
      \ what is happening or how you got there. You see a TV, a trash can, a desk,\
      \ and a closet.  There are objects throughout the room, but most of them are\
      \ hidden.  Some of them are easy to find.  Others are not as easy.  You must\
      \ click in specific areas to find these items and figure out how to use the\
      \ items together to escape.  How can you turn on the TV?  How can you unlock\
      \ the drawers?  What will you find in the desk? <br />\r\n Where is the key\
      \ to open the main door?  What is outside of the door that is keeping you inside?\
      \  Can you solve the puzzles to find out how to escape?  Or will you be stuck?\
      \  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a point and click adventure game where your character\
      \ is stuck in a room and you need to solve some easy and some complex puzzles\
      \ to try to figure out how to exit the room.  You don't know why you are in\
      \ the room, but you must figure out certain aspects of the room prior to leaving.\
      \  Your goal is to leave.  Explore the room, find items and use them to your\
      \ disposal.  Open the items you find.  Use the items together and use them in\
      \ different areas of the room.  If you're stuck, think harder. <br />\r\n<br\

    review: 'Guess I''m stuck


      "Clues" don''t really make sense, I can''t tell which clues go to which "puzzles"

      "Puzzles" are mostly math problems, trying to decipher the "clues", and the
      pixel hunt of trying to use inventory items


      Game is sold as complete, but the only thing in "settings" is resolution options
      and a message saying they don''t work yet.

      It doesn''t save automatically, you have to hit esc and save. If you just close
      the game you lose all progress.

      Not sure it''s worth starting over, let alone playing 10 times for the achievement.'
