Wouldn't purchase it on its own, though. It came in a very discounted bundle with other games, that's the only reason I have it and the main reason I'm not being too demanding with my review.\n\n\nThe animations are basic and honestly ugly looking when it comes to the characters. The dialogues are very few and brief, maybe to save costs. As a work around you find out most important plot points through notes or letters. Even when you're standing next to a character at one point...\n\nThe Hidden Object sections were good, definitely the highlight of the entire game, but the puzzles were clunky and boring. Expect a lot of aligning of things. Also, the logic for solving certain scenarios is super wacky. Had to break a statue at some point. Hammer? No, wouldn't work. Gunpowder and matches? No, got to be something else. The answes: Tie six balloons to the statue, fill the balloons with regular air so the rock solid statue somehow levitates, and then proceed to shoot each ballon with an arrow to have the statue fall down and break into pieces. Just insane.\n\nWhy am I giving this a positive review? It's an okahy enough game, it doesn't bug or glitch like some others I've encountered, and it doesn't pretendt to be something bigger than what it actually is. Just something quick and mindless you can play to pass the time when bored.","timestamp_created":1608603509,"timestamp_updated":1608603509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kLSPxPYCefmJvAI="}
