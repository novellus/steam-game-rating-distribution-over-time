    review: 'Well, this is disappointing. I have m y brand new Xbox One S Controller
      all set up in steam and have tested and calibrated it just fine, and this game
      will just not accept trigger inputs for acceleration and braking. Control of
      the car and all other buttons work, and since there is no way to remap buttons
      in the game, it is 100% unplayable. I guess no one else has bought it to notice
      this? I will try my dual shock 4 controller and if that works I will come back
      and update the review. Right now, all this game has given me is headaches. First
      launch was an endless spinning circle.. I waited for 10 ,mins and nothing happened,
      i.e. it crashed. Now it launches and I can even control the menu perfectly with
      the controller but it just refuses to accelerate or break. Will be getting a
      refund if the DS4 doesn''t work, ASAP.


      EDIT:

      The Dualshock 4 behaves exactly the same way. The game simply can not accept
      inputs from the triggers it actually tells you to press LOL.

      I also tried running it in Win7 compatibility mode just in case. So there you
      have it. This game is completely unplayable with a controller in windows, therefore
      is completely and utterly useless.'
