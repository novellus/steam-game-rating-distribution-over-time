    review: "Review of Overall Pack:\n\nTracks:\n\nFerrari test Track: mediocre. Just\
      \ a handful of hairpins.\n\nMugello: Both layouts are excellent and have a great\
      \ attention to detail.\n\nCars:\n\nF355 Challenge:  Absolutely fantastic. It\
      \ is an absolute dream to drive- especially with a stick-shift.\n\nFerrari Gr.\
      \ 4 car ( I can't remember the name) Looks great, sounds great, drives great-\
      \ but it is unbalanced. It can compete easily with the weaker Gr. 5 cars, but\
      \ it is in gr. 4. It is way more powerful than the Beemer pro-car and the Porsche\
      \ spirit of Le mans car. \n\n458 speciale: It's... alright. It just feels like\
      \ another super-car.\n\n250 GT + testarossa- My favorite car in this pack. It\
      \ balances well with the other GTC cars, and it expands the category nicely.\
      \ Same story with the 250 testarossa.\n\nF12tdf- fantastic car to drive- the\
      \ lowish down-force gives it a great feel of the point where excitement meets\
      \ fear. Ferrari territory.\n\nFXXK- This car is absolutely nuts! But I don't\
      \ like it. It has 1,000 horsepower carried through the rear wheels, and it feels\
      \ as if the first four gears are just not present- their ratios are so short-\
      \ and cannot be extended... It also feels as if it never has any grip, even\
      \ in slow corners.\n\nF40: fun car, however hard to drive.\n\n\nOverall, I give\
      \ this pack a 7/10- the best cars far outweigh the issues. Wait for it to go\
      \ on sale, and you will be quite happy.\n\n\n\n"
