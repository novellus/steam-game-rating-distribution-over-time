I love the alchemy style games, trying to figure out different combinations. This is the first one I've seen with 3 and 4 element combinations, not just 2. I will say there are a lot of combinations that aren't particularly obvious, but there's a robust hint system if you need it that will pretty much hold your hand if you get stuck. There's a lot of potential for growth in this, so hopefully they do more updates to add in more elements.\n\nAlso, \"clown\" :D","timestamp_created":1609990654,"timestamp_updated":1609990692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyou77fYCdYaXwQI="}
