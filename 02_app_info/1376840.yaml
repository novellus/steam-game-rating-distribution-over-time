    review: 'Lurkers Is a pretty cool little game. It definitely focuses more on the
      story than the romance, and the mystery is quite obvious. I knew who the villain
      was from the first conversation I had with him, and it wasn''t because i''m
      good at solving mysteries lol. There were also some typos and grammatical issues,
      especially towards the end of the game. The game''s greatest strengths are it''s
      atmospheric soundtrack, and Jack the Ripper, of course. It helps that I find
      the Jack the Ripper case fascinating.


      It was fun, and I enjoyed my time with it. 5/10'
