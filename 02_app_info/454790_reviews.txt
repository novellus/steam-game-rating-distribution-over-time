Passable.\n\nIt's good - the voice acting is alright and the audio quality is okay, but I kinda agree that the script can be a liiiittle bit grating in terms of repetition... I think the main game is better, but I think that can be reasonably expected! The sound effects are kinda varying in quality, some are better than others, and the binaural feature is definitely an awesome touch even if it's not the same as the things you hear in other drama CDs (or Cookie-tan's videos!) \n\nA great add-on to the main game.","timestamp_created":1552810552,"timestamp_updated":1552810552,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrJWuxekCfoCfvQE="}
