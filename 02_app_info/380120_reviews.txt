I find this game very interesting, as it is in many ways very unusual for the genre. \nThe main thing that makes this RPG unique, is that there is no experience or gold as such. You power-up by exploring the world, finding secrets and solving puzzles. Therefore, power-ups are limited, so you can't just mindlessly invest your time into grinding if the upcoming boss fight is too tough. And it means that you need to think very carefully what skill, stat or piece of equipment you are going to take next, read and read over the manual with open damage formulas, which the author kindly provided you with. \nThe game is very challenging, even on the lowest difficulty level. Make sure you have investigated each corner of currently available world before you enter key boss fights. I am a kind of gamer who enjoys hard games, because you can always come back to them. Moreover, this game has lots of freedom in customizing your character and selecting gaming style, which again, means high replay value. The battle system is deep, yet not too overcomplicated. I've just beaten the game for the first time (as a mage/techmathurgist), and I'm sure I'll come back to Celia's Quest someday to experiment with different character builds or play it over on higher difficulty level. The game took me 33 hours, by the way, considering I had to start it from scratch once because of a dumb decision I made in the beginning. \nThe story, like I said before, is here mostly to drive the gameplay. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the way it is introduced, its humor, and the atmosphere of an absurd fantasy world. The only possible downside of the game I can think of is a bit rough difficulty curve. In my opinion, the beginning should be slightly easier. The first serious boss fight is too hard unless you do everything right. Mid/endgame, on the other hand, are balanced much better. \n\nI recommend this little game to hardcore gamers, especially those who dislike random encounters and mindless grind. Totally worth playing and money spent.","timestamp_created":1514282853,"timestamp_updated":1514282853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51337134838104248","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qNSSyeACco/MkwE="}
