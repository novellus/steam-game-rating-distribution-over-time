    about_the_game: "It is an incredible combination of a motorcycle race and a shooter.\
      \ Do you have enough reaction and accuracy to survive and get to the end of\
      \ the route? You start the game at furious speed rushing a route at night. But\
      \ why damaged cars are scattered on the road and there are no people around?\
      \ After a while you understand why... Devilish creatures appear on the road\
      \ and you kill them with your weapon. After some time you meet more horrible\
      \ creatures: something hides from you behind a truck, something breaths out\
      \ the fire and tries to kill you. Various powerful weapon helps you. A shot-gun,\
      \ a disker, a rocket launcher, a gun that shoots lightning bolts!<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nYou think demons breathing out the fire are everything you should\
      \ be afraid of? What about a demon on a motorcycle with a scythe, with which\
      \ he will gladly chop your head off? And cars, helicopters and other machinery\
      \ possessed by evil forces? You think that is all? If you can survive you are\
      \ going to meet a really huge and dangerous creature. You should know that you\
      \ will need all of your reaction and accuracy to get to the end!<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nControl<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou should sit when you play. Moving your\
      \ head lets you turn the motorcycle. The trigger lets you shoot any weapon.\
      \ The shift button lets you switch the weapon. Moving speed is regulated by\
      \ the game. All the static obstacles are fatal when hitting them.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nWeapon<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA gun (the only weapon with endless cartridges),\

      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nEnemies<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVarious kinds of demonic creatures:\
      \ running, jumping and breathing out the fire. Also cars, buses, helicopters\
      \ and jets possessed by evil forces. The death with a scythe on a motorcycle.\
      \ And a really huge and dangerous creature at the end."
