It is the route I keep coming back to after trying others, particularly in Quick Drive using a timetable from a suitable Bradshaws.\nHere we have a pack of 10 new scenarios, all very different to those that come with the route. These scenarios are exciting, challenging and fun to run. What is not to like? \nThe scenarios utilise first generation diesels but with some steam. Anyone who is a fan of trains that had to be driven and need a certain level of skill will be well pleased with this pack.\nIntriguingly the pack is labelled  Weardale & Teesdale Scenario Pack 01 which suggests there may be further packs - yes pleeeeease.\nAt Â£6.99 it represents excellent value and I would have no hesitation in recommending it.\nThank you Dovetail for this add-on pack.\nUpdate: Have completed 5 scenarios successfully and they are great. Some of the scenarios head up branch lines not utilised in the main route so very interesting. HOWEVER:\nScenario WVR 1.06 Maintaining Lands Viaduct does NOT work. You have to exit yard to pick up brake van past a signal at danger - request to pass and request is approved BUT as soon as you pass the signal its game over for passing a signal at danger. Surely this should have been picked up and sorted if any sort of quality checks had been made. Quality checks must be mandatory before releasing any software !!!! Also class 105 from Bishop Auckland to Middleton gave me a score of 0 points when I had actually scored 765.\nI gave this pack a recommendation when it first came out because Weardale is my favourite route and I really wanted more scenarios, particularly over some of the branch lines which this pack offered. Unfortunately the quality control is noticeable by its absence. Scenarios that do not work completely spoil this pack. Save your money and do not buy.","timestamp_created":1585417221,"timestamp_updated":1595587698,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596938788890838623","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1YOcwPMCfurv+wE="}
