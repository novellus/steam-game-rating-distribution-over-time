    review: "Game is still in the works. The developer is very responsive in their\
      \ discord about issues, suggestions, and general feedback. \n\nThe game itself\
      \ is a very good recreation of the Project Diva titles (or Miracle Girls Festival\
      \ if you somehow never heard of PD lol) and on its own is well made. There is\
      \ not too many songs in the base game but it does allow use of charts from PPD\
      \ (fan-made project diva simulator of the sort) and the community consistently\
      \ is putting out charts of their own in the Workshop. If you're willing to step\
      \ into community charts, you'll find a near endless supply of quality rhythm\
      \ gameplay. \n\nI look forward to seeing this game in its finished state!"
