The visuals and music are on point. The gameplay follows the Punch-Out formula perfectly: time your punches and dodge or counter theirs. If you make a mistake, your character will take a bit to recover and that is more than enough time for your opponent to mess you up, so learn from coach Baby T and DON'T JUST MASH THE BUTTONS!\n\nThere's also a bunch of stuff to keep things fresh like \"hype moves\", items and even progression. Successfully landing a hype move rewards you with a bit of energy and you need that energy to dish out the heavy punishment, so you quickly start to get into this flow of dodging, countering and landing hype moves until you can finally let your hands fly. \nIf you lose your focus it's easy to get overwhelmed and lose a lot of health, but you can get some back by popping up some DRANX bottles during the fight (that's considered a b*tch move, though).\n\n\nAll in all, I'm happy with my purchase. It looked cool in the trailers, and it is cool when you play it. Also, it's on early access, so it'll probably get even better.\n \nPlay this if you want to knock out an ugly alien with a slap.","timestamp_created":1610065191,"timestamp_updated":1610091509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563145339488983154","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ40Na78PYCf/i0wQI="}
