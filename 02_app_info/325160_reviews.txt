The interesting, intertwining stories have nice pacing, and the puzzles have a decent difficulty level. Graphics had a couple nice surprise effects. Music and sound was passible. The game uses 285Mbs of diskspace and uses the Unity game engine. I played this game on an old Ubuntu desktop with the keyboard and mouse. I saw no technical issues.","timestamp_created":1591404744,"timestamp_updated":1591404744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629200875759124756","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1KnHw/ICf9yzjAI="}
