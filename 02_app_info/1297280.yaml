    about_the_game: The <strong>Last Spell Demo</strong> lets you experience the first
      five days of the final game. You start with only 3 heroes at your disposal,
      and their weapons are... not the best ones. But they can still make use of cool
      skills to get rid of those damned monsters! Build up your defenses, protect
      your city, and slay the very first hordes of enemies you will encounter in The
      Last Spell. Be prepared, because there will be many more nights in the final
      game.<br><br>We are still fiddling with a lot of features, so don't be scared
      if some may seem unbalanced or temporary.<br><br>The difficulty of the demo
      was specially balanced so that it provides a challenge on a 5 ingame days time
      frame, so don't be surprised if you finish the 5 days in a pretty bad shape  The
      difficulty in the final game will of course be different.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Important
      note:</strong></h2> the roguelite elements and difficulty settings are not present
      in this demo, which will change a lot the way the game will be played in the
      final release.
