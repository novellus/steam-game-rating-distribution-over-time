    review: "well, you need to have the program installed in a specific named local\
      \ computer location- right now as installed thru Steam- it cannot find the sample\
      \ files, let alone milkshape models on my computer. \n\nAnother problem is the\
      \ Convex hull creation- I saw how to make a cube and was able to carve it- YOU\
      \ as designer need to improve the tool menu so WE as buyers can see what you\
      \ have designed. It may be a useful tool- but it is just a guessing game at\
      \ the moment- and not in a good way.\nOtherwise good luck to you- I see your\
      \ sample video and pics- it is working on YOUR computer. Try to think out of\
      \ your box and let purchasers like myself use your application- who knows we\
      \ might pay more for a updated app!"
