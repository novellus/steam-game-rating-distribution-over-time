    review: "In my best English ;)\nI like the game. But there are some things i think\
      \ could be improved.\nI got into this kinda games due to Making history, i bought\
      \ the game. I played it and find it impossible to play with the minor countries\
      \ (game editor). I also tried to give a specific country some extra resources\
      \ but i haven't found a way to raise the produced crop. This is expensive on\
      \ the market so i ended with a incredible negative balance each year wich causes\
      \ my workers to be less effective which only makes the financial problems bigger\
      \ and the factory outcome evenly poor. \nPlaying the mayor countries is nice\
      \ but you are being forced into the historical situation a bit too much to my\
      \ opinion. I soon tried to make my own history as the game says to support but\
      \ find that hard to realize.\nIt is a nice game and it got me into this type\
      \ of games. I've been looking at hearts of iron but i'm thinking about playing\
      \ victoria II first."
