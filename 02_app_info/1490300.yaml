    review: 'TL;DR at the very bottom.


      To preface this just a little bit, as a fan of Supergiant since the days of
      Bastion, I''ve always adored the shit out of their music. Darren Korb and Ashley
      Barrett have easily become my favorite duo for gaming soundtracks, and with
      every single game release SG has hit it out of the park in just about every
      department, including music. If you''ve not listened to their soundtracks before,
      please do, but make sure to play some of the games first; they 100% add to the
      emotional value of each OST without fail.


      With the release and subsequent explosion of Hades hype, I became a bit worried
      -- I''ve seen a number of other companies go through something similar where
      the explosion of a certain game''s popularity would push them into a point of
      either selling out or starting to settle into mediocrity while giving only to
      fans of the big entry because of how lucrative it is.


      But that was not necessarily so with Supergiant. Now, I''m fairly certain this
      album was put together long before Hades got huge, but the thing is is that
      that game still had plenty to draw from in its library... yet Transistor, my
      favorite of the games, got the majority of the songs on this album, with almost
      every single one of its vocal tracks being represented. Transistor, probably
      the second least popular besides Pyre (which is also a game I''m glad got plenty
      of representation here!). That, along with the beautiful 8-minute Bastion medley,
      showed me that no, Supergiant absolutely still cares about old fans and their
      older games. They care about their roots, and they sure as hell still care about
      the art in their games. I found Hades to generally be lacking in some of the
      artistic departments that Transistor had shone the most in, but I have so much
      hope thanks to this album. I have hope that this studio will continue to make
      games that really do put the art up on a well-deserved pedestal while still
      retaining the sheer quality in gameplay and enjoyment that their past games
      have.


      =====


      So, now for the actual review. If you''re someone who''s just found Supergiant''s
      games and music through Hades, I honestly don''t recommend this album to you
      at all. What you need to do is take those $10 you would have spent on this,
      find Bastion/Transistor/Pyre, and pick up at least one of them (especially if
      one or more are on sale). I find that Transistor is the easiest to recommend
      out of them as it''s the most similar to Hades gameplaywise, though all three
      of them are worthwhile games for sure.


      If you''re someone who''s played at least 2 out of the 4 Supergiant games, it
      might be worth it just to listen to the stuff you know *and* to hear what you
      can from the games you''ve missed. It might just push you to give em a shot,
      cause it''s definitely worth it.


      If you''ve played 3 or 4 out of the 4 games, you obviously will want to pick
      this up. It''s beautiful and worth twice its price, easily (or even more so
      -- I know I bought the vinyl).


      Personally, I found the renditions of Never to Return, The Spine, and Vagrant
      Song to be a bit lacklustre compared to the rest. They weren''t bad at all,
      but I think they either missed part of what made the original good (the simplicity
      of Vagrant and the heavy percussion and bite of The Spine) or happened to be
      songs that were meant to be looped (Never to Return and The Spine). It''s unfortunate,
      but they do at least sound good anyway. I just think they''re weaker than the
      rest of the album.


      As for everything else, ohhhh boy. It opens well with We All Become, and In
      Circles/Lament of Orpheus/She Shines are great, but I think the standouts are
      most certainly the last three songs. In true Supergiant fashion, they totally
      nail the ending song(s): In the Flame, Paper Boats, and Remember the Bastion
      are superb closers to this album, and they alone are worth the asking price.
      Paper Boats has been my favorite Supergiant song for pretty much ever, and I
      think this version of it did it justice with its fresh take on the sheer emotional
      impact of the original. In the Flame perfectly captures all the feelings of
      hype I and others had when Pyre was first announced with those awesome trailers...
      and Remember the Bastion really does put together several beautiful themes into
      one medley package the game absolutely deserves.


      This album is, in a few words, beautiful, heartfelt, and a labor of love. I
      really hope Korb and Barrett have gotten enjoyment out of all the stuff they''ve
      made together, because they deserve it for the top-notch quality of all of this
      music. This album is a perfect showcase of a lot of what makes Supergiant stand
      out as a special little studio in this heavily saturated industry. Hell, it
      even makes me wish I had the skills to help a studio like them out -- it brings
      back feelings I had as a teen when I played through the ending of Bastion and
      thought, "Fuck, I wish I could work here someday."


      =====


      [b]TL;DR:[/b] Buy this album if you''ve played more than half of Supergiant''s
      first 4 games, and consider buying it if you''ve played 2. Wait until you''ve
      played more of them if you''ve only played 1. Top-notch album, and respectful
      of the games that got Supergiant to where they are now. Bravo, Korb and co.'
