    review: "Simple to play and quick to learn, we enjoyed this at the weekend just\
      \ challenging between friends who could score the highest. Spiders are particularly\
      \ creepy, graphics good. Would like more levels. The Good:\n\n1. Graphics are\
      \ well done although the start room had some major shimmie issues for me\n2.\
      \ Easy to get into (Swing shovel, reload grip buttons, and throw brains with\
      \ MCs)\n\nThe not so good for me:\n\n1. Wave Shooter type game...blah (I did\
      \ like the brain level though)\n2. Once Mummies get across chaperone you really\
      \ have missing issues like all the other wave shooters and you immediately start\
      \ losing life but can't see them hitting you\n3. Spider level has the spiders\
      \ just appearing so if you just looked in one direction and it is clear there\
      \ might be a spider appearing as soon as you turn away. This leaves no room\
      \ for anticipation and you will find your self constantly turning your head\
      \ (more so than you should) because of this. I prefer to have them just walking\
      \ from some place far so you can time things more accurately instead of just,\
      \ \"Surprise I'm here now but just wasn't !!! \". \n4. It is a stationary wave\
      \ game. I just wanted to travel around in the nice environments. Wave shooters\
      \ are not very immersive or exciting for me. They may be 3D but I want to free-roam.\n\
      \nConclusion: If you like anything wave then this is for you. If you are like\
      \ me and am tired of wave shooters then this probably won't hold your interest\
      \ long but the brain level has promise and could use some more thought and last\
      \ longer. That was a fun level even though it was a simple concept.  Interesting\
      \ and different. Not a bad game at all. Easy controls and a different concept\
      \ make all the difference here. Would give it an 8/10. \n\nFree so try it.\n\
      \nHere is a first play video I did below. It will be viewable soon.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/OIKuy-idpic"
