    about_the_game: "After the last catastrophe, the world got desolated and degenerated.\
      \ Like everyone else, you woke up in a tower with many different rooms. Where\
      \ is this? How did you get here? You only have a smart device and an unknown\
      \ transmitter with you, and no knowledge of what happened. You have no other\
      \ choice but to embark on this journey to survive in this mysterious tower and\
      \ explore the truth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLegend has it that the tower lies at\
      \ the end of the world and that it was born from the catastrophe. Although this\
      \ is a cursed place, it is said that at the top of the tower lies precious treasures\
      \ and powers strong enough to rule the world. Many brave and greedy people often\
      \ enter the tower for the power that lies on top, and some people are thrown\
      \ into the tower as a punishment. Very few people can survive the horrors of\
      \ the tower. This is a live-action climbing game that all human beings can participate\
      \ in. To live, or to die.. It is up to you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br\
      \ />\r\n1. Procedurally generated levels, each run is an unique adventure!<br\
      \ />\r\n2. Challenging combat mechanics which requires critical timing!<br />\r\
      \n3. Collect clues and solve puzzles to unravel the secret of the tower!<br\
      \ />\r\n4. Wield over hundred pieces of armor and weaponry to dominate the tower!<br\
      \ />\r\n5. Your death won't be in vain, become stronger after every revive!<br\
      \ />\r\n6. 4 Professions to choose from: Balancer, Attacker, Defender and Anger."
