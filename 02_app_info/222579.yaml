    review: Like some others on here, this was my first DLC as these were regular
      units on my local line when I were a lad and I often sat behind the driver pretending
      I was driving the train and watching the driver change gears, notching up/down
      and braking. This DLC replicates all that you have seen the driver do and I
      find this to be a very enjoyable unit to drive. It is quick drive enabled so
      you can drive it on any route imaginable.
