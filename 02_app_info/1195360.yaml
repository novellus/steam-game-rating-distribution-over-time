      \ DaRevieweD #45[/url]<-- [i]New review every Sunday[/i][/code]\n\nRed Ego Games\
      \ is an indie team that put out a demo for Re:Turn back in June for the Summer\
      \ Game Festival (seriously so informative and eventful) and I thought it was\
      \ on the right track~ at least in its atmosphere and train setting- which btw\
      \ we don't seem to get a lot of in horror; excluding RE0 and a few other recent\
      \ titles in 2019-20. As great as demos go and I get that they're only placeholders\
      \ that may-may not be in the final game, I want to point out the latter however\
      \ is a far cry (will get into this later on)!! So, all aboard?    \n\n\n[h1]\"\
      Last Boarding Call\"[/h1]\n\n[u]The Gist:[/u]\nSaki and her college friends\
      \ are about to graduate soon. They have a wilderness excursion to ponder over\
      \ the end of their school lives and future relations. That is until a quarrel\
      \ ensues, suspicion thrown followed by the appearance of a train well out of\
      \ nowhere. Now, where will this take them? \n\n[spoiler] ! Excuse me, no stowaways!![/spoiler]\n\
      \n[h1][+] PROS;[/h1]\n\n[b](a) Destination: Nowhere[/b]\n2D side-scroller that\
      \ doesn't take much to learn; you move, gather key items and unlock things.\
      \ Which quickly allows you focus on the good stuff. This comes in the form of\
      \ puzzles having both creepy Japanese folklore and childlike charm involving\
      \ dolls, colored drawings among other things. This is where the in-game notebook\
      \ comes in handy but also grab a pen-paper or whip out that smartphone because\
      \ they could test whether you're smarter than a 5th grader. It's only at the\
      \ halfway point that you can run with CTRL, to signal a change in determination.\
      \ \n\n[b](b) Off The Rails[/b] \nThe plot is extremely pulled off! It touches\
      \ on university anxieties and soul-searching *snorts* which ngl really stuck...\
      \ Definitely for lovers in mind and to appreciate, but it evokes a sense of\
      \ compassion nonetheless. The hardships of love and what could keep them apart;\
      \ circumstances sometimes outside the couple's control. What's also invigorating\
      \ is the duality in the storylines because you may think the past is done and\
      \ over with but here it's very much still kicking. Of course, the characters\
      \ also standout! Most notably Saki whose empathy is strong but is only human\
      \ in that she doubts herself. She along with the train inhabitants (some never\
      \ named) definitely carried the drama to its conclusion! \n\n[b](c) Appreciate\
      \ That View[/b]\nI have been drawn to more pixel arts recently, this is no different~\
      \ They get the job done and looks delightfully pleasing. You'll spend a lot\
      \ of time in the train so opening up its areas gradually and seeing a different\
      \ side to it entirely would make up for more than a passing interest. There\
      \ are also what I call 'breathing moments' which are CGs but shows their conviction\
      \ and body language. Though fewer in number, I live for these!! The complete\
      \ piano composition is to die for~~\n\n[b](d) P-pump The Brakes![/b]\nTruthfully,\
      \ the horror isn't always very obvious (until I've had my way bwahaha). Yeah,\
      \ I also wanted that \"horror\" genre to be removed but then I got to thinking.\
      \ It's never expositioned, but the events that occurred from the beginning were\
      \ [spoiler]orchestrated by restless beings[/spoiler]. I know it sounds obvious\
      \ but that's because it's made out to be \"coincidence\". What's even more chilling\
      \ is that connection the [spoiler]spirit world[/spoiler]with our physical environment.\
      \ \n\nThe train is an object of tragic history yet its negative emotions of\
      \ heartache, misunderstanding stay on affecting others, worst being similar-minded\
      \ individuals. Some puzzles bear meanings that go beyond the surface level-\
      \ the reflections segment require more understanding of the actual Japanese\
      \ folklore masks to truly appreciate them. Similarly for saving progress, why\
      \ a phone? Makes you wonder~\n\nNow to interpret the \"one-way trip\" metaphor!\
      \ Firstly, growing up and the responsibilities along with it. The characters\
      \ expressing their disdain and fret about what's next, but some look forward\
      \ to it (or are they?). Number two (yuck) is the relation to death. [spoiler]How\
      \ some lives are meant to be taken away or you never know when it will happen.[/spoiler]\
      \ Last but not least, time being irreversible. Ultimately linear that it moves\
      \ forward but it can still be warped by emotions and feelings.\n\n\n[h1][-]\
      \ CONS;[/h1]\n\n[b](i) Status: Delayed[/b] \nAll this train-wreck of gut wrenches\
      \ is offset by the pacing. I mentioned Saki can only run from chapter 5 onward\
      \ where she decides \"you know what, I have legs\". So the first two hours alone\
      \ could've been 50 min had she not decide to take her sweet time, (it is a luxury\
      \ cruise, after all). Her exact reasoning is she knows what's up and can't afford\
      \ to be careful anymore. But yeah I know padding when I see it. Which is why-\n\
      \n[b](ii) Dark Passenger[/b]\nThere's a black hole in game design and objectives.\
      \ Picture you're in the first few chapters, can only walk jauntily to get a\
      \ key item here and then magically another appears all the way on the other\
      \ side. It can be pretty frustrating, because this occurs many, many times!\
      \ The logic goes \"I wasn't looking for this\" or \"this should reveal new objects\"\
      \ but mhmm... \n\nSome oversights with characters can be way off. Kanae reacts\
      \ to the terrible sights witnessed thus far adding to her personality. But other\
      \ partners paired up don't really, not as much. Or how Yuuta's claustrophic\
      \ but then goes with you in cramped restrooms. Minor thing is the first venture\
      \ of the luxury ride; decorative doors (no description whatsoever) and you're\
      \ expected to just walk to the end of both carriages. Next thing ya know- they\
      \ can be interacted with. It's eating away at me because this is the only instance\
      \ it haPPpPpe-\n\n[b](iii) Just Shake It Off[/b]\nThe underwhelming scares owes\
      \ much to the demo which portray a wholly different experience. Because that\
      \ one was more intense in pace and atmosphere.. Even bringing a scripted chase\
      \ much earlier ahead of chapters. \n\nI get demos are not accurate representations\
      \ but that was a low blow. The end product turns out to be stuck in gear one\
      \ for way longer than it needs to. Deaths also are heavily scripted with QTE\
      \ sequences... The big bad beastie could have been omitted altogether. \n\n\
      [b](iv) What Did Choo Expect? [/b]\nParting thoughts? First, the train setting\
      \ which is dope af but it also means you'd be confined primarily to its interiors\
      \ and you'd see much of what it has to offer by chapter 8. But hey, it's 10\
      \ bucks sooo~ \n\nMay I also say while the story started off excellently, I'm\
      \ hurt by the abrupt ending [spoiler] it's like \"suspicions confirmed, okay\
      \ bye!\"[/spoiler]but that's probably because we've been conditioned to want\
      \ and expect wholesome ones. It actually makes more sense some things just don't\
      \ have resolution, at least not in our eyes.\n\n\n[h1]\"Journey's Part of The\
      \ Destination.\"[/h1]\n\nIn short, Re:Turn was a commendable 2D sidescroller\
      \ with much emphasis on interesting themed-puzzles and one-track attention to\
      \ a well-crafted story. Romanticizing the notion of love transcending all barriers\
      \ and dimensions, perhaps much too literally that overtakes the horror elements\
      \ at times. Furthermore, I was captivated by the overall pixel art and dynamic\
      \ CG stills, giving a lasting impression that much like the train- also brought\
      \ the atmosphere to life. \n\nAs with all tube rides, the scheduling isn't always\
      \ as promised and no less true here. The game leaves you walking for well over\
      \ two hours before deciding okay, wiggle yer toes! Problematized further by\
      \ the need to travel back-forth for fetch quests. Which is why the game design\
      \ here is largely at fault and dragged the whole impact. Beyond some initial\
      \ unsettling, cliched scares in the beginning the gears shifts into romantic\
      \ mystery for the remainder of the touchingly nostalgic 4 to 5 hour journey.\
      \ Now THAT'S a fitting price for a train ticket!\n\n[h1]8/10[/h1]\n\n[b]Would\
      \ pay for this trip again![/b]"
