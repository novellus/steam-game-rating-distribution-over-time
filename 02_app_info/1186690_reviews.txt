[b]there's no inventory[/b], interacting with an item simply puts it in the lower left corner where the (let's call it) 'interaction log' is. all you need to do to fulfill an npc's request is interact with the appropriate items one after the other, but unlike [b]kili's treasure[/b], the order doesn't matter. it cuts down on going back and forth, but [b]the map still offers fast travel[/b], so it would've been a non-issue anyway.\n\nwalking around can be done with the mouse, the arrow keys or wasd, shift highlights interactable items even while moving around, and there's a help screen with all the controls. the presentation is great as ever (I love voxels), the music is very pleasant, there's windowed mode and resolution options, and you can save whenever you need or have to quit.\n\nthere's a lot to see and do, and while I didn't find the story as heartwarming this time, it still had its touching moments and was really amusing. if you're into charming, not too difficult adventures with likeable characters, pick this up (along with [b]kili's treasure[/b] if you haven't) even at full price for an afternoon or two's worth of family-friendly fun. and don't call me shirley!","timestamp_created":1587908577,"timestamp_updated":1587908577,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.657379329204559326","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47sCu2/ECforQgwI="}
