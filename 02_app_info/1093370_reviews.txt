While doing whatever it is that space engineers do, a hex was placed upon you by a celestial witch. Regardless of what unholy act you perpetrated to receive such a punishment, you must play the hand you were dealt. Finish your space engineer gig while dealing with the limitation of the hex: The ability to turn knobs in only six specific directions. \n\n[b][u]The Good[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]The game is fairly challenging.\n[*]The challenge actually ramps up instead of going all over the place.\n[*]Does a good job of showing new gameplay elements and letting you figure those out before moving on and incorporating new ones.\n[*]Worth the $3 price tag.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Neutral[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]Tandem movements for certain knobs.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Bad[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]The visuals are static throughout the game. It would have been nice to see some variation.\n[*]The soundtrack is very limited.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Pro Tips[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]If you get stuck in the levels that have tandem knobs, sometimes it helps to start with those and get them all in sync first.\n[*]There isn't always just one solution.\n[/list]\n\nThis is an example of a difficult game with a simple concept. Even so, the game is not abruptly challenging, yet there isn't really any hand-holding (even with the undo button).","timestamp_created":1586391449,"timestamp_updated":1586400380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxpi1rvECfKul/wE="}
