    review: "To be honest, i've bought this soundtrack immediately after hearing the\
      \ first seconds of \"Get Sherlock\". \n\nI didn't use any of the tracks in my\
      \ games yet, but I'm listening to them while creating them. They are a good\
      \ source of inspiration and i really would buy it again.\n\nKudos to you, Mr\
      \ Atkinson."
