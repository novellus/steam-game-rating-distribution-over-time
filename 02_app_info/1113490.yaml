    review: "When it comes to fishing, I\u2019ll be the first to admit there\u2019\
      s a million other things I\u2019d rather do before stomping into a cold, wet\
      \ river and waiting for hours just for a nibble; however, River Legends: A Fly\
      \ Fishing Adventure gave me all of the joys of fishing with none of the negatives\
      \ attached. It\u2019s calming, it\u2019s challenging, and it\u2019s definitely\
      \ rewarding. This is the perfect game to unwind from a particularly stressful\
      \ video game or after a long day at work. If you even remotely enjoy video games\
      \ and are looking for something different and wholesome, River Legends: A Fly\
      \ Fishing Adventure is definitely a trophy catch."
