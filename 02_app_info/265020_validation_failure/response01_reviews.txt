I bought one copy and Gifted another so am heavily out of pocket. I sent a ticket to steam about being refunded and got the standard Refund is not our policy reply, i am now left wondering what i have to do. I am pleased to see that the game has been removed from the store and so it should of been, but does that indicate that steam will now reimburse those of us who purchased this abomination of a game.
