I thought Marlene was bad. This is bad puzzles, and gameplay mechanics (you'll see within seconds). The idea is to make you die alot until you fiqure out the nonsensicle puzzle, or rage quit because the key fell through the floor again. It also crashes alot, including steam and making my computer black screen twice. If my video card turns out to be burning out, I'll let you know. I hope it is.\n\ntl;dr Another one of those lame UE4 oculus-centric games with moderate roomscale/vive support.\n\n[spoiler]Get crowbar, use on tile get key, use shard of plaster from that room to cut light wire (wut), use resulting wire fragment to fix cirtcuit breaker, activate circuit breaker, use key to open desk drawer, solve code (hopefully easy one), then solve room puzzle by studying the 4 moves it makes and reversing them, resetting for mistakes. finale. see decent female avatar, keep review as is.[/spoiler] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoUBemKRzpo","timestamp_created":1480326045,"timestamp_updated":1546216061,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520994305610656738","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hJfqgOgCcLrGag=="}
