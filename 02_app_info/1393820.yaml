    review: By far one of the best games I've played in a LONG time! Just when you
      think you've found everything in the game, you discover something new! Between
      the story, the puzzles, and the characters, there's tons to love. The story
      keeps you interested, the puzzles are challenging without the "wtf do i do"
      factor, and the characters are SO CUTE! The folks who made this clearly have
      a passion for games! 10/10
