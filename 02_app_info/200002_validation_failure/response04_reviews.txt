I was disappointed with this guide because it didn't give the level of detail I was expecting from it. The searching was hard when trying to find info on specific things. This guide was no really a help during the game. It does how ever help with finding the little things in the game but can be frustrating to find again when you loose you place or restart the game. The lack of content in this guide make it not worth the buy. I did however get a deal for the guide and the game together at a really good price which I would suggest doing if you haven't bought the game yet. If you do get this guide make sure to get it at a very discounted price because then you will get your monies worth out of it. But as the current guide is at the moment its not worth it. You can find most things in the game from the in-game map.","timestamp_created":1331360438,"timestamp_updated":1331360438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw74LR/bUCctKxCg=="}
