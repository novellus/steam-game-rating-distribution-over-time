It's a fun western style, steampunk, wave based shootout with robots. If one of those words doesn't convince you to try this game ( assuming you own a compatible headset ) then you're probably as lifeless as the robots I turned to scrap in this game. This first person shooter is, as I said above, a wave based shooting gallery, taking place in a western town dominated by no-good ROBOTS! And it's your job to... well... DESTROY THEM! It's that simple. Your guns are on your waist, you point said guns... then you shoot. Movement is done via a teleportation system (Point and click using the touch pad) that slows down time for a brief moment when used, adding even more to the shoot em up feel I assume the developers were going for. This game is very simplistic but has a lot of charm. For instance when a robot has a hat on, you can shoot the hat off! That doesn't sound like a lot, but believe me it's fun doing it yourself in game. But this also holds an actual game play element, as you soon discover that hats act as an extra hit for the robots. Soon every enemy has a hat and I'm frantically (and quite comically) shooting dozens of hats of of the mechanical enemies. Another fun mechanic is the ability to remove enemy limbs. By shooting the robots arms or head or even lower body, you can remove weapons and armor. However removing the head will cause the foe to blindly shoot everywhere not just you as they attempt to end you before they explode! Removing both arms causes the robots to go \"Screw this\" and running into you and exploding taking a chunk out of your health. Let me tell you, there are few things in my day to day life that mach the terror of a giant robot running towards me ready to take us both out.\n\nThere's a lot of other things to praise but I don't want to spoil everything. No lets hurry and talk about some... Problems...\n\nThe reload mechanic is a bit finicky when you aren't actively looking at your holsters. This may be on purpose but if not then some fine-tuning would be nice.\n\nThe boss (Who I won't spoil ) is a tad bit dull, as all three versions of him are seemingly the same. Perhaps implementing some new attacks in each level that have something to do with the theme would make it better. Like in the town level, have enemies rush out of the bar with no weapons, making it seem as though they are drunk, or in the mine level, have a mine cart circling around the arena with enemies in them, etc, etc. That's just about it, one more thing in just a second, this game is simple yet fun, all I can really ask for is... well more levels. I know the theme is a western shootout, but I think you can do more, Imagine like an underwater level in an old shipwreck, or even a level on the moon. But if you stick to western that's still cool. Just continue to make content an all will be good.\n\nThe last thing I want to say is pretty bad though. The teleport feature has a major bug! If I get close to a gate (these gates are usually closed until you complete the area you are in) I clip through the gate and teleport into the checkpoint room. As you can imagine... this is BAD! I experimented with this bug and was able to complete the first level (not including the boss.) in ruffly 30-45 seconds. This is game breaking as you could probably beat the entire game in about 10-15 minutes. whereas not using this bug has the game running around an hour to 2 hours depending on how you play. PLEASE DEVELOPERS! You must fix this or this game will most likely not see as much success as you or I or any other fans want it too! Seriously it took me ten minutes to find this glitch because like most people when playing a VR game, the first thing I did was see what happens when I clip through the wall. This would not be a tiny but that no one would notice. \n\nMy suggestion, another VR title, Budget cuts, would have a similar problem if this was possible as the game has you navigate maze like offices to escape a building. To combat this problem the designed it so that everything in the players vision when walking into a wall or solid object, to become a sort of wire frame X-ray version of the model, along with this, everything freezes and the player can no longer use Items or the teleport gun to navigate until they step out. Attempting to walk through walls doesn't work either as the game will remain like this until you return back through the wall or object you initially stepped through. \n\nI believe implementing something like this is the best way to combat this rather nasty bug.\n\nOver all the Copper Canyon shootout is a rather hidden gem on the Steam VR store. (I say hidden gem as I haven't seen many talk about this game to much which is a real shame.) If you own a headset, Give this one a shot as even with the problems I mentioned, \"speedrunning\" this game doesn't net you any real rewards (except for the par time steam achievement.) and you'll enjoy it a whole lot more buy just playing the dang game correctly. \n\nTo sum it up. \n\nGame good, very fun, stylistic and lots of replay value. \nBad bug allows THE WHOLE GAME TO BE SKIPPED!\nOverall check this game out as it deserves FAR more attention then it is actually getting. \n\n9/10, fix that bug.","timestamp_created":1566968664,"timestamp_updated":1566968664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/Imn6+wCdvGd0QE="}
