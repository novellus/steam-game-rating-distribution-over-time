I found it when I was trying to think of a name for a god (or trying to see if there a was a god with a name), and this popped up. It sat in my wishlist for a long while, until I eventually bought it.\n\nI do like it. Sometimes, the controls have a hissyfit at me (and I get titchy back), but the concept is amazing and the music is great. (I recently bought most of BARCHboi's discography). The worlds are beautiful, and I love the aesthetic.\n\n-I'm not sure what the \"multiple endings\" means, but I have finished the game. My favourite room is the one with all the orbs that hum when you get close to them. And the one with the purplish twisting thing.\n\n-The lore is great. For some reason, it really reminds me of Roger Zelazny's \"Lord of Light,\" and it's so beautifully twisted? Maybe twisted isn't the right word but eh.\n\nI just really like this game. Definitely not fore everyone, but I really, really like it.","timestamp_created":1583478276,"timestamp_updated":1583478276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+p+q1/ACdviu9gE="}
