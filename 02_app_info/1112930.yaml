      /><br>Welcome to the world of dredgers. Dredgers are the men and monsters who
      all desire the gold and power lying in the dungeons beneath the earth. As a
      dredger you'll be exploring dungeons, looking for gold, potions, scrolls, food
      and more to further your endless descent into the depths. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1112930/extras/Buuum.gif?t=1574471156"
      /><br><br>As you slay enemies in your way, you'll earn experience which affords
      you higher stats, new classes and new skills. Deflect enemy projectiles as a
      fencer or call down devastating beams of light as a priest. Maybe you prefer
      leaving the grunt work to your followers as a summoner or lich? Or perhaps you
      prefer having excellent equipment instead, taking the blacksmith and artificer
      classes.<br><br>Even better, why not be all of the above? Dredgers places very
      little restrictions on classes, allowing you to combine them to your heart's
      content.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1112930/extras/Features.png?t=1574471156"
      /><br>As of release, Dredgers has the following features:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>30
      races to play and unlock.<br></li><li>40+ classes to skill into, with a myriad
      of possible builds.<br></li><li>Endless dungeon with 4 themed zones, and 3 challenging
      sub-zones.<br></li><li>253 items and equipment, ranging from torches and food
      to powerful staves, enchanted swords and more.<br></li><li>Majority of equipment
      and items can be crafted using specialized class skills and materials found
      throughout the dungeon.</li></ul><br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discord.gg/FGYGPD8"

    short_description: Based on traditional rogue-likes, Dredgers is a real-time dungeon
      crawler where you can play as 30 different races, each having their own stats
      and skills. With the unique class system you can mix and match classes as you
      desire, anything from an Archer-Knight to a Berserker-Summoner-Priest is possible!
