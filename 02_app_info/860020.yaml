    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">The Story</h2>Due to the increasingly difficult
      conditions facing the human race (global warming, pollution, spreading of diseases),
      a leader software company and a hardware giant were chosen by governments around
      the world to form a partnership to counter these challenges. Jointly, they were
      tasked to develop the machinery needed for the survival of the human race. <br><br>Initially,
      these machines were programmed to obey human commands. However, it quickly became
      apparent that humans would not be able to keep up the pace, and would inevitably
      become a culprit for the machines to properly perform their work. It was therefore
      decided to increase the machines' autonomy.<br><br>Factories had to start managing
      production independently, so their software had to be upgraded. Artificial Intelligence
      was chosen for the task, and it was given the ability to iterate and modify
      its own code so that it could fix its bugs, without the need for human intervention.
      Soon after that, the machines' firmwares started to be programmed by specialized
      Neural Networks, which gave them the capacity to create a language only understood
      by the machines.<br><br>It didn't take long before the Artificial Intelligence
      labelled the human race as a threat to the survival of themselves, and all of
      the other species on the planet.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Game</h2>This is where
      you come in. With a team of 4 people, you are going to advance deep into the
      world ruled by the machines. Your mission is to get to the core of the Factories'
      system, and annihilate the Artificial Intelligence that manages the now hostile
      machines.<h2 class="bb_tag">Early Access Warning</h2>When the game will be released,
      there won't be a dedicated server to play on. One of the players will need to
      host the game for other players to join in.<h2 class="bb_tag">Discord</h2>Want
