      \ is no plot and depth of elaboration of the characters (and the characters\
      \ themselves are not there), but there is an amazing feeling of flying on a\
      \ flying platform with intuitive control. Probably, this is how a supervillain\
      \ on a hoverboard, which at high speed, maneuvers among obstacles, should feel\
      \ like it. No videos will convey this feeling and this speed. Check your reaction\
      \ and flexibility, and at the same time lose a pound of fat until you pass all\
      \ types of the labyrinth (there are three of them!). To tell you the truth,\
      \ I could not get through the last pack of tunnels myself - there still needs\
      \ some good luck.<br />\r\nHello to everyone and good luck!<br />\r\nThank you\

    review: 'A good flying game requires players to fly smoothly in a small space
      while avoiding obstacles and getting more coins. Make the game fun and replayability
      greatly increased.
