      \ resources, employment, education, housing, happiness, and more.  You can start\
      \ on a relatively simple earth-like planet, or choose from some of the more\

      \ colony under the government of another player, who will help take care of\
      \ you and send you resources and aid in the early game.  Once you grow and your\

      \ either a single city game, or create a new region, which is a collection of\
      \ smaller colonies working together in tandem, sharing a similar resource and\
      \ technology pool.  Each play mode offers a unique style and different challenges.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, My Colony also includes both a map and texture editor,\
