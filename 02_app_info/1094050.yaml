    review: 'A rare one of a kind game that I wish was more common on the market.


      To get this out of the way first, by any means this game is not perfect. It
      looks rough in places, feels clunky at times, has some lapses in content balance
      and can become frustrating in the long run. All these are mostly deeper design
      decisions that could be made different - elevating a rough gem into something
      greater. So a game like this is not a lost cause by any means. That said, its
      not likely to happen with this title in particular due to how deep some of the
      changes would have to go to overhaul many of the core components of this game.
      Creating new games inspired by this one would be the better option.


      However.


      Despite it being an amateur production and the above disclaimer, this game has
      some of the most satisfying array of features and content that you will not
      find anywhere else on the market. There''s destructible terrain, open area 2D
      spaceflight with hyperdrives and long range scanners, a relatively complex modular
      system for your and enemy spaceships, allowing upgrades to individual components,
      swapping out a wide variety of exotic weapons, reactors, engines, etc, managing
      an inventory with bizarre cargo items that offer seemingly endless opportunities,
      benefits and functions to your ship or your pilot. This is a big game with lots
      of good stuff in it.


      There''s top-down spaceflight. There''s a lunar-lander esque planetary re-entry
      sections that seamlessly transition into a jetpack equipped powersuit ground
      battles, both in planets with gravity and in space within derelict wrecks featuring
      weightless environments.


      Your mission is to brave 20 open areas in space, building yourself up to face
      a powerful final boss at the end, where you go to deliver the final blow to
      the core of the enemy personally, on foot in power armor. Its epic, its satisfying
      and unpredictable. You''ll never know what you''ll be facing in the next sector
      and you''ll never know what you''ll find next to upgrade yourself.


      With a few exceptions, despite the game being ruthlessly hard - requiring you
      to use all the tools at your disposal and think ahead as you fight sector to
      sector - it is still very fair and it is possible to win every playthrough once
      you get the hang of it. This game is possible to beat and each victory feels
      incredibly satisfying as the final boss goes out with a bang. There''s even
      an escape sequence when you deal the final blow to the mainframe, where the
      entire level is collapsing all around you - physically via an actual destructible
      environment - the very terrain falling on top of you as you race back to the
      dropship you came in. That is incredibly unique and not seen in most games.


      The game now has an ingame tutorial that''ll teach you the basics and get you
      started, walking you through the seemingly complex controls and systems that
      may seem overwhelming at first. Thankfully, the learning curve is tame for this
      game, so you''ll get the hang of it quite quickly enough.


      The game is punishingly hard at first, but it gets easier as you learn it, so
      don''t be discouraged by your first death. Deaths may come swiftly out of nowhere
      at first, but once you''ve identified the causes, you''ll be only blaming yourself
      for doing a poor choice. My only hard recommendation is to go to the options
      menu and TURN OFF asteroid storms. If you try them, you''ll see why. This can
      only be done via main menu.


      Despite the flaws and the rough edges, this game is a gem that I hope could
      be an example to others for what meaningful and satisfying gameplay systems
      found in this game could be added elsewhere too. This game is a sincere passion
      project of a unique creative mind and it can be felt on all levels throughout
      the visuals, gameplay and music.


      This game, its structure and its features are rare. I think its made by a single
      person and it manages to deliver an experience that most high budget studios
      usually with more people that I have fingers could only dream off.


      I recommend this game to everyone that loves space/scifi games, even if it ends
      up being too hard or rough for you, at least just to see the features and the
      content it offers and be inspired by it. I personally want to see the creativity
      of this game''s author be a more common thing in the industry, to be brave and
      believe in creating games that follow the true passions of your heart.'
