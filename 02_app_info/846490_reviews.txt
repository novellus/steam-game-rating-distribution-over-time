Very cute art, gentle ambient music, and once you get past the tutorial levels, surprisingly challenging and compelling levels.  I've played up through level 13 at this point in the Desert realm, and the difficulty curve is pretty well established so far.  Hoping I can convince some friends to play, as it looks like in later levels the Leaderboards could be pretty fun to try to keep top slot -- a lot of nuanced strategies to improve your score on any given level.  \n\nMy only complaint thus far is that there's a bug where occasionaly I will get the intro screen for Level 11 (boss level) even though I'm on a later level.  Not a showstopper, just exit and go back into the level and it's fixed, but looking foward to an update -- would be sweet to add more traps and tools, too!  \n\n","timestamp_created":1539882084,"timestamp_updated":1539882084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6vyHxOYCea70rAE="}
