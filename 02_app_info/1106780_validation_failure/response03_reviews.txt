Developer is realistic and works on the game mechanics rather than enviroment, which still look crappy. The gunplay however is really good, even has recoil in guns. Wasn't able to test out PVP against other players because i was the only one on the server.\n\nThe developer has a general idea how to form the game, but for now its still really pre-alpha gameplay. \n\nIf you are going to pickup this game don't put high hopes on thje gameplay yet, just see it as an early investment into the game, so the developer can work on the future of the game and eventually hire more developers.\n\nWhat i would love to see is a website of the publisher, this way he can express the game more.","timestamp_created":1567693822,"timestamp_updated":1567694022,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw14z2gO0Cd5nb0QE="}
