    about_the_game: Hailstorm is a multiplayer-focused sci-fi shooter designed for
      VR, with a focus on agile locomotion and gameplay customization. Players enter
      battle equipped with electrical body armor, wrist-mounted rocket thrusters,
      a wingsuit, up to 4 weapons, and 4 grenades. Custom game variants allow for
      nearly everything to be tweaked to create a wide range of gameplay from insane,
      high speed aerial combat to slow and careful tactical scenarios. User generated
      maps are fully supported and can be created in Unreal Editor and downloaded
      from Steam Workshop.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Walk with the thumbpad and
