It may be a useful tool- but it is just a guessing game at the moment- and not in a good way.\nOtherwise good luck to you- I see your sample video and pics- it is working on YOUR computer. Try to think out of your box and let purchasers like myself use your application- who knows we might pay more for a updated app!","timestamp_created":1484253349,"timestamp_updated":1484253349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511196434497833252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yJiZytkCeI63bw=="}
