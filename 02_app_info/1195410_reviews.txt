The new mechanics blend in to the game and with the SIRALIM universe even more. congratulations, very, very solid game,\n\n2)Played it so far, very interesting\nMy personal liking is for quick battles which are present. Strategy comes in knowing your opponent and be able to counter it. Not only you need to abuse their weaknesses, you gotta cover your own.\n\nI like the creatures artwork, expanding the siralim series concepts, all looking beautiful so far\nOST is very good\n\nCan be a bit hard but you have acess to your stable, where the cards you got are, for easy switching. Not a big punishment for losing, and winning makes you stronger.\n\nSo far, very good\n\nReview em portugues\nhttps://filopoisquilo.blogspot.com/2020/04/trial-of-gods-siralimccg-e-o-mais.html","timestamp_created":1584125517,"timestamp_updated":1607019344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.610123097896575928","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1584188643,"developer_response":"Thank you for taking the time to review the game!
