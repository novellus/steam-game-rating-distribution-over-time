And in fact this game fails to live up to its predecessor in my humble opinion. If this had the story and the dark atmosphere of the first game with modern graphics, I would give this a 10/10.\n\nThat being said, I think it's still a fun experience with some interesting new mechanics. The story is not bad either, I just didn't like the conclusion that much. The end of the first game just blew me away. But I guess it's hard to achieve the same effect with a sequel. \n\nThe game has its moments, though and I think is well worth your time, if you are looking for a classic point and click style adventure. This is certainly among the better ones of the past few years.\n\nIf Revolution Software makes another sequel, I will buy it, and I wouldn't regret doing so, if it's as good as this one. But maybe next time, they should focus on a different part of the world they have created instead of Union City. The wasteland or some of the other mega cities for example. There's still great potential to be tapped into.","timestamp_created":1609852846,"timestamp_updated":1609853733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iNGw6fYCdZTZwAI="}
