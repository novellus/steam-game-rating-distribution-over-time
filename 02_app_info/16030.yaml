    review: Classico gioco in cui combinare oggetti, graficamente molto bello con
      la variante di non avere uno schema di una forma predefinita ma cambia a ogni
      livello. Questo rende ogni livello da risolvere in modo leggermente diverso
      dal precedente. Se vi piace il genere merita di essere giocato.
