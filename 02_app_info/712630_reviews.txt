As others have mentioned, the digital pdf artbook is only 25 pages (not 40) but it is very detailed with high res pictures, colour and b & w drawings throughout.  It was designed for printing that each page is 2x A4 pages but the PDF translation results in both pages becoming 1x A3 page.  If that makes sense.  Don't worry there is no crease down the middle.  Pictures look great as wallpaper on a 1080p desktop.  Soundtrack is awesome and crisp as in game, 29 tracks in all in wav format.
