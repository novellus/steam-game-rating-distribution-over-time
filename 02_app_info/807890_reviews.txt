Unfortunately, this game is not about general knowledge. The scope of the questions are quite narrow, mostly focus in Big Bang Theory, Gravity Falls and Adventure Time. I feel like being tested whether I know what are the developer’s hobbies and interests. I was expecting general knowledge questions or broader topics. Even if the game supposed to have only geek questions, it should have wider topics than that.\n\nThe game a bit buggy for me. Sometimes, if I answered the quiz question wrongly, the game still put my answer is wrong after I restarted the level and my answer is correct. And the achievement to disarm 100 bombs (Seasoned Minesweeper) doesn’t make sense because there are less than 100 or even 50 levels involving bombs. It means you need to play the levels repetitively until the achievement gets unlocked.","timestamp_created":1582686154,"timestamp_updated":1582686154,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0cXcv/ACcurP9AE="}
