    review: I remember how excited I was to play R.B.I. Baseball 15 when it came out.
      I ended up playing an entire season and quickly learned how to dominate the
      league into the post season. A few glitches occurred but in my experience, they
      were very rare. Glancing at other reviews, I must have been very lucky. This
      game doesn't have the modern presentation that you might expect, but it does
      offer the classic experience that I remember from my NES days. Revisiting this
      game today, I couldn't find someone to play with online. Instead, I played an
      exhibition game and won in just 4 innings 12-0, highlighted by a grand slam
      in the 3rd inning. It was cool but I also remember outplaying the AI a lot in
      the past too. Strangely, I did notice that my GPU ran much hotter in the main
      menu than during actual gameplay. As expected, the rosters are out of date and
      I am not sure if the newer versions of the game have changed much from this
      one. I am definitely one of the few who knew what they were getting into with
      this game and enjoyed it. If you can look past its shortcomings to appreciate
      a different breed of baseball video games, maybe you will too. Game on.
