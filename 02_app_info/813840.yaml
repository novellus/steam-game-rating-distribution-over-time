    review: 'This product is missing tracks (Hey, devs, if you''re reading this, go
      compare the track lists!) compared to the version on Bandcamp released under
      Dale North''s name (not to be confused with the Scarlet Moon Records version,
      which is this but worse on all fronts, at least as far as I could tell without
      buying it).  Get it on there instead, because the devs don''t seem to be intending
      to fix this anytime soon.


      Otherwise, very good soundtrack, would recommend if it weren''t for that little
      bit of missing content.'
