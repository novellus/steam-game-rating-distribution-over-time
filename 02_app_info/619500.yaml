    review: '*first Impression* Well when i first bought the game i wasn''t sure what
      to think. I mean i thought to myself "Hey this is seeming like Virtual Minecraft.
      Let me give it a shot." I am glad I took that shot. For starters when you first
      load up the game youre blasted with a pure white screen but its not just white.
      You''ll hear a calming menu melody, from there its simple actually you have
      3 choices. Continue (which if you never had a world, enjoy the one you''ll make)
      New & Tutorial. From there you can choose. Personally i just wanted to dive
      in, and dive I. No tutorial no nothing (P.s: It even says "Play the tutorial,
      its not fun not knowing things." I ignored it, but fun fact there is a tutorial
      in your personal chest to read up and explain things.

      *Starting Out& Crafting*Please keep in mind this game is still being developed.
      Now after you''re in your vast infinite cubed world, you''re graced with a beat
      stick. Yes a stick to gather your first materials, the days of tree punching
      are over and you have a stick to do the work. You have a recipe book in your
      menu too, it has 3 of your basic crafting recipes; A torch, an Ax and a pickax
      (pro tip: if you''ve played minecraft, you get a 4th. A shovel) . All crafting
      is done in the actual world. By that i mean you place the blocks on to the dirt
      and assemble them like building blocks with your hand (see screenshots provided
      in store.). You will find recipes throughout the world, fear not, they''re not
      hidden and they''re not in impossible spots, just pick them up and look at them
      and they''ll be revealed to you.

      *Gameplay* Ok now this is where the fun begins, as well as the exhaustion. YES,
      you physically mine, craft, dig and chop down trees! Have fun and don''t break
      anything. Should your newly obtained material be out of reach your glove has
      these little icons that can glow orange to allow a telekinetic grab of those
      materials, point -> grasp -> flick wrist -> catch it, simple enough. Now storing
      materials and tools will come by using your trusty bottomless bucket. You''ll
      have it assigned to a button on your controller and it is a push and hold, tilt
      the pulling stream towards the materials you wish to collect and they will pop
      into your inventory.

      *Overall Thoughts* Personally i love it. The game is very relaxing and it is
      the child of an active dev, who constantly reached out to their community and
      discord to provide them with feedback and ideas for their game. I is well made
      and has some very beautiful graphics once loaded into the world. There is alot
      of untapped potential in this game and cannot wait to see where this leads
