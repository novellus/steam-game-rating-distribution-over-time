Soundtrack bops.\n\n+Also, sfx are amazing. Boss doors opening and intros are exciting.\n\n+Going up a level doesn't require a loading screen. Just progress from the boss room and you're on your way. Unique and feels nice.\n\nCons:\n\n-Movement is a bit wonky: Jump could use a little more physics/speed change instead of being a fixed speed hop to feel more natural.\n\n-Bouncing off platforms when your character's chest hits them is annoying. A Dead Cells climb-up would be cool so when you hit or dash into a platform you can grab it and keep up your altitude in a room and avoid breaking the combat flow.\n\n-Your projectiles can get hard to see, especially with the bullet-type weapons or when you have bouncing. \n\n-Stims aren't very clear with what they do, even after you take them.\n\n- I'm about halfway through unlocking all the items, and the perks are still a little lacking, it would be lovely to see more in-depth ones or dynamic options that you can utilize in the moment more, as right now they feel like the most lacking part of the content to me.\n\nVerdict:\n\nI've heard of a lot of bugs here, but after 2.5 hours and beating the final boss for the first time, I haven't experienced them. Your mileage may vary.\n\nGame is definitely worth it on sale, and if you like the aesthetic, pick it up whenever you feel the pull. Little pricey for some people but it definitely has cult potential and replayability. \n\nBlack Future certainly has a lot of content and unlockables, creates a great flow. Excited to see where the game goes and to see whether it shakes what is in my opinion an unfairly low overall review score. It definitely surpasses several others I've played in the 2d roguelite platformer genre.","timestamp_created":1609729551,"timestamp_updated":1609787108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqr2y5/YCf5mjwAI="}
