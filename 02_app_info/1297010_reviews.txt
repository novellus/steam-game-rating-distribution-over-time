After reaching the point to board the transport and crossing some invisible line which triggered the guard at the other side of the screen and 10 tries to get past this point was enough to stop this game and put it in my superfluous folder.\n\nSummary: the controls in VR and implemented \"distract\" system are not polished enough for me to enjoy this game.","timestamp_created":1608579946,"timestamp_updated":1608579946,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4cK1w/YCetaBvAI="}
