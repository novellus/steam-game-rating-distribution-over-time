No. \n\nDespite the problems, it's an interesting and creative lil game. It shows lots of potential coming from the dev. It has very unique artstyle and soundtrack (and gosh, the writing is so funny!), and never fails to surprise me.\n\nMy biggest problem is with the controls. Since you can only shoot sideways, it can be very frustrating when you're surrounded by enemies. I wish we had free aim or something similar to that. I also had problems with the visibility, but you eventually get used to it (but I really recommend turning all the graphic options to the lowest settings possible to give you even better visibility).\n\nDue to its fair price tag, I would definitely recommend giving it a try. It's not a great game, but shows tons of potential.\n\nPS: this game is HARD. Dark Souls is child's play compared to this. I'm a roguelike masochist but this felt too much for me at some times. I have barely scratched the surface in 5 hours of gameplay and only managed to unlock a single achievement. Maybe I just suck at it, who knows.","timestamp_created":1487472004,"timestamp_updated":1601424530,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515723228454589844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpeOV7vQCdovEcg=="}
