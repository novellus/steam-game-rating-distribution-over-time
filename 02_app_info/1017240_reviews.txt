It took a little over an hour to collect all the items and finish the game.\nThe graphics are good and the gamepad controls are great despite not being able to remap them, I did not play with keyboard & mouse. Sound did become repetitive after a while, you'll mostly be hearing the same footsteps and windy echo while you play. Level design is good and while there are only four levels each one has some unique feature or mechanic that keeps it interesting; my favourite was the tree in the third level, which also made this the most challenging level as you hop from branch to branch and explore the inside of the tree for all the items.\nIt does not feel like a full game, but rather a demonstration of a concept that I would like to see developed further. \n","timestamp_created":1609362062,"timestamp_updated":1609362062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq4fd2vYCceTyvgI="}
