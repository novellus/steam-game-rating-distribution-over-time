    about_the_game: "Canada\u2019s first transcontinental railway through the dramatic\
      \ Rocky Mountains comes to life in this beautiful new route for Train Simulator,\
      \ featuring imposing mountain passes, steep gradients and famous spiral tunnels.<br><br>The\
      \ Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) was originally built between British Columbia\
      \ and Eastern Canada in the 1880s, fulfilling a promise extended to British\
      \ Columbia when it became part of the Canadian Confederation in 1871. The route\
      \ was originally planned to run further north than where it was eventually built,\
      \ primarily to prevent American railroads running through Canada. However, this\
      \ presented engineers with a challenging project to navigate steep gradients\
      \ and imposing mountain passes.<br><br>The CPR was completed in 1885 but as\
      \ traffic grew, the 4.5% grades of Kicking Horse Pass, west of Calgary, became\
      \ unmanageable, as well as heavy avalanches that constantly disrupted operations\
      \ along the line. As a result, a series of tunnels were built through the mountains\
      \ and, using the famous Gotthard line in Switzerland as their inspiration, CPR\u2019\
      s engineers constructed a number of spiral tunnels to reduce the steep grades\
      \ along the line.<br><br>Today, the modern-day 155 mile (250km) route for Train\
      \ Simulator between Revelstoke and Lake Louise, through the imposing Rocky Mountains,\
      \ is part of the busy transcontinental railway that sees almost exclusively\
      \ a busy mix of freight traffic, including coal, potash, sulphur, grain, manifest\
      \ freight and double stack container wagons. Scheduled passenger trains on the\
      \ route were discontinued in 1991, but during the summer, the line sees the\
      \ Rocky Mountaineer tourist train.<br><br>The Canadian Mountain Passes route\
      \ for Train Simulator begins 10 miles east of Lake Louise at Eldon and follows\
      \ the Bow River to Morant's Curve, a famous location for railfans and photographers.\
      \ At Lake Louise, the track splits and runs on grades up to 1.8% to Stephen,\
      \ at the summit of Kicking Horse Pass.<br><br>As the line descends to Golden,\
      \ the first of the route\u2019s famous spiral tunnels is navigated, descending\
      \ on a much gentler 2.2% grade than the original line carried. Just south of\
      \ Golden, the main yard sees busy coal traffic load and unload daily, with double\
      \ tracks from Golden to Revelstoke to accommodate the constant flow of heavy\
      \ coal traffic.<br><br>For a short distance, the line follows the Columbia River\
      \ as it flows northwards through the Rocky Mountain Trench \u2013 engineers\
      \ get brief respite on this flat section of the route, before the line turns\
      \ away at Beavermouth and starts the climb up Rogers Pass. This climb features\
      \ some of the route\u2019s most spectacular scenery, including the Stone Creek\
      \ Trestle Bridge, a favourite spot for photographers, Connaught Tunnel and the\
      \ nine-mile (15km) long Mount MacDonald Tunnel.<br><br>Included with the route\
      \ is the GE ES44AC diesel locomotive in Canadian Pacific\xAE livery, which features\
      \ new air braking with adjustable difficulty offering more realistic behaviour\
      \ for heavy freight trains than ever before \u2013 bringing a 10,000t freight\
      \ train down a 2.2% grade has never been more challenging in Train Simulator!\
      \ Also included are a number of loaded and unloaded freight cars, including\
      \ an Auto Rack, Coal Hopper, Gondola Car, Container Double Stack Car, Grain\
      \ Hopper, 50ft Box Car, Double Door Box Car, 4-Chute Covered Hopper, Potash\
      \ Car and Tank Car.<br><br>Developed by Milepost Simulations, Canadian Mountain\
      \ Passes: Revelstoke-Lake Louise is a stunning route through the beautiful and\
      \ famous Rocky Mountains, that will challenge even the most experienced of engineers\
