      /><br><br>Shadow Tactics is a hardcore tactical stealth game set in Japan around
      the Edo period.<br><br>Take control of a team of deadly specialists and sneak
      in the shadows between dozens of enemies. Choose your approach when infiltrating
      mighty castles, snowy mountain monasteries or hidden forest camps. Set traps,
      poison your opponents or completely avoid enemy contact.<br><br>The group is
      composed of very different personalities. Working together as a team seems impossible
      at first. Yet over the course of many missions, trust is won and friendships
      are made. The characters develop their own dynamic and each member will have
      to face their own personal demons.<br><br>One of the leaders of this team is
      Hayato, an agile ninja, who clears the way through his enemies silently, with
      his sword and shuriken. Samurai Mugen prefers a more powerful approach and can
      defeat more fiends at one time, but thus also forfeiting flexibility. Aiko is
      a master of camouflage when she distracts enemies disguised as a Geisha. And
      the street child Yuki places traps and decoys enemies towards their deadly fate.
      The mysterious marksman Takuma however, relies on his sniper rifle and takes
      care of the enemies from a distance.<br><br>The player has to carefully evaluate
      his options in order to master the challenging missions: how will the characters
      behave as a team? Which one is best equipped for each task? How can they best
      master the given missions? Come up with your own ingenious tactics to vanquish
      enemies and complete missions.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/418240/extras/Shop_Feature.png?t=1594389009"

      notes: 'Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun is a tactical game about a team
        of specialists who are tasked with eliminating their opponents by assassinating
        or sabotaging them. Depending on your style of game play, violence is present:
        For most missions, there are non-lethal ways to neutralize your opponents,
        but if you choose to kill them to reach your goal, there will be blood.'
