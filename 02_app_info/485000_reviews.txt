Save your time. While I loved this game, the STEAM version just DOES NOT WORK online. You can have an experience playing against IA, but forget about challenging a mate, forget about challenging people online. Yeah, even if you paid for that.\n\nInterface gives headaches, with constanty moving in and out from the cards. There's no alert when (if ever...) a game starts, if you manage to start a game it will disconnect a dozen times in a round.\n\nI don't blame the obviously underpaid developers here. But honesty, these mistakes are expected from newbies.","timestamp_created":1598433111,"timestamp_updated":1598433111,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508196711540222168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vbWClfQCfuvrnQI="}
