If you buy the bundle, you get two episodes (Episode 0 is a sort of set up teaser that introduces the major characters and comes free with Episode 1) for about 5 bucks CAD. But...it's hard to justify even the small price for the amount of content. I have about an hour and a half played, and this was exploring [b]every[/b] option. There are a total of three H scenes, which are buried in Episode 2. One is only accessible if you picked a certain character to go after in Episode 0 and 1 (Britt) and two are basically on the way to unavoidable game overs. All three scenes are single, static images with text descriptions of the action. They are not voiced.\n\nThere are also so very...odd errors. Grammar mistakes here and there, but you have an option to go after a friend to save them, forsaking the other. I've had it in later episodes (all launched from the same game, mind you) where the forsaken friend is there with the group, and even has lines, as if nothing happened. It was hilarious, because it made it seem like they were talking [i]about themselves[/i] being gone. \n\nI would have liked to have seen far more H content, especially since it's not exactly anything special (just a single image of content). There are sexual overtones in the episodes, but nothing goes to XXX land until Episode 2, and it just feels like a slog to go through the entire game to get to some rather unrewarding scenes.\n\nI'm not going to return it, but I also wouldn't buy it unless it was on sale. Or maybe until there's much more, and much more decent, content.\n\nEDIT: Seems there's another H scene, but getting to it is kinda convoluted. Also, going hard into the Amber route results in a hard crash.","timestamp_created":1603689375,"timestamp_updated":1603689801,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40ozXsfUCf6mYqgI="}
