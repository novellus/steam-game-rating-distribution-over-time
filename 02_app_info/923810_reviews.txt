So far with only 3 hours into this visual novel, I can give this a thumbs up. The characters in this game and the previous are one in a million and are all really likable. Honestly, I don't want this VN to end. If only people in real life had the personality's of those in If My Heart Had Wings...\n\nIf you enjoyed the first game, I really do recommend picking this up. 10/10","timestamp_created":1609984288,"timestamp_updated":1609984288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0NSi7fYCduyUwQI="}
