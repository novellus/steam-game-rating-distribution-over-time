    review: 'Wow, this game is loud! And it has no sound settings in the options!
      So I recommend going to the bottom right of your desktop and right-clicking
      on the speaker icon and click "Open Volume mixer." Of course the game has to
      be already running to lower it.


      Other than that, the game is oddly beautiful for a pixel game. It doesn''t even
      feel like one. The art direction must be that good because the atmosphere is
      spot on for this game. Sound design is amazing too. Gameplay is great, the puzzles
      aren''t that hard and the controls feel good. Overall great game.


      I did however experience some strange motion sickness on the "Red Plane," where
      everything is the color red. I say strange because I''m running the game at
      2000fps with a 144hz monitor (v-sycn doesn''t change how it feels) so I guess
      seeing RED on everything I see gave me a hard headache. Might be personal thing
      so other than that, the rest of the game is A-OK.


      edit: Ethan''s mom is pretty hot.'
