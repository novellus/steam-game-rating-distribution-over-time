    developer_response: 'Hi!


      Thank you very much for trying Waifu Collector. We''re sorry you didn''t like
      it. :(


      We just wanted to comment here to correct a few little bits of misinformation
      in your review.


      First, the playtime is much longer than you''ve mentioned if you want to see
      everything, or even most things. Obviously it''ll completely depend on how fast
      you read and how interested you are in achievements and collecting, but even
      for our fastest tester it took over six hours to unlock all three goddesses
      with both of their domains, and that was only about half of the achievements
      and less than a quarter of the cards. And he knew how to game the relationship
      system!


      Second, the lewd content isn''t few and far between overall, it''s only that
      way when you first start. To begin with you only receive low-level T1 "blessings"
      -- mostly Common, with a small chance of Uncommon -- and the lewd cards are
      almost all Rare and above. You get better cards from the T2 and T3 blessings,
      and also from improving your relationship with the goddesses. We understand
      that with only an hour or so of play you''d not have progressed far in your
      relationships with the three goddesses (probably not even met all three), but
      the longer you play the higher proportion of lewd content you''ll see -- both
      in game and in dropped cards.


      Finally, you can skip through all VN-style text (including the credits) by holding
      down the right mouse button or the red / b Xbox 360 controller button. There''s
      a sticky describing controls in the discussion forums. Maybe we should have
      added that information in game as well. Oh well. :(


      Thanks again for reviewing our game and we''d really appreciate it if you could
      give it another chance; we think you''ll like some of the lewdness you encounter
      later on if you can spare a few more hours to make the goddesses like you. :)


      Oh, and we''re fans of Lewd & Nude, too! :)'

      \  [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b]Waifu Collector[/b] is a lewd collector/visual novel\
      \ game about acquiring \"blessings\" from Goddesses which are added directly\
      \ to your Steam inventory.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nChat with \"goddesses\" to\
      \ obtain \"blessings\" which are added to your Steam inventory, and viewable\
      \ in-game. As you advance your relationship with the goddesses, they will grant\
      \ access to better and better blessings, and more powerful deities (with even\
      \ better blessings!) Blessings contain a single (possibly lewd) CG, with a little\
      \ bit of background. Many Blessings are part of two or more \"dates\", each\
      \ blessing representing another sequence of events. Take care not to piss off\
      \ the goddesses, or their blessings may waiver!\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe main\
      \ protagonist is [b]you,[/b] and you're a millionaire bachelor!  Recently, you\
      \ acquired some \"VR Software\" from a \"shady contact\" (from from me, I'm\
      \ a shady wombat!) You don your VR headset, and you're greeted by your guide,\
      \ Min. She gives you a tour of the world(s), and a run-down on how the game\
      \ works and the \"goddesses\". Please the goddesses, and you will earn their\
      \ \"blessings\" in the form of [i]metadimensional[/i] dates.\n\nIf anyone asks\
      \ me why I'm still single, I'll just tell them my relationship is [i]metadimensional![/i]\n\
      \n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe titlescreen looks okay, but the user-interface is visually\
      \ basic. There are no user-preferences to adjust, which is kinda BS in this\
      \ day and age. The \"About Waifu Collector\" button will take you to an unskippable\
      \ string of credits, and not (what I thought was going to be) lore or information\
      \ regarding development or the developers. You view the fruits of your labor\
      \ from \"Manage Collection\" in-game. The user-interface is hidden when viewing\
      \ CGs after the text has been clicked-through. \n\n[b]- The Goods-[/b]\nThere\
      \ are quite a bit of static scenes to unlock, each including a few lines of\
      \ exposition a single static CG. Otherwise referred to as \"Blessings\", they\
      \ are separated by \"Tiers\", denoting rarity; there are twenty-six \"common\"\
      \ Blessings; fourty-one \"uncommon; fifty-five \"rare\"; fifty \"super-rare\"\
      ; fourty-four \"super super rare\"; and there are seventeen \"special\" Blessings\
      \ to unlock. It's possible to unlock Blessings with lewd content, but they are\
      \ few and far between (and generally reserved for rarer tiers). The sexual content\
      \ isn't remarkable, and the poor character development doesn't owe to emotional\
      \ attachment. I think a lot of people will be put-off by the models themselves\
      \ \u2014 I found the oversized shaped breasts to be a major turn-off.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\
      I don't think I can recommend this game. I'll admit, having a hentai game interface\
      \ with your Steam Inventory is novel, but the concept wasn't very well executed.\
      \ The idea is that you're supposed to log into the [b]Waifu Collector[/b] everyday\
      \ to enjoy (hopefully) new dialogue and (provided you say the right thing) a\
      \ new Blessing or two. The game is monotonous, and the unlockable content isn't\
      \ very saucy. [b]Waifu Collector[/b] tries to be an online-service, but fails\
      \ to provide incentives to keep players entertained. One thing that I will say,\
      \ props to the number of unlockable content. When your game only has a few minutes\
      \ of content every day, your creative department has truly dropped the ball.\
      \ If you want a game like Waifu Collector, I suggest having a look at [b]Lewd\
