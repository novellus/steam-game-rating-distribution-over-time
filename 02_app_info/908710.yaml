    review: Fun game for a while, although it feels like abandonware at the moment
      with the last update somewhere end of 2018. Good to show off VR to newcomers,
      but won't hold your interest for long. I found the learning curve quite easy,
      but it's a pretty hard game to master. Waves are full of enemies if you don't
      hit them in one or two shots you will get overwhelmed quickly. That said, pick
      it up for one or two euros as it does not feel like it's worth more than that
      in the current state.
