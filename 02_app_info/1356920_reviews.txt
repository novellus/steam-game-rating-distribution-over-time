But now that I got it I cannot move it from my storage to my character as there site says I have no character. But the game has no problem loading this character that there site claims doesn't exist.\n\nUpdate after logging back in for a few logging out and refreshing the storage page alot it eventually showed my character and I was able to redeem it. That being said the site should not randomly tell you. That you do not have a character as it's a very worrying sign.","timestamp_created":1606866212,"timestamp_updated":1606866791,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pa2ukPYCe67QtgI="}
