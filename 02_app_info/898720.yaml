      \ to improve through its early access period.&quot;</i> - Rock Paper Shotgun<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">What is Kubifaktorium?</h2>Build, manage and grow a thriving\
      \ settlement in Kubifaktorium, a voxel-based colony management and automation\
      \ game. The game features multiple biomes to explore, plenty of resources to\
      \ exploit, complex transport systems and automations to build and interesting\
      \ production chains to master.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Colony Building and Management</h2>The\
      \ heart of your colony consists of loyal colonists who will gather resources,\
      \ farm crops and craft tools and weapons. Every colonist is unique, with their\
      \ own set of skills which evolve based on the jobs they perform. Managing your\
      \ colonists\u2019 needs and abilities is vital to ensuring your colony's efficiency.<br><img\
      \ src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/898720/extras/Building.gif?t=1605038398\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Different Biomes</h2>In the course of the campaign\
      \ you will explore and colonize multiple islands and encounter different biomes.\
      \ Each biome features new enemies and challenges but also new resources to discover\
      \ and process.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Logistics and Transportation</h2>As your\
      \ colony grows and your production hums along, transporting the resources you\
      \ need becomes more and more challenging. Kubifaktorium features a number of\
      \ transportation systems like trains, conveyor belts, zeppelins and more. Automated\
      \ depots and inserters are there to help you store, sort and keep track of all\
      \ your goods.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/898720/extras/Transportation.gif?t=1605038398\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Automation</h2>While your colonists are highly motivated,\
      \ their work power is limited. Fortunately, your colonists know how to craft\
      \ advanced machinery like automated farms, smelters, crushers etc., which you\
      \ can use to automate more and more of your production.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/898720/extras/Automation.gif?t=1605038398\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mod Support</h2>Kubifaktorium is built to be mod friendly\
      \ and allows players to create anything from localizations, new goods and industries\
      \ to total conversions with new terrains and scenery. The game will support\
      \ publishing and sharing mods via the Steam Workshop!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">User\
      \ Interface and Accessibility</h2>The game is designed to be easy to learn and\
      \ hard to master. Multiple tutorials and extensive tooltips will teach you the\
      \ game\u2019s mechanics. The game\u2019s intelligent recommendation system will\
      \ help you along by suggesting things to build and produce based on the current\
      \ situation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Development</h2>The game was inspired by games\
      \ like Factorio, Gnomoria, The Settlers, Stonehearth and Rimworld. Kubifaktorium\
      \ has been successfully Kickstarted in August 2018 and has received weekly bug\
      \ fixes and content patches since. I also make (bi-)monthly progress report\
      \ videos in which I present the development progress. If you like, join us on\
      \ Discord and share your thoughts and suggestions. :)"
