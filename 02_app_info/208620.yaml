    review: 'Problem 1 - Achievements are broken. Earning them shows an in game notification,
      but does not show them on steam.


      Problem 2 - Hint system is terrible. Hints showing you how to use an inventory
      item is useless when the next thing you need to do requires an item you didn''t
      even know existed. [spoiler]I needed the oven mit, which was in a drawer I didn''t
      know to open, to get the wrench "key" as the only thing I could do next.[/spoiler]


      These were just the unique issues with this game, it had some of the standard
      HOG issues too,'
