Then I would recommend the Jewel Quest series. I played this series years ago and for some reason always have the craving to come back to it every now and again.\n\nPros:\n- Super easy to understand and pick up\n- Engaging and offers some challenging scenarios\n- Addictive\n\nCons:\n- What you see if what you get. Match up jewels and fill in the whole chart. Not much beyond that.\n- Story is nothing to write home about.\n- If you know puzzlers, you will blow through this rapidly. I completed the first game in less than 4 hours and the other two took about 8 hours each.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it as an older style, simple puzzler that will help bridge your bored times. If you are looking for anything beyond that, look elsewhere.","timestamp_created":1597593135,"timestamp_updated":1597593212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxrr++/MCd5DtmwI="}
