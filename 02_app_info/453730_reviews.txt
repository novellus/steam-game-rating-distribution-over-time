The mountain scenario, especially, felt very random, and certain events made absolutely no sense.  For instance, I recall when if I simply moved, I would die suddenly and without any prior warning; essentially for no reason at all.\n\nWhile there are still some random events in each scenario, you are not always destined to doom or success based on how the map generates during a round of play.  I think that aspect of the game could be fine tuned even further, but then, this is a game about survival.  Sometimes, despite our best efforts, things happen.  The real question is that of how you will adapt to your environment and which resources you will choose in order to face the expected and the unexpected challenges ahead of you.\n\nBoth scenarios are short and can be completed in less than 10 minutes, but you will not discover everything about each scenario in one round, or even two rounds.  Until this week, I encountered storylines that I had not previously seen, having already played each scenario dozens of times.  So replay value is high.\n\nThis game will not appeal to everyone, but if you are a casual gamer or you need a short game to play everyday before work/school/bed, Borstal may be just what you are looking for.","timestamp_created":1493093419,"timestamp_updated":1493093419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521580219268798828","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/7DT0dsCePTLdw=="}
