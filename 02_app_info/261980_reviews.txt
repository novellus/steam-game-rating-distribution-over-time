I enjoyed the addition of the cutscenes as well as the music. The boss was interesting but I felt like it needed more.\n\nAlso, its free!\nIn short, I DO recommend that you get this and have hÎ»lf an hour of fun.","timestamp_created":1486692658,"timestamp_updated":1597686536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583587408065795898","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9Lri/vMCferdcQ=="}
