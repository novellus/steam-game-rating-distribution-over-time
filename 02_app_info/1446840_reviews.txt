The cut scenes are so choppy and flash so much that they are probably a huge danger to folks who are at risk of seizure. \n\nWhen I wasn't slogging though the painfully slow and choppy scenes, I was constantly caught on objects from all the collision problems or slipping through the floor and crashing the game. The audio doesn't work either. :(\n\nI feel really bad leaving this review, but I have to be honest about this game. \n\nSorry friends. :(","timestamp_created":1609016360,"timestamp_updated":1609016360,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.58953934907913208","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxKe20PYCf4TCvQI="}
