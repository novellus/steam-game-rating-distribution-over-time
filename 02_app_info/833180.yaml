    review: 'Not Recommended

      Refunding the game


      -The game requires a hosting or a room for multiplayer (I dont like multiplayer
      games)

      -I cant play it offline, cause its a multiplayer game

      -Should add multiplayer in the definations of this game

      -Constant loading everytime i do anything, making playing it very difficult.

      -Causes some of my backround apps to crash or not work.


      Your game looks good but if its difficult to play, im sure its a good game,
      but if i keep getting loading screens every time i do anything like buying and
      selling parts, or waiting to shoot, to move to do anything, its not worth playing.


      Remove the multiplayer required connection, and the constant connecting messages
      that add to such long loading times, and this game might be worth it, but right
      now its not.'
