    review: unable to use it doesn't show anything. don't waste your money. ok so
      update  was able to pull up the files but I had to go into the steam folder
      and get them they still are not accessible from the pack when launched. until
      it is fixed I will not recommend this. I could have gone to rpg makers page
      and got more sprites and they would be put in my game file instead of having
      to search for them. this is not acceptable for a product you have to pay for.
      not to mention this problem has been going on since 2015 and has not been addressed
      or fixed by the creator. I don't know how steam allows it to still be here.
