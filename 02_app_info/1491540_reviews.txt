The mechanics of the map gameplay when introduced seem straightforward and intuitive, but as the game goes on the complexity of each level gets deeper and deeper with new elements thrown into the mix. There's a surprising amount of depth here that may not show at first glance. \n\nThis game showcases a perfect mix, I think, of both levels that will test your wits and problem-solving and levels that require that perfect timing and fluid platforming movements. As someone who isn't normally a fan of puzzle games, I found the experience to be enjoyable and challenging, and for the price of admission I think you get your money's worth. \n\nAlso the humour is goofy but it adds a charm to the journey I think would be missing otherwise.","timestamp_created":1608967636,"timestamp_updated":1608967636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwrj8zvYCf4invQI="}
