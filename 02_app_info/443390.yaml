    about_the_game: "Though none had dared to speak about the risks involved in traveling\
      \ through this area of the galaxy, everyone aboard the ship knew the threat\
      \ looming over them as soon as they felt the engines shudder. A single shot\
      \ from the dark vessel had taken out their propulsion systems, and with it their\
      \ only hope of escape. Soon afterwards, the passenger heard voices. Not coming\
      \ from the intercom, but from within their own bodies. The voices told them\
      \ to prepare to join the Mind Collection, to become part of a greater whole,\
      \ to give up everything they had to become more powerful than ever imagined.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThough some resisted, all those aboard the vessel became part\
      \ of the Mind Collection. And so it grows... spreading across a dark part of\
      \ the Galaxy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn time, every sentient creature in the Galaxy\
      \ will hear the voice of the Mind Collection and be called to take their place.\
      \ Even those known as the Awesomenauts will be called, and they will make a\
      \ fine addition indeed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Mind Collection Announcer can\
      \ be activated from the character select menu or the in-game menu. Activating\
      \ this Announcer will replace the default announcements made during regular\
      \ gameplay with a whole new set."
