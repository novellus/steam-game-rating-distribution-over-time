    review: 'Game is very short.

      Your decisions seem to affect only next outcome. For some reason I''m sure it''ll
      be impossible to fail in this game.

      Main character seem to be nice even if standard.

      Romances seem to be rushed. At least the glimpses I seen. Not much as it looked
      not very well to go into them as they made practically no sense.

      Not the bad game. Not the good one. Just a little story to read.'
