    review: "Overall pretty okay RPG maker game, the system that being used is interesting,\
      \ but there are some other aspect that might be a turn down as well.\n\nPros\
      \ :\n- Good character art.\n- Interesting loot mechanic & skill system for RPG\
      \ maker game.\n- Kinda difficult but still manageable.\n\nCons :\n- Starting\
      \ area and other area that with less light actually truly almost pitch black\
      \ (almost can't see anything, kinda annoying).\n- Some area way too big (Like\
      \ norwich & the wilderness), which turn into wasted resource since don't have\
      \ much content inside the area.\n- NPC filler in town literally crowded and\
      \ the movement kinda random like a rat rather than a normal human. xD\n\nMinor\
      \ Cons : [Solved by using Nvidia driver GPU rather than integrated one] \n-\
      \ Kinda unoptimized (for example : when the character going into Inn in Norwich\
      \ for some reason it feels heavy to move not sure why, sometime Selene char\
      \ blinking when player interact with some interactive item) \n- FPS drop when\
      \ some animation in battle (poison for example) \n\nI think that's all I can\
      \ said for now. It is recommended for the person who is patient in playing rpg\
      \ maker game.\nAs for the price, it is better to grab one when on Sale."
