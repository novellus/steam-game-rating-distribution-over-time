    about_the_game: "The route from Hamburg to Hanover in Germany is one of the most\
      \ important railway lines in Lower Saxony, running from the state capital of\
      \ Hanover to Germany\u2019s second largest city, Hamburg, and now you can take\
      \ control of your own high speed passenger train on this arterial route in Train\
      \ Simulator.<br><br>The main section of the route from Celle to Harburg opened\
      \ on 1 May 1847. Nineteen years later, the line reached Hamburg, and by 1906\
      \ was open to Hanoverian station, today known as Hamburg Hauptbahnhof.<br><br>In\
      \ the early 1970s, a number of trials took place to assess the line\u2019s capability\
      \ for high speed running at 200km/h. The trials proved to be a success and later\
      \ that decade, a 78km (48 mile) section from Langenhagen to Uelzen was relaid\
      \ to accommodate high speed trains, with the rest of the route upgraded by the\
      \ end of the 1980s. Today, the 153km (95 mile) lines sees a busy mix of high\
      \ speed and commuter passenger trains alongside regional and international freight\
      \ trains.<br><br>From the major transport hub of Hamburg, the route runs south\
      \ through Harburg, L\xFCneburg, Uelzen and Celle. Landmarks along the route\
      \ include the Metronom Depot at Uelzen, one of the company\u2019s main maintenance\

      \ long and has a total track length of 300km, handling up to 11,000 goods wagons\
