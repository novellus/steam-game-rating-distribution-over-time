    review: "Bought the DLC, didnt receive a mail ingame. Wrote Support (https://chromatic.zendesk.com/)\
      \ and had to wait 2 days. But then they came back to me and added the items\
      \ to my account. \nThe price is okay and I am happy to support CG with their\
      \ game and get something for it that I can work with ingame :)"
