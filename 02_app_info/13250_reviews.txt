I grew up playing Unreal Tournament (the original), and loved it. For some reason I never got around to playing Unreal. So after all these years I thought I'd try it out. Given how brilliant the level design and action is in Tournament, I expected this to be a pretty compelling single-player. But, I don't know, it doesn't feel much of a step beyond Quake. There are some pretty vistas for its time, but the combat feels stale, and the level design is utterly bizarre.  I'm often running around a map looking for a random button, which yeah, I know, is the basis of Doom and Quake, but their buttons seem to me a bit more obvious. Unreal has messages and some semblance of a world order, and yet the means of level progress feels more opaque than the older shooters. I'm only about a third of the way through the game, so maybe it will improve, but for now I would say this is just an average 90's shooter if you need another one.\n\nAlso, the control are a bit wonky. For instance, leaping out of water launches the avatar, making platforming from water very difficult. Platforming in general is difficult to gauge. It's just not as smooth as the controls of Quake or Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1610007667,"timestamp_updated":1610094805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gKDI8PYCdI+cwQI="}
