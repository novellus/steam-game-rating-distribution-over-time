    developer_response: I'm sorry to hear that you had a negative experience with
      this game. My intention was to provide a short but fun experience for players
      to enjoy. This game is here for the enjoyment of the players, and if you feel
      that it was not worth the price, then I encourage you to refund the purchase.
      I want to thank you for leaving your feedback and for giving this game a chance.

    review: As someone who's very much into ninjas and VR games, I had high hopes.
      Unfortunately, this game is absolutely riddled with bugs and it's not worth
      playing. This game is extremely inconsistent with its shuriken physics, but
      the main issue is the  hand tracking is always broken. Move to a level, and
      suddenly all shuriken are flying backwards and you can't fix it. There's a reason
      it's so cheap, and that's because the developer knows how awful it is and hopes
      people won't refund a one dollar game. It's not worth the 75 cents I paid for
      it. DO NOT BUY!
