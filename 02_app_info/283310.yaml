    about_the_game: Thousands of years ago six demon kings, known as the Revenants,
      ruled the world with an iron fist and bloody swords. Donning the bodies of mortal
      vassals, they could live in the realms of man forever. The great hero and warlock
      Harbinger was the only one who could stand up to their power. One by one he
      hunted the Revenants, taking their spirits and casting them into the Well of
      Souls. Alas, the Revenants survived. As a young man you will travel to meet
      your uncle in the town of Madrigal. There, your destiny draws you into the path
      that Harbinger trod - to confront the Revenants and banish their souls back
      to the Well forever. Your travels will take you far from Madrigal, to the ruined
      kingdoms of Horath, the ancient empire of Thardolin, and through the lost city
      of Talendrah. You will brave searing deserts and icy plains. You will have to
      seek answers among the living and the dead.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Customizable
      combat and magic system that can be as simple or as complex as you like.<br></li><li>Compelling
      story with many twists and turns will keep you hooked for hours.<br></li><li>Dynamic
      music, high quality voice acting, and more than one possible ending.</li></ul>
