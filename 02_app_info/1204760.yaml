      driver is on drugs and is leaving packages in the wrong locations! It is up
      to Courier Frog MD to fix it. Using your Medical Degree, you must find the lost
      packages and deliver them! <br><br>James, grew up in James Town (no relation).
      One day he decided to become a doctor so that he could help people. He left
      his quiet little street to go and get a PhD as a medical doctor. He spent 8
      years in medical school and aced all his exams. He then applied to the most
      prestigious hospitals and research facilities in the land. Astonishingly, he
      was told by every single one &quot;You can''t work here, you are a frog!&quot;
      Distraught, he returned home and ordered a package from Jungle delivery. Upon
      notification that his package was delivered, it quickly became apparent that
      it was not. He stood in the middle of the road... wondering how he could help
      people and fix his problems. Then he knew what he must do, he must find and
      deliver all lost packages for the rest of his life!<h2 class="bb_tag">How to

    review: This game is an underrated gem. The little frog you play as runs around
      collecting packages and delivering them to houses. This frog is a very helpful
      little guy and I love playing as him because I feel like a real frog.
