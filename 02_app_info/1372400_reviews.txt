Overall, its story is one of the best Iwaihime has to tell, adding some much needed content to one of its most vital characters that was sadly overshadowed previously, and as such, I'd consider it a must read. That said, however, it really feels like something that should've been included with Iwaihime to begin with, rather than being sold separately as a DLC.\n\nIf you're looking to buy the game & find yourself wondering if the bundle is worthwhile, then my answer would be a resounding yes. If you've read the main story & want more, I don't think you'll be disappointed with what Musubihime has to offer.","timestamp_created":1609723675,"timestamp_updated":1609723675,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.582753837108612061","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l8DA5fYCft+gwAI="}
