You start out with almost nothing, and the enemies have you outnumbered and have better units, making it all the more satisfying when you finally start to take over the map (and even then, it's easy to make mistakes that will lead to you getting overwhelmed).\n\nAside from the RTS mechanics, you also control one unit directly to fly around and shoot at things and die repeatedly.","timestamp_created":1590426930,"timestamp_updated":1590426930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwtaG1pvICf8adigI="}
