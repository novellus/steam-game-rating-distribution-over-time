    review: After acquiring the materials you need to complete your first navigation
      upgrade through a degree of luck the game effortlessly coasts you to future
      upgrades and it's inevitable end just as soon as it began. It's a shame because
      a simple tweak of the game's statistics (i.e making the upgrades more expensive
      or the bombs not as easily detectable) combined with the game's randomized maps
      and permadeath feature could have made this game a challenge. Instead though
      the only redeeming quality about this game is broken down into a simple science,
      making this just another game in your collection for you to beat and then forget
      about.
