    about_the_game: "Lead your people to glory and write a new chapter of history\
      \ in Realpolitiks II, a real-time grand strategy game where you lead any contemporary\
      \ nation in an attempt to secure world dominance. The road to supremacy is filled\
      \ with modern world issues as you manage your nation\u2019s economy, command\
      \ armies, conduct diplomatic and espionage actions, and tackle global threats\
      \ such as terrorism, pandemics, famine, and more.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1248060/extras/GIF_1.gif?t=1607095025\"\
      \ /><br><br>Realpolitiks II delivers a whole new economic system which gives\
      \ you more control of your country than ever before. Construct new buildings,\
      \ dictate trading policy, and use your advisors\u2019 special abilities to further\
      \ improve, or hinder, the life of your citizens. Transition from democracy to\
      \ totalitarianism too quickly and you might have a rebellion on your hands.<br><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1248060/extras/GIF_2.gif?t=1607095025\"\
      \ /><br><br>Bring your units to battle in a completely new combat system which\
      \ gives you complete control over every battlefield. Command your units and\
      \ develop your general\u2019s skills to acquire new tactical opportunities on\
      \ land, sea, and air. Plan your war strategy carefully, weather, terrain, unit\
      \ formation, equipment, and much more must all be taken into account to ensure\
      \ a decisive victory. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1248060/extras/GIF_3.gif?t=1607095025\"\
      \ /><br><br>Diplomacy has been revitalized with a whole new set of diplomatic\
      \ actions such as non-aggression and defensive pacts, military access, trade\
      \ agreements, and advanced peace negotiations. Espionage is now deeper with\
      \ a wide range of spying activities; level up your spies and develop their subterfuge\
      \ skills to create more chaos in the enemy\u2019s ranks or deceive your own\
      \ people. Choose your approach and dominate the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES</h2><br><strong>Dominate\
      \ the Globe</strong><br>Choose any nation from 208 contemporary countries (including\
      \ Sealand &amp; Kiribati) and conquer your opponents. Adapt your strategy accordingly\
      \ whether you start as a superpower or a small independent nation.<br><br><strong>New\
      \ Modern Warfare</strong><br>A brand-new combat system enables full control\
      \ of your units on the battlefield while taking into account strategic advantages\
      \ such as the weather, terrain, equipment, and a whole lot more. With an all-new\
      \ sea combat system, your nation can take and control important naval provinces.\
      \ Control the seas, control the world!<br><br><strong>Expanded Management System</strong><br>Create\
      \ a communist utopia, a completely free market nation, or become a tyrant overseeing\
      \ your citizens\u2019 every step. With over 700 projects and technologies to\
      \ choose from, you decide the path to greatness.<br><br><strong>Improved Diplomacy</strong><br>Engage\
      \ in advanced negotiations to establish new trade routes or military access\
      \ to neighboring regions. With a completely reworked AI, and new Favor and Investment\
      \ systems that allow you to influence other countries - diplomacy becomes a\
      \ crucial tool once again, especially as other leaders will prove hard negotiators.\
      \ <br><br><strong>Advanced Espionage</strong><br>Conduct clandestine actions\
      \ with your spies, steal breakthrough technologies to further increase your\
      \ military power, and invent new ways of mass destruction. Dominate your foes\
      \ from the shadows.<br><br><strong>New and Unpredictable Events</strong><br>Over\
      \ 1000 new events ranging from minor provincial issues to a world-threatening\
      \ meteor strike. Be wary of the ever-changing world as each playthrough will\
      \ be completely different. Each of the 3 available campaigns will have their\
      \ own unpredictable events for you to tackle. <br><br><strong>Growth By Infrastructure</strong><br>Buildings\
      \ are a major part of your campaign as they enable you to recruit more units,\
      \ train your spies and generals faster, defend against rocket attacks, or increase\
      \ the supply range to your armies.<br><br><strong>Mod Support</strong><br>Use\
      \ a plethora of in-game tools to create your very own campaigns, scenarios,\
      \ units, and nations. Our grand-strategy game can become your brand new grand-strategy\
      \ game.<br><br><strong>IMPORTANT: Tutorial scenario for Realpolitiks II is currently\
      \ in ENGLISH ONLY! Since the game is in Early Access, we wanted to use this\
      \ opportunity to tweak and polish our tutorial scenario in accordance to the\
      \ community feedback. For this reason, tutorial scenario will be translated\
