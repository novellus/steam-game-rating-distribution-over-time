Since then the description has shifted to describing it a retro hobbyist language. I welcome this change and feel it is more appropriate.\n\n--------\n\nOzapell Basic is a retro-styled programming language. It is advertised as both an educational tool to learn the basics of programming and a game development tool for simple retro games.\n\nI was really, really torn on the final verdict of this review. I've actually enjoyed playing with Ozapell Basic quite a bit. It's fairly simple to pick up and play with. It took me back to my youth for a few hours and that was worth the money to me. But it's also flawed. So would I recommend it? Not to the audience it seems to be aimed at...\n\nUsing this as an educational tool seems a bit like teaching someone to drive in Ford Model T. The principles may still apply, but it lacks so many modern conveniences that I'm not sure if it's a worthwhile task. There's no IDE here and therefore no syntax highlighting, GUI, contextual help etc. This isn't a complaint as such - it is what appealed to me in the first place. I just take issue with inflicting these archaic limitations on a beginner. Something like Mu ( https://codewith.mu/ ) would seem to be a much better choice. It still has much of the simplicity and immediacy of Ozapell Basic, but lacks the artificial outmoded limitations. As an additional bonus, since it is python-based, much more help is available.\n\nThe syntax is \"inspired by JavaScript, with BASIC keywords.\" And it's certainly unusual. For example, this if-then construct:\n\n[code]\nA = 5\nA < 10\nIF RESULT\nPRINTLINE \"A IS LESS THAN 10\"\nENDIF\n[/code]\n\nI would have thought the need for the RESULT keyword was a odd limitation of the interpretor. Others might call it horrific. But it's apparently an intentional design choice:\n[quote=Ozapell]PRINT 1+1 won't work because it combines a subroutine call with a mathematical operation. To keep Ozapell Basic as simple to read as possible, they must be separated\nIn [other] languages, you're allowed (encouraged?) to crunch as many operations together as possible on a single line of code. While it can be convenient for veteran programmers, it results in nearly unreadable code. Ozapell Basic was designed with simplicity as a primary goal.[/quote]\nI'm not an educator. This may well be a good way to learn. But I remain unconvinced it should be enforced by the language. If I'm honest, I have to wonder if this is in fact less of a design choice and more a limitation of the way Ozapell Basic is implemented.\n\nSo what about as a game development tool? Ozapell says \"It could be fun for someone who wants to program or make retro style games but doesn't want to learn a complicated modern language.\" You certainly could develop complete games with Ozapell Basic and it could be fun, but I think only in a 'what can I do with limitations' kind of way. If you want to develop something without learning a complicated language. I'd recommend Game Maker Studio instead. Anything you wanted to make with Ozapell Basic, you could make with Game Maker in a fraction of the time. It would be much easier to pick up and learn too. Plus you can delve deeper in to code if you wish. Game Maker is also great for children.\n\n[b]So, how [i]would[/i] I recommend it? If you're an oddball who can see past it's eccentricities, I say go for it. Ozapell Basic is quirky, sometimes esoteric and feels very hobbyist. It can successfully transport you back in time three decades and is charming and unique as it does it. Maybe it shouldn't try to be more than that.[/b]\n\nI'll finish with the classic \"99 bottles\" example in Ozapell Basic.\n[code]\nREM OZAPELLBASIC VERSION OF\nREM 99 BOTTLES OF BEER\nREM BY JOSEPH FOWLER\nREM (JOSEPH@JIFISH.CO.UK)\nREM CODED IN-EDITOR. ;)\nREM MODIFIED FROM ERIC CARR'S\nREM\nFOR BOTTLES=99 TO 1\nPRINT BOTTLES\nPRINT \" BOTTLE\"\nBOTTLES > 1\nIF RESULT\nPRINT \"S\"\nENDIF\nPRINT \" OF BEER ON THE WALL, \"\nPRINT BOTTLES\nPRINT \" BOTTLE\"\nIF RESULT\nPRINT \"S\"\nENDIF\nPRINT \" OF BEER.
