      /><br><br>Element TD 2 is the culmination of 15 years of multiplayer tower defense
      development, with the original mod having been downloaded over 5 million times
      across WarCraft 3, StarCraft 2 and Dota 2. With dozens of towers, alongside
      an array of maps to test your defenses, this is a feature-packed standalone
      sequel prepared to challenge tower defense players.<h2 class="bb_tag">Let Elements
      Collide</h2><br>With 6 elements that combine to create 44 unique towers, you
      will need to anticipate incoming waves, their elements, and tailor your approach
      to maximize your defense. Each element has its own strengths and weaknesses,
      so choosing the right upgrade paths is crucial to winning.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1018830/extras/Action.gif?t=1609465968"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Cooperate To Conquer</h2><br>Work with up to 8 players
      to synergize your elemental choices, tower upgrades, and plan your placements.
