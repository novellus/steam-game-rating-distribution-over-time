    review: 'Honestly this game is kinda bad. The balancing sucks, it''s clunky as
      hell, the AI is braindead, and it''s sometimes buggy.


      It''s still got some really awesome stuff in it though.


      The diplomatic options for the game are crazy. You can make a treaty or alliance
      with other players which have all kinds of rules/laws set up, including things
      like banning certain techs or having votes in an alliance be determined by population
      or number of planets. It''s really detailed, but the AI can''t handle it at
      all. (For instance, there was an occasion where I was able to just buy a minor
      faction''s homeworld for chump change.)


      The ship design and customization is really detailed, and you can make a ship
      which really does whatever you want it to. Only problem is the AI can''t adapt
      well and some techs for the ship weapons are unbalanced.


      On the subject of tech, there''s a lot, and a lot of it is pretty interesting.
      Only problem is that it''s hard to know where all the stuff you want *actually*
      is. It feels like a guessing game. Also some of the techs are blatantly overpowered.


      The galactic map is on a hex system, but combat is real-time. It''s like space
      Total War and it''s awesome. But the combat feels a bit weird and clunky sometimes.
      Except in evenly-matched fleet battles, most of the time you fight something
      it''ll end up being a mouse chase around the edge of the map until the time
      runs out.


      The game is deeply flawed, but the ideas present are awesome. I''ve never been
      able to find a game which scratches this same itch for intimate control over
      how you play the game, and I think there''s a good reason for it. Even now this
      kind of game is just too ambitious. Balancing aside, you''d need a seriously
      impressive AI for it to be able to handle even just the diplomacy, let alone
      handle that plus ship designing, combat, and empire management.


      That said, I yearn for the day that someone does this idea right.


      EDIT: I''m seeing a lot of complaints that this game doesn''t work on newer
      systems, but it''s working fine on my win10 machine. I''m guessing it has issues
      on some machines but just works fine on others? I guess if you get it you should
      expect to return it if it doesn''t work.'
