Triggering 2 factions, or being triggered by both factions, is their main draw, but many of these cards work pretty well in even a 1-color build.\n\nYou may note that in this and the other expansion, there is no Star Empire + Machine Cult faction, nor Trade Fed + Blob (my favorite combo! :( :( :( )\n\nSince WWG doesn't really fully fill you in on what you're grabbing, please see below:\n\nExplanation: C=Combat, HP=Authority, T=Trade\n\nTrade Fed / Star Empire = Alliance\nShip - Alliance Frigate: 3-cost; 4C, yellow faction +3C, blue faction +4HP <- [i]this is a beast of a card even in 1-color decks![/i]\nOutpost Base - Alliance Landing: 5-cost; 2T; faction (either) +2C; 5 hit points <- [i]it's okay in decks of its intended color; unimpressive otherwise[/i]\n\nBlob + Machine Cult = Unity\nShip - Unity Fighter: 1-cost; 3C, scrap a card in trade row; scrap to scrap a card in hand or discard. <- [i]This is basically a War Elder hero in ship format. A pretty good early game card that self-scraps, so no risk in grabbing it regardless of whatever faction you're building into.[/i]\nOutpost Base - Unity Station: 7-cost, scrap 1, and scrap a card in trade row; faction (either) +4C. 6 hit points. <- more expensive Junkyard with some extra bells and whistles. Works okay in any deck for the auto-scrapping.\n\nTrade Fed + Machine Cult = Coalition:\nShip - Coalition Freighter: 4-cost; 3T; blue faction, put the next ship this turn on deck; red faction, scrap 1. <- [i]Wait, a freighter that also scraps? Yes please! Needs more Cult ships to keep that scrapping going, though.[/i] \nOutpost Base - Coalition Fortress: 6-cost; 2T; faction (either) +2C OR +2HP; 6 hit points <- underwhelming, only decent as a damage sponge.\n\nStar Empire + Blob = Union\nShip - Assault Pod: 2-cost; 3C; faction (either) Draw 1 <- [i]runs well even in blob-only decks for the Draw 1; basically another blob fighter.[/i]\nBase - Union Cluster: 7-cost; 4C; faction (either) Draw 1; 8 hit points <- [i]works better than it looks on paper, and good even in yellow-only or green-only decks; the 8 hp makes it a hard kill.[/i]","timestamp_created":1533338822,"timestamp_updated":1533339053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.613959848880767822","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vKWIgeUCdLPEpwE="}
