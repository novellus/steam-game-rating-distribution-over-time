What is a corrupt system except for the people that reinforce and benefit from it? What happens when those that we are close to place their allegiance with such a system? Is it possible to befriend death herself, and is such an acquaintance necessary to engage in the self-sacrifice so often required for societal change? These are some of the questions proposed by developer Deniz Kayacan.\n\nAlthough these grand ideas emerged afterwards as I reflected on the game, the gameplay itself is much less notable. Most of your time in the game will be spent taking step after plodding step as your wan, permanently shell-shocked protagonist weaves fabric, shoots a rifle, punches the authorities, or wanders around in a prison cell.\n\nIt's not that the gameplay pieces themselves are poorly designed - it's that the pace of the game as a whole is so sluggish. It's impossible that the developer isn't aware of the egregiously-slow walk speed. Perhaps the idea is to force the player to slow down and consider the implications of the protagonist's actions? However, I did all my thinking after I finished the game - while I was actually playing, I was noting just how little of a hurry Victor was in to get anywhere or do anything.\n[list]\n[*]An unrelated suggestion for the developer would be to pause the game and display the text of a note when Victor finishes composing it in the prisoners' line. I was so focused on avoiding the guard's gaze that I couldn't pay attention to what he was actually writing.\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1608420378,"timestamp_updated":1608420596,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwktPVvvYCcp7HuwI="}
