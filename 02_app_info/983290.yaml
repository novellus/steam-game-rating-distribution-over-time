    review: "A real treat to play. The AI and its many personalities all present unique\
      \ perspectives and goals to the table. It's hard to know who to trust and how\
      \ the game will progress. There are quite a few dialogue options, and many conversations\
      \ warranted replays in order to discover alternative goals and dialogue, especially\
      \ if you decide to work toward achievements. Takes around 3-4 hours to complete\
      \ on the first playthrough, and the big cutscenes are skippable. \n\nAlthough\
      \ there were some questionable moments in the dialogue options that can make\
      \ you go \"that's not what I meant,\" the game is immersive and gets you invested\
      \ in the fates of everyone and everything present. This game, unfortunately,\
      \ does suffer from offering the player fake choices in some areas where you'll\
      \ have different dialogue options that give you the same result, with barely\
      \ noticeable long-term effects. It's a bit of a shame that there is no option\
      \ to replay a specific chapter, but the game isn't too long if you want to find\
      \ out all the available options in a chapter.\n\nYou can tell a lot of work\
      \ went into this game, especially in the animation. Worth getting if you're\
      \ a big fan of UI/text-based games, because this game will stand out regardless."
