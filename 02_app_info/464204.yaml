    about_the_game: Gold coated model of the BM03 Vegalta. Only a small number of
      these were ever manufactured. This model is coated in gold so that it reflects
      radar waves. However, this is not very effective. It is operated as a ceremonial
      unit or by commanders. It is armed with a Combat Burner (flamethrower) that
      is mounted on the arm. After jumping, pressing the jump button again will activate
      the jet thrusters. Flight is possible for short periods of time.
