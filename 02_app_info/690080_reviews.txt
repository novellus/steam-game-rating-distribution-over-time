Pretend you're jumping full speed this way ->. In almost every other platformer, tapping Left would make you either slow down or move a little bit to the right. In this game, tapping Left [b]immediately[/b] makes you go full speed this way <-. It makes no sense. You can't make precise adjustments, which isn't exactly great when it's one of those platformers that asks for precision. Even worse, this only happens after you jump. If you just walk off a ledge and fall, mid-air control works like it should! So you're dealing with two different schemes the entire game.\n\n2) The bomb hitbox is active for a weirdly long amount of time. If you can see the explosion, it's still deadly. Pretty sure it can kill you until the very last frame of its long-ass animation. \n\n3) Lots of spike paths are drawn very randomly, no rhyme or reason to them. Not predictable unless you memorize each one.\n\n4) Deadly stuff doesn't reset when you die, which is terrible for a game where there are like 3-6 [b][i]different[/i][/b] cycles that need to align for you. A lot of the time, the experience from your last attempt will be pointless because now you're looking at a new pattern. There are several levels where most of your time is just waiting. \n\nThere's also the more usual jank, weird hitboxes, weird collisions, etc. And if you land on a corner, it'll just yeet you off the edge at max speed.\n\nMost of the issues are honestly the sort of thing you should expect in a game like this, so if mid-air stuff was different, it would be an okay game. But like this, it's not a good platformer even for this price. I was afk for a while so playtime isn't accurate, but it was still ~2.5 hours that felt more tedious than fun. Maybe I'm a masochist.","timestamp_created":1587507659,"timestamp_updated":1587508084,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.468227416276931763","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0t+2z/ECdvjIggI="}
