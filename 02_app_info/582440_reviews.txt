Extremely low quality textures, cheesy sounds, and lighting that made me want to punch my monitor made this game an absolute chore. Many areas, I couldn't even see anything at all. Which is exactly what you want in a video game.... Utter blackness.\n\nNot scary, not well done, and not a quality product in any way, shape, or form, Nine left me wishing I had lobotomized myself as opposed to actually suffering through the game even as far as I did. It is an insult to charge any money at all for a game such as this.\n\n2/10. The only reason why it didn't get a 1 was by virtue of it not crashing on me.","timestamp_created":1485214411,"timestamp_updated":1485215212,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.585546791553497314","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnrTu5tkCduuscA=="}
