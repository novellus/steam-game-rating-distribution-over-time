    review: "[h1]The destined big conclusion to the game! (or is it? :P)  [/h1]\n\
      No but seriously, it feels great if you played the other routes before and it\
      \ actually gives the game one last punch!\n\n [h1]--if you are unsure if you\
      \ want to buy book 1 AND 2 [/h1] \n(wich you probably should as they have a\
      \ continues storyline. [b]Book 1 has NO climax or ending[/b] really) [b][u]please\
      \ check out my review on book 2[/u][/b] where i adress the negative points indepth.\
      \ Sadly the second book is the part where all the issues really come to play.\n\
      \n [h1]Game overall: [/h1]\n- CS were good but i would have hoped for more (or\
      \ i'm used to get more of them in other VN/Otome).\n\n-> the music loops seem\
      \ to be a lot better in Hikarus playthrough. maybe bc he got some new tracks\
      \ too. anyhow its not a negative point anymore! yay!\n\n+ Other that that the\
      \ game is unusually polished\n+ i personally enjoyed a more western/realistic\
      \ artstyle for once \n+ and the writing was good (both in grammar AND storytelling)\n\
      + the maincharacter is normal, in a GOOD way. She reacts grumpy when someone\
      \ is rude, shes flustered if its the situation but shes not overly anything.\
      \ The writing conveyed a fully fleshed charcter wich you shape with your reaktions\
      \ one by one. I really enjoyed seeing this instead of one blunt character!\n\
      (-? some of the options feel a bit wierd in how he reacts. Like some of tehm\
      \ make sense later on / in retrospective but not all of them - its a really\
      \ tiny problem tho)\n\n [h1]This particular Route: [/h1]\n++ Amazing idea to\
      \ put all routes together - i loved it! Eventhough i had hoped we would kinda\
      \ get pay off for actually playing them (i.e. the choises be linked to the story,\
      \ that you had to know what was \"the right choice\" to pick) but thats nagging\
      \ on high niveau!\n+ likewise it feels like on big show down after the first\
      \ few chapters, wich is really exciting as this is the last released route and\
      \ kinda the climax of the game over all (well if you leave out the amazing chaos\
      \ route wich you should play AFTER book 2!)\n+ hikaru might be my fav character\
      \ yet (even tho he seems a bit ill treated is his own routes (more on that futrher\
      \ below and on book 2 review)\n- regarding personal time or like relationship\
      \ devolopment you have hardly any with hikaru (or even ANY). I get that we learn\
      \ a lot about him (well more about the divine realm rather) and we kinda get\
      \ closer to him - but not in a romantic way actually. it cann all be very well\
      \ seen absolutely firendly/platonic (wich makes book 2's [spoiler]\"were destined\
      \ for each other\"[/spoiler] really forced ... wich is really sad!)"
