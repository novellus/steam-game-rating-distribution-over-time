Over all though fun hack n slash game, nothing ground breaking, just good oal button mashing time","timestamp_created":1609997155,"timestamp_updated":1609997155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4q9/T7fYCfouZwQI="}
