So if you got a higher lvl char, you can start a higher lvl Quest with that char and do it with your selected lower lvl, and get more fun, more XP, faster lvl up :P\n\nExplosive bait is FUUUN! Save ammo and life!\n\nYou get a new SKILL what gives you +100% Explo DMG when you got it at the max skill lvl (5).\n\nNew armorset, what gives you +100% Explo DMG and it got good def stat, so get it when you reach lvl20!\n\nWery usable armor set, I use some of them with my lvl 51 char to get explo DMG boost :) no need to use potions and food :D\n\nIf you got the Archery skill at max with max explo dmg skill and with armor, you can 1shoot the ZOMBIE BEAR with only 1 Explo ARROW!!! Maybe you not need the armorset... (I not tested everything)\n\nYou dont need to AIM with explo ammo to make incredibly tons of dmg!!!\n\nWith EXPLO JAVELIN, what is 1 use only, cause its goes to KaBooM (like explo arrow), you can HUNT ALIENS! and the EXPLO javelin goes to the ground.....reusable! Svae the EARTH! Aliens got barriesr, thats why Explo javelin bouncing to the ground, but the explosion kills the enemy! I think its not a bug, its a feature, and works only against the Aliens (the bouncing thing).\n\n:)","timestamp_created":1601920796,"timestamp_updated":1601920796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1vD6/PQCfKiJpgI="}
