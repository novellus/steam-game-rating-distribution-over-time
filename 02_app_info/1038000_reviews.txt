Anyway I feel I need to report this too in my updated negative review about this software.. \n\n\nIts a bit buggy and I wish I had bought another utility because sometimes it doesnt stay on top even though I set it to pin..\nAnd sometimes when I use the command to get it to show up again it doesnt show up, and yes app is running then on windows start up, think Ill just skip the autostart app now and quit wasting my time on this piece of junk.\nI will look for something better and something that works.\nCant really recommend.","timestamp_created":1604070490,"timestamp_updated":1607901030,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561023056507110596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw59SXr/YCepeKqwI="}
