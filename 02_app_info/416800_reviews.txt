The plot is funny yet interesting, the sound design is great, with the sound of rain drops hitting the roof of the space craft and the sound of alien chickens roaring in the back parts of your ship. It caught me off guard how good this game is, and for only three dollars! \n\nFor the people who say \"Its just a FNaF clone!!\" It isn't? It takes the concept of the original FNaF and adds on to it in almost every way possible. It is WAY more than just a clone.\n\nIf you want at least three days worth of entertainment, giggles and fear, this game is worth your purchase!","timestamp_created":1599861497,"timestamp_updated":1599861497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yqPLv/QCdYWcoQI="}
