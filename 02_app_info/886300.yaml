    review: 'At first, I got the game a few months back, only played for about an
      hour and thought "Man, what a waste of money. Could''ve purchased something
      else."


      Just today though, I decided to come back and give the game another try, and
      honestly, I can say that it is a great game for me after all of these months.
      With the quarantine going on currently, I''ve been playing the same games over
      and over again and it''s been driving me nuts. So I''ve decided to dig up games
      I haven''t played in a long time. This was one of ''em.


      Why the game is great for me is because well, you destroy everything in your
      path. And for me, I tend to explore or discover more parts of a map. Levels
      like City Tower and the Retail Stores for me are my personal best because they
      are big and expanding. So far, I have unlocked four maps and I can''t wait to
      unlock more.


      There are some errors though, such as NPC''s dying by themselves (kind of funny
      when they scream) and the NPC''s can also knock over some items before you start
      breaking them. I discovered this in Retail Store 2. Everything else though seems
      perfect to me.


      Overall, the game is chaotic, funny, and will definitely give you a bit of adrenaline
      depending how destructive and crazy you are, especially with the police and
      employees chasing you. I would definitely buy it and I can''t wait to see how
      far the game will go because it could be a huge hit later on.'
