    review: This game is such amazing value for money!!  Players get to nurture their
      'eggs' and watch them develop into caterpillars and eventually fully grown Butterbies.
      Each Butterbie has a different character and I know that players (young and
      not so young) will have great fun collecting them all. The game looks beautiful,
      which makes it appealing to play, but it is also fun and educational. The mini-games
      have different levels of difficulty and strengthen different skill sets, from
      hand-eye coordination to planning, concentration and strategizing. This game
      is not just for the kids lol.  I thoroughly enjoyed playing the  mini-games
      and challenging myself to  beat my previous scores. It is well worth the money.
      It keeps the kids entertained whilst teaching them valuable life skills like
      identifying basic needs for survival (food/water/hygiene/play) and taking responsibility
      for a pet- albeit a virtual one!!
