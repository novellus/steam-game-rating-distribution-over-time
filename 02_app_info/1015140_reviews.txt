It's not exactly a bad game, but the overall experience was underwhelming. We refunded after an hour of playtime.\n\n- Gun variety is low and they just tacked keywords onto them to denote increased stats.\n- Equipping attachments is manual and they don't automatically carry over to upgraded weapons.\n- Respawn points are just a little too harsh. Falling into water resets your inventory.\n- We progressed too fast (yes, the game punishes efficiency) so we could barely even complete missions with the equipment we had.\n- Friendly NPCs are way dumber than enemies. The police units will often just abandon you instead of helping you. Civilians flee towards enemies.\n- Some of the procedural generation can produce impassable terrain which requires you to spend double the time in some segments to find another way through.\n- Minigames/events are often drawn out, but give roughly the same loot as a random chest. My co-op partner was either not able to see the event timer, or the timer showed the wrong value for them.\n- Base building is very simplistic, there are 2 resource types and 1 structure of each type. They don't appear to scale with enemies or weapons so by the midgame they became almost useless.\n\nIf half or so of the above issues were fixed, I would consider a repurchase.","timestamp_created":1610023863,"timestamp_updated":1610023863,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550561785697937012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rdC57vYCevChwQI="}
