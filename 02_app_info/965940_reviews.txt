[/h1]\nThe UI looks like a 15 year old that just began to learn how to use UnityUI designed something. It's just buttons slapped all over the place with eyesearing colors on Arial. Not to mention the title screen which, if it moved, would cause seizures to people because of how clashing it is.\n---\n2020 update: It's still bad, and even worse now with the huge menu button.\nSome parts of the UI flat out do not work, and parts of the high score panels are broken.\n\nAlso, the expansion pack is not even up in the Steam store.\n---\nThe game itself is also very basic looking. The playfield is mostly black, the blocks (normally called minos) are a very bleak gray that changes with \"danger elements\", the \"danger elements\" look like 3D shapes anyone with basic 3D can do in a few minutes...\nThe UI overscrolls in certain parts, the buttons are unstylized, some strings that have the player's name, for example, aren't present...\nIt really doesn't look good.\n\n[h1]Sound Design[/h1]\nThe game has a singular background BGM. It plays ONLY on the title screen. The in-game itself has no BGM, and BGM only plays when some danger elements are present which, in all honesty, sound really bad, especially the \"ghost\" one which has a small loop where the lyrics are just \"ghost... ghost...\"\n\nThe sound effects for the pieces falling are passable, but not good enough or fit for the aesthetic the game's... uh, trying to reach.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nWhere do I start...\nThe default controls are horrible and you can't reconfigure the controls once you're inside the game. You can only do so through the Unity Resolution Configuration dialog, and you can even see some of Unity's default input buttons are still present. The game has no [url=https://harddrop.com/wiki/DAS]DAS[/url], which means you would need to tap several times the side keys to be able to move the active piece quickly to the other side. Not 0 DAS, [b]ABSOLUTELY no DAS.[/b]\n\nThe game boasts in other social networks for having over 30 pieces, but the management of these pieces is horribly uneven. The [b]memoryless[/b] randomizer present does not take in consideration pseudopolyomino (minos can be or not next to each other) and polymino which means you will end up with an array of very unbalanced pieces. The pieces also are in a strict 3x3 mino grid, which means you WILL NEVER see an I4 (I shaped, 4 minos) piece. Along with that, the rotation center is always the center of this so-called grid, which means the O4 (O shaped, 4 minos) piece has its rotation center in a CORNER instead of the center of the piece.\n\nThe multiple piece playstyle is also really bad given the default controls. Cycling through more than two pieces at a time gives a very bad problem and that is the lack of proper focus for each of the falling pieces. Not only you have to deal with the default controls that are very unintuitive,\n\n[url=https://oshisaure.itch.io/puzzle-juggle-trouble]The game that is being thrown shade at in the Steam Store description[/url]\n---\nINTERMISSION: 2020 update--\nThe shade thrown at the game mentioned above was removed, but does not excuse the fact it was already done.\n---\ndoes a better job at managing both the multiple kinds of pieces you can generate, and the dual piece management as well, in which you just have to press a single button to alternate pieces. I recommend checking this one out, it's free.\n\nThe hard drop style present in this game is [url=https://harddrop.com/wiki/Drop#Hard_drop]Sonic Drop[/url] instead of a locking Hard Drop, which would be fine if the [url=https://harddrop.com/wiki/Drop#Soft_drop]Soft Drop[/url] would also lock the piece in place when colliding with the ground.\n\nThe only thing I can give props to this game is because of the leaderboards, which is given by Steamworks, but even that's exploitable...\n---\n2020 update: Still is.\n---","timestamp_created":1571670179,"timestamp_updated":1581822020,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.666247844696044922","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1581817018,"developer_response":"This fool is just trying to trash my game because nobody wants to play his shitty game\nhttps://youtu.be/zjBaBTPgPHo"}],"cursor":"AoJwmpH8pfACeY+/1AE="}
