Great content for colonization and better map stuff. No more yellow Prussia and more mod compatibility. The only downside (a minor one) is that you need DLC \"A House Divided\". It should be in the base game but I don't care, it is worth the money. 9/10","timestamp_created":1607938652,"timestamp_updated":1607938652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9pansPYCeoeKugI="}
