After having installed the game and playing for one hour straight without and with \"KiLL The EnginE\" (offline play) the only noticable change is the big wallclock being moved from left wall to the right wall in the beginning. According to the very fair pricing (free when purchasing the standard game) this DLC is actually better then some other DLCs from real games. \nAnd it's 100 times more honest, because the engine used for this game and the DLC, FPS Creator, is literally the killer of all engines... Because... It riuns any game created with it, already before release. So, attend the User License Agreement, which this time didn't lie! \n\nI am looking forward to see this DLC and the game it belongs to finally getting removed from Steam, so nobody will ever be fooled by by the screenshots again. \n\nI would love to give you a positive rating, but I am afraid this DLC is too good to have the same charme as the original InsanZ, which impressed me with it's low quality. As this DLC didn't offer anything to joke about, I see myself forced to give you a negative rating. \nBut you may have this one more chance because I am really sad about how bad your programing and language skills are and I hope by rating all of your disgusting work positive I might encourage you to improve and get some actual game done...\n\nOr at least to do anything useful.","timestamp_created":1516900308,"timestamp_updated":1516900308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwrqTl+ECdfuMlwE="}
