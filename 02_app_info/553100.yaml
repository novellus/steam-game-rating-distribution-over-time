    review: 'Poor graphics (max resolution is 1650x1200, and that for a game that
      was released in nov 2016), poorly optimized (52 FPS on a i7-4790K with two GTX980''s),
      poor controls, buggy. Avoid at all costs.


      If you''re looking for a good logging experience, try Farming Simulator 2017
      instead. Although the name doesn''t suggest it, you can also work as a logger
      in that game.'
