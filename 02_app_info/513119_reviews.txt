The models of the interior and the people within are hilariously bad in noclip mode, but everything else seems to be detailed enough. Comes with 1st class, 3rd class, brake/luggage, and even comes with slip coaches. If you're a fan of these coaches, I'd say give them a try. They're certainly better than any 3rd party add-on.\n\nPro tip, RH and LH just means which way they start out facing. If you want composite to have first class first in Quick Drive, just use RH. If you want the brake+3rd class coach to have luggage at the end, just use LH.","timestamp_created":1532585358,"timestamp_updated":1532585358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53436809778213501","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq5bN6uQCcIbzpgE="}
