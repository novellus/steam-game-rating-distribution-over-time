    review: "I was tempted to say that this game is far more enjoyable than it has\
      \ any right to be, but fuck it:  It's actually quite genuinely CLEVER, so any\
      \ kudos I'm inclined to give it is fully deserved.  Simple, yes...deceptively\
      \ so...but definitely clever.  How, you ask?  Well, in...SIMPLE ways, really!\
      \  Such as the fact that your visibility declines as the game progresses, meaning\
      \ that the formerly easy task of clicking on all encroaching beasties becomes\
      \ significantly harder, especially if you have to keep frantically turning on\
      \ lights just to keep said visibility up!  So, yes, it's basically a \"time\
      \ management\" game with a very simple interface, and in that sense may well\
      \ appeal to the Five Nights at Freddy's crowd (without being a completely blatant\
      \ rip-off of said franchise, such as, hmmm, let's see...123 Slaughter Me Street,\
      \ anyone?)!  Add to all this an extremely charming art style, fabulously spooky\
      \ sound and - what's this - highly competent voice acting?  In an indie \"horror\"\
      \ game?!  TELL ME IT AIN'T SO!!\n\n   And okay, so the main story mode doesn't\
      \ appear to be that long - though I for one am yet to beat it - but there's\
      \ a couple of mini-modes on the side to give it all a bit of longevity.  So\
      \ on sale, at least, it's certainly a bit hard to argue with the more-than-adequate\
      \ bang-for-your-buck...unless you're one of those tiresome fucks who complains\
      \ about spending a measly few bucks on a game to find it doesn't last for twenty-seven-plus\
      \ hours.  (Seriously, you people really are tiresome, and should find something\
      \ more worthwhile to concern yourselves with...maybe turn on the TV news for\
      \ five minutes some time...THAT oughtta scare the living shit out of you!  I\
      \ know it gives ME fuckin' nightmares...)\n\n   Oh, and for all you \"clicker\
      \ game\" people:  This is a bit like that, only it requires some degree of thought\
      \ and skill.  Just in case you still want that experience of clicking the mouse\
      \ a thousand times a minute, but with a bit of added strategy and, er, CHALLENGE\
      \ involved...just as an added bonus on the side, y'know...\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10."
