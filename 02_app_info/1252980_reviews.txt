Taco bros differs in the way of that damnable bell. It summons like 7000 customers all at the same time meaning if you don't actively pace yourselves on getting food out you fall apart almost immediately.\n\nThe previous campaigns all had challenges but nowhere near as unforgivably hard as Taco Bros. While I recommend it to those that want new content, I warn that it's overwhelmingly stressful at times.","timestamp_created":1610011648,"timestamp_updated":1610011648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgISL7vYCfrOdwQI="}
