End of game is quite lazily, doesn't rely on your ability to put words together, just unremovable tiles to artificially kill it off, or flooding you with unusable letters (Xs, Ks etc). Special tiles are pointless mostly, given very few do anything bar add a few points to the score. It's fine as a demo or proof of concept, but there's little strategy involved, and doesn't make me want to play it again.","timestamp_created":1609847429,"timestamp_updated":1609847429,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+MqY6fYCdMTWwAI="}
