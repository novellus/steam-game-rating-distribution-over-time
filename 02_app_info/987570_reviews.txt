In easier terms than the Store description, you put a square on the field. As the other squares run into it, they then form their own full-sized squares to potentially catch other squares that may have been out of reach at first. The levels with 50 of them are the most fun as the whole field lights up. Unfortunately, all of the girls are a simple palette swap (hair, clothing) from girls in a previous game (Chroma) so there aren't any new images to see.","timestamp_created":1595383413,"timestamp_updated":1595397000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541284441947937012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtMnEuvMCcabolgI="}
