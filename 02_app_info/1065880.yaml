    developer_response: "Thanks for the trying the game. If you play in more than\
      \ normal mode, the decisions really make a difference in combat. The expansion,\
      \ addresses some of the issues you mention. Each class gets a new feature that\
      \ affects the game in a major way. There is more customization on the equipment\
      \ with buffs. Additionally adds monsters that start to use skills that block\
      \ you from using spell and melee attacks and other features. \n"

    review: "This is a menu- and numbers-heavy Mordor/Demise-like RPG. If you haven't\
      \ played Mordor or Demise I wouldn't blame you, so in more generic terms, it's\
      \ a hack and slash RPG with randomized dungeons and slightly randomized (basically\
      \ elemental affinities) equipment. \n\nThis is *not* a roguelike, modern or\
      \ otherwise. There is only the most cursory resource management: \"stamina\"\
      \ dictates how many steps you can take in the dungeon before you start taking\
      \ damage, but there are myriad ways to extend, mitigate, or ignore it. There\
      \ is, of course, the ubiquitous gold, XP, and HP. Experience raises your level,\
      \ progressing you along a linear track which grants passive bonuses, and also\
      \ apparently gives you points to spend toward \"perks,\" though maybe this is\
      \ a feature of the DLC since I've yet to find the interface for doing so.\n\n\
      What's notably missing is a special resource like Mana, or even Vancian spells\
      \ per day. You can cast anything at any time you want. This is extra puzzling\
      \ considering you can cast your spells while outside of combat, giving you buffs\
      \ that last til you leave the dungeon or rest. Except... there is no mana, so\
      \ it's just about remembering to cast these, not actually making the tactical\
      \ choice to use resources to cast these. In other words, why aren't these just\
      \ always-on passive bonuses to relieve the tedium?\n\nWith no resource management,\
      \ combat feels strange, since you just spam the ability that reports the highest\
      \ damage. Magic schools are actually just big, monolithic spells, so if your\
      \ character can use \"Fire Magic\" it means they can cast \"Fire,\" which does\
      \ fire damage and applies a stacking burn. Each spell also comes with a side-effect,\
      \ like Fire's burn, or Stone's ability to reduce the physical damage enemies\
      \ can deal. But that's about it. All the spells do the same damage, so it comes\
      \ down to elemental resistances and/or which debuffs you need.\n\nEach encounter\
      \ seems to be the same, tactically speaking. It's you (and your pet, if you\
      \ capture/summon one) versus one enemy. Never more. There is no decision on\
      \ kill order, debuffs, crowd control, anything. You kill the guy in front of\
      \ you. That's it.\n\nThere are a plethora of skills and stats and mechanics,\
      \ mostly straight out of Mordor (but who cares since they're cool mechanics\
      \ like monster capture and the Zoo), but with the rubber-to-road game being\
      \ so extraordinarily basic, it's a struggle to really, well, care. There's not\
      \ even a sense of actually exploring the dungeon, since it's just a 2D grid\
      \ you click around on, one square at a time, that shows you an icon for fight,\
      \ treasure, or event. Whoopee.\n\nIn the end, there is, overall, just not a\
      \ lot here. You can do 1v1 fights ad infinitum, and get better at 1v1 fights\
      \ ad infinitum, but that's about it."
