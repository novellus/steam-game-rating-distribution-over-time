    review: "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Non-Difficult Platforming Fans, or Those\
      \ who want an enjoyable, relaxing romp [/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \nThe 4th\
      \ game in the Shantae series (the GBC game counts damn it), Wayforward put a\
      \ bunch of emphasis in revamping the presentation this time around: and the\
      \ change definitely works. While I still enjoyed the more classical pixel style\
      \ of the older series, this new art style brings colors that jump off the screen,\
      \ while still keeping the animation quality at the series high standards. And\
      \ while the sound design does leave a bit to be desired, the music is fantastic\
      \ as you would expect when Jake Kaufman is involved (Shovel Knight, Shantae\
      \ series fame). This game is just a pleasure to look at, and the character design\
      \ is probably the best it has ever been in the series.\n\nThe gameplay on the\
      \ other hand has taken a step back. While the platforming is still enjoyable,\
      \ its difficulty in combat has taken a step back from Pirate's Curse, as some\
      \ of the returning transformations such as the monkey form make dodging enemies\
      \ a breeze. The emphasis on movement over combat still shows off the smart level\
      \ design Wayforward is known for. And the boss fights do bring it a bit more\
      \ this time around, as they are better designed then in Pirate's Curse. But\
      \ a lack of length in gameplay and just a overall lack of difficulty plagues\
      \ the game a bit. \n\nOverall, the game still is an enjoyable romp that keeps\
      \ with the Shantae style. If you've liked the previous games in the series,\
      \ you'll love Half-Genie Hero. Just don't expect an evolution in the gameplay.\n\
      \n\n[b]Video Review: [/b]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgfpjp1KdYM\n\n[u]\
      \ Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The art work and presentation\
      \ change is fantastic, as the new color and line work really bring Shantae and\
      \ her dancing booty to life on the screen. \n[*] Good color choices as always:\
      \ putting the foreground and the action elements with the stronger hues. \n\
      [*] Music selection by Jake Kaufman is fantastic, appropriate for the levels\
      \ in question. \n[*] Boss fights have definitely gone up a notch, as they felt\
      \ like more of a test of my overall skills then previous games. Giga Mermaid\
      \ fight was a prime example of a good difficulty: not too hard, but needing\
      \ to take some skill in order to execute.\n[*] Good humor as always from the\
      \ writers of Wayforward. Some groan worthy puns as always, but it's the good\
      \ kind of humor.\n[*] Level Design great as always. Always good to go through\
      \ the first time, but still fun to go through on the next few playthroughs.\
      \ \n[*] Enemy variety is good. Good mix ups of melee versus range.\n[*] Good\
      \ difficulty for the casual player.\n[*] Performance is flawless. 60 FPS with\
      \ no drops.\n[*] Character design elements are fantastic as always. Being able\
      \ to recognize Shantae in her transformations is fantastic through the specific\
      \ characteristics like her headband and her eyebrows.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n\
      [list]\n[*] The gameplay's combat has taken a step backwards. A bit easier to\
      \ deal with enemies, and the enemies just don't pose the challenge they did\
      \ in Pirate's Curse.\n[*] Was Hoping for more after beating the game. I know\
      \ that more content with new characters is coming later, but I found myself\
      \ disappointed.\n[*] Sound Design does leave a little bit to be desired, as\
      \ some sounds seems to be missing, while others don't make a lot of sense in\
      \ the big picture. Squeaky sounds on grabbing metal rings for example. \n[*]\
      \ Shorter then the last games, and to me it showed a bit. Just didn't have the\
      \ same impact over the full game's length.\n[*] The Genie sub-plot here doesn't\
      \ work as well as other games plot lines. The thread connecting the various\
      \ substories is missing, unlike in Pirate's Curse.\n[*] Keyboard default configuration\
      \ must have been done with someone with giant hands.\n[*] Missing sound sliders.\n\
      [/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed,\
