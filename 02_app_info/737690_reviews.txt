The replayability is strong with this - every round is different and it makes a lot of fun playing it. The atmosphere catches you, so you do feeling like a little Dragon that has to escape and hide or the other way that has to hunt ! Either way it's a lot of fun ! Playing in Group with Friends do has a feeling from the long ago LAN-Partys. \nThe Dev's are really nice people you can speak to them if you have any troubles or just want to ask things about the game. If you start playing the game I suggest playing the Tutorial it shows you the many options and possibilities how to play the game, so even if you are an experienced player, just do the tutorial it helps a lot! \n\n10/10 Highly recommend this game :)","timestamp_created":1520857416,"timestamp_updated":1520857416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512987017631530762","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlNCKjeICcoLAmwE="}
