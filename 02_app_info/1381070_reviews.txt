Not as much NSFW content as I would like but the game is still being actively developed. So hopefully later on there will be more NSFW content later on, though what's there isn't bad. \n\nRegarding the developer, he develops practically daily at https://www.twitch.tv/mercernarymage. That being said, he makes no secret that the game is free to try on his Patreon, and buying the steam version is just a way to support him and get access to the latest version sooner.","timestamp_created":1608285843,"timestamp_updated":1608285843,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4483TuvYCcICTuwI="}
