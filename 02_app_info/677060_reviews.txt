There has been no discussion about it for a very long time in the forum. I picked it up yesterday and it's a fantastic idea, but the tracks that are included are not to my liking but I thought I could get past that by using the import feature which is supposed to generate charts from my own mp3 files. Well, it did generate charts, which is great, but there is no sound from any of the drum pads as soon as the song starts. I tried a half dozen different songs and there is no sound from the drum pads on any of them. The pads work fine on the included songs and you can bang on them while the song is loading but once your custom track starts playing, that's it, the drum pads go silent. Please fix this issue if you're out there? It really is a great game.","timestamp_created":1609033069,"timestamp_updated":1609033069,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nIb20PYCeJPLvQI="}
