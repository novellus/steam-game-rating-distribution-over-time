      notes: The game deals with some mature themes, such as murder, attempted murder,
        torture, and contains some depictions of nudity. However, as the game is lower
        resolution pixel art, nothing incredibly graphic is seen.

    review: 'Very enjoyable and well-paced point-and-click adventure. :)


      This one is a detective type point-and-click that goes the route of talking
      and clue-finding and does not actually feature an inventory system as such.
      This means you won''t easily get stuck and you will never end up in the "combine
      every object with every other object" situation. However, it still managed to
      feel like just the right level of challenge, and the story felt very well-paced
      with constant progression and new discoveries. Each case offers up several potential
      solutions where it''s up to you to decide if you''ve uncovered the whole truth
      yet or not.


      It''s not the longest game out there but every moment of it was truly enjoyable.
      I would attribute much of this to the fully voice-acted dialogues (of which
      there are plenty) that are mostly very well done. The script and voice acting
      for Bill - one of the main characters in the game - is my definitely a favourite
      of mine when it comes to voice-acting and script writing in a game!


      The only negative thing I have to say about the game is funny enough also about
      the voice-overs, but it''s not a huge issue. I understand the need for using
      the same voice actors for multiple roles in an indie game, but I think some
      choices could have been better planned. To me, some voices didn''t feel like
      they quite matched their characters and one particular scene lost a bit of its
      tension to me because of the same voice actor doing two very important parts
      in it. Other than that, I truly enjoyed every bit of this game and it is definitely
      one of my favourites in a genre of games that I cherish a lot. I will definitely
      be looking for more from this developer!'
