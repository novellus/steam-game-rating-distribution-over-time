    about_the_game: "Founded in London in 1888, The Order of the Golden Dawn was a\
      \ secret magic fraternity. It counted amongst its members the likes of Aleister\
      \ Crowley and W.B. Yeats. To become a member one must first have discovered\
      \ the existence of the fraternity after which an invitation to join must have\
      \ been extended. Upon accepting this invitation, one was initiated in a secret\
      \ ritual designed to invoke occult energies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a faithful\
      \ recreation that first ritual the &quot;Neophyte 0=0 Grade&quot; as it is described\
      \ in Israel Regardie's book &quot;The Golden Dawn&quot;. All of the speaking\
      \ roles are fully voiced by experienced members of the Seattle occult community.\
      \ Further rituals will be available as DLC as they are completed.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nYou can witness the ceremony as it was intended to be first viewed\
      \ - through the eyes of the candidate - or you can inhabit the body of any of\
      \ the officers including several of the so called &quot;invisible officers&quot;\
      \ giving you a giant's view of the proceedings. One of the view points allows\
      \ you to walk around the temple room during the ritual to grab and inspect the\
      \ various weapons and objects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWorks with both HTC Vive and\
      \ Oculus Rift (built using Oculus SDK for better performance).<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nPlease note that there are existing groups all over the world that are\
      \ currently working these rituals with varying levels of professionalism and\
      \ competency. Even though the scripts have been published for the public to\
      \ read for more than a century, if you are seriously considering the path of\
      \ the initiate we highly recommend that you not buy this app - all the proceedings\
      \ are revealed (as best we understand them and our modest technical abilities\
      \ are capable of representing them) and it would spoil your experience were\
      \ you to take initiation in person. Further, these groups can provide guidance\
      \ and fellowship to a level that a virtual community cannot, so if you enjoy\
      \ this experience and want to learn more, we advise seeking one of these groups\

    review: "    \"The lips of wisdom are closed, except to the ears\n    of Understanding\"\
      \n\nThis is an excellent resource for anyone studying the western esoteric tradition.\
      \ A simple and beautifully detailed look into the secret gnostic rituals practiced\
      \ by Bram Stoker, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, A.E. Waite, Aleister Crowley and many\
      \ others. Do you have the fortitude of spirit and strength of will to walk the\
      \ path of Hermes? Will you learn the ancient methods of Thoth? \n\n\"Roses are\
      \ red\nSushi is raw\nDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law\"\n\nA.'.A.'.\
      \   \n"
