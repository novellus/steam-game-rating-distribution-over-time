Some of them are fun, but in my opinion it's not good enough as a whole. This game is like the old flash games/old browser games, half of them are not fun at all, some of them didn't even have give any clue or didn't have indicator for completion. Sure, \"figure-it-out-yourself\" kind of game is fun for me, but not like this.\nSave your time and skip this title.\n\nScore: 2/5 (a bit disappointed)- a few of them are fun.","timestamp_created":1565605765,"timestamp_updated":1575517461,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589531779289245605","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oJOK6u4Ce9Ca0AE="}
