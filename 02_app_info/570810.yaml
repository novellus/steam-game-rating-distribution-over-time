    short_description: A 3-4 hour journey through an RPG-flavored museum of bad game
      design and worse puns. A meditation on the rites of passage that define a veteran
      gamer. A hot fudge sundae whose ice cream is the platonic form of a game and
      whose hot fudge is literal hot fudge that I spilled all over my keyboard.

    review: "[h1]Hilarious example of how to handle parody games RIGHT. Excellent\
      \ writing, good pacing, and superb price make this a must buy for an comedy\
      \ or RPG fan.[/h1]\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9nUnSg9e8SE\n\nHoly CRAP. I can\u2019\
      t remember the last time a game, besides something Crankage Games cooked up,\
      \ got me to laugh so hard I was crying. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect when\
      \ I started up this game, but the meta \u2018game within a game\u2019 and then\
      \ never taking itself seriously was amazing.\n\nYou start the game innocently\
      \ enough, but it quickly becomes apparent that Ivy (you) is the only sane and\
      \ logical character in a world FULL of badly written NPCs and horrible camera\
      \ angles. Eventually you manage to get the upper hand on the world. I won\u2019\
      t spoil anything, but how you fix the airship is nothing short of genius, both\
      \ in actual GOOD game design and comedy.\n\nThe main draw of this game is that\
      \ you are a player PLAYING another game...an RPG Maker game that is filled with\
      \ bad design choices, copy & pasted maps, and terribly written sections that\
      \ smack of a developer that is too full of himself. But that\u2019s just it...it\u2019\
      s SUPPOSED to come off as pretentious and full of itself! It ticks off all the\
      \ boxes of a bad game, but does so in such a subversive and meaningful way,\
      \ that you almost forget it\u2019s a game poking FUN at those sorts of things,\
      \ until you hit the punchline and just sit there in awe, holding your sides.\n\
      \nParody games (and to an extent, games where you are self-aware) are delicate\
      \ things to get right. Too obtuse, and no one will get the joke. Too blatant,\
      \ and people find it boring and unfunny for \u2018trying too hard\u2019. I dunno\
      \ what the developer, Kyle, was doing to come up with this masterpiece, but\
      \ he struck gold. Easily one of the best RPG Maker games, and easily the best\
      \ parody game I\u2019ve ever played. By attacking the designs, and not the tropes,\
      \ it\u2019s a fresh take on what can be a stale topic.\n\n+Hilariously takes\
      \ jabs at itself and other games for common \u2018bad\u2019 design choice\n\
      +Doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome, and plot moves along at an excellent pace\n\
      +Every Inn\u2019s name is a pun, and that\u2019s just Inn-credible\n+Excellent\
      \ price\n\n=Dragon Boss was somewhat difficult and annoying, taking several\
      \ tries (and a dead Tonk) to finally down. Unsure if intentional or not. Clever\
      \ girl\n\n-There was only ONE [i]Choose Thine Destiny[/i] book"
