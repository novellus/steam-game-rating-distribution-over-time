Level ten will haunt my dreams forever as an example of why man must never play God. Seriously, though. The pictures aren't super crisp and the kittens look super deformed from the puzzle cuts. Is it worth .49 cents USD on sale? If you love all kittens, even the ones most people would not, then yes.\n\nThe sad thing is, with crisper photos and the deformities from the cuts fixed it could be a good if small game. If that ever happens, I'll happily flip my review to a recommend as some of the kittens remind me of those posters from the 1980s.","timestamp_created":1606695148,"timestamp_updated":1606700082,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtbSyi/YCfMXFtQI="}
