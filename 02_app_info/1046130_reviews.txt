The masks are really cool and, without spoiling which, I like how some of them change the game slightly(I'm a completionist so I have to buy all the masks).  \n\nJust a really fun game that doesn't get boring or monotonous.  I think the animations are very well done and there is quite an attention to detail.","timestamp_created":1569881843,"timestamp_updated":1569881843,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40/yPwu0CfIyc0wE="}
