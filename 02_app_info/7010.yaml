      \ and epic first-person action game.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>An augmented super-soldier\

      \t\t\t\t<p>Hong Kong, 2065. 2nd Lt. Nathan Frost is just a regular grunt in\
      \ an international army called the Liberty Coalition. When he takes massive\
      \ injuries from an explosion on the battlefield, Frost undergoes an experimental\
      \ procedure. The outcome of the surgery is something more than human; a transformation\
      \ that makes him a unique weapons-grade warrior, with abilities that far surpass\
      \ those of the average soldier.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Empowered with these extra-normal\
      \ abilities via implanted augmentations, Frost is immediately sent to the frontlines\
      \ of a war as a secret weapon against the destructive regime. Stranded in hostile\
      \ territory, cut off from command and far outnumbered, Frost and a handful of\
      \ men must try and stop the entire renegade militia's plan threatening to plunge\
      \ the world into darkness.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Engage in\
