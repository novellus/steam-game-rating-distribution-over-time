      for the 5th Edition rules, Kingdoms provides rules for settlements of every
      size, from tiny wayside villages to a sprawling metropolis, detailing prosperity
      and corruption, law and learning, and a wide range of government types and special
      characteristics. In addition, it includes a complete system for founding a kingdom,
      from exploring and claiming territory to building and developing cities and
      issuing edicts to manage your kingdom's economy and stability and for building
      up the loyalty of your subjects. You can play with a simple, abstract system
      or use any number of optional rules to develop trade, diplomacy, and more, and
      Kingdoms also includes a simple system of mass combat, allowing you to build
      armies to defend your kingdom from enemies or raise a mighty crusade to conquer
      all who stand before you. Your heroes have beaten the bandits, overcome the
      orcish onslaught, and defeated the dragon, but in between their adventures your
      heroes would rather return home to a mighty throne instead of a warm campfire,
      now they can with Kingdoms! Grab this fantastic 5E supplement today and Make

    review: Not much here. I was hoping for more tables and things to auto generate.
      There is a detailed refernce manual but there is not much built. I would not
      recomend buying in its current state!
