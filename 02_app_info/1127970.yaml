      /><br>In a long-devastated world, only one city remains intact. Protected by
      a glass dome, the city of Endeavor rises above the wreckage of the past. Inhabited
      solely by robots, the city has been maintained this way for hundreds of years.
      For this to be so, everything must work perfectly, so everything imperfect is
      discarded.<br><br>That is until a single robot worker malfunctioned. Thrown
      out of the city that once was his home, he is on a quest to find a way to fix
      himself. But he is no longer welcome in his city: being unpredictable, he is
      seen as a threat, so now the city opposes him. In his journey to fix himself
      and find intelligent life, he will unravel the mysteries of this world, the
      origin of his city and its kind.<br><br>But it seems that there is no intelligent
      life left. Only the robots programmed to keep the city nice and clean for the
      people who are nowhere to be found.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1127970/extras/features2final.png?t=1608292905"

      is left to help you out? What happened to the people who lived here long ago?<br><img
