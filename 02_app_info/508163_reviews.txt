(or is it? :P)  [/h1]\nNo but seriously, it feels great if you played the other routes before and it actually gives the game one last punch!\n\n [h1]--if you are unsure if you want to buy book 1 AND 2 [/h1] \n(wich you probably should as they have a continues storyline. [b]Book 1 has NO climax or ending[/b] really) [b][u]please check out my review on book 2[/u][/b] where i adress the negative points indepth. Sadly the second book is the part where all the issues really come to play.\n\n [h1]Game overall: [/h1]\n- CS were good but i would have hoped for more (or i'm used to get more of them in other VN/Otome).\n\n-> the music loops seem to be a lot better in Hikarus playthrough. maybe bc he got some new tracks too. anyhow its not a negative point anymore! yay!\n\n+ Other that that the game is unusually polished\n+ i personally enjoyed a more western/realistic artstyle for once \n+ and the writing was good (both in grammar AND storytelling)\n+ the maincharacter is normal, in a GOOD way. She reacts grumpy when someone is rude, shes flustered if its the situation but shes not overly anything. The writing conveyed a fully fleshed charcter wich you shape with your reaktions one by one. I really enjoyed seeing this instead of one blunt character!\n(-? some of the options feel a bit wierd in how he reacts. Like some of tehm make sense later on / in retrospective but not all of them - its a really tiny problem tho)\n\n [h1]This particular Route: [/h1]\n++ Amazing idea to put all routes together - i loved it! Eventhough i had hoped we would kinda get pay off for actually playing them (i.e. the choises be linked to the story, that you had to know what was \"the right choice\" to pick) but thats nagging on high niveau!\n+ likewise it feels like on big show down after the first few chapters, wich is really exciting as this is the last released route and kinda the climax of the game over all (well if you leave out the amazing chaos route wich you should play AFTER book 2!)\n+ hikaru might be my fav character yet (even tho he seems a bit ill treated is his own routes (more on that futrher below and on book 2 review)\n- regarding personal time or like relationship devolopment you have hardly any with hikaru (or even ANY). I get that we learn a lot about him (well more about the divine realm rather) and we kinda get closer to him - but not in a romantic way actually. it cann all be very well seen absolutely firendly/platonic (wich makes book 2's [spoiler]\"were destined for each other\"[/spoiler] really forced ... wich is really sad!)","timestamp_created":1548250489,"timestamp_updated":1548254543,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ya/KvegCdP6DuQE="}
