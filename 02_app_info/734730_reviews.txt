TBH, I consider it excellent. A mature story (no, I won´t spoil anything here), good AI, very interesting (at least for me) world  building. \nI would like to see a part 2 or at least an DLC. \nOnly thing I miss is an endless mode after ending the (approx. 60-70 hours with side missions)  main campaign.","timestamp_created":1597532378,"timestamp_updated":1597532378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwubKW+vMCeP7amwI="}
