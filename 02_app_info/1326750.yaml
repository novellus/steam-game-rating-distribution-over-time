      town of Amberglen.  You've washed up on a quiet beach with nothing to your name,
      not even your memories.  You're in luck however as locals are quick to find
      you, and nurse you back to health.  The king himself is kind enough to allow
      you to stay on a piece of abandoned property to make your living.  With nothing
      more than a few rusty tools turn strike out and attempt to breathe life back
      into this old land!<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Create
