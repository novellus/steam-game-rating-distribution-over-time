    review: "I know that this game is in early access, however it is not meant for...\
      \ this!\n\nFirst, the art.. is not horrible, but also not good! The only decent\
      \ art are the sprites. \n\nThe dialog is clunky. If you i. e. want to get a\
      \ sex scene with a girl you have to first select choice 1, then choice 2 and\
      \ so on until you're there (with lots of copy-pasted dialog in between of course).\
      \ And the choices are the same for every girl. Bugs are common as well and the\
      \ skip function does not work. \n\nIf you want to know more about the plot,\
      \ you can read a text file contained within the game and the sex scenes are...\
      \ not even acceptable. The cg's are straight bad... and this is not just  me\
      \ being mean. It's probably the reason the screenshots up there don't show any\
      \ sex scenes. \n\nThere is no romance, so why is the only thing the game was\
      \ supposed offer, the sex scenes, the worst part of it!?\n\nThe characters behave\
      \ the same as well. Always the same dialog for every character. \"Sorry, I'm\
      \ not ready for this\". Proposing after first sex scene? Always works. The same\
      \ getting-to-know events for every single character. More than one character-specific\
      \ event? Don't you guys have phones? Argh, I'm tired of this. \n\nAnd one (date-able)\
      \ person's a guy. For diversity purposes I guess? I mean I wouldn't care...\
      \ but I expected yuri. It was pretty disappointing. \n\nHonestly, all of those\
      \ bad games which seem like the dev started working on it yesterday annoy me\
      \ so much. I would be okay with a game which would be in beta or something...\
      \ but this would be basically pre-alpha.... wft? Someday we'll get so-called\
      \ \"games\" which are just template ren'py projects and the people say \"It's\
      \ still in early access\". 'Course it isn't complete.\" This game is not incomplete.\
      \ This game will probably have triple the amount of time spent after early access\
      \ release than before. \n\nHonestly, it feels like some 16 y/o publishes his\
      \ passion products... on Steam... for money... no idea what to say. Bad. Don't\
      \ buy. Save your money. Not worth it. No. Don't. Please."
