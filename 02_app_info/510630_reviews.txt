Easy to play once you get the hang of it. I manage to play and sign players just fine without spending any money on SM credits. All you need to do is win matches and leagues and use that prize money to purchase whatever players or facility upgrade you require. The fact that you can play the same saved game over different platforms (mobile, pc, steam) and pick up where u left off, whatever the platform, is something that is very useful and works well.  Overall i think it is a very good game, fun to play. I highly recommend you at least give it a try, you might like it as many others do.","timestamp_created":1488097199,"timestamp_updated":1510491088,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyJyS2N8Ccf+Ucw=="}
