There is a 4 day submit with the other kings and queens from the other countries in wonderland to decide how they will govern between war, magic, trade and borders. For the 4 days you're there it's your job to schedule the activities between the kings, queens and their daughters/sons/advisors. \n\nQuite an interesting game, I'd say. Basically, you will unlock mini plots and stories between the characters depending on who you pair off with who. Re-playability is a given. It's highly advisable to play it many many times to get all of the plots and it will involve a lot of trial and error for a lot of the acheivements without a guide. Luckily for you, 1 complete playthrough is quite short so you wont have to worry.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Well, I liked it, it was interesting. It had many mini sub plots that slowly told us each person's story there, it doesn't allow you to grow very attached to the characters but all characters are quite interesting in their own right. Mind you, expect lots of playing again and again to get everything, even with a walkthrough. It might not be for everyone but try it out if you can.","timestamp_created":1594546035,"timestamp_updated":1594546035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.614682614803314209","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k7OWofMCcvThlAI="}
