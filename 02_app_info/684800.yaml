    review: 'Log Jammers is basically pong with throwing axes and log rolling which
      is exactly as intense as it sounds. Add in a series of power-ups that force
      you to go right up to the metaphorical net or risk a super charged challenger,
      and you have something that can only be described as frenzied.


      That sort of fast-paced, reaction-based craziness is always going to be more
      fun with friends, but the single player tournament mode has plenty to offer
      too. Each character has an off the wall motivation and an equally off-color
      happily ever after waiting for them at the end of a successful tournament. But
      just like a multiplayer match, you''ll have to be focused and quick to get there.
      After all, you''re always only three good throws away from victory, yours or
      your opponent''s.'
