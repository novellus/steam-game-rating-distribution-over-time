    about_the_game: "Hag\u2019s Castle is a 3D Action Adventure game, inspired by\
      \ classics like \u2018Dungeon Master\u2019 and \u2018Eye Of The Beholder\u2019\
      .<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game features real-time combat with a range of crusty\
      \ creatures that have usurped the hallowed opulence of an ancient Scottish Castle.\
      \ You, playing as a \u2018Wizard\u2019s lackey\u2019, have been asked to perform\
      \ the quest of rescuing the wizard\u2019s pet dragon \u2018Oli\u2019 from the\
      \ clutches of an evil old witch named \u2018Madam Hag\u2019. <br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThere are twenty-five levels in the game, and the player can control movement,\
      \ fighting and spell-casting entirely with mouse control.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      It\u2019s also the first game from Ed Sludden, a veteran Games Artist from the\
      \ UK with experience working on titles such as \u2018Conker\u2019s Bad Fur Day\u2019\
      , \u2018Bonsai Barber\u2019 and \u2018Adventure Time - Pirates of the Enchiridion\u2019\
      .<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe music in \u2018Hag\u2019s Castle\u2019 is by Graeme\
      \ Norgate,  a Bafta nominated composer who has worked on video game soundtracks\
      \ since the late 80\u2019s. Graeme wrote the music on games such as Killer Instinct,\
      \ Blast Corps, Goldeneye and Perfect Dark."
