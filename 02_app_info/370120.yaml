      \ pirates! Engage in deep tactical decisions, balancing attacks with repairs\

      \ battle, even a random encounter, will take some planning to win. Use a variety\
      \ of moves to position, deal damage, heal, or intimidate your way to victory.\
      \ You'll have to out-smart enemies who always have you out-gunned!<br></li><li><strong>Fully\
      \ customizable fleet.</strong> Design your fleet from top to bottom with ships\

      \ /><br>Join Rogue Swanson, daughter of a famous pirate captain, in her quest\
      \ to take down the dreaded Pirate League! You'll need to grow the strength of\
      \ your fleet quickly if you hope to stay one step ahead of your enemies and\
      \ uncover their dark plans. Many will join their ranks, claiming that you are\
      \ pirates\u2014that you should be stopped! But you know the truth. Follow your\
      \ code to protect the weak and remain fearless as darkness falls over the sea.\
      \ There will be no one else to stand against it.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/370120/extras/gameplay.png?t=1604776274\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Chose Your Tactics Wisely</h2>Each fleet is made of\
      \ ships from four classes, each with unique abilities. Some ships can withstand\
      \ any attack, some move quickly, and some have great range. Which ships you\
      \ use will depend on your strategy. Will you hold back and launch a counter\
      \ attack or will you attack before they have a chance to load their cannons?<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Liberate the Islands</h2>The ocean is divided into territories,\
      \ each of which has islands. As you fight pirates in a territory, you gradually\
      \ liberate the local islands, which unlocks new locations on each island, new\
      \ items to buy, and new crew to hire. Just don't spend your gold too quickly.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Complete Missions</h2>As you explore you may find someone\
      \ who offers you a mission. Completing missions will unlock locations, unlock\
      \ new ship designs, or reward you with gold. There\u2019s always a primary mission\
      \ that will move you closer to unraveling the plans of your enemies.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Hire Your Crew</h2>Occasionally you will find someone willing to join\
      \ your crew in exchange for gold or items. As your crew grows you can use more\
      \ ships in combat or choose to use bigger ships, if you\u2019ve discovered their\
      \ designs.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stop to Fish</h2>You can\u2019t fight pirates\
      \ all the time! Fishing and botany are both available to help you relax while\
      \ gaining some valuable items to sell. Mythical fish and plants are out there\
      \ to discover and are worth a lot of gold. Finding them won\u2019t be easy though."

    review: 'Took me a couple of hours to understand most of the "ins and outs" of
      this game (I was spurred on by the positive reviews).


      I play a lot of turn based strategy games, but this one has its own unique positive
      flavour.'
