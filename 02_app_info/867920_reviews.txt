But I've enjoyed this one. They say it's made with RPG maker software, but it's reasonable to not waste your time on unnecessary coding when you have a good story to tell.\nAnd this is Mahabharata, one of the best books to read, which inspired many of your so-loved anime and games.\nThis game is best played when you already know the story of Mahabharata, at least by tv series. Here we have many episodes from it. Playing as Bhishma, Karna, and the Pandavas. With Indian visual style and music. There's quite a lot of content and they say it takes 48 hours to play it all. \nSure, there are some small inaccuracies, but not more than in any Mahabharata movie when compared to the book.","timestamp_created":1577450614,"timestamp_updated":1577716498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.600840330123901367","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5efOq+8Ce4K35wE="}
