    review: 'Nice puzzle game which lasted me a good 4.5h.


      In each of the first 7 parts of the game, a new element of gameplay is introduced.
      You have between 10 and 15 levels to learn how it works and interacts with the
      other ones. The 8th and last part of the game feels like a treat: nothing is
      new, you just have 13 more levels to have fun with.


      In other words, the level design was good. I was only wondering a few times
      why some elements were there, because I did not use them at all: it was probably
      due to levels having multiple solutions. The very last level was brilliant:
      it took me quite some time to solve it, but I really enjoyed the thought process
      of getting to the solution.


      The look and feel of the game is a perfect fit for the genre: the visuals are
      beautiful but clear, the interface does not go in your way, and the ambiant
      music is great to focus on the puzzles.


      Overall, a solid game. Bonus point for working flawlessly on Linux-based systems.'
