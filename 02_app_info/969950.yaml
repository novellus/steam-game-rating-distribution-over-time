    review: 'I was really enjoying this up until the start of Mission #3 where I discovered
      the AI driven log truck stops dead halfway to the loading point and never moves
      again, thereby rendering the game unplayable due to missions being consecutively
      unlocked.


      Sadly, nice visuals and decent control layouts for the equipment can''t save
      this one. Harvestable trees are randomized though, so those of you who already
      own WS11 could get a bit of use out of it by replaying the first two missions
      a couple times each I guess.'
