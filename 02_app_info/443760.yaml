    review: "This is one of the best sci-fi films I've seen in years.  There's no\
      \ flashy graphics, alien invasions, or apocalyptic scenarios.  It doesn't spend\
      \ a bunch of screen time ratcheting up false tensions, piling on mountains of\
      \ expository dialogue, or following predictable movie tropes.  The \"hook\"\
      \ is presented with an unapologetic lack of explanation.  The viewer is thrown\
      \ into the chaos alongside the characters trying to piece it all together. \
      \ This is smart sci-fi and a great character-driven thriller.  \n\nMultiple\
      \ viewings are encouraged and rewarded.  I've seen it several times and I've\
      \ loved it more each time.  There are lots of little details that might be missed\
      \ on a first viewing which have profound implication upon subsequent viewings,\
      \ such as one character's quick glance at an object in the room or a line spoken\
      \ off camera that is barely registered the first time around.  I won't ruin\
      \ the plot in this review and suggest going into this film knowing as little\
      \ as possible.  It's interesting piecing it all together and if you love it\
      \ as I did, you'll want to watch it again and again to pick up on all the subtle\
      \ details.  I had a bunch of \"oh sh-t!\" moments on my third viewing once I\
      \ started paying really close attention.\n\nThe way it was filmed is also really\
      \ interesting.  This is an indie film with a $50k budget shot on Canon 5D's.\
      \  It was filmed at the director's own house over the course of 5 nights with\
      \ only pair of cameras, a skeleton crew, and completely natural lighting.  The\
      \ most interesting thing is that the acting is entirely improv.  The actors\
      \ had no scripts.  They didn't know the story ahead of time.  It was filmed\
      \ like a mystery dinner party, with the actors staying in-character, and the\
      \ director as master of ceremonies pulling strings behind the curtain.  Before\
      \ each scene the actors received a small sheet of notes directing them as to\
      \ what their character should accomplish.  He left it in the actors' hands to\
      \ craft the scene, only pausing to \"right the ship\" when they started veering\
      \ too far off course.  What we get from this are natural conversations and genuine\
      \ characters while the actors work together to craft a coherent story.  They're\
      \ figuring it all out as they go, just like the audience.  It's a fun way to\
      \ create a film, certainly too risky in the big-budget space, but it really\
      \ works here to create a compelling, refreshing experience.\n\nI have a couple\
      \ gripes with the Steam version.  It appears this film is only currently available\
      \ at a maximum of 544p resolution.  The store page suggests 720p and proper\
      \ 1080p options are available, as listed in the recommended system requirements,\
      \ but these options were not present at my time of viewing.  I've also viewed\
      \ this film on Amazon Prime Video and it has a 1080p option, so it shouldn't\
      \ be a matter of availability of a \"full HD\" version.\n\nAlso, some scenes\
      \ are particularly dark due to filming outdoors at night and using only natural\
      \ lighting sources.  Due to the low-light conditions and digital compression\
      \ there are occasionally color banding and artifacting issues.  Despite these\
      \ technical issues, this is one of my favorite indie films of all time and I\
      \ look forward to see more from this director in the future."
