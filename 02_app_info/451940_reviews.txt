Difficulty scales to your ability throughout the run. Solid aesthetic, fantastic soundtrack, tons of leaderboards to compete for. Then change it all up with Core mode for a new challenge.\n\nBest part is the original version of this game, Leave Home, is included in here as well. Since XBLA no longer exists, it's great to have that game in my life again. Hello 2009!\n\nYou can totally afford this game.","timestamp_created":1606342235,"timestamp_updated":1606342235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t6rdgPYCc76SsQI="}
