    about_the_game: The Ford RS200 never had the opportunity to shine in Group B rally,
      this changed however when the car was entered into its first European Rallycross
      Championship event, with the car demonstrating incredible performance characteristics,
      winning multiple events between 1986-1992, and winning the championship in 1991.
      Typically producing around 580 hp, the RS200 could accelerate from 0-60 in little
      over 2 seconds.
