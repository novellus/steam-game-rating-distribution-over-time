There are parts of this game that I love and parts that I hate. The art and music are absolutely gorgeous and the writing is fun, but the city puzzle is a nightmare. Most of them just need some note-taking, but that one requires you to click on almost exact pixels with no specific indication of where. There is a clue given for where the spots are, but the clickable space is incredibly tiny. Even with a tutorial, they're a chore to pinpoint. A later puzzle requires precise clicking as well, but the location is much better indicated.\n\nI'm not sure I could recommend it for $5.99, but it's definitely worth it on one of its 90% off sales.","timestamp_created":1609191286,"timestamp_updated":1609191286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz8zR1fYCcKqevgI="}
