Which brings me to my second point.\n- The Steam version has [u]no Japanese aka original text[/u]. The only reason I could think of is that the publisher wanted to save on licensing fees, since if you wanted the original, you probably would've gotten it through Getchu / Amazon.jp etc, not Steam. However, this is a visual novel, so omitting original text makes for a bewildering choice. For me personally, this is unacceptable, especially with VN releases moving in the opposite direction with simultaneous dual-language options etc.\n\nYour Diary came out way back in 2011. The + and +H versions were released in 2014 with three additional routes. Let's just say I got the +H version through other means back then, and I'm buying this now to support the developer and encourage more studios to release their material through Steam. If you've ever tried to properly buy/import one of these from overseas, you know how much of a hassle it is. Just to be clear, I would [i]not[/i] have bought this on its own without Japanese subtitles, but I've already read it, so fair's fair.\n\nSo why am I giving this a positive review? It's because I think the original deserves it. This is for the devs: I hope the English re-translation goes smoothly, and the original text is added, so players on Steam get the version they deserve. Hence the following is my [u]review of the original your diary +H in Japanese[/u].\n\nWhen this was released, in my opinion, it was an underappreciated title with very high production values. Just look at the opening movie with cover from Duca. It doesn't even feel like a 2011 title. That was almost ten years ago. This was Cube's second VN, and I get the feeling that they wanted to make a real splash. The CVs alone say a thing or two: Naomi (Idolmaster, Little Busters, Aokana, Shinikissu), Yoshino (Eustia, DaCapo), Sawada Natsu (Irosekai, Aokana). The voices were well-matched, and their performances are spot-on.\n\nThe premise in your diary is simple: Tomoki goes to an old bookstore, and he ends up being chosen by Yua, a shiawase no kami (deity of happiness) inhabiting the titular diary book, who is determined to help him find happiness in life. What does happiness mean to different people? What does happiness mean right now? These are central themes to your diary.\n\nThe first and best impression on me is the atmosphere. The pastel shades, paperback feel, and gentle piano / strings complement Kantoku-sensei's art style so well. The characters are really well-drawn even by today's standards. Throughout much of the common route, you have moodmaker Kaho and Hibiki bouncing ideas off of each other and doing rapid-fire conversations trying to get Yuuhi and Tomoki together, with Yua's innocent antics added in for laughs. Of course, the characters are all a likable bunch, and they get their own quiet moments too. It reminds me of August's Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai, where the conversation flows naturally and almost everyone in the group has something interesting to say, unlike some VNs with less competent writing. Of course, what they say is pretty much in line with what you'd expect from a chara-ge. This kind of VN has no central mystery or anything of the sort. It's about the characters.\n\nSpeaking of writing, usually I wouldn't think of mentioning prose in a typical VN. However, there are sections in this one that read like they belong in an actual book. In other words, the original writing is pretty good (IMO) by chara-ge standards:\n\nどういうわけか、部屋に入ってきた途端、ゆあは口を閉ざしてしまい、やむなく俺はベランダに出ようと提案した。そして、しばらく二人で夜空を見上げていた。あいにくの曇り空。それでも曇の隙間から点々と星が輝いている。肌を撫でるそよ風は、少しひんやりとしていたけれど、疲れている体には、何だか心地よく感じられた。\n「今日はつかれただろう？」\n「いえ、だいじょうぶです……」\n\nMy best attempt at translation:\nFor some reason or other, just while we were headed into my room, Yua clenched her mouth and reluctantly suggested that we head out to the veranda. And thus, for some time, the two of us simply gazed upward towards the night sky. It's a regrettable, cloudy sky. But even so, the stars still managed to flash their brilliant light from between tiny cracks in the clouds. It felt a bit chilly, with the caressing breeze against my skin, and somehow, that made me realize only now, how tired I really was.\nTomoki: \"Today was exhausting, eh?\"\nYua: \"Mm, I'm alright...\"\n\nBottom line: If you're looking for a classic VN that is buoyed by the strength of its characters, rather than cheap gimmicks and shallow writing that plagues too many VNs these days, your diary is an instant recommendation from me, [i]once the publisher restores the original text and comes up with a translation that can do justice to the original material, that is.[/i]","timestamp_created":1586385633,"timestamp_updated":1608934825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580152690410614014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wqP/zfYCcraj/wE="}
