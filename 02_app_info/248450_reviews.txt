Why attack a faction/planet located at the other side of the galaxy when you have a space station right above a planet home to an enemy colony? At one point the \"Free Nations\" had just three locations on the map. Why not focus on wiping them off the map so they can't rebuild? \n\nThe developer did a good job for sure. It's identical in quality to many great, early 2000's games but I just can't recommend it, unless you have a lot of time and patience.\n\nEDIT: I plan on giving it another chance at some point and will see it through to completion...","timestamp_created":1606883793,"timestamp_updated":1607069074,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpYCylvYCcpjWtgI="}
