Haven't done the rest yet.\n\nI could be stating the obvious here, but this is much more of a work simulation than a game.\n\nI work as a software engineer, a lot of this is so far is really simple stuff, but made difficult by the byzantine programming language and difficulty physically making it do the stuff that I want it to. It's like going on hacker rank and then tying an arm behind your back.\n\nThe game parts of this are a little bit frustrating or miss the mark. The UI to create a file, open it, then get dumped back into the base menu after every level is somewhat annoying. Not sure what the point of naming the files is or why you would want multiple files for the solutions. You can't copy and paste, you can't make jumps or functions as far as I can tell. The emails between levels are missing the mark a little bit with me and I wouldn't be surprised if many people just didn't read them (similar to how I don't read emails at work, which is another +1 for the simulation).\n\nI went into this expecting a game like the human resource machine which takes similar low level programming concepts and algorithm/data structure questions and turn them into a game with animations, characters, etc. Right now this has the frustrating parts of that and not much else.\n\nGood concept, don't recommend it as it stands today though.
