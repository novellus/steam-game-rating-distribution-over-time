In fact, so much SLS has been put in there that it's much more than \"a poor attempt at copying FNaF\".\nThe jumpscares are not the best, but they're still alright. The atmosphere already makes the game scary, plus figuring out the best strategy to send the puppets away.\nThe levels have a nice game design, in the earelier floors, they are pretty easy, but at the lower floors, they are much harder, so you must try new strategies, as I said before.\nI recommend this game to everyone, especially with this price.","timestamp_created":1608191330,"timestamp_updated":1608191330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7Yjrt/YCeKLxugI="}
