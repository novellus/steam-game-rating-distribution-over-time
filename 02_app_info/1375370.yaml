    review: "Just picked a random one since I couldn't review the whole pack as one\
      \ unit.\n\nThe mapping in this entire pack is awful, it reeks of them running\
      \ out of interesting ideas and just randomly throwing notes into the song. \
      \ It doesn't feel like a lot of the best custom songs where you learn the patterns\
      \ and the beat and eventually get the win.  It just feels like half the notes\
      \ are off beat, and the other half are patterns completely pointlessly.  \n\n\
      Hard Pass.\n\nPlayed on Expert+"
