This is more like survival game. It reminds me of Resident Evil 1-2 and Dark Souls 1. \nYou need to think to progress. Every item, shrine, secret door is important. You can't just go forward and make progress - you will die or spend to much resourses if you do this. Your \"skill\" means nothing. Game work such way you just can't win with your reflexes, only smart and carefull planing make you through the game. This is the part that reminds me of oldschool survival horros :) \nVery nice mechanic of Evil in here. I love it.","timestamp_created":1608618292,"timestamp_updated":1608618292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsubHxPYCcouOvAI="}
