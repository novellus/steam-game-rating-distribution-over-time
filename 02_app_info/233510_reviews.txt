The problem is: there is no story, the only known thing about the alien is the fact that he needs to return to the moon, and yet each time he does he will fall again only to do the same thing all over again. The entire point of the game is to explore the map and find six different ways to make it back to the moon in one piece, only to unlock the seventh way, but since even then nothing new will happen, achievements are probably your best motivation to make it that far. \n\nApart from that, you know absolutely nothing about the alien's life, the planet, the random creatures you will find on the planet or even the purpose of the entire game; aside from two or three easter eggs that will award you with an achievement each once you get to them, the entire map is a empty maze in which your only purpose is to get to the other end in order to collect a part for something that should take you to the moon. As much as the game focuses on exploration, as it leaves menus, instructions or quests behind, there really isn't much out there to explore and without looking it up online you will have a hard time figuring out what you're supposed to do with those random pieces you find scattered around the map. \n\nEven with seven different ways to make it back to the moon, the entire experience feels repetitive and mediocre, as almost all the routes will require you to collect a number of items from around the map, not knowing in what direction they might be, bringing them back to an NPC which will then present you with another way to make it back. This is one of those games that it's painful to watch or play as nothing interesting ever happens and even when the challenge is supposed to make it better, there will be issues that will stop it from being enjoyable.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nLunnye Devitsy fails to follow the first rule of any platformer: being fun to play; instead of that you get a boring, frustrating and luck-based experience that you won't miss once you press the escape button. For the first bit, Lunnye Devitsy wants to give you freedom of exploration, giving you the choice to take on the six different endings at your own phase and theoretically figuring out each one of them on your own. However, the game has absolutely no instructions whatsoever and even though you will bump into an engine part or a moon piece frequently, it will take a while to piece them all together and figure out where you're supposed to go once you have collected them all, time in which you will simply move from one edge of the world to the opposite one trying to find that object that you're supposed to interact with, as there is no hint to the whereabouts of that object or NPC, or the action you're supposed to perform in order to interact with that object / NPC.\n\nOnce you do eventually get back to the moon six times, a seventh ending will be unlocked which is supposed to be longer and more challenging, but ended up being nothing like that. In order to get back to the moon the seventh time you must collect all the coins scattered around the map, some of them in almost unreachable areas, so this is where your abilities were supposed to interfere, making use of the double jump techniques and the cannons, which were useless before, however the cannon shooting mechanic is completely broken, sending you way off track from where you're supposed to be and in different directions each time, no matter if the cannon is positioned at the same angle it was a try before, making reaching those hard areas a game of luck rather than skill; combine that with the double jump mechanic which randomly stops working at times after you come out of the cannon, even though you obviously need it to reach the ledge near you, and you've got yourself an almost impossible to finish game. Believe it or not, that was only the core of the problem, as there are many more issues such as your character randomly being transported on the other side of a wall or getting stuck for a few moments in the floor.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nThe resolution is for some reason fixed, which works fine if you play the entire game in window mode using only a portion of your screen, but if you do decide to go fullscreen, then that becomes a problem since the resolution is nowhere near HD. The map is relatively small and even though it's somehow divided into different areas, they all look alike; the black is always dominant and there are little things to differentiate one area from another, and because of that until you get familiar with the layout, it will be easy to get lost. The visual effects will always be around in some way, whether it's rain, fog or a combination of both, but they only make it harder to see, something that can become extremely annoying later in the game when you you have to jump from one platform to another and the fog or rain effects will cause you to miss your target.\n\n[b]Audio[/b]\nThis game sounds just as mediocre as it looks, there are few sound effects and the ones that are there feel like they've been extracted from a 90's basic effects pack. While that song playing the background as you jump around isn't necessarily bad, you will eventually grow tired of hearing it, and after the four or five hours you'll spend with the game if you're into getting all the achievements for returning to the moon seven times you will be glad it's over. Even though the game has a lot of issues aside from audio related ones, it would've been nice to have a background story narrated while playing, at least offering some details on why the alien that you control keeps jumping from the surface of the moon, or at least make some jokes about it.\n\n[b]Extras[/b]\nCompleting the game takes around 3-4 hours depending on how long you take to find everything and if you're using a guide or not, something that you will probably do at some point since there are no indications to what your objective is or where you should start looking for something, but even so most of the players will probably give up on this game in less than an hour, leaving you with a question if you really do want to complete it or not; I did, and I already regret wasting 4 hours of my life with this.\n\n[b]Verdict[/b]\nLunnye Devitsy is a bad idea with a worse execution, and that's the kind way to say it; the story or the purpose of the game makes no sense, the bugs and technical issues will sometimes make the game impossible to play and on top of that most of the players won't even know what to do without a guide since there are no indications whatsoever. You can, however, grab the game for only a few bucks, so if you're still interested you can try it without spending too much and give it your verdict.\n\n[u]Rating: 2.9[/u]","timestamp_created":1397846231,"timestamp_updated":1594986258,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5dulrvMCdfLPJQ=="}
