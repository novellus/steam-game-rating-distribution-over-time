      \ Created by Simon Mesnard (ASA, Catyph, Myha...) and magnified by an oriental-sounding\

      \ through space for 4 years, and finally landed on an uncharted moon, where\
      \ a mysterious hermit used to live alone. Bo\xEFnihi was his name, and he was\

      \ and the solving of didactic logical puzzles. This game is reminiscent of the\
      \ Myst series but also point and click games like Syberia, The Longest Journey...<br><br><img\

    review: "Bo\xEFnihi is a marvelous journey.\n\nA discovery. An initiation. Bo\xEF\
      nihi is without a doubt the most accessible of the games in the Black Cubes\
      \ saga. And like every previous opus, it can be played without having played\
      \ the other opuses. The Black Cubes is the most opened and interactive game's\
      \ series ever, which can be done in the order you want: over the finished games,\
      \ the player gradually reconstructs the backdrop that serves as the universe,\
      \ and can then return to the titles previously played with the newly acquired\
      \ knowledge of this world if he wants to understand more details.\n\nNo matter\
      \ which opus you start or end, therefore, the canvas ends up revealing all its\
      \ riches. Bo\xEFnihi is, of course, the last game created in the saga, but it\
      \ is still probably the best to start the adventure, while offering to the previous\
      \ players the last piece of puzzle that leads the Black Cubes in a pure apotheosis.\
      \ Bo\xEFnihi is a cult game that has become essential to the series since it\
      \ was released.\n\nBo\xEFnihi is above all an adventure game. Suddenly, many\
      \ of the gamers afraid of this category will flee, giving way to reckless players\
      \ who appreciate various intellectual challenges. But this game offers more\
      \ : here, exploration, dialogues, meticulous observations lead the player to\
      \ decipher a mysterious codex, and learn about the spectral host who attracted\
      \ him to this place. Displaying impressive graphics, this game is made with\
