It's better to lure them into the artillery spot, since it doesn't affect friendly units and since there's no warning flares, use your own guys as bait, the enemy blob will walk into the area of influence and bam, they'll either be suppressed long enough for your mortars/katyushas to finish them off, or they'll have to mass retreat.\n\nIL-2 Precision Bombing: this is what makes this commander a lot more useful than the anti-infantry commander, because it gives you a fighting chance against late game german heavy tanks. What i like to do is ram a T-34 into a big tank and immediately call in a bombing run, if you do it right, even the heaviest of tanks will fall. Do note that it costs 200 ammo for a single bombing run so you really need to land that shot. It's better to use it on small maps or maps that are shaped like a rectangle where you planes can come in faster from certain angles.\n\nKV-8 Flamethrower tanks: It's a big meatshield with a flamethrower, throw it into your army composition so they'll think twice about massing up blobs in your face.\n\nML-20 Howitzers: Yeah they're okay i guess :/\n\nStG blobs b-gone!!!","timestamp_created":1574187285,"timestamp_updated":1574230773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555352687835693359","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40Ondw+4CfIOn2wE="}
