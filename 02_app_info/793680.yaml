      /><br>Experience a weird, relentless solar tour in this randomly generated space
      rogue-lite. Travel from Planet X to Earth while fending off endless waves of
      attackers. What is the payload? A &quot;superstar&quot; nuclear bomb. What is
      the mission? To make her famous! Does it makes sense? Ask the &quot;scientist&quot;
      who built that thing!<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/793680/extras/HeaderStory.png?t=1593187281"
      /><br>While working on his latest nuclear bomb, Dr. Leopold had a revelation.
      He wasn''t creating a weapon of mass destruction; he was creating a nuclear
      superstar! Was it the radiation sickness or was Leopold always insane like this?
      Who knows and who cares? Now you must do his bidding and tour the solar system
      with Celine, his dear bomb. Who would not be thrilled to host the concert of
      a nuclear bomb under the control of a clearly insane scientist? Everybody it
      seems, that''s why they are all trying to destroy Leopold''s creation.<br><br><br><br><br><img

    reviews: "\u201CThe thing is, difficult or no, FSX is still really good fun. I\
      \ have a feeling this is the sort of game you could return to week after week,\
      \ learning its intricacies and formulating the best possible strategy for success.\
      \ I\u2019d like to see a few changes made, a few quality of life additions,\
      \ but it\u2019s hard not to recommend a game that\u2019s this much fun and looks\
      \ this good to boot. I suspect that the brilliantly named developer, Turbo Pelvis\
      \ 3000, will be one to keep an eye on in the future.\u201D<br>8/10 \u2013 <a\

      In a market saturated with clones or proposals lacking innovation Fission Superstar\
      \ X is a sign that when things do well the results are great and checking this\
      \ for yourself is an opportunity you should not miss.\u201D<br>8.3/10 \u2013\
