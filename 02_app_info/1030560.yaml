      \ bass that are needed to win on these venues. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLake Seminole\
      \ is found in Georgia, on the border with Florida with a climate that is ideal\
      \ for largemouth bass to grow huge with a current record of 16lb 4oz. A beautiful\
      \ venue that also contains longnose gar in excess of 30lb and channel catfish\
      \ in excess of 44lb.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLake Jordan is situated in Chatham\
      \ County, North Carolina and is a man-made reservoir. A picturesque landscape\
      \ may look idyllic but catching the biggest fish from its depths is no easy\
      \ task. Largemouth bass go to over 14lbs and channel catfish to a huge 41lb.\
      \  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith islands to explore, shorelines dotted with fallen\
      \ trees and submerged structure, the challenges this pack brings are high, but\
      \ the rewards are huge!"
