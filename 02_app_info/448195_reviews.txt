Plus with locomotives of any type that have TS PRO icon beside the DLC image that also means that it is harder to control but hopefully you should get a hang at it...\nAnd another example. lets set your just idling and not moving once on spawn or whatever you were doing that had to make you come to a complete stop... If you put the Reverser to full forward or full backwards and put the Regulator at maximum ( 100% ) the wheels on the locomotive will over spin and will display a warning saying \"Wheel Slip\" now that's not a bad thing that just means when you take off you just have to be mindful of the Throttle-( Regulator ) and/or the Reverser....\n\nAnd also one more thing! About vehicles with the TS PRO icon in the image of the DLC of any locomotive the Interior of the locomotive has a Special Feature! All controls inside the cab of the locomotive that have TS PRO icons are fully functional! Just for examples, Bell, Whistle, Levers, Knobs, Buttons, Switches, Windows, Doors, Gauges, Realistic Animations. and many more that are all functional and can be used or messed with but be careful you could screw the vehicle up and could cause damage. ;) Not that like you would want to damage a TS PRO locomotive and end up having a game error that takes you out of the current Session that you were in but i'm just saying, Be careful, Genital, Cautious, and possibly be aware if any issues you might encounter! Anyways... With TS PRO locomotives of any kinda the cab controls are fully functional! every single control within the cab works! and you can use them! :)\n\nThere are probably other things that the TS PRO vehicles come with but that's all I wanted to point out for people that are looking for interesting vehicles to drive... And to make a challenge for yourself as well. I fully Recommend these type of vehicles including this one with the TS PRO logo beside it! Have fun! and thanks for reading this long Review by me!\n\nFeel free to comment what you think in the comment section of this Review!","timestamp_created":1609358314,"timestamp_updated":1609359410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtfjS2vYCcsjwvgI="}
