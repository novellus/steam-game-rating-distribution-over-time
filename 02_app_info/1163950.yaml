    developer_response: 'We are sorry you''ve had this experience, would you mind
      telling us which sort of headset/controllers you were using as we''ve not seen
      these bugs during testing.


      As for the lack of content, we''ve got a lot of content that is already finished
      and will be coming through on patch 1.1 including 3 more npc types, 2 more minigames
      and some visual overhauls.


      Thank you for the critique, it is useful to catch these things early, this is
      our first release so we are still learning.'

    review: "This is another vr game that's really an unfinished tech demo.  Two of\
      \ the mini games in it kept glitching out.  One time I had a timer that just\
      \ stopped at 65 seconds and could no longer do anything else.  Dropping cows\
      \ made them disappear instead of dropping.  The burn down trees minigame didn't\
      \ register any tree being burned down, and I burned down all three different\
      \ types of them in the game.  Which brings me to how little there is in the\
      \ game.  There's just a handful of assets in the game so it has a painful cut/paste\
      \ feel to it.  And there is a lot of nothing.  The island feels like a low effort\
      \ generic island from a budget 90's game.  The intro video shows almost the\
      \ entire game.  I've circled and checked the island and I'm decently sure I've\
      \ seen all content there is in about half an hour.  Some textures will load\
      \ sooner in one eye than the other and that gives you the feeling that you have\
      \ vision problems.  I've never had that issue in any other vr game.  There's\
      \ no landing, you slide and that may result in strange launches around the area\
      \ which makes reading the instructions for the minigames it's own challenge.\
      \ \n\nThe flying mechanic IS interesting and it's one of those easy to do but\
      \ challenging to master movement systems.  I've gotten motion sickness in other\
      \ games but I was fine in this one.  That's the only redeeming feature in this\
      \ game.  It is fun, but there's just not much to do with it."
