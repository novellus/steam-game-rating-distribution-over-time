    review: Short, ties the loose ends from ace academy wonderfully. I really felt
      connection and emotion and I'm still glad kaori was my first pick. The jokes
      really hit, including a surprise appearance from a certain someone. These puns
      and the quality of this humor has me happily awaiting to play more from pixelfade.
      If you've played ace academy, play this, if you haven't.... what are you still
      doing here, go play ace academy and then play this as well.
