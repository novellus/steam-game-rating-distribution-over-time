Not only in resolution, but being able to see thickly painted brush strokes in real 3d, the shininess or matteness in areas of the paintings, plus many other very subtle details. It's something very unique to this app, I've tried some VR museum apps, and they fail to capture the texture and sheen of real paintings, those apps usually opt to use a generic bumpmap texture instead of actual scanning data. You can tell the devs really put effort into giving a real feeling art experience.\n\nThey actually addressed my previous review gripes in an update with more polish to the environment and in my opinion did a fantastic job, adding a level of surreal quality of the house being on a house sized island in the middle of a storm.\n\nI really recommend this if you are an art lover. Just know that this is not a game, it is an experience. Also note that it's not a huge show, but the works that are included are amazingly brought to life. I hope the developers continue to refine and release content more content this (and more paintings please!) It's very nice to be able to view art and go somewhere new when not being able to leave home.","timestamp_created":1560727885,"timestamp_updated":1608229167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596544742584228516","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+bP7uPYCcvjHwwE="}
