Cool!  This isn't the game for it.\n\nThe problem is that this is a puzzle game first,  and a Japanese teaching tool 2nd.    It adds a lot of gimmicks very quickly that just devolve into well,   puzzle game.    That,  sounds fine,  however it really breaks the pace of  learning. Even if you disregard the \"complete each level in optimal number of moves\".  Flipping around tiles doesn't necessarily help either as there are many puzzles that must be solved in a very specific way,  with no way of going back a few steps unless you restart.     \n\nThat constant slow down to figure out a puzzle, some of which are actually rather difficult, quickly takes the fun out of learning.   Kana are just a side to a puzzle.    So that's why this is a \"no\"   If you're here to learn Kana.  They also inexplicably put the English letter visible on  each slime kana.  I get that the slime is supposed to be transparent, and the English letter is on the back of each tile.  but imagine if a flashcard had the answer visible on the front.    Puzzle game first, Teaching tool second. \n\nIF you are looking for a puzzle game however,  by all means.  It's a fine puzzle game,  and can be replayed at least once,  due to Katakana and Hirigana.   \n\nBut as is,  it's just not a effective teaching aide over something like  Duolingo,  or lessons on Smile Nihongo.","timestamp_created":1609500023,"timestamp_updated":1609500200,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxIHs3vYCeKmvvwI="}
