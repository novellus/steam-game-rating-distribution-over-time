      \ Duty\xAE: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment\
      \ franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty\xAE franchise\
      \ features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation\
      \ fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive.<br><br>Fueling\
      \ this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise's new next-gen engine\
      \ delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining\
      \ the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.<br><br><strong>Single\
      \ Player Campaign</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Ten years after a\
      \ devastating mass event, America\u2019s borders and the balance of global power\
      \ have changed forever. As what's left of the nation's Special Operations forces,\
      \ a mysterious group known only as &quot;Ghosts&quot; leads the fight back against\
      \ a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power.<br><br></li><li>A\
      \ New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players\
      \ will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and\
      \ outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal\
      \ narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and\
      \ visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty\xAE\
      \ before.</li></ul><br><strong>Multiplayer</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"\
      ><li>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don't just create a class, you create a soldier,\
      \ a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can\
      \ change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body\
      \ type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty\xAE\
      \ game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations,\
      \ this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call\
      \ of Duty history.<br><br></li><li>New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer.\
      \ They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the\
      \ environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and\
      \ force players to change tactics and strategies.<br><br></li><li>Call of Duty:\
      \ Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system\
      \ now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations\
      \ or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over\
      \ objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition\
      \ from sprinting crouching to prone.<br><br></li><li>Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers\
      \ over 20 NEW Kill Streaks such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture\
      \ and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player\
      \ campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW\
      \ weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles. </li></ul><br><strong>Squads</strong><br><br><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in\
      \ the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer\
      \ experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom\
      \ soldiers  created and leveled up in multiplayer.<br><br></li><li>The load-out\
      \ choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior\
      \ of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he'll behave like\
      \ a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</li></ul>"
