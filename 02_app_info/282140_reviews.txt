If you liked moons of madness, you might like it.","timestamp_created":1610111603,"timestamp_updated":1610111603,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k6qI8fYCd8DEwQI="}
