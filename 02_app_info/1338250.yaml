    about_the_game: "Nohra is a beautiful and fast paced precision platformer where\
      \ you take control of Lupu, a newly awakened monster, and attempt to escape\
      \ from an abandoned lab. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreated by students of the DigiPen\
      \ Institute of Technology, this game is built with reaction and mechanical mastery\
      \ in mind where players are expected to recognize patterns in the scenes and\
      \ combine movements to advance. Set in a once proud laboratory now broken and\
      \ neglected, you play as a monster who has broken its containment. Freed of\
      \ your confinement for the first time in years, you scour the lab in search\
      \ of an exit, and maybe something more. Something other than freedom that calls\
      \ to you. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn your mission to find a way out, you will encounter\
      \ many dangers. All signs of the previous inhabitants are gone, but the defenses\
      \ protecting them are as vigilant as ever. However, with your ability to chain\
      \ dashes together and slow down time, the defenses set up in your way stand\
      \ no chance. Through sheer force of will and strength beyond normal creatures,\
      \ you will prove you are what you were designed by your makers long gone to\
      \ be, an apex predator.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n-\tChain your\
      \ dashes to wind through deadly traps.<br />\r\n-\tSlow down time and enjoy\
      \ the view of your beautiful prison.<br />\r\n-\tTime yourself, challenge your\
      \ friends, beat the developers!"
