It has a calming and soothing effect on me. Just being sucked in to the world of Thea is a joy in itself, but the gathering, crafting and building are great too. \nAlso the card based fights are cool, although I still have a lot to learn there.\nThe lore is presented via beautiful drawings and well written stories. \nI did play the first Thea and this is much the same in many aspects, just worked out better in my opinion. \nOnce I get further in I might add to this review but the game already is worth every cent I paid for it.","timestamp_created":1609977439,"timestamp_updated":1609977439,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.669805645942687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4scSI7fYCcbaSwQI="}
