It is like what you would expect from a student game jam except even buggier and lower quality than average even for that context.\n\nTLDR: This game is so poorly implemented that it is completely unprofessional and unworthy of public sale. No self respecting game developer should ever release a product whose quality control is this poor and careless.\n\nLook elsewhere if you want a Joust-like game. I promise you that you almost certainly won't enjoy this one. It's a shame too, since it could have been good in theory.","timestamp_created":1602257448,"timestamp_updated":1602257448,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxI3/hvUCe4vqpgI="}
