It reminded me a lot of the old school Apogee platformers like Commander Keen and Crystal Caves which I loved playing in the nineties. I struggled with it for about forty minutes, and while I do think it has a lot of potential, I must unfortunately give it a negative review, based on the small part of it that I was actually able to experience.\n\n- Jump controls are floaty and imprecise. I never felt like I had tight control over when my dwarf would jump, and where he would land.\n\n- The dwarf does not automatically grab onto ropes and ladders when he jumps toward them. Instead you must press the \"up\" key at exactly the right moment to make him grab them, otherwise he just falls straight down (usually landing on spikes or some other hazard). This makes it very difficult to complete stages where you must jump from one rope to another.\n\n- There is a single \"attack\" key that is used both for attacking monsters, and for breaking blocks. Unfortunately it is difficult to control the direction of the attack; the dwarf would often accidentally break the blocks underneath him (and fall into a death trap below) rather than attacking the monster next to him as I intended.\n\n- There are monsters that fly across the screen, and can pass through walls and floors to get to you. While it is sometimes possible to kill these monsters (if you can line up the attack correctly), there are often several of them coming at you from different directions, which makes it impossible to explore the map at a reasonable pace.\n\n- There are places where the dwarf gets stuck, and stops responding to the movement keys. I cannot tell whether this is a bug, or an intentional hazard to be avoided, but either way once you get stuck it means inevitable death once the flying monsters catch up to you.\n\nAs bad as all of that is, I could have dealt with it, if not for the absolute worst problem:\n\n- There are no checkpoints in the game, as far as I can tell. If you die, you get teleported back to the very beginning of the level, and everything is reset: all of the gates you had opened are closed again, and you have to restart from scratch, replaying the same parts over and over. This is really bad, especially in a game where most of the fun comes from exploring the huge, maze-like levels, but you never even get to see most of it.\n\nI don't know whether the developers intended for the player to have to complete an entire level without dying, but given the size of the levels, the poor controls, and the large number of hazards and monsters, I think it would be nearly impossible for all but the most hardcore players to get even halfway through the first level. At least, I do not have the patience for it, which is why I refunded the game. If the problems I have outlined in this review ever get fixed, I might consider buying it again.","timestamp_created":1595029905,"timestamp_updated":1595029905,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45pvMr/MCeK/7lQI="}
