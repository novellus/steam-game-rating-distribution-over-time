If the idea of calling balls & strikes appeals to you, without anything beyond that, then there's a good chance you'll enjoy the game. Personally, I didn't feel like it would have been worth the full normal price of $2.99, but for the sale price of 98 cents, it was worth a shot. \n\nThe graphics/animations could certainly use improvement. I could hypothetically see a multiplayer option where the pitcher attempts to trickle the umpire into get the calls wrong. Obviously, a home run derby option would be fantastic, but obviously those things are beyond the scope of Umpire Simulator. \n\nJust ask yourself if you're willing pay whatever the current price is based on what it *does* have, rather than what it *doesn't* have. I can't really recommend the game, but I can say that the program does what it claims to do.","timestamp_created":1534582189,"timestamp_updated":1534582189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vL2OpuUCcaHaqAE="}
