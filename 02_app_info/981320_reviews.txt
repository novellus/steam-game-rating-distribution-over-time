There are two different experiences. One you're on a stationary floating platform and watch a whole lot of nothing happen. The other one you're flying around and seeing a whole lot of nothing happen as well. Both experiences together took me a total of about 9 minutes. There are no interactions and you choose the experience via gaze (the floating balls to choose from are behind you on the Oculus SDK version). \n\nThe environment does look kind of like a Salvador Dali-inspired world. The flying air craft look like flying creatures. You're near a hill that looks like dinosaur bones with Swiss-cheese eggs on top. It's definitely trippy. This one thing happens but I have no idea how to even describe it. A lot of nothing happened in between. \n\nI just didn't get it. I feel like I wasted $1.49 USD. However, I think some people may appreciate the experimental art experience  (I think I'm being generous calling it that though).\n\n[b]Rate 4.5/10. Do you have to be on drugs to appreciate Whale Island?
