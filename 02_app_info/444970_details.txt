These psychoacoustical phenomenons called HRTF = head-related transfer functions.<br><br>Using these HRTFs, the SSC provides stereo and surround sound on virtual loudspeaker systems for any computer using regular headphones, also giving the choice between surround sound 5.1, 6.1 and 7.1.<br><br>Adapted from the professional production line, it is a software-based, virtual sound card, highly recommended not only for gamers but also for movie enthusiasts,  music lovers and for 360 \/ VR applications.<br><br>Differently to other applications, the SSC <strong>doesn't do so-called up-mixing or fake-surround processing<\/strong> what means to playback a stereo source on 5.1 or 7.1 anyway.
