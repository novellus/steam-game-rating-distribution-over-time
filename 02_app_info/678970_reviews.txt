As the game itself doesn't do much to rise above the bare minimum expected of an HOG, I'll be rather spare in my analysis.\n\nPositives:\n\n-Gameplay-  It didn't give me or my computer a virus.  It occupied a few hours of my time in an otherwise harmless fashion.\n\nMeh:\n\n-Music, graphics, puzzles, voice acting-  Bog-standard, with very little to distinguish them from any other HOG on the market.\n\nNegatives:\n\n-Plot, writing, dialogue-  Started out.......okay......but then rapidly got quite stupid in the final two thirds of the game.  It had a moderately original plot (famous inventors from history, as well as Coco bloody Chanel and a young Albert Einstein {the less said about the latter inclusions the better} are being threatened by an evil madman who wishes to harness their inventions for ill means and profit, profit, profit) compared to many HOGs, but it becomes so  actively stupid and inane that any goodwill earned by its originality is squandered by the overwhelmingly intense feeling of self-loathing that you will experience when you realize you are wasting precious time that could be spent on far better games.\n\nI ultimately can't recommend this game.  Your mileage may vary of course (it's not completely horrible after-all) but it sure doesn't rise above mediocre.\n","timestamp_created":1610130713,"timestamp_updated":1610130739,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ486nR8fYCdpLNwQI="}
