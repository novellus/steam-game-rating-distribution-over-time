The game feels more like an escape room than a traditional puzzle game. The use of ambiance and story telling drives home an unsettling feeling throughout the levels of the game. If you enjoy the darkness of the Lovecraftian genre then I'd highly recommend this game. \n\nPros:\n- Amazing ambiance\n- Intriguing puzzles that utilize VR mechanics\nMeh:\n- The puzzles are not especially difficult\nCons:\n- The game is short (Less than 4 hours)","timestamp_created":1610134531,"timestamp_updated":1610134531,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u+Xf8fYCdIHPwQI="}
