Even the easy starter zones are difficult. Expect to die a lot from predators, heat stroke, rapid dehydration, even freezing cold, until you can get established in a relatively safe sheltered location. Know how to survive on The Island before you attempt the challenge of a desert outback style wasteland.\n\n\tSome game hints that will prolong your survival on “Scorched Earth;”\n\n1. Avoid running unless trying to escape from the numerous predators. Running will overheat you using up water faster.\n2. As quick as you can, level up on fortitude and get thatch clothes. They will help you resist the heat.\n3. Water is going to be hard to find. Hitting a cactus with your fist or tools will help to refill your water meter. Take advantage of that mechanic given that berries are nearly useless as a water source.\n4. Water can be found on jug bugs. Walk up behind one and get a drink when prompted.\n5. Water veins are a good source for water. Walk into one and get a drink when prompted. Later, you will be able to craft a well to place over it so you can refill your containers, use irrigation plumbing with it, or water a Morellatop tame.\n6. Ponds full of water can also be found in the canyons or under the three Obelisks. However, like in a real desert, the presence of water attracts predators of all types in large numbers.\n7. Don’t waste your time or engram points on getting water skins or jars. They leak so quickly that by the time you need them, they are empty.\n8. There are places on the map that are naturally cooler then the rest of the surrounding terrain. Should you find one, consider constructing your campsite in that area.\n9. As soon as you can, learn how to craft a tent. It will provide portable shelter from adverse weather such as the heat wave and sandstorms. The silk for a tent can be found in some types of flowers.\n10. Tame a Jerboa. It will warn you of adverse weather approaching thus giving you a chance to get into shelter. Heat waves can kill with heat stroke. Sandstorms sap you and your tame’s stamina. Electrical storms will disable metal weapons,cryopods, and damage your electrical systems. \n11. Build an Adobe Hut. Adobe will protect you from a desert heat wave. Other then thatch, any other structure will function as an oven during the daytime.\n12. Craft Desert Armor. Unlike Gillie Armor, wearing a full suit of Desert Armor will cut your water usage in half as it insulates you from the extreme heat.\n13. Your most useful early tame will be a Morellatop. They are great at gathering resources such as wood, thatch, cactus sap, silk, berries. They can also hold their own against a predator when ridden. Best of all, they can serve as a portable water source when they have water in their hump. That can be filled by taking them into a pond, next to a well, or during a rare desert rainstorm. Find one alone to tame as all of their buddies will attack you.\n14. As usual, rare resources can be found on dangerous mountain tops and in caves. Some metal and pearls can be found along the canyon riverbed. Be aware that some oddly colored boulders may come to life and flatten you with a boulder.\n15. The most sought after tame will be a Wyvern. The range attack of a lightning can be most devastating compared to the fire breathers and poison spitters. A saddle is not required to ride on one. They are a fast way to get around on a map. However, getting one is going to be a real challenge as you cannot tame a wild Wyvern, you have to steal an egg from a nest and hatch it, then steal highly perishable wyvern milk from a knocked out female.\n16, The drops can supply with useful items such as an Oil Pump which can be placed over an oil vein.\n17. Numerous Explorer Notes are now on this map. Wait until you have a good flier such as an Argy or Wyvern to level the both of you up quickly.\n\nGood luck surviving and, as always, be prepared for the unexpected.","timestamp_created":1530312229,"timestamp_updated":1609863436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.716584622859954834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7tLV6fYCcL7XpAE="}
