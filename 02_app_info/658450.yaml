      \ and adorable little creatures known as Buddies!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVisit the\
      \ Hatchery to choose your Buddy, and bring it to one of the Isle's lovely beaches\
      \ to fill its belly with delicious fruit! The more fruit your Buddy eats, the\
      \ more points you will earn.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut remember: Buddies only have\
      \ a limited amount of time to forage, and they don't like sour fruits. Eating\
      \ a sour fruit will cause your Buddy to lose time. Also, some fruits are too\
      \ big to be eaten and will stun your Buddy if they land on its head. Be sure\
      \ to dodge these obstacles!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse your points to unlock and\
      \ purchase eggs to hatch new Buddies, and customize your Buddies with cool markings\
      \ and colorful wristbands.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat are you waiting for? Come\
      \ play!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay:<br />\r\nFruit will fall from the trees\
      \ overhead and it is your job to help the buddies catch them.<br />\r\nYou will\
      \ control your favorite Lil' Buddy and run back and forth in an arcade style\
      \ fashion trying to catch as much fruit as you can. <br />\r\nYou need to catch\
      \ as much fruit as you can while avoiding dangerous obstacles like coconuts\
      \ which will hurt your Lil' friends.<br />\r\nThe more fruit you catch, the\
      \ more points you earn; which you can use to purchase cool things from the shop\
      \ or unlock new levels on the island."
