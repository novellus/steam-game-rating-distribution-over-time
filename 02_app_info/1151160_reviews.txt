Not really a game, and far from being playable. Although the setting is promising, there's a long way to go.\n\nFeatures:\n- item rarity system\n- levelup system (by working the field)\n- Job assignments to crew, with what to harvest and not (e. g. only mine stone and iron, not copper and gold)\n- manual trade system\n- Building works (but feels like dragging the plans through pudding and the next moment through vacuum and reverse, so quite a fiddly issue)\n- Fights work, but are in no way difficult\n- Crewmates may die of starvation or dehydration\n- interactions with different buildings/members/parts work, but the process is unnecessarily complicated (scroll through menu, press E for a second to select action)\n- No way to increase your crew as of now\n\nBugs encountered in about 5 hours of gameplay:\n- Random inventories/storages get emptied or lose items when saving and loading, which may break your game\n- your mates don't occupy buildings until you restart the game\n- your gatherers do gather like hell, but don't push their stuff to inventories (which starves your crew to death)\n- your builders can stuck, trying to get items from storage but never getting them\n- some buildings you can't build yourself as their inventory is too small to fit all necessary items\n- a lot of items have no purpose (yet), but occupy valuable storage space\n- storages can be overbooked, either by picking stuff up (your own) or by getting something pushed to by your crew\n- No way of telling the AI which storage to use for what\n- Wells can't store more than 2 helpings of water; you need at least 3 to have you and your crew hydrated\n- Wells only fill during rain\n- Drinking from wells only fills 10% of your hydration level per helping\n- The windmill orientation is all wrong, with it lying flat on the ground, blades rotating like a ceiling fan\n- Can't tell your crew how much to produce of any item, you feel a bit like the sourcerers apprentice\n\nAll in all: In the current state (v0.07) it's not worth any money.","timestamp_created":1597858273,"timestamp_updated":1597858304,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50205761194229126","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwgNrxg/QCd428nAI="}
