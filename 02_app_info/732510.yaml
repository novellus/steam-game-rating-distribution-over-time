    about_the_game: Rise of the Foederati is an online, massive multiplayer strategy
      game that combines real-time strategy with turn-based combat. You play as a
      leader of one of the many tribes surrounding the Roman borders in mid-5th century
      AD, and your objective is to lead your warriors into raids, skirmishes and battles
      to survive. More important than winning battles, however, is to wade through
      the intricacies of managing your warband, as your soldiers will support your
      leadership as long as you bring them loot and glory. A weak leader, however,
      may face discontent warriors that will desert, abandon formations, disrespect
      your commands, or even challenge you to take control of your group!<br><br><strong>Spine-chilling,
      realistic immersion</strong><br><br>What you hear is what it is. A knife stab.
      A shield blocking an incoming sword. The jingling sound of coins inside a bag.
      Nearly every sound you hear in Rise was recorded in studios to be as realistic
      as possible. The eerie feeling before a battle now feels more tense than ever,
      with dynamic music that shifts with a battle's progress.<br><br><strong>Deep,
      intricate, and tactical gameplay</strong><br><br>Witness your soldiers improve
      as they wage wars with you.<br><br><strong>Historical accuracy</strong><br>The
      Dark Ages (or, more accurately, Migration Period) as you have never seen before.
      Rise of the Foederati has historical accuracy down to the most minimal detail.
      From the pronounciation of one of the dozen extinct languages of the period
      to the design of warriors' armaments, the experience you have is as historically
      accurate as it gets.<br><br><strong>Politics paved with power and casualties</strong><br>An
      ever-changing political scene awaits you. Within each swing of the pendulum
      of power, you'll be forced to make decisions that may have long-term repercussions.
      For example, if a huge force from a previously neutral tribe attacks your own,
      it may require your warband to ally itself with old enemies against this new
      threat.<br><br><strong>Rally your friends, raid your enemies, protect your tribe*</strong><br>Hundreds
      of players are present at the same time in Rise. Your movements and battles
      are present in real-time; there are no instances in the world. Your actions
      make a mark in the world. The more people you bring to your side, the bigger
      your actions are.<br><br>* To be added during Early Access
