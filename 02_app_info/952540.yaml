    review: 'So i just finished this huge pile of shit and i have to say.... do NOT
      buy this "game".

      it is by far the worst rpg i''ve ever played.... even a fart in the face has
      a better story than this crap.


      playing this feels like i imagine being drugged by strangers which constantly
      fuck you in your asshole and you have no clue whats going on the whole time...


      if you want more fun than i had with this game get some rusty nails and a hammer
      and hit them under your fingernails. even that would have a better gameplay.
