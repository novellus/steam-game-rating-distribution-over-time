      \ is a two-car diesel multiple unit (DMU) built by Alstom as part of their Coradia\
      \ family of multiple units. The LINT sub-class \u2013 of which the BR 648 is\
      \ part of - stands for \u2018Leichter Innovativer Nahverkehrstriebwagen\u2019\

      \ for 115 passengers, this DMU has all it needs to manage the more rural scene\

      \ and wheelchair accessible facilities. The floor itself has been designed to\
      \ absorb and reduce sound that comes from the diesel engines and the exhaust\
      \ heat from the engines is used to heat the cabin of the unit. Some of the seating\
      \ is also raised higher than the low floor to distance passengers from the noise\
