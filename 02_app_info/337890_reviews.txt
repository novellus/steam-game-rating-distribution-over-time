For the current price (75% discount), totally worth it, for the full price, maybe not so much.\n\nSo, this is an out-of-the-blue prequel to the previous Dysfunctional Systems VN (Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to manage chaos). Most of what it does is world-building.\n\nSince it is a kinetic VN, there is no branching, hence the replay value is nonexistent.\n\nArt is serviceable, but not great. Music is not annoying but not particularly memorable either. Writing is a little stilted compared to the first installment, but it's fine for what it is (i.e. exposition dump). The philosophy it kind of tries to push is slightly annoying, but probably that's the point [spoiler]since it gets subverted by the end.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, this is at the same time encouraging and disappointing for the fans of the first installment. It's a mediocre kinetic VN set in an interesting multiverse, but here we mostly get to see the boring parts.\n\nOverall, if you're interested in anything I described, it's a fine 1.5-2 hour read. But it's not something you'd really want to read unless you're somewhat invested in the first game in the series.\n\nThis does make me hope that other (hopefully more interesting) installments will happen eventually, so I'll give this a slightly begrudging thumbs up.","timestamp_created":1594278383,"timestamp_updated":1594278395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x7eZmfMCc47+kwI="}
