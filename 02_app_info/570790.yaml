      \ Field and many more!<br />\r\nMake your town thrive with all these useful\
      \ buildings!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can also keep wild animals as pets too!<br\

      \ in hunting,<br />\r\nand even allow pioneers to ride on their backs!<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nAs you progress in colonizing the land, you may obtain &quot;Invention\
      \ Cards&quot; along the way.<br />\r\n&quot;These cards provide various effects,\
      \ such as shortening your farm harvesting time cycle,<br />\r\nand increasing\
      \ the fishing time and etc. &quot;<br />\r\nThere are over 290 cards in the\
      \ game! Use them wisely!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3 Game Modes are in the game.<br\
      \ />\r\nFirst, there is the Story Mode, where you set out with the help of your\
      \ lovely assistant, Jessica, to build your dream town from scratch, overcome\
      \ all sorts of obstacles, and aim to develop into a city.<br />\r\nThen, there\
      \ is the Survival Mode, where you can choose from 5 levels of difficulty to\
      \ suit your pace of game play.<br />\r\nLastly, the Free Mode has no Game Overs,\
      \ and you can use whichever Invention Cards you have obtained freely.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nYou choose how you want to build your frontier town!"

    review: I bought this game because the ad for it looked like it was a good game.
      Sad to say the game play is nothing like that. The User Interface jams up A
      lot and is not easy to use, also it has some glitches, I had to restart the
      game like three times thanks to that. I would NOT recommend this game to anyone!
