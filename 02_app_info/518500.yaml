    review: "Sentai Filmworks is proving to be quite interesting by bringing anime\
      \ to Steam; although I'll never buy another Blu-Ray from them again since they\
      \ won't get rid of their cheap, screen-covering yellow subtitles, it sure doesn't\
      \ hurt to rent a movie on a stormy Tuesday night, and being able to customize\
      \ the subtitles in Steam's video player is a neat touch.\n\nTo be straightforward,\
      \ Loups=Garous is a solid B- movie; low-budget and derivative with no liberties\
      \ taken, but still worthy of your time if you don't have much else to do. There's\
      \ no outstanding faults in either the dub or sub, but not much in the way of\
      \ original content either. Despite that, there still exists a fair degree of\
      \ care in the presentation of the movie's themes, with the top two being totalitarianism\
      \ & man's \"suppressed monster\".\n\nBackground art and music is what we've\
      \ come to expect from Production I.G.- sublime, world-building, and decadent.\
      \ Would probably be even more remarkable if given enough time.\n\nAnimation\
      \ quality is a mixed bag; the design is representative of the source material's\
      \ intentionally lifeless atmosphere, but translates poorly to anime, since everybody\
      \ is, well.... lifeless. The lack of detail in even the most basic shots undermines\
      \ what the narrative has to offer, which makes it difficult to root for anybody\
      \ currently in a scene. Sometimes I feel as if this would be better as live-action,\
      \ especially when it gets edgy in a few parts.\n\nIn spite of Loups=Garous great\
      \ themes, it's definitely not character driven. Most, if not all characters\
      \ in the film seem like flat, pre-established archetypes too often seen in modern\
      \ I.P.-  \n\n-Ayumi's a stoic, anti-societal kuu-dere\n\n-Haduki's the clumsy,\
      \ overly anxious type that has trouble expressing her emotions\n\n-Mio's a half-baked\
      \ Mary Sue that appears out of nowhere in the beginning to assist the characters\
      \ with superb hacking skills, having no in-depth explanation as to how she acquired\
      \ those skills, for which Loups=Garous relies on the audience to make assumptions\
      \ about her character\n\nIt also doesn't help that Sentai Filmworks labels Ayumi\
      \ as a guy, going so far as giving \"him\" a male voice actor in the dub and\
      \ even retaining that gender-swap in the subtitles, when said character is a\
      \ definite female in original Japanese, regardless of character design. It might\
      \ of been an okay marketing decision for their Blu-Ray, but it's still glaringly\
      \ misleading.\n\nAlthough the characters felt unoriginal, I certainly didn't\
      \ hate them. They carried the movie fairly well when they had to, and managed\
      \ to pull off the sentiment charm when it was required. Not everyone will feel\
      \ the same way though.\n\nThere's nothing wrong in expecting Production I.G.\
      \ to go all out when they make anime movies (since they definitely nailed Break\
      \ Blade & Eden of the East), but even if corners are cut, movie's like this\
      \ can still be worth looking at, if you're willing to give 'em a chance."
