Its so simple, but executed so well. It has no slow movement button though. It also has a nice bunch of creepy and cryptic lore.\n\nI also recommend checking out ZeroRanger if you like Monolith.","timestamp_created":1579989427,"timestamp_updated":1610046884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwirmR7/YCeLeJ7gE="}
