    review: 'I''m giving a thumbs up because the game is so cheap but I was debating
      this as the game could be better.

      The idea of this indie game is walking around  a big house to find gems which
      to some people sounds boring but I think the "hide and seek" collecting can
      be fun and relaxing but this  game needs a few improvements.

      1. walking is too slow there should be a sprint button

      2. All you do is walk over to gems and pick them up, you should be able interact
      with things around you and gems should be better hidden.

      3.  The game is too dark , making sure it''s on higher graphics settings helps
      but then potato gamers are left out so adding a torch would help.

      4. Game needs more substance , add in a great storyline like a murder investigation  or
      add in tomb raider or silent hill style puzzles in fact having a difficulty
      setting for a range of puzzles would be also  great.

      5. Game is too short even for the price one or two more levels would help.

      So overall a relaxing game that could be much better; feels unpolished but fine
      for a relaxing playthrough.'
