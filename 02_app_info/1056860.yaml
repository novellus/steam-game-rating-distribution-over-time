    about_the_game: "Time Break is a game set in an alternate reality where you are\
      \ a police officer training to serve the public with your standard issue time\
      \ slowing and rewind watch. Assess, resume time, and stop the crime. Keep the\
      \ city safe from a deadly group against the manipulation of time. <br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery level will start in stopped time. This allows you\
      \ to survey the environment. Take in what crime is happening and what you can\
      \ use to stop it. Maybe it's throwing a trash can lid at a robber or exploding\
      \ a can of spray paint with a lighter. Each level is filled with multiple solutions\
      \ to solve each scenario. When you're ready, resume the flow of time and stop\
      \ the crime using whatever you can in the environment. If you fail, the level\
      \ automatically rewinds time back to the start of the crime. Try and try again\
      \ until you successfully stop the crime.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTime Break\
      \ is a student game, made in about 7 months, through the University of Utah\
      \ Entertainment Arts and Engineering Program."
