Dropping items to activate things is clunky and doesn't work well. Especially when it is the action button. Which also talks to people. So you give an item to someone you're going to run into problems over and over. \n\nThird, this game does not go true full screen. The taskbar still shows at the bottom, the game is still windowed. \n\nAll the hype in the comments would lead me to believe these things wouldn't be as they are.","timestamp_created":1577081424,"timestamp_updated":1577081424,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiJnYmO8Cc9qk5gE="}
