    short_description: Create then experiment with your artificial intelligent life
      form in HOUND, an open-world simulation god game (kind of). Not a game in the
      traditional sense, HOUND is more like the science experiment that gives Elon
      Musk nightmares.

      \ game. The concept is cool and the flexibility is extremely high. I played\
      \ it for a while but got stuck for following reasons. Since this game is under\
      \ EA status, players who are afraid of BUGs should wait for a while.\n\n1. The\
      \ user interface still need to be improved. On my 14 inch laptop, words are\
      \ too small to be recognized clearly. \n2. Guide needs to be improved as well.\
      \ I understand that developers want players to explore functions themselves,\
      \ and pressing Q to see instructions is a really good design. But I think helping\
      \ a beginner to make a jellyfish is necessary since it can prevent him or her\
      \ from giving up. So I would like to see how to make a jellyfish right after\
      \ I learn basic operation, intead of after I press Q in \"Molecule Editor\"\
      \ and press other several buttons. Also, the notofication of hidden panels in\
      \ corners are not very clear. Maybe it is because of my 14 inch screen.\n3.\
      \ The hardware requirement seems to be high. At least, on my i5-7200u+940mx\
      \ laptop, the game can not run smoothly. I need to wait for half a second after\
      \ I click every button. I can play it on desktop, but I still hope to see further\
      \ optimization.\n4. [b]  A BUG!!!\t[/b]. In first few minutes, I can move around\
      \ with WASD C Space. However, after I name my world, I can't move any more.\
      \ It causes many troubles when tracking or observing a creature. I am running\
      \ the game on newest stable WIN10.\n\nThanks again for such interesting game.\
      \ I am not sure whether it is a right place to report BUGs. I am looking forward\
      \ to see improvements and I am willing to help the game become better."
