Further, there is a good music assortment\nbuilt into this product. And the character and room designs\nare showing a lot of work on details. There is definitely done\nquality and fantasy. I appreciate it. And by the way, I found \nplaying the string instrument is too high in scoring precision \nfor me. This is a hurdle that a lot of people can not climb. \nI would say, 75 percent accuracy would be enough for the \ndifficulty. If it is that high, as it is, it brings very soon no \ninterest in trying again. But all the rest of this product \nis good founded work. It shows a lot of good effort.\nSo I recommend it for this.\nJune 2020.","timestamp_created":1592021978,"timestamp_updated":1592021978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwufH51fICe5zcjQI="}
