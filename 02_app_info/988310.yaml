      \ has all of this and more. However, Viola is not a passive RPG. Attacks require\
      \ the player to time their button taps, and to unleash spells you'll have to\

      \ /><br>On top of being an RPG, Viola: The Heroine's Melody is a side-scrolling\
      \ platformer! With wall jumps and triple jumps, springs and cannons, you can\
      \ explore each level and uncover every little secret. Find more potions, or\
      \ gems to equip and customize each character's stats! And don't worry about\
      \ random encounters: each monster is visible in the level. Don't feel like fighting?\

      \ /><br>Music is key to Viola. Every character in your party has their own instrument,\
      \ and they'll eagerly play along with the songs you learn along your journey.\
      \ All the songs have their own magical effect, like summoning a bird, creating\
      \ a magical campfire, unlocking secret pathways... If you've ever played a Zelda\

      \ /><br>Viola: The Heroine's Melody is about Viola's journey. It's one of strange\

      \ But Viola's journey isn't just about going home: it's also about learning.\
      \ That it's okay not to be perfect. That it's okay to grieve. That you deserve\
