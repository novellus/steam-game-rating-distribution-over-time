Walking around the scene to spectate the diorama-like levels from different perspectives is great fun and adds a unique layer to the puzzle solving gameplay. The game is quickly learned, but will keep you on your toes: The level selection covers everything from simple puzzles to challenging brainteasers and because this game is shipped with a level editor and the option to play other players creations, we can look forward to an ever-growing selection of levels.\n\nThe level editor that comes with the game is super intuitive to use: You just drag and drop your level pieces into the scene and you can quickly switch from building mode to testing mode. Seeing your creations coming to live in VR within minutes is a fantastic experience on its own. For those reasons I found, that building your own levels in this game is similarly fun as to play them.\n\nTwiggles VR comes highly recommended. For me it was worth every cent!","timestamp_created":1540120401,"timestamp_updated":1540120401,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51754385232925415","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4xoqVy+YCcIeLrQE="}
