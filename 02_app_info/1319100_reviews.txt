In this new apears you took a lot out of it, to try some of arcade to kids 4 years age, and yet not stay so easy, and lost the wealth that was( think I one of think that made the MoonShot game Great).\nThis new orbitou tlaws have HOrrible controls if compared to the old MoonShot\nAnd What is this DISC dust effect from the wheels of the tanks?!\nThe Visual Effects Also already was Very Good /o/.. Please Dont change the vfx team.\n\n\n\nWell,\nI dont know if you are asking. apologies for something but...\nwhat I think just was Missing in the first moon shoot to a new Game like this \"orbit outlaws\"... To be a Amazing game.\n\n- More options of tanks and \"weapons\" \"parts\" \"adds\"(what you already are doing in this new game, Nice!)\n- Improve a little the 3d details of the models(what also you are doing in this new game, very Nice), textures may be, \"cartoon\" language already solve a lot of this, and is Good language to a game where the models in most will apear smalls on screen, pollutes less visually.\n\nAND\n- A Campaign Mode, even if simple, but Levels, Bosses,.. and may be some other enemies types,(what could be just the tanks with different colors and weapon configurations).\n\n\n- PLease, Dont change the controls to this new game, for me it is horrible, compared with the wealth that was the oldest in Moon Shoot.\n\n- Where are the breaking planets???! Why did you take it off?!\n-Where Are just One screen with all the players?!?!, this new are splitting in severals screens, when to a local game where the tanks in most of time is in nearrealy Dont Need , stay worse, and yet this way(splitting the screens) are cuting some of players some times.\n at least give a option to choose the screen type, if split or uses ONE screen where dynamically embraces all players(this Much Better to this type of game).\n\n- other, the time of things of the oldest,.. was better, calm, in right time, you Saw what was happening and gave importance, value to these,.. this new, is more fast, reflex may be the actual modern times where almost nothing have importance, value, and almost all people have anxiety.\n\n- Dont tranform the sound vfx in a war of fluffy plastic pieces,\nenough today kid toys real life.\n\n\n- and this last is more personal...\nNice the ideia of differents pilots but, this star fox style .. mix of cartoon hyper cute with serious characters.... : / ?\nsomething Just Cute, like \"Lovers in the dangerous spacetime\" https://store.steampowered.com/app/252110/Lovers_in_a_Dangerous_Spacetime/ ,\n Or Just Serious,\nis much more well defined and atractive, at least for me.\n\nWell, hope you understand, and that are a constructive criticism, and brings great Good things to your game,\nor also Mine if continue in the Line of the first Very good Moonshoot.\n\nRegards!!\nRicmage","timestamp_created":1608984872,"timestamp_updated":1609286115,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ466u72PYCdd2uvQI="}
