Another big issue with the game is tone: it tries to be a hardcore survival game but often doesn't feel like that at all.\n\nThe goal: survive on a deserted isle - perhaps not as cool as survive the apocalypse like with Cataclysm: DDA or Caves of Qud but sure, I'm right there with you! Wayward is a hardcore/realistic experience that requires you to juggle and micro-manage a lot of things at the same time with death looking over your shoulder with every step but then... you can tame a giant rat to be your friend by giving it food? Wait, what?! That's so tone-deaf that it takes me right out of the experience.\n\nUnlike most roguellikes, a lot of the controls are mouse-based - which should be a blessing but instead hinders the experience compared to a veteran player in most roguelikes that can perform complex actions in just a few memorized keyboard commands.  Instead, a lot of actions are triggered by either pressing the \"command menu\" key or a \"quickbar slot\" key - which then brings up list of sub-commands.\n\nThis all would be fine but these subcommands are number-based so where in [i]literally any other roguelike[/i] you would press [c]onsume -> [item key], in Wayward you need to first place an item on a quickbar slot, then hit that slot key, then select from a drop-down menu with the mouse. Even if the item is already on a slot, all subcommands are numeric so you have to go through the list every time to see the number rather than [b]just press \"c\" to consume[/b], for example. Or do it all with the mouse instead - not great.\n\nI haven't explored deep into the game, mostly because the core gameplay is pretty unappealing to me right now. There's a lot to do just to get by and nothing of it is as easy to perform as if it were a more traditional, text-based roguelike (which, ironically enough, are known for their bad UIs). Apart from that, there is zero character creation (other than cosmetics, name, etc) and I haven't come across anything obviously interesting in the game world other than a higher-quality version of grass.\n\nI wasn't expecting much when I came in - all I wanted was a survival roguelike with minimally modern graphics and user interface, yet Wayward still left me disappointed. Even if there were a huge amount of interesting content in the game (which I haven't seen a hint of, so far), the sheer drudge of keeping myself alive by struggling with the UI for every little thing puts a hamper on whatever amount of fun I'd be trying to have with this game.\n\nI really hope the developers rethink some of the fundamentals here but looking at their public roadmaps, I don't remember \"interface overhaul/major improvements\" being a priority.","timestamp_created":1609549155,"timestamp_updated":1609721154,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwnfG25fYCcYTJvwI="}
