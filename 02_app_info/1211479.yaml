      \ Lake Constance: Schaffhausen \u2013 Kreuzlingen route!<br><br>The Lake Constance:\
      \ Schaffhausen to Kreuzlingen route is part of the Swiss \u201CSeelinie\u201D\
      \ (Lake Line) from Schaffhausen to Rorschach, which is the Swiss part of the\
      \ train-ring around the Bodensee (Lake Constance), and located in the Thurgau\
      \ region. This route features the stunning part from Kreuzlingen to Schaffhausen.\
      \ <br><br>The route as it is today was built in 4 segments from 1869 to 1895.\
      \ Initially, there were 3 Swiss train companies who had built routes in this\
      \ area. One after another, the NOB (Swiss Northeastern Railway) took over the\
      \ separate parts and united them. In 1902, when Switzerland started nationalising\
      \ its railway companies, SBB took over the route. They started electrifying\
      \ the route in 1928, but because of its status as a branch line, it took until\
      \ 1969 to complete electrification. <br><br>In the 1990s, the SBB slowly started\
      \ decommissioning the route, but in 1996 the MThB (Mittel-Thurgau-Bahn or Central\
      \ Thurgau Railway) took over the route and started modernising both the tracks\
      \ and the trains. Then in 2002, the SBB subsidiary \u201CThurbo\u201D took over\
      \ the route as well as most of the rolling stock.<br><br>Today, the route is\
      \ operated with modern multiple units, running every half an hour in both directions.\
