Ignoring that *and thats asking alot*, it doesn't work. You can scroll through the menu, and nothing more happens. This is a lazy and terrible port, do not buy.\n\nI will remove this review if the devs get this working, this *WAS* a fine product once upon a time, now it's a cash grab for a game that does not function.\n\nThis review is based on a Windows 10, modren machine.\n\nEdit: ok so I got it to actually WORK, however only with a controller, and the prompts are PlayStation prompts. Clearly a rubbish port and the devs need to properly fix this.\nAlso for the old school of you that used to own this back in the day, none of the Janette Lee videos are present, this is a stripped down version of the original.","timestamp_created":1439836562,"timestamp_updated":1439850209,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.695189952850341797","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47tPwns8Cfb2LQw=="}
