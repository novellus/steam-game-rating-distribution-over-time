The game is interesting as a concept, but as another reviewer noted, the game has not been completely translated into English and so suddenly puzzle text appears in Polish (?).  The text at times is cut off of the cards and text size in the journal is incredibly small.  It is not clear what is to be done and so a lot of clicking is involved.  I don't mind that necessarily, but in the second game section, I thought I was going to a different room and I ended up leaving the second scenario unfinished and I could not go back without starting the entire game over since there is just one auto save.  All of the above made for an unenjoyable experience.","timestamp_created":1608261478,"timestamp_updated":1608261478,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547563791275024414","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw59T2ufYCcNiLuwI="}
