Overall skill makes no sense, for example how is Cotchin over 10 overall less than dusty. Players asking for stupid amounts of money for contracts so within one season you dont have a team. The rucks constantly winning the goal kicking. There was an 19 year old who had already played 400 games and kicked 700 goals. How can you charge anyone for this game when it is not complete. If the creator wants this game to be good just contact me and ill help them out for free. I just want a AFL game that is good. The last good one was in 2007. The game has a lot of potential I just think the developers need help with basic things that should be in the game.","timestamp_created":1592730511,"timestamp_updated":1592730511,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46dyI6/ICceCljwI="}
