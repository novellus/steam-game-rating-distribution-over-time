    review: "I don't recommend this game, this game feels like a mobile/pad game.\
      \  Your ship shoots automatically and you move by using the mouse only, I should\
      \ also mention there is no controller support.  There are also barely to no\
      \ settings except music. sound, and preset visual quality.\n\nThe concept is\
      \ there, I like how theree is online co-op, not too many shumps nowawdays with\
      \ online capabilities.  Too many \"if only...\"'s with this game...\"if only\"\
      \ this where fleshed out more and were turned into an actually shump, with proper\
      \ controls and more variety in everything, this game would be really great.\
      \  \n\nI hate saying this, but I honestly feel you shouldn't purchase this game.\
      \  It falls short in many areas and does not justify the current price tag.\
      \  If you really want the game, get it at 75% off or something, not at 50%,\
      \ 40%, 30%, etc...not worth it."
