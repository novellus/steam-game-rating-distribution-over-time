    review: "4 incompetent and bored 'terrorist' including one who [spoiler] refuses\
      \ to intially commit any acts of violence [/spoiler] kidnap two US soldiers\
      \ and demand that the US frees prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. Somehow they think\
      \ that the US will actually give in to these demands before a SWAT team or Navy\
      \ SEALs kick in their door and ventilate them. \n\nThe best way to describe\
      \ this movie is bland. The attempts to humanize the terrorists fails as the\
      \ actors seem uninspired and so does the dialog. A lot of it is just the basic\
      \ \"The US attacked first\" and \"The US has killed Muslims\". It failed to\
      \ bring an understanding of the mindset of a terrorist or why someone would\
      \ do this. This could have been an interesting character study but the script\
      \ just wasn't there. \n\nThe only scene I enjoyed was when [spoiler] when after\
      \ one terrorist murders another for having relations with his sister (who is\
      \ also a terrorist), she screams \"Call 911\", because it's not like there's\
      \ a kidnapped hostage here or anything... [/spoiler]. Everything else was boring\
      \ and dull."
