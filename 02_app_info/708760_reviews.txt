The graphics looked good in the preview but the gameplay is very unpolished. Some TLC could make this game fun but it's still a long way from being there. It looks like the last update was in December '19, so I don't know where they are going with it.\n\n Needed Additions that would make this game decent/work: \n\n-Better hand movements to tap game board for more cards in Blackjack. \n  (right now you have to hover over a button that takes a second or two to select \"hold\" , \"split\" ect)\n- Listed #'s near cards to show you current hand amount.\n- A listing of multi-player lobbies to enjoy games online \n-better placement of roulette chips for the selection you want \n- Better integration of the wording/lettering for directions, ect. it looks so out of place.","timestamp_created":1598401883,"timestamp_updated":1598401883,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t6WLlPQCcZrknQI="}
