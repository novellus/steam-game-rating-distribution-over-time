    review: 'I''m the kind of guy that''ll give every fighting game a shot. Went in
      with an open mind on this one, but it didn''t quite pan out.


      For one thing, there''s no option to change control inputs, which is frustrating
      especially since one of the default gamepad inputs on 1P overlaps with an input
      on 2P. Since there''s no training mode, you have to go into versus 2P mode if
      you wish to lab/try things out, and as you can guess that can make things a
      chore. Even an option to just disable 2P inputs would''ve helped things a bit.


      The game itself has a basic fighter system, and while I can forgive jank, sometimes
      it gets intrusive in this game. Sometimes there''s moves that just whiff completely,
      like Driver''s stand LK missing on 1P side on some characters. It''s also a
      bit cumbersome that very little of the games controls are explained to you.
      There''s a menu that lists special moves, but it''s only for one character in
      the game, Mike; Everybody else you have to just wing it. There''s two characters,
      Boxer and Ethan, who have a strange control/assist system, and Boxer jumps with
      a button(?). And three Chun-Li clones who I assume have other moves but all
      I could figure out was Lightning Legs. Other than Mike, Driver/Robo Kyle (they''re
      the same character swapped basically) I could figure out a bit of, and they
      were actually pretty fun.


      This game actually has a few fun ideas going for it, and I found myself labbing
      some Driver/Kyle combos for a bit. As a program it ran well all things considered,
      even for my less than stellar setup right now. But the problems in the game
      just get too much in the way to recommend. Even some small fixes could help
      this game a lot.'
