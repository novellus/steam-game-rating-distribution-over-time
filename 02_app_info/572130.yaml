    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift[/h1]\n\nYou can view my gameplay &\
      \ review here: https://youtu.be/xjIu0eM-ycI\n\nI'm surprised this doesn't have\
      \ more reviews. This is an endless VR music video / relaxation app. You'll see\
      \ & hear different colors, shapes, & sounds swirl all around you as you feed\
      \ bugs to birds by guiding them with a rainbow (the golden orbs with a string).\
      \ This experience still holds up in 2020 even though it's from late 2016. \n\
      \nI believe the whole thing is looped for maybe every 5 minutes. There's a counter\
      \ where you can see how many bugs you have fed. You can also extend the string\
      \ or make it shorter to swing around. None of that matters though; your only\
      \ goal should be relaxation. VR and chill. \n\nI do think that $2.99 USD may\
      \ be a bit much for the simple experience that you'll probably only play for\
      \ 10-20 minutes at the most. However, it is a unique experience. Also, it is\
      \ something that you can showcase to friends or family that are new to VR. \n\
      \n[b]Rate 6/10. There are better VR music videos & relaxation apps, but this\
      \ one is unique & super chill. [/b]"
