    review: "The Wastes is the greatest multiplayer FPS game you've never played,\
      \ and it holds a special place in my heart.\n\nYears and years ago when I had\
      \ a shitty Compaq that had some Athlon XP CPU clocked at 1.6 GHz, 512 MB of\
      \ DDR SDRAM, and an AGP Nvidia 5200 FX that had.. maybe 64 or 128 megabytes\
      \ of memory, the selection of games I could play was somewhat limited. I also\
      \ had *no* money, so I had to make due with mods for games that I already owned\
      \ if I wanted something new to play. Half-Life 1 mods consisted of the majority\
      \ of these. I poured countless hours into The Trenches, Sven Coop, Firearms,\
      \ The Specialists, and The Wastes. Out of all of those, The Wastes was the one\
      \ that struck the right chords with me: the electrifying gunplay, the great\
      \ art and sound design, and the fantastic post-apocalyptic atmosphere that all\
      \ of the maps had. All of the controls for that mod are permanently burned into\
      \ my muscle memory, and I practically know every little detail that all of maps\
      \ and weapons had. \n\nUnfortunately, The Wastes community was tiny when I discovered\
      \ it in 2005, but I managed to play it regularly with some people. Fast forward\
      \ to 2016 - I'm looking around on Mod DB and I notice a news article announcing\
      \ that The Wastes is being ported to a variation of the Quake 3 engine whilst\
      \ being revamped and reworked. I could not believe what I was seeing, and after\
      \ I read that article, I felt like I was a kid again. When the new iteration\
      \ of The Wastes was released roughly two years later, that feeling came back\
      \ in force, despite the fact that the first release had some significant bugs\
      \ that were eventually patched out. Regardless, those blemishes did not diminish\
      \ the wave of nostalgia I had. \n\nWe live in an age of cookie-cutter AAA games\
      \ today; the age of highly ambitious multiplayer Half-Life or Quake total conversions\
      \ is largely gone. All AAA multiplayer FPS games today are alike in some way\
      \ or another; none of them have the vision or creativity that were made by people\
      \ trying to find their footing in the world of game development and not having\
      \ to worry about suits restricting their work. If you want to know what mods\
      \ for games like Half-Life or Quake were like circa 2002, give this game a try.\n\
      \nThese Vera Visions peeps are some real crazy motherfuckers, and I love it.\
      \ Reviving a highly obscure Half-Life 1 mod (and putting it in a new engine)\
      \ that's loved by only a select few - this is the shit I live for."
