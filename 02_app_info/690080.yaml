    review: "Weird decisions that break genre conventions:\n\n1) Starting with the\
      \ worst one, the mid-air control is awful. Pretend you're jumping full speed\
      \ this way ->. In almost every other platformer, tapping Left would make you\
      \ either slow down or move a little bit to the right. In this game, tapping\
      \ Left [b]immediately[/b] makes you go full speed this way <-. It makes no sense.\
      \ You can't make precise adjustments, which isn't exactly great when it's one\
      \ of those platformers that asks for precision. Even worse, this only happens\
      \ after you jump. If you just walk off a ledge and fall, mid-air control works\
      \ like it should! So you're dealing with two different schemes the entire game.\n\
      \n2) The bomb hitbox is active for a weirdly long amount of time. If you can\
      \ see the explosion, it's still deadly. Pretty sure it can kill you until the\
      \ very last frame of its long-ass animation. \n\n3) Lots of spike paths are\
      \ drawn very randomly, no rhyme or reason to them. Not predictable unless you\
      \ memorize each one.\n\n4) Deadly stuff doesn't reset when you die, which is\
      \ terrible for a game where there are like 3-6 [b][i]different[/i][/b] cycles\
      \ that need to align for you. A lot of the time, the experience from your last\
      \ attempt will be pointless because now you're looking at a new pattern. There\
      \ are several levels where most of your time is just waiting. \n\nThere's also\
      \ the more usual jank, weird hitboxes, weird collisions, etc. And if you land\
      \ on a corner, it'll just yeet you off the edge at max speed.\n\nMost of the\
      \ issues are honestly the sort of thing you should expect in a game like this,\
      \ so if mid-air stuff was different, it would be an okay game. But like this,\
      \ it's not a good platformer even for this price. I was afk for a while so playtime\
      \ isn't accurate, but it was still ~2.5 hours that felt more tedious than fun.\
      \ Maybe I'm a masochist."
