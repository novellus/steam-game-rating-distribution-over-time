My only concern is that it was hard to \"pick chapters\" to go back to when finishing the rest of the achievements. \n\nThere were some parts of the game where the controls became very stiff and the transitions were way too abrupt that it became confusing, breaking immersion into the game. This may have been intentional, to add context to the story, but I just hated it. I also hated that the mouse sensitivity would change during the dialogue, again, another example of just breaking immersion. \n\nI'd still recommend the game because the story is very nice, I just didn't like it as much as I did other walking sims.","timestamp_created":1609125610,"timestamp_updated":1609125610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoYjX0/YCecX8vQI="}
