    about_the_game: '<strong>Othello (Reversi)</strong> is a strategy board game for
      two players, played on an 8x8 uncheckered board.<br><br>There are sixty-four
      identical game pieces called disks, which are light on one side and dark on
      the other. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned
      color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent''s color that are
      in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) and bounded by the disk
      just placed and another disk of the current player''s color are turned over
      to the current player''s color.<br>Tips for possible moves are indicated by
      transparent parts.<br>Players take alternate turns. If one player can not make
      a valid move, play passes back to the other player. The player with the most
      pieces on the board at the end of the game wins. When neither player can move,
      the game ends.<br>The object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned
      to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled.<br><br><ul
