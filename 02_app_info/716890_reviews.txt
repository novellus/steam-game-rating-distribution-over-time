Sure a story was being told but I can't pay attention to something so worthless as the intro... It would be better if you just used something like a comicbook explaining the story?\n\nThen we went to that office, girl standing to the left, after the talk with Kevin I started to talk with the girl and suddenly my character was spinning 360 degrees looking at the floor for 1 minute! Shy? Eitherway, made me sick in the stomache!\n\nFinally action.. After dying like 10 times, coming to the conclusion that you already have weapons! Only had to press 1, 2 or 3 for getting them. Oh well... Maybe I should had paid attention to the intro...\n\nCIA logo during loading times, cover your ears!!! Ear Bleeds is a common thing when you hear that CIA logo...\n\nAfter all those grenades, I want to throw some too!!! Where do they hide all of those balls??\n\nThe thing I liked, was that when your bullet hits the enemy, you see it on your crosshair. And when you down your enemy, feels quite satisfying. Especially after being bombarded by grenades all the time. \nAnd I don't really like it when the character is moving, that it is making such tiny steps, as if he wants to keep that B-U-T-T-P-L-U-G inside of him... \n\n[h1] Sometimes I felt like I was that little girl running through the fields from \"little house on the prairie\" at certain moments in the game with that musical score... -_- [/h1]\n\nBut I won't recommend this game to any of my friends... Unless you are a collector of first person shooters, bad or good, then grab this game. \n\nFor what it is worth, I will be playing more of this game, because I want to know what is happening at the end of the story...","timestamp_created":1590762693,"timestamp_updated":1590762888,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtOu2sPICf7aBiwI="}
