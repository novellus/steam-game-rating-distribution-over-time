The first room is an escaperoom part, looks decent enough but it the puzzles weren't that obvious, so you'll probably die the first time trying. Second space was absolutely worthless, didn't feel like you were doing anything, didn't also feel like you were lighting the cannons. Third space didn't even really make sense, knocking out the pirates (1 model) with your barehands even though they had a sword, sort of wave 'shooter'.. And the last space on the beach (at least for me it was the last space) didn't make sense at all with your watershooting hands...\nNope sorry.. Don't spend any money on this 'game' as how it is now. Als I guess there will never be an Episode 2....","timestamp_created":1578700269,"timestamp_updated":1578700269,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43Mz3yO8CcKOX6wE="}
