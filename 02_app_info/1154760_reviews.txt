I also noticed that the campaign routinely ends up becoming a huge mess and there are a lot of balancing issues - especially late game.  While the yellow turbans take over the north, you can take literally any faction south, amass a huge empire and finally crush the rebellion...then the three kingdoms \"starts\" but it's over before it finishes.  Even when I started in the north and ended the rebellion it was a cake walk from there.  I find the vanilla game way more difficult late game as factions gang on you.  Most notable are bugs where historical events don't happen early in the campaign when things haven't gone to total shit yet.  Some of the bugs break certain campaigns as historical events don't even fire.  Most notable are Dong Zhou events.  No Lu Bu, no capturing the emperor etc.  Even if just the bugs were fixed, I'm not sure if this would be worth it, and clearly CA doesn't think it's worth it to fix....well any of it.","timestamp_created":1609866228,"timestamp_updated":1609866228,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkqbg6fYCf9rgwAI="}
