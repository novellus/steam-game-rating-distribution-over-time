Everything from the weapons, to the obstacles (cyclones), monsters, and racing aspect is spot on. I really like the game graphics and music. It looks and sounds good.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the clunky controls. It seems like when I am accelerating and steering either left or right it turns really slow. It seems like when you approach a curve you should be able to turn into the curve faster, also when you bank out of water you seem to be stuck for a long time before the game moves you back into water. It would be easier just to have an invisible land barrier that you cannot enter onto. \n\nI tried running this game on my HD 6770 and it would barely run (1-2 FPS max.) I can run NFS:HP on my HD 6770 no problem. I think the polygon count in this game is too high for older graphics cards.  \n\nAt the time of this review I would not recommend buying this game, but being an early access game I would change my review once the steering issues have been fixed.","timestamp_created":1565401499,"timestamp_updated":1565406388,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw8rvfvOwCf5qI0AE="}
