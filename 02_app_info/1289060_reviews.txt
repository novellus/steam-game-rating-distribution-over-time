It is a visual novel that deals with dark themes and if you don't make the right choices will end badly for your love interest... and possibly all of them, since without your input most of them will still be in their particular trouble. The only one not so much is Chinatsu, whose issue... well, you really can't help with that one...\n\nAnyway, the three other girls are Yui, who has suffered from bullying to an extent where she tries to be a loner. Shiro, who loves music, but whose father... is a bit of a dirtbag. And Megumi, who is dealing with the death of her sister... which she believes she may have caused while trying to save her from a pedophile... who is now free and stalking HER...\n\nThere is also a failure route, if you don't manage to pursue any of the four girls... and it ends slightly badly...\n\nDo try it if you have the willpower and stomach for it.\n\nThere is a more explicit version out there, and rumors of a patch that may or may not ever come to fruition...","timestamp_created":1598404230,"timestamp_updated":1598404230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596457958221435547","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt5+UlPQCfOXknQI="}
