    review: "It's a simple game where you defend a house from slowly incoming zombies.\
      \ It has a small amount of charming pixel art and  a good UI. \n\nBecause it's\
      \ simple it relies on the core gameplay to be fun, but unfortunately it's not.\
      \ The primary issue is that there's a long cooldown period in between shots\
      \ which ruins the flow of the action. The zombies also have annoyingly small/awkward\
      \ hit boxes which causes you to miss often which then triggers another painful\
      \ reload. \n\nThere's also no animations for enemies being hit or when you reload\
      \ which is annoyingly unsatisfying.\n\nThe game might be more fun with later\
      \ power ups and monster types but I just didn't want to play for that long."
