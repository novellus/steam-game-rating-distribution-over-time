    review: 'The lack of checkpoints makes this title extremely repetitive.


      Especially with such design of the levels: One wrong jump, one slow turn, and
      you''ll have to run around to ascertain that you are, in fact, softlocked, progression
      impossible without even a shortcut to your death, then restart the entire thing.
      Oh, and believe you me, you''ll miss jumps with those unresponsive controls.


      While the platforming is quite boring, I''m still waiting for a puzzle that
      requires thinking. The good looks are not enough of an incentive for me to continue
      playing.


      As usual, you can''t expect much from a dev that displays their texts character
      by character.'
