    review: 'It is a quite depressive visual novel. I have to admit I don''t quite
      like the story. I think it is a little bit poor-written, and the English translation
      aren''t good. Also, the end of the plot is kind of unclear...


      Nonetheless, the social problems posted in the story are quite real, both in
      the age this got originally published (2002) and today. [spoiler] Also, the
      China problem isn''t getting any better ... [/spoiler]


      As for the music... The music pieces are fine albeit unpolished. But in my humble
      opinion, it would be a lot better if some dynamic range compressors are applied
      to the background music.'
