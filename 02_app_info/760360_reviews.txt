You just thrown into some editor with zero instructions.\nI love programming games, but this is NOT how you do a programming game. I have enough \"fun\" figuring out how to use real-world systems with bad documentation, don't need another one.\n\nOn top of that, the game is mostly not working for me, just crashing on load.\nHad I access to \"gameplay\" right after purchase, I would've refunded it (I generally don't refund games if there is at least some resemblance of gameplay).\nHaving spent next to nothing, I decided to wait and see how the developer would address various issues instead.\nHe makes updates once in a while, fixing random things.\nA year has passed, but the game is still crashing on me, and gameplay is not there. Weak response in discussion forums too.\n\nThumbs down. Not recommended to anyone. Developer have a lot to learn about how to deliver fun to players.","timestamp_created":1547210565,"timestamp_updated":1547210565,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491326808929443359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42PS7nugCcKCIuAE="}
