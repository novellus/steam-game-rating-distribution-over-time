    about_the_game: 'Joyfess Ep1: Martin''s Secret Recipe is a revival of the point-and-click
      adventure genre of the 1990s, featuring traditional animation, full voice acting,
      rich dialogues and an unpredictable, family-friendly story set in the familiar
      Caribbean setting.<br><br>Help extreme adventurer Joyfess Tidesman revitalize
      his boring life by doing something fresh; away from his kraken-slaying routine.
      As he stumbles upon a cooking contest due the next day, it would fall upon you
      to figure out how to become a chef overnight. Work your way through a flow of
      logical puzzles to obtain a recipe, collect its ingredients and arrive for the
      cooking contest in time (and in one piece).<h2 class="bb_tag">Back To The Caribbean
      As A Fearsome... Cook!</h2>No, this is not a pirate adventure at all. All our
