      of one such ship, and must carefully manage the planets you find, technology
      cards you posses and fellow colonists as they gradually awaken from a long cryo-sleep
      in order to scratch out a new cradle for humanity.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><ul

    review: 'I enjoy this game because I must find creative ways to generate and convert
      resources, ultimately transforming all available resources into colonies and
      settlers. The core mechanics are somewhat simple, but the variety that the game
      creates allows for fun and reward decision making. I also appreciate the way
      difficulty scales with success and losses, so I will always be playing at a
      difficulty which is correct for me. I have not yet gotten to very high difficulties,
      so I cannot say the game performs at that level.


      This is a great value for a puzzle game.'
