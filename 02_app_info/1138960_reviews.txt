Like HLD, it uses atmospheric synth music to great effect, has a vague story you must piece together, and arms the player with a variety of lightsabers and guns.  Set in a post-apocalyptic flooded metropolis, the game alternates between above-ground areas where you fight members of three warring factions, and underground tunnels infested with alien monstrosities.  The game presents you with different choices to make and optional areas to explore that will impact later events.\n\nGameplay can feel a bit slow and plodding at first, due to the movement of the player character (think slightly faster than NES-era Castlevania). If there's anything I would ask to be patched it would be a way to quickly climb up and slide down ladders because there's a ton of them and you'll spend a good deal of time wandering around to explore every inch of the game world. Thankfully, combat is more lively with clashing and parrying attacks, and a dodge roll.  Once I had leveled up a bit and was able to explore more of the world, the game really sucked me in to its lore and mysteries. I'm so thankful I kept at it, because Biomass is a truly rewarding experience.\n\nThis is a game that rewards exploration and experimentation.  Poke around, try new routes, make different choices, experiment with the combat and different weapons.  Pay VERY close attention to all NPC dialogue in order to learn what you need to do and what is going on in the game world.  Sometimes, you'll need to do a little experience grinding to make things easier, but this becomes less and less necessary as you progress and \"git gud\" with the combat mechanics. Even after completing the game, I'm still going back and discovering new things that I missed and it's such a great payoff.\n\nAs this game is fairly new, there are a few bugs here and there, but nothing that was game-breaking in my experience. Funniest thing that happened was I got stuck in the crawling animation on a ladder, but due to the auto-save feature, I just restarted the game and it plopped me back at the beginning of the room.  The developer has released several patches, including one that adds a dedicated healing item, and has been welcoming of feedback to fix issues.\n\nOverall, I had a great time with Biomass and would highly recommend this game to all metroidvania and Souls fans.","timestamp_created":1609630521,"timestamp_updated":1609630521,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46pLd4vYCdK/yvwI="}
