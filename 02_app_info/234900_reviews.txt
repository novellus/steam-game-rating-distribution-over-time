It straddles the line between Zelda-style action and exploration and a surreal existentialist haze. The problem I have with it, though, is that it's boring.\n\nI see plenty of people praising this because it's like the classic Zelda. Except the original Zelda had a ton of different items. It had money that you could use to buy new equipment and supplies. It had a robust roster of enemies. It had catchy music. It had fast-paced, challenging game play that was augmented by its items and equipment. Anodyne has none of that. Was the original Zelda directionless? Yes. Was it horribly vague at times, especially when it came to finding walls to bomb? Yes. But there were so many resources back in the day to help you out: Nintendo Power, unofficial strategy guides, tip lines: it was vague but you could still beat it. And people tend to forget the reason so many of those games from that era were so vague was due to the hardware limitations. \n\nAnodyne, after two hours of playing, left me feeling like I was still waiting for a game to begin. Screen after screen with nothing in it. Maze-like paths that led to the same place. Bland environments. Enemies and puzzles that offered no challenge. And man are the tonal shifts bad. Sometimes I could tell it wanted to be like Earthbound with its bizarre humor. Then I travel through a whirlpool formed by a man I killed into a bloodsoaked nightmare realm and perform...an abortion? It was all over the place and it didnt create an engaging experience.\n\nIf you want a Zelda-style action game, go play Hyper Light Drifter. Go play 3D Dot Game Heroes. If you want an Earthbound or Undertale clone, find something other than Anodyne. Its dreary and boring in an attempt to come off as deep. But its just boring.","timestamp_created":1609970786,"timestamp_updated":1609970786,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7ZPv7PYCf+GPwQI="}
