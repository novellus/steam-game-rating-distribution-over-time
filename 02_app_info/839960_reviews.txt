I finally it on sale, and am enjoying what I'm seeing so far! The puzzles are really ramping up in difficulty - I was impressed by the OR/XOR type switches, but then mind boggled when it started adding in power levels, invisible codes you can only access via a headmount terminal connection, etc. Definitely a ton of depth to the puzzles, something an electrical engineer or programmer would enjoy. The shooting is OK, not the best combat I've seen, but serves its purpose ... do you drop your hacking tool, which is almost done unlocking a code, to grab your gun, and have to re-start the hack? Graphics and sound are OK, nothing special, but it's clean and plays well. Thumbs up!","timestamp_created":1602449415,"timestamp_updated":1602449415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4tbPbjPUCfIWppwI="}
