No challenge, no subtleties or nuances. Just a plain old boring perfunctory platformer where you gather chests and can optionally break them open by hitting them from below first. Except there's no reason to bother doing that because all it does is slow the already dull gameplay down. I only died after the 1st boss because I was bored and really stopped caring. Missing lots of polish such as being able to return to the main menu from a game only QTD, plus you can't skip the annoying intro screen even though you've already read it all, nor can you adjust settings like sound/music or turn off the scanlines effect, which is a huge annoyance. It has the cuteness and retro feel, but it is simply not fun in any way. I refunded.","timestamp_created":1596827688,"timestamp_updated":1596827688,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxJuW5fMCcNWDmgI="}
