    review: I wish that I could give this a neutral rating rather than a down vote
      because it's early access and what's there suggests that Sumerians has the potential
      to be a fun game - in time. At the moment, though, there's not much depth and
      you can essentially put it on x4 speed and walk away for a bit to let things
      progress without you.
