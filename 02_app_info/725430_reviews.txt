Either way, me and my son like the game and it's got enough challenge to keep you going.","timestamp_created":1534987143,"timestamp_updated":1534987143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.608108341693878174","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ49aCXsuUCefKJqQE="}
