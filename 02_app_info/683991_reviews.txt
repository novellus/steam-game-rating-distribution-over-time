The abilities aren't new mechanics, they're the same abilities you might expect from any of the base factions, except now you get more of them for a single card. The ability to be triggerd by either faction, or to trigger either faction, is their main draw.\n\nPersonally, I think this is the weaker of the two dual-faction expansions, but a worthy inclusion.\n\nSince WWG doesn't like to tell you exactly what you're buying, please see below:\n\nExplanation: C=Combat, HP=Authority, T=Trade\n\nTrade Fed + Star Empire = Alliance\nShip - Alliance Transport: 2-cost; 2T; yellow faction, opponent Discard 1; blue faction, +4HP <- [i]my favorite ship from this expansion[/i]\nBase - Embassy Base: 8-cost; Draw 2 cards, discard a card. 6 hit points. <- There are much better 8-cost cards out there.\n\nStar Empire + Blob = Union\nShip - Trade Star: 1-cost; 2T; scrap +2C. <- it's a cheap explorer with 2 factions. Kind of underwhelming.\nBase - Union Stronghold: 5-cost; 3C; blob faction, scrap 1 in trade row; yellow faction, opponent Discard 1. <- meh\n\nTrade Fed + Machine Cult = Coalition\nShip: Coalition Messenger: 3-cost; 2T; faction (either), Choose a card of cost 5 or less from your discard pile and put it on top of your deck. <- some interesting late-game plays can come from this one.\nOutpost Base: Lookout Post: 7-cost; draw a card. 6 hit points <- It's merely okay.\n\nBlob + Machine Cult = Unity\nShip - Blob Bot: 3-cost; 5C; blob faction, +2T; red faction, scrap 1 <- Meh.\nBase - Exchange Point: 6-cost; 2C; faction (either), scrap 1. 7 hit points. <- Actually pretty good if you can get the scrapping going consistently. The 7HP makes it hard to kill in early to mid game.\n\n","timestamp_created":1533337481,"timestamp_updated":1533337481,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.672575652599334717","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48qWCgeUCeKPEpwE="}
