As other have pointed out - some of the most frustrating sh*t you'll ever do. But I cant deny that it feels amazing to be done with it and on many of the challenges I actually had a lot of fun once I got the basics down. Theres just 2 or 3 that really REALLY suck. Like, B A D L Y.\n\nSo - for casual play, this DLC is a blast imo. An assortment of minigames straight from the dishonored universe. If you just wanna try your hand at some of the challenges this game has to offer, I can only recommend it to you, especially for that price.\nFor completionists this DLC can be a complete pain, but also immensely rewarding to finally get it all down. So youll have to decide on your own if you wanna take that risk. Definitely is a recommendation from me even with the many many curveballs this throws you on your way to 100% :D","timestamp_created":1609541374,"timestamp_updated":1609541423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+aGJ4PYCfKHFvwI="}
