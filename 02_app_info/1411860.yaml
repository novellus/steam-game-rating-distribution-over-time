    review: "Do you LOVE PUZZLES? Hours of puzzles? Puzzles on top of puzzles? More\
      \ puzzles you can shake a stick at?\n\nThis game is for you, puzzle lovers.\
      \ Holy crap there are a ton of puzzles. And they're all UNIQUE! They don't repeat\n\
      \nThere is more variety of puzzles in this one game than in 10 years of Artifex\
      \ Mundi games. Artifex Mundi games are maybe 5% puzzle, and they reuse the same\
      \ puzzles over and over again. This game is 90%+ unique puzzles.\n\nThis game\
      \ is from 2015 and is not primarily a hidden object game or an adventure game.\
      \ It's a puzzle game. It's a bit rough around the edges, but it's good. \n\n\
      Note: this first puzzle may be \"how do I get it to run?\".  If you run it and\
      \ get a blank screen with delayed sound, then it IS running fine, but doesn't\
      \ like some Windows settings. Try this:\n\nWin10:\n1) right click on Desktop\
      \ ---> Display Settings\n2) find \"Scale and Layout\" section\n3) change scaling\
      \ to 100%\n\nSome say their fix was changing it away from 100% to something\
      \ else, or doing that and then back to 100%\nAlso: might try (if laptop) changing\
      \ between integrated graphics and GPU graphics."
