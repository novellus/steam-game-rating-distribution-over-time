If you manage to last past the first boss, you'll find a wildly creative game with a lot of unique ideas and charm. Be warned though, if you require polish and consistency in your games you probably won't enjoy Blessed Surface. But if you can bear a little jank, there's a lot of fun to be had here.\n\nThis game is really weird and really janky. Almost everything in the game is confusing when you first encounter it, and it's even kind of hard to figure out how to get out of the very first room in the game. For me, a big part of my enjoyment with the game is encountering new and strange things and experimenting with them to try and understand them. I've found food that turns all your projectiles into ghost monkeys, a monster heart that gives me wings and spawns homing crystal barriers, centipede monsters that you can ride on to get around quickly, and a lot more. There's so much here, and every time I launch the game I find something new, even in previously explored areas.\n\nThe combat seems awkward and simple at first, but after you get used to it and make a good build it becomes very enjoyable. It's still awkward and janky, but the variety of enemy and weapon behaviours combine with the heart system and environments to create some really engaging and unique fights. \n\nThe world is expansive and strange, with weird creatures and items scattered around many distinct areas. Very little is locked away in the traditional metroidvania sense (asides from literal locks that can be opened with common generic keys dropped by enemies) and you can go almost anywhere as long as you can figure out how to get there without dying to the local wildlife.\n\nIn short, Blessed Surface is a strange and confusing gem. It's got a really rough start which I think contributes to its relatively low review score, but for all its roughness it has a lot of great qualities. I think it's a shame that this game which obviously has had so much love put into it has been so overlooked and so poorly rated by the few that did notice it. If you like weirdness and don't mind jank, give it a shot. You might play it for an hour and decide it's not for you, or, as in my case, you might find the most memorable game you've played in a while.\n\n\nAs a side note, there seems to be a decent amount of content in the game as well. As of writing this review I've played 6.9 hours, and have only beaten 2 out of the 10 bosses. EDIT: I just \"finished\" the game (in that I got the ending, there's still quite a lot of unfinished business and unanswered questions which I am definitely going to spend a lot more time on) and wanted to edit my review slightly. I played the game in a weird order, where I explored as much as possible before beating bosses. This meant that I could beat the remaining 8 bosses in a pretty short time. I just wanted to add that so my review isn't misleading about how long it takes to get the ending. Even though I've gotten the ending, I plan to continue playing for a while. There are a lot of things I still don't understand about the game, and there are some puzzles I and to solve and side quests I want to complete. Overall, really great game. It doesn't deserve its current steam rating at all.","timestamp_created":1609116895,"timestamp_updated":1609301842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhav32PYCcKf4vQI="}
