By leading Ellie’s investigations into uncovering the culprit, we are able to gather evidence through searching rooms and interacting with objects, which are presented as evidence throughout questionings. These interactive elements of the game added depth and immersion to the story and really made the game shine for me.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2156946185\nGothic Murder has 2 character, 2 normal and 19 bad endings. While I found the romance lacking with only brief parts throughout the game and at the end of routes, I felt like the overall story made up for it. The only other complaint I have is probably the lack of CGs. There is a total of 12 with some variations and I would have loved to see more, but it was still enjoyable with the amount it had, nonetheless. Music tracks were also limited to a small range but suited to the situations they were used in and all very pleasant to listen to. The game comes with a handy flow chart which you can easily jump from to collect missing endings, excluding the character ends where you need to build up affinity from selecting the correct choices throughout the game. Seeing all the bad endings are not necessary for any achievements and most do not add to the story, but I still felt it was worth getting them all as this function allowed me to quickly navigate through them all.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2156948719\nGothic Murder was an enjoyable read for me and although the romance was scarce, I really enjoyed the slow unravel of the mystery. The developer has expressed that if there are enough people interested in the game then they would like to translate it to English, so I hope this review can contribute towards helping people get a feel for the game.\n\nEdit: A English translated version of the game has now been released.","timestamp_created":1594342183,"timestamp_updated":1606690264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.743251144886016846","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvPqMi/YCeKKYlAI="}
