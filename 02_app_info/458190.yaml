    review: '[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]


      Big Dumb Fun Games is the dev. They forgot the big and fun part of this game.
      This is a rather pedestrian attempt at a VR game. This feels like it should
      be a .99 cents game at best or a student project free to play that we all like
      because although it has its faults, it''s free and has some nice moments.


      So there is full locomotion, but no turning (you have to turn in real-life so
      roomscale setup recommended). As far as I can tell (I''ve only gotten to level
      3 of 5 levels), there is a revolver gun with 5 bullets, a sword, and a repeater
      laser gun you can get that has like 100 bullets but you lose once you deselect
      it. So just shoot it till it''s out of ammo.


      The gunplay is not very satisfying because the AI enemy is dumb. Reloading feels
      clunky. The graphics are below average. The assets are very below average. This
      is supposed to be a procedurally generated game. Was it? I felt like I was always
      going down the same bland looking corridor with the same generic assets everywhere.


      I only saw two types of enemies a dumb human AI that just walks to you and tries
      to camp you at the door. And some dumb giant Spider that just walks rapidly
      towards you. You can gain XP by putting your hand on these orbs that improve
      your health and damage. But enemies also get better, so meh.


      Endless replayability? I played 3 times, they all felt the same. And I was bored
      all three times. I don''t want to play a 4th that''s for sure. Each time I died,
      I spawned without the right controller in my hand. Have to restart to fix this
      issue in the game.


      Rate 4/10. I don''t think this game has been updated since launch in January
      2017, so consider EA here means Early Abandonware. The devs are not going to
      keep any of their promises.'
