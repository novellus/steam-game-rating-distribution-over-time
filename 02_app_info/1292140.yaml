    review: 'it should be noted that this is a relatively short game with very little
      replayability. that being said, it''s a nice little HOg that follows along with
      the rest of the series. rest assured though, you don''t need to have played
      the rest of the series to get through this one. it just makes it more interesting
      when you know more of the lore and more about the characters in it.

      the graphics are crisp like most of the other games by this developer. the sound
      quality''s good and the music is nice.

      the down side, is like that of many games of this sort... the back-n-forth between
      scenes to complete the puzzles. but as i said, you get that with pretty much
      Any HOg.

      i Did have some issues with the game crashing a couple of times, but i can''t
      honestly say that it wasn''t just my computer being a butt. as far as i know
      this is based off an older game from Big Fish (as in i had seen it for sale
      over on their platform some time ago) but i''m not sure if it was remastered
      to bring it over here to Steam or not. so i don''t know if that may have been
      a contributing issue with the crashing. but again... it could just have been
      all on my computer acting up just as easily.

      still, i figured i should mention it as a just-in-caser. at any rate, i enjoyed
      it when everything was playing nice together.'
