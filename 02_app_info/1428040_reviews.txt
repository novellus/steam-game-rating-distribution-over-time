It has the features you need to properly play this game. Left click for a regular block, right click to put a negative block. You can drag accross the titles and it wont delete the previous blocks. It has a counter when you select multiple cells. And the biggest feature you can activate is that once the correct number of blocks are filled for a row or column the rest of the blocks are automatically put to negative blocks.","timestamp_created":1609606129,"timestamp_updated":1609606129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41oyA4vYCdffjvwI="}
