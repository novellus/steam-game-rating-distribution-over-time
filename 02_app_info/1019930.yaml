    about_the_game: 'Dark Deception Chapter 3 is the next chapter in the Dark Deception
      story. Face off against 2 new nightmares - Dread Duckies and the GremClowns.
      Dark Deception mixes the fast-paced style of classic arcade games with fun horror
      game design. Trapped in a dark world full of nightmarish mazes and ridiculous
      monsters, the only way out is to face the darkness and find a way to survive.
      <br><br><br>Features:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Fast-paced Arcade Horror:
      No hiding in lockers here. Run for your life and run fast. Enemies can be stunned
      and avoided, but not killed. <br></li><li>Power System: Earn XP and unlock powers
      as you progress that will allow you to even the odds and survive longer against
      horrendous creatures. <br></li><li>High Quality: AAA-quality graphics and creative
      designs give players a variety of unique and terrifying worlds and enemies to
      survive. <br></li><li>Hazardous Environments: Enemies are not the only danger.
      The mazes themselves are full of traps, hazards, and other dangers to watch
      out for. <br></li><li>Unique Enemies: Every nightmare presents a unique creature
      that has its own distinct AI. Players will have to change up their tactics in
      order to survive. <br></li><li>Dark Humor: While scary, Dark Deception is not
      a bloody or gory game and features it''s own stylized brand of dark humor. Dark
      Deception was designed to be enjoyed by everyone.</li></ul>'
