It tells the story of man (Diego) haunted by his healing gift and the separation of his daughter, and a woman (Hillary) that is confused about his marriage and the feelings about his daughter. It is nice movie although slow,and it has some beautiful views from caribbean islands. The end it is good, and the untranslated spanish dialogues are not important to the main story. For 50 c, it was a bargain.\nThat guy that always play bad guys in action movies was put in the movie just to call the audience. His participation has some 5 minutes in the movie, although it is an important part.","timestamp_created":1478119058,"timestamp_updated":1478119163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456330478191375732","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x5Cxk9gCfdXQZA=="}
