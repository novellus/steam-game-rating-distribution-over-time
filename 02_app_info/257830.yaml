    review: "Update 12/2020: Still unplayable past the Airplane scene. If you ring\
      \ the yellow bell before moving the ladder, the player is stuck and cannot progress.\
      \ \n\nOriginal: Point and click. I did enjoy it last time I played, but now\
      \ is buggy as... Pathing isn't always working. Sometimes I have to backtrack\
      \ out of a room and back or all the way to the beginning area of a room before\
      \ it will let me walk somewhere.\n\nWorst two I can think of now are the Kitchen\
      \ (have to return to the platform sometimes to visit the caterpillar, even though\
      \ you are already on the floor and the Plane Roof (I have the ladder tipped,\
      \ and tell her to climb it, but she ALWAYS walks toward the little green bird\
      \ on the lower beam. Since you cannot get past the bird until climbing the ladder,\
      \ this game is now unplayable past that stage.)\n\nI was going through some\
      \ of my old games and restarted this one to try to get that last achievement.\
      \ With this bug, it is impossible. It might have helped if they gave you some\
      \ sort of counter per room/ total to look for.  Even if it isn't in the game,\
      \ it COULD have been implemented on the achievement. \n\nTLDR: Pathing makes\
      \ this game unplayable. Achievements are overly difficult to figure out how\
      \ close you are to done.  I cannot recommend this."
