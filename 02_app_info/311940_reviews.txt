The way your \"ship\" moves is so bad. I tried to get used to it, but it's so imprecise that you will always run into something and die, and lose your gun power-ups. It's like trying to fly in gel, and I think this was done on purpose, but it shouldn't have been done this way. It makes this game unplayable.","timestamp_created":1577182933,"timestamp_updated":1577182933,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gLbbm+8CdJXL5gE="}
