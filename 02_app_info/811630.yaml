    about_the_game: Have you ever had a feeling where you are walking down a narrow
      hallway and you feel like there's something behind you but you can't turn around
      because if you do, then something bad will happen? If you turn around, its over
      so your only chance of winning is by not turning around. Just make it to the
      end and you won. It shouldn't be hard.<br><br>This is a simple first-person
      horror game where you are placed in a narrow hallway. You only have a flashlight
      to help you see whats in front of you. You can only go forward and there is
      no turning back. Your goal is to make it to the end of the hallway without looking
      back. So<br><br><strong>DON&quot;T LOOK BACK</strong>

    review: 'You know how some games are so bad they''re good? This ain''t one of
      those games. Let''s play a game. Hold down the W key on the keyboard for about
      five or ten minutes. Done? Congratulations, you beat the game.


      No joke, my flashlight wouldn''t load in so I just held W to see how long it
      would take to die. I beat the game. In complete darkness by just holding W.
      I feel so acomplished now.'
