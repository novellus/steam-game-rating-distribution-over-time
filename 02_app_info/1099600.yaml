      \ /><br>The sands of the desert may have been replaced by the dark foliage of\
      \ the woodlands but that doesn\u2019t make it any less unforgiving. With the\
      \ Interceptor Set, you can wear a dashing leather outfit and goggles as you\
      \ take the fight to your enemies. For it is a most glorious day and even if\
      \ you don\u2019t have a battle plan in place, you need to survive no matter\
      \ what.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ecto-Scientist Set: </h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1099600/extras/Blockbuster_4Ecto.png?t=1594890531\"\
      \ /><br>It might be hard to know who you are going to call in the case of hostile\
      \ machines roaming the countryside, but when wearing the Ecto-Scientist Set\
      \ you aren't afraid of no machines. Put on your jumpsuit, grab a pair of high-tech\
      \ goggles, and grab your favorite gun. You may not have to worry about crossing\
      \ any streams but you can still arrive to the action, observe the scene, and\
      \ kick the machines in the posterior.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Xeno-Specialist Set:\

      \ /><br>With the population gone, no one can hear you scream for help. So channel\
      \ your inner hero through the Xeno-Specialist Set, with a wild hairdo, ammo\
      \ straps, and highrise shoes. For the machines are not only incredibly hostile\
      \ but also structurally perfect. That doesn't mean a few well-placed bullets\
      \ won\u2019t take them down though.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Annihilator Set: </h2><img\

      \ /><br>You become the ultimate killing machine when donning the Annihilator\
      \ Set, perhaps not in combat but most definitely in looks. With a studded jacket,\
      \ colorful t-shirt, and boots you will look absolutely deadly as you lay your\
      \ ambushes, line up your shots, and slowly walk away from exploding cars.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Six New Emotes:</h2>Dance to those summer blockbuster beats\
      \ with these 6 choice emotes. From the Pop Princess and One Step, to the Bump\
      \ and Running Man, your moves will be smooth as butter. Or show your respect\
      \ to a comrade by doing the Salute or Air Punch."
