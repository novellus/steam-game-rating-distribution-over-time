    review: I was very disappointed with this game, after moving in cover and having
      the enemy on the other side of the cover, it automatically goes into melee mode!
      Well that would be ok I guess, but you only do 10 damage and leave cover. Leaving
      the next turn for all the enimes to do 20+ damage each to your character.  This
      is a far cry from any tactical game I have played, don't want to play this game
      ever again.
