    review: I am absolutely hooked on Soul Harvest; it's fast paced, fun, and quite
      challenging at times. I can't wait to see what else they have in store for this
      hidden gem!Remember this game is in ALPHA; (and I will be adding more to my
      review the more I play the game to give more in depth detail) but in it's current
      state it is still VERY fun to play and well worth the price.Edit#1) The game
      is still very satisfying to play, and with the addition of the map editor, more
      additional content is always great! Still enjoying the game! (don't let my hours
      fool you, most of the time I am playing offline)Final Edit. The game has been
      abandoned, I have tried reaching out to devs no response. Sad. Could have been
      something. Move on folks.
