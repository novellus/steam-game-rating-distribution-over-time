    review: 'The music is easily the best thing to come out of the game.


      However, there are two strikes against it: One, is that steam doesn''t allow
      you to buy just the soundtrack without buying the game.


      Second, is that the beautiful atmospheric tracks which lack the game''s transition
      sounds, (which are a man with a very deep voice saying a few words that include
      the segment''s title) is marred by the words "Give Up The Ghost" near the end
      of each track, which is what the game plays to indicate to you that this is
      now the boss fight.'
