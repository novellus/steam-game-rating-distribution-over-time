    review: 'This is a 2D platformer/puzzle game that has a metroidvania style over-world
      for accessing each puzzle level.  It is absolutely NOT metroidvania like in
      any other way.


      Graphics - 8/10, nothing revolutionary, but certainly nothing lacking for a
      modern 2D game


      SFX/Music - 8/10, Above average, again nothing amazing but many tracks jive
      well with the mood.


      Controls - 8/10, this game took a hit compared to the predecessor, there are
      a few annoying kinks with the controls, so I had to knock off a couple of points.  Specific
      examples are hard to give if you have not played the game, but just know you
      will be occasionally frustrated with the controls.


      Story - 9/10, There is an amusing story that develops as you play this game.
      Considering that the game did not really even need a story, I would say that
      is going above and beyond.


      Gameplay - 9/10, still one of the best puzzle/platformer games I have every
      played. Unfortunately they made a couple of bad design choices that knocks off
      a point compared to the first game.


      It is a real shame that this game and it''s predecessor, Stealth Bastard, are
      not more well known.  These are some of the best platform/puzzle games I have
      ever played. This one is not an overall improvement on the first game.   They
      improved on the gameplay but adding gadgets that you have to use to get through
      the puzzles, thus adding to variety of puzzles compared to the last game. Unfortunately,
      they did not quite get there with the controls in this game and some of the
      levels have errors in them.  So overall it''s like a lateral step and I hold
      both games in high regard.  If you think to yourself at all that you like the
      puzzle/platformer genre, do yourself a big favor and pick both of these games
      up.'
