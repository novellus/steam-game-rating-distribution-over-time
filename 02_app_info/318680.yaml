    review: 'At first I tried to like this game because of the subject matter, then
      I tried turning a blind eye to what bothered me about it, and in the end I gave
      up and asked for a refund.


      The dialogue was not very inspiring.  I would not characterize it as inane because
      it is one cut better than that, but just barely.


      It''s hard to tell when you should click to advance the dialogue.  If you do
      you might miss something, but that''s probably not a bad thing.


      I wasn''t expecting the game to be about finding hidden objects, but it is.  I
      encountered three puzzles, none of them giving hints as to what I was supposed
      to do.  That wasn''t a problem on the first puzzle (an uninspired cypher solving
      puzzle), but the next two were hidden object finders, after which I threw in
      the towel in disgust.


      There are several YouTube walkthroughs that I should have looked at before buying
      the game, because I would have realized what I was getting myself into.


      A shame, because medieval alchemy is a great subject.'
