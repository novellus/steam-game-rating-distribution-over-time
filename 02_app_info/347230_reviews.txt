It was made when games came with 2-inch thick manuals that were as fun to read as the game was to play. Obviously it's an old DOS-based game, so don't expect great graphics (especially since it was released during what I call the \"muddy phase\" of sims, where clear graphics were sacrificed for the cutting edge effect of 3-D immersion), but this is about as comprehensive a Pacific Theater sim as you can find. Why no one has re-booted this game I will never understand. It's a lot of fun.","timestamp_created":1597372000,"timestamp_updated":1597372000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496385514736175537","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8Myy9fMCf+iomwI="}
