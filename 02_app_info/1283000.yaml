    review: 'It''s nice to look at...while you click the space bar (or have a script
      running to auto click the space bar), but zero depth. You seriously just click
      the space bar. I foolishly expected more with the fun graphics...that you soon
      realize never change.

      There''s no fun to be had, or reason to ever come back to the game after the
      last achievement pops, and it very unfulfilling...but I got the achievements.
      I guess, if I want more, I can just play an actual "game."'
