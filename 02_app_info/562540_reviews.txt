I came across this right as it was being launch. I was not impressed. You have zero choices in the cards coming into play. You Build a deck and then its an auto play, As in the computer plays the cards from your deck not you. There is a lot of Luck involved in this game. After every battle that you lose you will be forced to wait a period of time before you will be able to play again. The artwork is nice and some of the cards have special abilities but i see too many problems coming from other players in the long run for me to be able to continue to play this for very long. It has Potential to be good but its not there at this time. Im thankful this was a free game. Good luck to the other players. 3/10 rating\n\nPlease follow me at One on One Gamers. As a curator I am looking for help from you wonderful people on steam to make my reviews better.
