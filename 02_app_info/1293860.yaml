    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE PROLOGUE?</h2><strong>The\
      \ Riftbreaker Prologue</strong> allows you to experience the events taking place\
      \ before the story campaign of the main game. Explore an entirely new world.\
      \ Gather resources. Build up a base. Defend yourself from thousands of alien\
      \ creatures. Or just take the scenic route and do whatever you want - the choice\
      \ is yours.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STORY</h2>You play the role of captain Ashley\
      \ S. Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful\
      \ Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the\
      \ far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base\
      \ that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit,\
      \ which she calls &quot;Mr. Riggs&quot;, can withstand the harshest environmental\
      \ conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource\
      \ extraction, gathering specimens, and of course - combat. It is capable of\
      \ traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances.<h2 class=\"\

      \ /><br>Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very\
      \ complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors\
      \ and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex\
      \ chain of mines, refineries, powerplants, and research facilities to complete\
      \ this mission.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORATION</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1293860/extras/riftbreaker_biomes_jungle.gif?t=1603108745\"\
      \ /><br>Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way\
      \ galaxy. Long-distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect\
      \ for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that\
      \ can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise\
      \ you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct\
      \ local outposts in resource-rich locations that will transport the required\
      \ resources using rift technology.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEFENSE</h2><img src=\"\

      \ /><br>Your presence on this planet will not go unnoticed. As you build up\
      \ your industry and disrupt the natural order, the world will start seeing you\
      \ as a threat. Build up your defenses. Construct walls, barriers, and defense\
      \ towers as the attacks get stronger with every passing day. You will face thousands\
      \ of hostile creatures trying to eliminate your presence.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\

      \ /><br>Mr. Riggs can be equipped with powerful weapons and abilities that will\
      \ allow you to take on the largest of beasts. You will need to be ready to face\
      \ lots of hostile alien creatures as you scout the planet.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >GATHER SAMPLES AND STRANGE ARTIFACTS</h2>Fallen beasts will drop valuable research\
      \ specimens as well as rare resources. Use everything that you can gather to\
      \ research and craft new technologies, buildings, weapons, and equipment. You\
      \ can also scout the terrain using your sensors and dig for treasure buried\
      \ underground.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">RESEARCH</h2>Use the samples that you've\
      \ gathered to research new technologies that will help you build up your base,\
      \ improve your defenses, develop new blueprints for your Mecha-suit, or improve\
      \ existing technologies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CRAFT</h2>Mr. Riggs is fully customizable\
      \ and upgradeable. Use the blueprints that you've researched to craft new parts\
      \ and weapons. Utilizing better materials for the crafting process results in\
      \ developing gear with improved properties. Each crafted item has unique properties.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">INTERACTIVE STREAMING</h2>The Riftbreaker\u2122 has built-in\
      \ integration with the most popular streaming services out there. The stream's\
      \ audience can actively participate in the game through multiple options, e.g.\
      \ by voting to send waves of new enemies, spawn environmental disasters like\
      \ a tornado, or by donating resources.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE SCHMETTERLING\
