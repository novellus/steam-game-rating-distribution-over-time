    review: "It looks like the game has received a couple of updates over the past\
      \ few weeks, even after the Devs indicated that they were putting this game\
      \ on the backburner. \n\nThe problem, as it always has been, is that the devs\
      \ have some of the worst communication I've ever experienced with any developing\
      \ game. It's in EA, so take the opportunity to tell us what you've update...what\
      \ you're working on...what's to come. That's part of what we love about EA titles\
      \ is engagement with the dev team and experiencing a project's evolution first\
      \ hand. \n\nFor god's sake, dev team, hire a community manager or something\
      \ and just tell us what is going on...even if it's nothing!"
