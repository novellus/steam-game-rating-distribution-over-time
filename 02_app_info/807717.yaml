    short_description: "In the last lesson we looked at Dr. Paul Richer\u2019s system\
      \ of measuring human proportions based on the height of the head. In this lesson\
      \ we\u2019ll take a look at a different approach, based on the same proportions\
      \ as Richer\u2019s, but using a different unit for measuring: the head."
