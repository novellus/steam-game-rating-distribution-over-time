As well as Bernard's abilities changing across the course of the game, there are also some odd little mini-game levels which enable access to harder levels if you complete a challenge. (Such as walking a dog without it getting wet.)\n\nThe final \"boss\" level was perhaps a bit too hard relative to the rest of the game (even before you unlock the harder version by clearing all levels!) Still, it was satisfying to beat, and you do get a proper ending which makes a nice change compared to a lot of more abstract puzzle games.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with Bernard and hope the developer makes more games.","timestamp_created":1515182425,"timestamp_updated":1515182425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593432366847991943","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uqD64+ACfauRlQE="}
