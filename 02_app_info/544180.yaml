    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">Overview</h2><br>Orbox C is a puzzle game
      with lots of levels. The game done with a sci-fi spacey graphics, good sound
      and music. Controls are simple and responsive. We put great effort into level
      design.<br><br>Move the orbox between various blocks to complete the missions.
      There are several types of missions. 8 packs with 30 levels in each pack. 240
      levels overall. We plan to add more level packs into the game with new exciting
      mechanics!<br><br>Below you may see a lot of reviews from youtubers who we gave

      let us tell about it. We never ask youtubers to be nice. They decide what to
      do by themselves. Some of them even show our email text in their videos(why?).
      So everything very open here. Often we get answers like - &quot;OK I can try
      your game, but I warn you, I will give only honest opinion and if I don''t like
      something then I will tell so. If it''s OK with you then send me key&quot;.

    short_description: Bounce the box in outer space. Blow bombs, break the ice, collect
      orbs, activate sensors and more! The game starts easy and slowly grows in difficulty
      to the real challenge. When you want a clever brain teaser for 5-20 min session
      - this is the best choice.
