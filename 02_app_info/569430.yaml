    short_description: '&quot;A Demon''s Game&quot; is a very unique title, but keeps
      true to its horror roots, the game focuses on creating a terrifying atmosphere,
      rewarding exploration, and engrossing players in the rich lore of its world,
      moving away from the trend of incessant jump scares and low production quality
      is our main goal.'
