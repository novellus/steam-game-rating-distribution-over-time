Noteworthy is that the airbending (for a lack of a better word) takes a bit of time to get used to.  It's short but worth your time. It takes about 3 hours if you collect all the collectables. I would wait for a sale but definitively pick it up.","timestamp_created":1609772508,"timestamp_updated":1609772508,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtuT65vYCeey0wAI="}
