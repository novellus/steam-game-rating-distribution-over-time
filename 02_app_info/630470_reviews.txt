The game was developed and published by rokaplay.\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visuals in the game are well done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThis is a solitaire card game, it involves clearing all cards from the screen, by using combos and wild cards.\n\nThere are no difficulty game modes to choose from. But all the levels have their own difficulty. There is a tutorial for those who are new solitaire or who need a refresher course in how to play solitaire.\n\nThere are eighty-four levels spread across seven chapters. The first level is automatically unlocked, while the rest are locked; completing the current level will unlock the next level.\n\nAll levels have a three star rating system. The stars are earned from playing the game. The star rating system represents how many cards are left on the screen. There is an opportunity to replay levels for better star rating.\n\nGold Coins are earned from playing the solitaire levels. These coins are used to purchase various themes. Most of these themes are a bit pricey and it would take some level grinding to earn enough coins to purchase them.\n\nThere are eighteen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game only.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1547403175,"timestamp_updated":1599882315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563153207302093506","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z9iawPQCetiluAE="}
