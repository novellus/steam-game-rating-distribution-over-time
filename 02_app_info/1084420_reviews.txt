(keep attention on the tips)\nThe dev on this game loves feedback and will try patching bugs if you find any. I have not found any bugs but I have not completed it yet.\nAt times the puzzles get really hard and will take some effort to figure out..\n\nSo if you like games that try to test your puzzle skills and you have a love for soda give this game a go. It's a good price for this project!\n\nWill update this when I complete the game","timestamp_created":1577122931,"timestamp_updated":1577122991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469798654317855835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ueH2me8Cdr615gE="}
