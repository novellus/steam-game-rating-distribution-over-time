    review: "[h1]The Story with the Undead Witch[/h1]\n\nOkay, this HOG is pretty\
      \ well rendered. Though the story again has some lapses. The HOG-Scenes are\
      \ well rendered, and some of the puzzles included in this game are pretty well\
      \ made. All are solvable, and there is a reset key if someone just botched up\
      \ enough of a puzzle to make it harder to solve.\n\nThis game isn't on the unfair\
      \ side of HOGs, where you need a magnifier attached to the monitor to find pieces\
      \ of the Scene. Or you can't find items through odd coloration issues.\n\nThe\
      \ story as a whole is okay, nothing too fancy. It's about the ghost of a witch,\
      \ that wants to return to live by possessing the body of a living person, and\
      \ you are the one who needs to get rid of her once and for all. The Bonus Content\
      \ also is well made. One thing about achievements in Hidden Object Games...\
      \ they are pretty superfluous, most of them you gain automatically. And those\
      \ few that realls require some more drive are also the same that can utterly\
      \ frustrate you. This is couterproductive in a \"meditative Playstyle\"  and\
      \ devs really need to look deeper into the \"Is an Achievement required, or\
      \ is it just a barrier to assess the motivation of the player?\" In HOGs the\
      \ latter is doubtful, since HOGs often have no replayability - there is no alternative\
      \ route to discover, or no open World to Explore... it is a storytelling medium,\
      \ nothing more. IF for any case an achievement would make sense would be if\
      \ the story within the HOG contains twists and turns, alternative endings and\
      \ of course the option of choice. At the moment most HOGs don't offer this kind\
      \ of Storytelling, most are pretty liniear, and often pretty restricted in the\
      \ topic. Visual novels on the other hand often have shallow storytelling, and\
      \ most often too many choices and therefore consequences - I have learned my\
      \ piece about VNs as well, and I have to note, that not all VN are badly written\
      \ scripts there are some precious pearls among them. \n\nSo would I recommend\
      \ this game to a prospective buyer? Yes. This one is a bit better than the first\
      \ of the series, it contains some logical lapses too, but don't bother too much\
      \ about it... how is the Song of Queen back in the eighties? \"It's a kind of\
      \ magic!\" and there are worse methods to waste your time actually."
