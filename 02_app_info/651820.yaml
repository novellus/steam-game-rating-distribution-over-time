      Interesting premise.

      Narrative, exploration gameplay.

      Hand drawn on paper style.

      Not a huge fan of the flashlight effect.

      I really like the music and the weird jabber (Sims Esque) talking she does.

      Fullscreen option doesn''t make the GAME fullscreen, just the black around the
      game.'
