[/h1]\n\n[b] I don't need to play a game like this that long, in order to have an impression of it. [/b]\n\nYour sword of absolute slashyness has a cooldown if you use it too yolo-ish, so you need to change weapons sometimes. That is pretty cool, because in most games, you can just spam using one weapon throughout an entire game. Not with this one. Plus the fact there are chests in the game, AND it's fully handdrawn and doesn't look like crap, AND it has some particular music scores: This game has scored a lot of points already!\n\nIf you were looking for a ninja type of game ( I know, I know, this is a monster hunter, not a ninja, but my impression of this guy feels like a ninja, maybe he was a ninja, but decided to become a monster hunter instead ) or just searching for a special platform game that offers a little bit more then the usual with a wide range of different types of monsters, big & small, with impressive boss battles and lot's of action? \n\nThen look no further, this might be that little gem you were waiting for. Made by somebody who was probably searching for the same thing, but couldn't find it and decided to make it himself... And exceeded!\n\n[h3] I didn't played it that long, but for what I have tasted so far, it's a decent game for it's genre, totally doesn't feel like utterly crap and it offers a bit of a challenge! A cocktail, worth to drink up!
