    review: "Bought it. Really digging it thus far. Kinda has a Mass Effect RPG with\
      \ a traditional strategy game (now wondering why Bioware/EA haven\u2019t already\
      \ done that). As others have pointed out, it still needs some work but is still\
      \ in early access. Regardless, I\u2019m still enjoying myself and think others\
      \ will too."
