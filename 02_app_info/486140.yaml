    detailed_description: "<h1>*Content Update*</h1><p><u><strong>Hard Mode</strong></u><br>We\
      \ have implemented a Hard Mode that comes along with a World 1 environment re-skin.<br>In\
      \ Hard Mode, the player can only take 5 damage (between 1 to 3 hits) and it's\
      \ game over.<br>It is strongly recommended to familiarize yourselves with the\
      \ controls using the standard mode.<br><br>---------<br>There will be other\
      \ free content updates in the form of new worlds, weapons and modes (how quickly\
      \ they are implemented is dependent on interest in the game).<br><br>Bug-fixed\
      \ and optimization updates: Our current priority is bug fixes and weapon optimization\
      \ - The sword attack gesture is rather restricted currently (only upward to\
      \ downward slashes) and the hammer needs better targeting. <br><br><u><strong>Planned\
      \ Content Updates </strong></u><br><strong>ii. World 3</strong> - Vote between\
      \ the following:<br>a. 'Bosses' only levels - where each enemy has more HP and\
      \ unique abilities<br>b. Different mechanics - player to battle in close combat\
      \ (room-scale style) and hop between different platforms<br><strong>iii. Multiplayer\
      \ Versus Mode</strong><br><br>We target to have World 3 up in a couple of months,\

    review: "https://youtu.be/UpLChtpbrUI\n\nI don't even know where to begin...\n\
      \nI'm at a loss of where to start to critique this. It's buggy, confusing and\
      \ generally not fun. It may only be $1.99 but this isn't something that is in\
      \ a state where it should be charged for yet. \n\nIt doesn't even feel like\
      \ a lot of effort was put into it. I can overlook some issues if it seems like\
      \ the dev/devs cared about the game. This just feels slapped together and tossed\
      \ out to make a buck.\n\nVR Gameplay 2/10 (swing your arm in front of you and\
      \ hope it activates your attack)\nVR Graphics 8/10 (It was pretty, kinda reminded\
      \ me of Kojimas Death Stranded trailer)\nAudio 6/10 (Out of place music and\
      \ repetitive sound effects that sometimes randomly went off for seemingly no\
      \ reason)\n\nLocomotion 1/10\nWeird pull the trigger then step to the side to\
      \ hop platform to platform. It was buggy and kept popping me up in the air.\
      \ If I was prone to motion sickness I have a feeling this game would have set\
      \ it off pretty badly."
