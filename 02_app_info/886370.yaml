    review: 'A game where you build a cell that can survive, grow and evolve.  The
      building process is fairly good with a good, but not great selection of building
      blocks.  There are several tiers in maybe 5 different categories that you unlock
      by spending DNA.  This includes mouths, spikes, guns type weapons, healing,
      armor, etc.  In a normal game you will gather both protein and DNA by eating
      food and supposedly by mating.  I never actually tried mating though as you
      would have to find a partner and line up the "mating" parts which did not seem
      worthwhile at all.  The building has some issues though, there needed to be
      ways to quickly drop many parts, invert pieces and such.  Building just gets
      cumbersome when you get to larger organisms.  A bigger problem is that after
      unlocking a higher tier (which means a different central cell), there is no
      way to swap out the main cell.  You have to remove the old one.  When you remove
      the central cell, every other part is also removed.  Very bad design as the
      building is already clunky.


      The game itself leaves a lot to be desired unfortunately.  The only game mode
      is a random map where you can tweak a few parameters like size, active disaster
      types and some other things which I don''t remember (temperature maybe?).  You
      can play these maps in a few ways but they are all multiplayer focused except
      one.  In the map you just swim around and survive by eating based on your mouth
      parts (find meat mainly by attacking or scavanging or plant matter lying around
      the map).  Fighting other cells or avoiding them and trying to stay alive is
      fun for a while, but it quickly wears out it''s welcome.  This process is sped
      up by one annoying bug where food can get stuck inside your creature.  This
      messes up your movement and when you get a bit bigger it happens very frequently
      and gets very frustrating.


      Other negatives is there is no sense of evolution.  You can change from a carnivore
      and to herbivore or from a tiny creature to a massive creature at will (assuming
      you accumulated enough protein and unlocked the parts already).  Also energy
      consumption is very unbalanced.  I found it impossible to keep energy levels
      up, even when constantly eating.  With no energy you take damage but it is slow
      so isn''t that big of deal.  The game even has fat reserves that can be accumulated
      when energy is maxed out, which was a joke.  I never once was able to get even
      a single point of reserved energy.  Maybe I was missing something but I don''t
      think so. Beyond that the cell building will often not let you put a cell where
      you think you should be able to.  I''m sure there is a reason but the editor
      doesn''t tell you anything at all.


      As a big fan of the cell stage in Spore I was really looking forward to this
      game but it just doesn''t have the fun of that.  It is a game with good ideas
      and some good pieces but just doesn''t have the polish and attention to detail
      it needed to be a game worth playing for more than a few hours.  It is not something
      I would recommend as anything more than a curiosity.'
