    review: "King of Volleyball is a visual novel developed and published by King\
      \ Key Games. \nEven though the description states that this is a yuri dating\
      \ sim, you get to know at the beginning of the game that the dev focused more\
      \ on activism than on the game. \n\n[h1]Please note that most of the game is\
      \ not a romantic comedy yuri dating sim, [/h1]contrary to the description it\
      \ is more like a visual novel about the problems which lesbians and asians face\
      \ with acceptance, written by a LGBTQ+ activist. \nThis game also isn't about\
      \ volleyball at all. While it is mentioned a few times, the main focus is a\
      \ lesbian couple. There are very few sex scenes, but buying the VN for this\
      \ is definitely not worth it.\n\n\nSo, this game is about two girls being in\
      \ a volleyball team, training for some big tournament. The both always had good\
      \ sync and compatibility, but this suddenly stopped. That's because the two\
      \ girls were in a relationship for about two years and just recently broke up.\
      \ \nYou, as the ex-volleyball-pro, are hired by the coach to solve the problems\
      \ they are facing, while she is unaware of the personal struggles the girls\
      \ are going through. \nRemember I mentioned sex scenes? Yeah, so this game is\
      \ about getting them back together. So how do you unlock the ecchi stuff? Right,\
      \ you completely ignore their broken relationship and instead hook up with one\
      \ of them. Great!\n\nThe UI is and looks horrible. \nOnce you're on the bad-looking\
      \ title screen you'll know what I mean. There are localisation issues and unintuitive\
      \ interface design. \n\nThe soundtrack is ok, while the one background you see\
      \ 70% of the game looks so bad. \nLike, imagine an talented artist drawing a\
      \ painting. Almost before he finished, he suddenly retires. Now, you force your\
      \ unpaid intern to draw the last corner of the image in paint. After 5 minutes\
      \ you decide that he could instead sort some documents and tell him to just\
      \ copy and paste the one bottle he drew a few ten times and you're ready to\
      \ go.\n\nDespite the mediocre-at-best background, the sprites actually look\
      \ pretty great... they don't fit the rest of the game at all though. Cute, clean\
      \ drawings are mixed with blurred real images. There is no consistency at all.\
      \ Settings can't be accessed in the settings menu, real pictures are mixed with\
      \ cute anime sprites, which are again mixed with another authors work... the\
      \ trailer is a pretty great example of this. \n\nHighlighting the speaking character\
      \ is a great Idea. I like it. \n\nMuch to my surprise, the game actually implemented\
      \ the I-Am-Very-Discriminated-Against-Parts pretty good. It doesn't feel as\
      \ forced as expected. \n\nHowever, the language... Urghhh. It's.. not just not\
      \ my cup of tea, I guess?\n\nIt feels pretty amateurish and awkward. And the\
      \ talking about sex... I'm not against being open about it, but is this how\
      \ 40-year-old women talk? I don't know. I just wish this had never happened.\
      \ \n\n\nSo, should you buy this game? No, definitely not. \nWhile the LGTBQ\
      \ stuff is actually quite good implemented, buying a game that has nothing else\
      \ to show off except for bad UI and miserable backgrounds is just not worth\
      \ it, even if you're into that stuff. \nNext time I would recommend the devs\
      \ to focus more on the actual game. This could have been a good game if they\
      \ had tried, but they didn't. And I'm not giving them credit if they think that\
      \ a message is enough to make a game good."
