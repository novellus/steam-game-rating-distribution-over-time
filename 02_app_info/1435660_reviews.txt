If you're playing on controller this game really fn sucks, you have to click push in the right to shoot and can't remap the controls to say something like right trigger? \n\nIt's fine on mouse and keyboard. \n\nGood job making sure all those 10 year olds get carpal tunnel by the time they're 20. Fix the controller support dev.\n\n*and I swear if you reply to this with \"Thanks!\" I'm refunding this game.","timestamp_created":1604989767,"timestamp_updated":1604989767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1606277647,"developer_response":"Hi.
