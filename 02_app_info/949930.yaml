    review: 'The only thing it has in common with PvZ is the playing field, as they
      want to compare themselves to PvZ I''ll also tell you why this game''s nowhere
      near that great game by referring to it.


      It started out with a nice tutorial to give you a nice understanding of the
      game mechanics.


      It didn''t all of a sudden decide to throw in gigantic hordes on the first playing
      field.


      It didn''t make it hard to see where you planted the plant, this game has humanoids
      to "plant" but the feet is not what decides where you "plantt" it, you have
      to check if the square is illuminated. (making the placement something you need
      to focus on rather than being easy)


      If anyone want to know how I can decide this is not up to snuff with very little
      time played I can tell you that I''ve spent a lot of hours with PvZ, enough
      time to survive a survival round long enough to basically only have supermutants
      - don''t remember name, the buffed version of the blokes with the gimp on the
      back - when I finally died... (I''ve finished it X times, I love that bloody
      game, it''s brilliant in it''s simplicity, this game comparing itself to it
      is an atrocity...)'
