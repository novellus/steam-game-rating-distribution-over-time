    review: 'Return Home is the perfect 5 minute game, stages are procedurally generated
      but familiar enough that you can work on strategies to up your score. Difficulty
      scales to your ability throughout the run. Solid aesthetic, fantastic soundtrack,
      tons of leaderboards to compete for. Then change it all up with Core mode for
      a new challenge.


      Best part is the original version of this game, Leave Home, is included in here
      as well. Since XBLA no longer exists, it''s great to have that game in my life
      again. Hello 2009!


      You can totally afford this game.'
