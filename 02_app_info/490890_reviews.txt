I cant wait till i see how part 2 will play and see what's instore for that one. \n\nThough im curious what song is playing when Len and Shino faces off with Tsuchigumo at the imperial Palace as for me it sounds very viking like though i could be wrong but it 100% caught me off guard and it sounds epic for a battle. Though the whole battle at the imperial Palace got me, i love it. \n\nLen has become scary in capture: Recounting, seriously this game is amazing! Emotional, and other sort of emotions at the same time. \n\nAll the music used in this game, perfect places set... I love this game, developers you deserved my money for this game.\n\n[h1] DISAPPOINTMENTS [/h1]\n\nNone.","timestamp_created":1610047356,"timestamp_updated":1610047356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxp+T7/YCe4+twQI="}
