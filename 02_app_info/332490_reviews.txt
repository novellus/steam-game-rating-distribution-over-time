Perfect? No. Their vision, as with many game designers, is somewhat limited. Still, the VR support is good. Being able to play with a buddy on a normal screen at the same time: great.\n\nA good majority of the gameplay is eyeballing ranges which is about as fun as it sounds. Damage to systems is relatively random for you but on the hardest AI difficulty you can count on always being on the receiving end of major damage with every salvo. Not actually a game killer..so long as you're playing the allies. The axis are an unplayable doomed faction in the \"historical\" mode while you'd be a fool to lose with the allies on any difficulty.\n\nBuy only on sale. 6/10","timestamp_created":1584695434,"timestamp_updated":1609306609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41sKJ2fYCeIq2+QE="}
