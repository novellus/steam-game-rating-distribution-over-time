    review: 'Quite boring game. It has almost no sounds, nothing ever happens, not
      scary, walking speed is soooo slow (can''t run). And then the gameplay is also
      very boring and tedious. First you have to get in the school by first finding
      the right street to it, then finding the key for the school and entering it.
      Then the real game starts where you basically do the same thing 4 times. On
      every of the 4 floors you have to go into the teachers room, get the key for
      the classrooms. Go into the classrooms, get the key for the next teachers room
      and repeat. Then get the exams in the last room and leave the school. The End.

      Wow. Great game concept.'
