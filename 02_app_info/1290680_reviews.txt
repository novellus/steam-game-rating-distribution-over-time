Cute visuals and artstyle, charming characters, a catchy soundtrack good for pretty much anything, fun and simplistic gameplay, and up to 4 players to play with! \nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is very simple and easy to get a grasp of as it doesn't require you to do much and only requires good positioning, movement, and supply management! It really boils down to when you should start throwing snowballs or when to start making more. This simple gameplay makes choosing a characters fairly easy as there's only a few key things to worry about, how much damage each character does, how fast each character is, how much snow they can hold, and their EX attack! (all of this information is directly shown to you in the character select screen!)\nCharacters:\nThe characters are all cute and full of life! as mentioned before every character has unique stats you can view on the CSS (character select screen) and are all balanced and fun to play!\nCharacter rundowns:\nYukky is a character for players who just want a balanced and honest jack of all trades, them EX allows them to throw a big snowball that bounces across the screen and is good for any form of gameplay!\nMizore is for players who want a character who's quick and tricky with and EX attack that summons 2 copies of her that will throw snowballs along with them\nRed is a character for people who like to rushdown and get things done quick with big damage with their EX attack that allows her to throw explosive snowballs!\nIgloo is a character for people who like to play tanks in games and play like a brick wall, to make up for their low speed, they have a high attack and 4 slots for their snow! and their EX attack is a big beam that goes across the screen. However, they are very easy to rushdown from their lack of mobility.\nSnorbo is the exact opposite of Igloo, hes very fast but does little damage and can only hold 2 snowballs, his EX attack allows him to move very fast and ram into others!\nAicy is for players who want to play safe and far away, they have low speed and a low amount of slots for snow but their EX ability is a homing snowball with great damage.\nStages: at the moment of writing this, there are only 3 stages in the game and each are different variations of \"flat plain with platforms\"\nWhat I personally think the game needs:\n- A proper tutorial, as the game does not have one at the time of writing this.\n- Online play, at the time of writing this the game only supports 1v1 with a CPU and 4-player fights. It would be nice to have an online experience for the game so it can gain more replay value and a bigger scene\n- An in-game options menu, explains itself, really\n- An in-game button to close the game, at the moment you can only use force quits to close the game \n- More stages, 3 stages is fine, but it could really use more to diversify gameplay\n- Team battles, a 2v2 mode would be great for more diversified gameplay styles\n- Items, as fun as the game is stand-alone i feel that items could help the game become more interesting from a casual standpoint \n- 4 player VS CPU\n- And finally, a training mode for players to practice the game and get a grip of what to do and how the game feels \nTLDR:\nThe game is a cute and simple indie fighter and no too complicated (something akin to Smash Bros, Nair or Stickfight the game) and has a diverse roster of characters that lacks a few key elements\nI recommend the game for simply having fun and goofing around with friends but for a competitive e-sport?... only half honestly, if the game updates and adds what I listed in the \"What I personally think the game needs\" section then 100% it could have some pretty good potential!\nIf I missed anything in this review or said something wrong and you'd like to add on to it, please reply to this review correcting me!","timestamp_created":1598639415,"timestamp_updated":1598639415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47bOVm/QCc+qungI="}
