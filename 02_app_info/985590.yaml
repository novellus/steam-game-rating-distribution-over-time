    review: "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I]  More Mid-Level Platforming/Metroidvanias\
      \ who want a down to earth project[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nA one man project\
      \ is always a hard hill to climb, especially in the current indie game landscape.\
      \ With so many games out there, it's hard to stand out even when a game , while\
      \ having flaws, pales compared to even other indie game projects out there.\
      \ Necrolepsy however does enough to be worth its 10 dollar price tag, with the\
      \ idea of where the project has come from. There's some good core elements with\
      \ the psuedo combo system here, and there's a good understand of the basics\
      \ of platforming action. It is rough around the edges, as certain enemies can\
      \ easily be cheesed and there are some effects that can cause some motion sickness\
      \ (however as I write this its being changed in an upcoming patch). There's\
      \ some ideas that don't entirely work mind you: the nightmare mode doesn't feel\
      \ like its really taking advantage of the idea, and sometimes the game can be\
      \ a little bit easy.\n\nWith that said, the game has this sorta newgrounds+flash\
      \ charm that you can't help but start to smile at. Certain enemies are straight\
      \ forward, but it also feels like they were built from the ground up, influenced\
      \ by games like Mega Man and Castlevania, but built by the creators two hands.\
      \ Lira is a goofy protagonist and there are goofy villians, and yet you sit\
      \ there cracking smiles left and right. The fact that updates for problems have\
      \ come at a steady rate shows a developer that's definitely listening to feedback,\
      \ and is wanting to make a game that people enjoy. It's not going to blow you\
      \ out of the water, but it's also going to make you appreciate the work put\
      \ in. It's solid control wise and the mechanics all work and do provide for\
      \ some higher level skill play, especially with the idea of combos toward the\
      \ mid segments of the game.\n\nIt's a game that you should try the demo out\
      \ for, and if you enjoy it, definitely give the game a try. \n\n\n[b]Video Review:\
      \ [/b]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCOGxK9Ccm0 \n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n\
      [list]\n[*] A charming style and quirky writing style leads to a game that you\
      \ want to succeed, even if its rough around the edges. \n[*] Good basic enemy\
      \ design and style while keeping low key in terms of the design itself (not\
      \ overly flashy)\n[*] You can tell that a dedication was put into certain animations,\
      \ and the game can be really cool when showing off these.\n[*] Core world design\
      \ and mechanics do the job and the game is appropriately priced.\n[*] Controls\
      \ do well for the world created here. \n[*] Do like a boss battle or two even\
      \ if they may be considered on the easy side.\n[*] Like our main character and\
      \ the idea of necrolepsy is an interesting one that drives the plot home.\n\
      [*] Like the secondary weapons and their basic uses.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n\
      [list]\n[*] There's an overall lack of oompf at times, the game does show its\
      \ roots as a first game by a solo developer. \n[*]  Rough around the edges with\
      \ little glitches here and there, that the dev is addressing, but it's something\
      \ that you keep on running into.\n[*] The necrolepsy timer needs more oompf\
      \ to it in the normal mode to make it feel like an actual threat. \n[*] I admit\
      \ I completely forgot that I had a stun weapon until the dev literally told\
      \ me about it. Stunning feels overpowered at times.\n[*] You're not exactly\
      \ sure what items do without going to the in-game store, and overall there's\
      \ more description that can be used in general.\n[*] The in-game map not showing\
      \ doors can be really confusing especially when exploration doesn't seem to\
      \ be one of the games themes with the timer element.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you\
      \ want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.\
