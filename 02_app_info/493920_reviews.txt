If they added controller support, extra levels and achievements, I don't have trouble imagining a boost in sales.\n\n[h1]A Real Life Problem, Turned Into a Game[/h1]\nThis is based on the real-life problem of landmines, and the problems they create when left behind after wars (or \"police actions\" or whatever sham euphemism we call them). \n\nYou play as a strange, padded ball thing and have to roll through the levels, setting off the mines while using the force they create to propel yourself in various directions. There doesn't appear to be any sort of score-keeping, or benefits to getting all the mines or doing it in the shortest possible times, but that didn't stop me from barreling through and decidedly not hating the time I was spending.\n\nAt the end of each level, you'll get a random factoid about landmines in real life. Heck, at the start of each level it's a child that gives you your initial push to get on your way. So, it has a nice touch of humanity to it. If they ever decide to expand on this, having these take place in real life locations (or facsimiles) that have these problems would be even better. (Though I imagine there'd be less convenient hills and such for momentum.)\n\nDefinitely a worthy contribution to the bundle.","timestamp_created":1589059929,"timestamp_updated":1589059929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543007016181945801","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4usjW/fECebvbhgI="}
