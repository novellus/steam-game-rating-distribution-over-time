Stunning world and level design, great graphics and atmosphere. Controls take a while to get used to but movement becomes very smooth and intuitive after a while. Awesome soundtrack too.","timestamp_created":1587316449,"timestamp_updated":1587316449,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47tvbyfECfduCggI="}
