    review: 'WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!


      Have you ever wished Zelda was a versus tennis game?? THE WAIT IS OVER.


      This game is a seriously good way to kill an afternoon. Lots of subtle references
      to classic NES games like Dragon Warrior. Great mechanics. Very balanced so
      far.


      This may be in my Top 10 games of the last few years. Grab a fren and have a
      go!'
