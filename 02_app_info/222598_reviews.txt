DTG made some adjustments to this pack to keep cost down but also make it much simpler.\nWhile you have to complete the entire startup procedure on real ExpertLine locomotives, you are pretty much ready to go with this one. However, there are other, much more severe changes.\nIn real life, the BR111 is driven using a power wheel with 28 acceleration levels. However, DTG watered this version down by instead implementing a standard lever control, like on the DBbzf or more modern locomotives. So, if you're going for realism, you're better off with the official vR ExpertLine variant.\n\nPros:\n+Many variants and liveries of the BR111 and Dostos\n+PZB and SiFa\n+ZZA control\n+very nice sounds\n+detailed manual on controls and backstory\n+driving the locomotive feels very good\nCons:\n-Lever control on the 111 instead of a power wheel\n-dynamic numbering does not seem to work properly on the orient red 111s (as can be seen on image 9 of this DLC page)","timestamp_created":1597972698,"timestamp_updated":1597972698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuYqmh/QCcdPenAI="}
