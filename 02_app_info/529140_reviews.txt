The good news is that they have plans to work on some of those improvements to give us all a better experience.\n\nIf you enjoy games that have a cultural background as well as fighting games, I'd recomment it. \n\nNOTE: This game is fcking hard to grasp, and even harder to master. So, if you're looking for a challenge, you're up for it.\n\nGOOD LUCK IN TRYING TO WIN YOUR FIRST MATCH \n\nPS: Hey devs, that should be a good achievement to implement, haha!","timestamp_created":1491301814,"timestamp_updated":1491301814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505358576774597168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw7/mgnNsCeKGDdg=="}
