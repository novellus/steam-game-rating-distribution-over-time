    review: 'I really like this! I''m currently making my first RPG game themed around
      pirates, so i thought this music pack would fit in perfectly.


      Set Sail is pretty good.

      I gotta say, Seaside Inn sounds really good out of everything that is in here.

      Island Hideaway makes me want to think about a small island with a friendly
      tribe living on it. Good too.


      That''s it for this review.'
