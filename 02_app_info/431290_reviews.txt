That's what this game feels like all the time. This is a rare case for me, an Indie game that isn't terrible but is actually pretty damn fun. (Seriously, look at my other reviews, this doesn't happen much). I can honestly say I really enjoy this game despite its issues. Highly recommended (for me anyway). Price point may be a bit high for some though since I'm not sure if there's much replay value,  a community level editor would make this a much better proposition for the price.  \n\nTechnicals: Not much to speak of, no fullscreen/windowing options, you can toggle music and sfx on or off and you can use gamepad or mouse and keyboard (I recommend gamepad, mouse and keyboard requires you to control the character with clicks like an rts which is very awkward, a wasd and arrow keys system would have been better). Oh and nothing is remappable.\n\nGameplay: You control Gary and try to evade coworkers and security guards as you sneak your way into work late. You hit a gameover when you are spotted by somebody (unless you just skirt their vision for a split second). The \"enemies\" have a cone of sight like in many games and you need to evade them. \n\nThis can be done by simply learning their movement patterns and dodging them, to using the environment to hide (vents, closets, toilets etc.) , to even sabotage. Sabotage how? Well you can break their equipment to distract them, chuck erasers so they look in that direction, knock em out, OR (my favourite) give them an overdose of laxatives -insert maniacal laugh-\n\nThe gameplay feels very smooth and it does get complicated at some points, I'll openly admit there was a couple points in the hour and I half I have played so far just raging. Oh, and did I mention boss fights? There are boss fights in this office lmao. These boss fights use mechanics you've already seen but in a way that feels much less like you're advancing a level than legitimately duking it out with the boss and it's great. \n\nBesides that there are little collectible figures, essentially pop figures with alternate names and some quirky descriptions. As well as secrets, these are hidden behind safes which require you to locate hints hidden throughout the level, on the first couple levels this is simply a case of spotting numbers hidden in plain sight around the level but later on it does become more difficult.  \n\nMusic/sound: Pretty enjoyable, the pacing is good and suited to the game and I do enjoy some of the tracks quite a bit. The sfx are decent enough, the one issue I have in this department is the fact that you can hear the employees using printers when they are waaaay off screen, no matter the size of the level you can always hear printers being used from the other side. It's not a huge issue but it does detract from the music a little.  \n\nGraphics: Pretty simple, nothi9ng flashy about it. Runs smoothly at 60 locked. \n\nOf course there are a couple bugs that do need addressing: \n1- I have multiple monitors and f0r some weird reason this game does not play in the primary but in my third monitor all the way on the left, this means if I were to play on mouse and keyboard I'd be at a very awkward angle. There's no in-game option to window the game so you need to alt+enter to window it then move it to your primary and alt+enter again to have it play on the right monitor. \n\n2 - On gamepad there's a button that will zoom in the camera and lock it there, I can't figure out how to zoom back out despite mashing all the buttons, this is fixable with a restart. \n\nFully recommend, this is honestly very, very fun for me. Nice pacing, it's got some difficulty behind it at some points, and the dialogue is quirky. I do honestly think using a gamepad will make the game feel much smoother though.","timestamp_created":1455266790,"timestamp_updated":1602109925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.440063804388046265","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46KzMgvUCcsXVUA=="}
