    about_the_game: "Anti-tank warfare arose as a result of the need to develop technology\
      \ and tactics to destroy tanks during World War I. Since the first tanks were\
      \ developed by the Triple Entente in 1916 but not operated in battle until 1917,\
      \ the first anti-tank weapons were developed by the German Empire. The first\
      \ developed anti-tank weapon was a scaled-up bolt-action rifle, the Mauser 1918\
      \ T-Gewehr that fired a 13mm cartridge with a solid bullet that could penetrate\
      \ the thin armor of tanks of the time and destroy the engine or ricochet inside\
      \ killing occupants. Because tanks represent an enemy's greatest force projection\
      \ on land, anti-tank warfare has been incorporated into the doctrine of nearly\
      \ every combat service since. Most predominant anti-tank weapons at the start\
      \ of World War II were the tank-mounted gun, anti-tank guns and anti-tank grenades\
      \ used by the infantry as well as ground-attack aircraft.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      The DLS contains 2 unique fighters with anti-tank weapons."
