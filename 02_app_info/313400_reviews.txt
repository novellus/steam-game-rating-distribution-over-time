Can't play it...[/h1]\n\nGreat concept, packed with fast paced action, unique and clever \"rotation\" mechanic, nice soundtrack and... everything in blue... literally everything.\nI can't keep track of the enemies due this, bullets are ease to dodge, but the enemies themselves and the hazards keep f@cking me.\nAlso, for some unknow reason, the Xbox controller does not work (a minor inconvenience since the keyboard is Ok for this game).\nStill recommended, since it's not the games fault my lack of concentration thanks to vitreous detachment in my eyeballs.","timestamp_created":1609013133,"timestamp_updated":1609013133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47P+p0PYCf4rAvQI="}
