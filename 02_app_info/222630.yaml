    about_the_game: "The \u2018teddy bear\u2019 of diesel-hydraulic locomotives is\
      \ now available for Train Simulator in its original British Rail Green livery.<br><br>The\
      \ single six-cylinder engine locomotives were built in the mid-1960s by BR\u2019\
      s Swindon Works, with the intention of working in shunting yards and short distance\
      \ freight trains. Initially, 26 models were ordered in January 1963, expanded\
      \ to 56 later that year. The mid-cab locomotives resembled the Clayton Type\
      \ 1 (Class 17), but had a fixed wheel configuration \u2013 0-6-0 \u2013 rather\
      \ than bogies.<br><br>The Class had an extremely short working life, not because\
      \ of reliability but mainly because the duties for which they were originally\
      \ intended starting to diminish. However, their usefulness as shunting engines\
      \ and top speed of 40mph (64 km/h) saw many sold to private industries such\
      \ as iron and coal companies.<br><br>The disappearance of these industries saw\
      \ many models move to preserved railways in the UK, with five being exported\
      \ to Belgium and Spain. Unusually, D9504 was leased in 2005 from the Kent &amp;\
      \ East Sussex Railway to work on High Speed 1 around London, marshalling construction\
      \ trains used during building of the route.<br><br>The Class 14 for Train Simulator\
      \ is a former Iron Horse House model, which has been updated to TS2014 standard,\
      \ including new scenarios and improved exterior modelling. The locomotive is\
