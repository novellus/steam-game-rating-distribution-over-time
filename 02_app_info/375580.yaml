      \ attempted, with modern survival games, is the sense of seriousness to escape\
      \ in a period of time. Three Days gives a new perspective on urgency by adding\
      \ a 72 hour - three days - time limit allowing the player to get involved in\
      \ gameplay with an incentive to escape. We have fine-tuned ThreeDays to suit\
      \ most players without it being impossible,and for the more casual players we\
      \ have created an endless mode which has no time limit allowing a less intense\
      \ experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Unique creation system-</strong></h2><br>Three\
      \ Days has its own unique crafting system: simply take a movable resource and\
      \ drag it onto another resource to see what you can create. No inventory, no\
      \ fuss.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Procedurally generated islands-</strong></h2><br>The\
      \ game includes islands that are randomly generated every time you play allowing\
      \ diverse gameplay every time it\u2019s played. Not only this, but each island\
      \ has its own original name and generation and all resources that are generated\
      \ on the island will be placed elsewhere.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Stats-system-</strong>\
      \ </h2><br>Three Days contains a dynamic ever changing stats system, where the\
      \ player is in constant need of attention to survive which is achievable by\
      \ looking after the players hunger hydration and temperature. The system is\
      \ ever changing is and the player is always in a new procedurally generated\
      \ island, meaning different amounts of resources and different weather effects\
      \ to survive with.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Auto-mine-</strong></h2><br>The\
      \ automine mechanic was influenced by playing other games with different mechanics\
      \ requiring the player to hit or hold a button to break and collect resources.\
      \ Personally, I disliked this system and wondered how I could do it differently\
      \ and came up with the automine feature. The player is simply brought over to\
      \ the resource desired to break and it will automatically start to break.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Upgrade/levelling system-</strong></h2><br>ThreeDays\
      \ also allows you to collect experience from breaking primary resources such\
      \ as trees and boulders, this allows level ups and PPs (Perk Points) which can\
      \ be spent on 15 different upgrades for the character, such as killing and catching\
      \ fish without a rod to slowing the timer down. The level system will also directly\
      \ affect the player\u2019s fate at the end of the game via 4 cutscenes.<br><br><img\

    review: "Game has potential, but it's current state is much of an early access,\
      \ because there is many bugs and exploits and things that needs to be reworked.\n\
      \nThe main objective of the game is to build a boat withing 72 hours and GTFO\
      \ from the island.\n\nThe tutorial in main menu instantly drops you in game\
      \ after you read everything, without allowing you to choose what mode you wish\
      \ to play. Also, in my opinion, tutorial would be more better if it was a mini-level\
      \ where you do step-by-step crafting to learn the basics. \n\nThe crafting system\
      \ is complex and you don't know what to craft first - i recommend before jumping\
      \ into game to have a look into craft sheet in the main menu and ignore warnings\
      \ to see the basic stuff you need to survive the first night, i.e. at least\
      \ learn how to craft campfire and spear. \n\nAt day you're free to explore and\
      \ find a perfect spot to build a base and get some food, and by base i mean\
      \ a location with plenty of woods and rocks around and set up a campfire that\
      \ will scare the night monsters away from it.\nThe speach bubbles of main characters\
      \ hints what materials you must combine together to craft something but it is\
      \ pretty random and sometimes annoying because the game HUD is pretty large\
      \ and you cant see much things around you.\nSo, coming back to crafting, it\
      \ would be much better if at least the bubbles would show images instead of\
      \ text because reading takes longer time and time here running extremely fast\
      \ and you dont have such time to think. Besides there is a bug happening where\
      \ your character literally spams a lot of different texts in one speech sequence,\
      \ and the bubble itself change colors like green when its day but its actually\
      \ night.\n\nPressing Escape button during the game doesn't pause the game, it\
      \ still keeps running even in background leaving you vulnerable even in easy\
      \ mode. There is no saving features as well.\n\nThe combat is just crafting\
      \ a spear or spikes, hold them with LMB and aim at your enemies while keeping\
      \ them at distance. That's it. Often you might lose the spear on the ground\
      \ due to the limited range of dragging the items but you can find it with a\
      \ tether between the character and the item when you're close.\n\nSome objects\
      \ in game are really small and hard to see, like fish scale and glue. I think\
      \ adding the background color behind them like shadow or icon might help to\
      \ see them.\n\nAnd few more bugs i've encountered during gameplay:\n-I've managed\
      \ to craft a boat and it had that windows saying \"press E to escape\", but\
      \ spamming E led to nothing, big dissapointing bug. But i've managed to replay\
      \ again pretty simple on easy and normal modes about 4 times, it worked;\n-The\
      \ daytime should be much longer and the skills that slows time should be removed,\
      \ because in the night, the creatures that run away from lights are hanging\
      \ on the edge of the light radius trying to get you if you're close enough,\
      \ and because its so easy to kill them that way, you can get huge EXP drops\
      \ and unlock all skills in 5 minutes, including those that slows time by ~50%\
      \ and this thing leads to the very very very long first night. This is problematic\
      \ for the shark spawn rates that drops material needed for escaping;\n- Creatures\
      \ killed in night respawns very often near the player and manage to successfully\
      \ attack the player before retreating;\n-Also if you wander from the campfire\
      \ in night you might see that those creatures are not afraid of lights at all,\
      \ they walk bravely around the base and they only becomes afraid if you're close\
      \ to it and run away;\n-Walls do nothing;\n-fishing nets are almost useless,\
      \ i mean it kills small fishes when they bumb into it (sometimes) but i was\
      \ thinking it could collect fish over time and make stuff easier;\n-Collected\
      \ pages menu have duplicates among them;\n-Ending scenes does not unlock in\
      \ main menu unlockables;\n\nHard mode is currently impossible because you start\
      \ at starving and dehydrated state (and put in dying state in 10 seconds) with\
      \ slow movement speed and you die like in ~20 seconds which is actually the\
      \ time to walk to the closest tree/rock, break it down and craft a shovel //\
      \ spear, it's pure RNG that the tree and the rock will spawn near campfire.\n\
      \nAnother  thing is that you can die randomly by a thunder during rains, which\
      \ is annoying when you almost done building stuff.\n\nOverall, i like it. I\
      \ think it can be better. So far it's interesting."
