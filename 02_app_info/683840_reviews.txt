One that doesn't really require any thought as the game will do the fighting for you.  The other mode is the standard dodge and shoot.  This game is OK for little kids but otherwise I got bored really fast.  If your under 12 or buying this game for someone else of that general age then I'd recommend this game.\n","timestamp_created":1568998486,"timestamp_updated":1568998486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/53mp+0CcdvJ0gE="}
