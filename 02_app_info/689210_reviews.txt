The various displays are just scenes that have been given depth by separating the various parts kind of like a pop-up novelty greeting card, but the effect is good. The museum is very nicely done. It only took a few minutes to race around and have a quick look at most of the displays, and I don't know about replay value, but it does seem like a great way to introduce guests and friends to the ability of VR to take you to places and let you experience some cool stuff. I'll definitely go back in to see it in more detail.","timestamp_created":1518916325,"timestamp_updated":1518916444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575835466384887695","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9rOe0+ECeYWhmQE="}
