It is not usable. I have tried to talk to STEAM, they say the problem is not of their creation and to contact help.ea.com. When I try to message help.ea.com they will only speak to \"active subscribers.\" The phone numbers they have listed do not work. Even though I am unable to use the subscription STEAM will not refund my money because I have had the \"potential\" to use the subscription.\n\nUPDATE: It is now 04 January 2021:  Finally, after sending a copy of my receipt to support@swotor.com they replied and changed my status to subscriber. They were also helpful in pointing out that people in the EU are entitled to a refund within 14 days of subscription, even though STEAM says no. They are are working to resolve the problem which kept me from subscribing with them originally. I will continue to do it through them but not STEAM. This will be ONLY a platform for keeping a library of non-MMO games which I own. I have lost my faith in STEAM to maintain a balance between profitability and how to best serve the customer. Shame on you STEAM.","timestamp_created":1609253454,"timestamp_updated":1609763737,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":30,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.647206664085388184","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42qnZ5vYCdqK7vgI="}
