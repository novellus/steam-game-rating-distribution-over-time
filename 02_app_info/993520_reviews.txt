You have a guidebook that is meant to take you through puzzles, and our intention was to have one person playing the game, and another person working off the guide on their tablet or printed out.\n\nIn reality the puzzles just amount to pushing button sequences that are given to you directly in the book. The biggest challenge comes from figuring out where to go, since the map is unclear and there is no compass.\n\nIf you do try this game and don't want to use the in-game guide, be sure to download it *off the company's website*, because the PDF included with the game is out of date.","timestamp_created":1598750982,"timestamp_updated":1598750982,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.588477373123168945","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9/++nvQCe6nRngI="}
