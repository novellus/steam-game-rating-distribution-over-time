    review: "The game I didn't know I needed.\n\nI picked this game up for probably\
      \ 10 bucks for og xbox when Blockbuster was going belly up and never really\
      \ played it. I saw it on steam and thought I'd give it another go.  I was not\
      \ expecting to have so much fun. \nThere is a bit of a complicated upgrade system\
      \ I don't think I fully understood back in the day, Maybe that is why I didn't\
      \ get too far then,  but everything seems to be clicking now.  It is far more\
      \ tactical than it is Hack and slash.  I really enjoy luring enemies into sappers\
      \ traps, or burning them out with my archers' flaming arrows."
