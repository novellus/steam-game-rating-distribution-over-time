      Cube Pet: Some claim it''s a magical item and not a pet at all. But don''t fall
      into that trap! After all, who are we to say that it has no beating heart or
      soul? Well, ok, I suppose that ticking sound could be a bomb ready to blow up
      in your face at any moment... But isn''t adopting it the best way of knowing
      for sure? Whatever it is, this strange pet will follow you to all four corners
      of the World of Twelve and will be a valuable ally when you have to square off
      against your enemies. <br>This is a ceremonial pet which can be placed over
      another, already-equipped pet to change its appearance.<br><br>- Armorred Dragoturkey
      mountpet: If your Dragoturkey was never really all that bright, now it can at
      least dazzle your enemies with its shiny chest plate! This mount gives you 5%
      on all your resistances and plus 50% power at maximum level<br><br>- Lagomorph
      set: Thankfully, Cawwots awe still pwesent in the Wowld of Twelve. You wouldn''t

      hat (cape) to change its appearance.<br><br>- Wabbit Haven Bag: With this kit,
      you can have a 100% Wabbit-themed Haven Bag! Just watch out for Wabbit predators,

      will automatically be added to your Haven Bag interface. Please note, this Haven
      Bag theme is permanently linked to your account.<br><br>- Pre-sentient potion:
      This potion makes mounts Globally Pre-Sentient, giving them the ability to reach
      destinations shown to them automatically. Your mount is able to take the various
      shortcuts permitted in the game. If entering an area requires you to speak to
      an in-game character, use a Zaap, or be in certain areas (for example, Dark
      Vlad''s Maze), your mount won''t be smart enough to do so!<br>On use:<br> --Applies
      the Autopilot Potion to your mount<br> --Your mount gains the ability to automatically
      travel from point A to point B<br> --Open the world map and right-click on your
      destination of choice<br>The Autopilot Potion cannot be used on petsmounts,
      as these are not considered mounts.<br><br>- Sewin Shield: This shield is made
      from many magical threads, whose colours change depending on the bearer''s mood
      and health. When they''re fighting fit, the shield is solid and radiant. On
      the other hand, if ever you should suffer from nasty stomachache or gangrene,
      for example, avoid holding it, because nobody wants to see that.<br>(Place this
      shield over another, already-equipped shield to change its appearance.)<br><br>-
      New Life Bundle: The sun is coming back, the little creatures are out of their
      dens, and the flora blooms in thousands of colors: spring is back! It''s time
      to get your adventurer life back together... The New Life Bundle is a DOFUS
      service pack that will allow you to change colors, name, and sex without having
      to start over.'
