    review: 'This was worth it only with a discount.

      It''s a very short, yet challenging game.

      But in the end: It is all about potatoes.

      Is game about potatoes good or isn''t?

      Well, that''s hard to say, but it''s funny.

      Some weak players will just rage quit.

      Others will surely reach the very end.

      It''s hard, so be prepared for the pain.

      Potatoman deserves a positive review.

      And the supporter pack gets one too.

      It''s a cheap game, so they need cash.

      That''s understandable: Enjoy it, devs.

      The artworks and gifs are also pretty.'
