    review: "Great game in general, but it suffers from many possible difficulty spikes\
      \ in form of mini games. I managed to get pass through most of the game, but\
      \ the giant robo beat'em'up mini game in chapter 21 might be the worst content\
      \ blocker i have ever encountered:\n\n- Controls are janky as hell, very hard\
      \ to read which action leads to which outcome. Sometimes, it feels like inputs\
      \ are not registered at all.\n- The fight feels very unbalanced. Some phases\
      \ can be cheesed by repeating the same action infinitely, in other phases my\
      \ health bar depleted in a few seconds due to the seemingly unstoppable \"special\
      \ attack\" of the enemy.\n-  The \"tutorial\"  before the fight does not care\
      \ if you actually unterstood the fighting mechanics, it just lets you input\
      \ all possible actions 3 times each and then proceeds. Even worse, the tutorial\
      \ cannot be repeated once the fight has started even after reloading the game,\
      \ making it very hard to come back after (rage-)quitting the game.\n- It looks\
      \ awful and feels anticlimactic. This game has some very sweet pixel art, but\
      \ the 3D models of the robots are rather ugly. \n- It demands a completely different\
      \ skillset than the rest of the game. Yes, there already were many mandatory\
      \ mini games to complete, but these were either pretty easy or at least easy\
      \ to understand. I have not much \"classic\" beat'em'up experience, and the\
      \ game did not imply for 15 hours that they would be required to beat the game."
