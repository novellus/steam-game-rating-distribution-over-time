      \ pig is picking up coins at levels, passing extermination of biting dogs and\
      \ trying not to fall from the ledge down. At each level there is a disabled\
      \ portal, which will turn on by collecting good enough coins on level. There\
      \ is only one life for a pig, so be careful. On the other hand, the mumps can\
      \ shoot, make a double jump even from the wall, and even change color.<br />\r\
      \n\_The game can be attributed to a rather complex. Therefore, the game provides\
      \ control from the keyboard as well as from the gamepad for greater convenience\
      \ in the game.<br />\r\n\_\_"

    review: 10/10 the best game ever made, was distraught at first but then i saw
      there was a shooting mechanic in the game and now im busting fat nuts everyday
      on the little unprepared creatures that stand in my way, truly one of the only
      games to beat breath of the wild for me. thank you you've changed my entire
      perception of reality. my life has never been better.
