    review: 'I spent a dollar so I could write this warning-

      THIS IS THE SECOND SEASON.


      The anime itself is amazing, with the first season featuring possibly the best
      bromance of all time, and this season exploring family, life and death, and
      ageing in a beautifully unique way.

      For a slower-paced anime, it really has a lot of depth to it, and I''d recommend
      it to anyone.


      However, I probably wouldn''t recommend you start at the second season. That
      way lies spoilers.

      Go watch the first season online or something.'
