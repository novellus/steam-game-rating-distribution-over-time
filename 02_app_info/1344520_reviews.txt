As I mentioned in original review, I thought the team may have launched and left. As you can see with the latest update I am happily wrong! I am actually very excited and pumped to see this update and that the team is building on this foundation. The game has SERIOUS POTENTIAL, to be one epic RPG. Time will tell but they made me a believer and more important a player.","timestamp_created":1597263552,"timestamp_updated":1599811271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548251748085021973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1601662901,"developer_response":"Edit: Thank you, that is such nice feedback! :) You can be sure that we are always working on the game. Here it has only begun.\n\nWe are sorry that you don't like the current state of the game.\nThere will be an environment and graphics update first that we gonna release in the next coming days. As mentioned on our steam page a gameplay/combat bug fix etc. update is in the making and will follow a bit later.\n\nThe current gameplay is only a rough design of what is planned.\nDue to the difficult times everything has been more delayed than expected but our silence was just for the time being.\n\nFeel free to drop us any kind of suggestions here or on Facebook.\n\nThanks for being a part of this! Please lean back and watch how the game develops!"}],"cursor":"AoJ4ldeLvvQCfoyJmwI="}
