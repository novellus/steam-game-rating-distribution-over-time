You fight endless waves of enemies, and you can to explore the map to find new weapons and ammo while trying to survive. There are very many weapons to choose from, and you can also upgrade your weapons in the shop or find upgrades in the map! It's very satisfying and addictive to run around and loot weapon upgrades, armor plates and max HP upgrades while killing the enemies that just keep getting stronger and increase in number with each wave. You also have the option to run around and loot between the waves in 60 seconds of peace, or run to the shop to spend your well earned money for upgrades and ammo. There are also a wide variety of enemies, and the enemies can spawn with a different color from time to time, meaning that the enemy is upgraded with more health, speed, or damage output. If you like FPS survival games, I strongly recommend this game!","timestamp_created":1608709674,"timestamp_updated":1608709674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwbKkx/YCfpixvAI="}
