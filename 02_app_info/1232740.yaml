    review: 'The music is virbrant and chill! Super worth it if you are already a
      fan of the series.

      I bought this music so I can  play it on my background as it makes me reminds
      of the

      times playing the amazing Potion Commotion and it feels super awesome to chill
      out while listening to this.'
