Labyrinthine is a tense otherworldly nightmare that shares it's DNA with Silent Hill, Amnesia, and nightmare induced night sweats. The game combines otherworldly creatures that defy description with puzzles that inspire coarse language in both success and failure, and is handily one of my favorite things I've played in quite some time. My only complaint is that there isn't more of it yet, with yet being the operative word here. If you like supporting video games as an art form, or if you like using your brain, or if you like sweating so hard you could short out your mouse, this is the game for you. 10/10, will beat the absolute brakes off of this game.","timestamp_created":1609909154,"timestamp_updated":1609909154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwjYaE6/YCfsb0wAI="}
