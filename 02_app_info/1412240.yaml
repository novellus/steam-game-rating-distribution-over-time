    about_the_game: "Welcome to Lombardi's World. You will die here, but you'll have\
      \ some fun. You and your friends must band together to explore, complete puzzles,\
      \ and fight enemies with the ultimate goal of defeating Chris Lombardi of Matador\
      \ Records.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game takes place in a surreal world where\
      \ Matador Records rules over all inhabitants. At the helm of this bleak tyranny\
      \ is none other than Chris Lombardi. Matador records must be stopped, and it\
      \ is up to three heroes to defeat them! Trait, Tommy and Stoney must work together\
      \ using their unique hero abilities to conquer evil enemies and solve difficult\
      \ puzzles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can expect to have many intense PvE battles\
      \ as well as PvP if you so choose. There are also large world macro-based puzzles\
      \ and obstacle courses that are necessary to complete. And of course the final\
      \ showdown between your team and Chris Lombardi!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game\
      \ is played entirely online. Players will join or host a server in which they\
      \ can have many other friends join and band together to win! <br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nBE WARNED: This game was mostly coded by a MUSICIAN and the quality of the\
      \ game reflects that. It has some bugs that I just couldn't figure out how to\
      \ fix, but I assure you it is possible to beat. It tends to run very poorly\
      \ on MAC LAPTOPS because I spent 20 years playing the drums, not optimizing\
      \ code. If you experience game breaking issues and can't join a server, please\
      \ feel free to take a refund. Also please be aware that THIS GAME IS VERY, VERY\
      \ HARD"
