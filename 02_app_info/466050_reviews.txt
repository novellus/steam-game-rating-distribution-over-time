You have to set right the wrongs so the lost souls can find peace before you may leave. Another excellently put together story. This game has not only an map it also has a strategy guide (which can be handy).  The letter from the developers is, I think a very nice touch.(thank you devs) The bonus game takes up right where the main story leaves off. The puppy games are cute and can also give you some practice if you so desire. I enjoyed the game immensely.
