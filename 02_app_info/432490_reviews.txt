I was not sure what to expect, so discovering it was pretty much Taratinoesque and reminiscent of Pulp Fiction except with cast of lesbians. It was strangely compelling despite slurs and racial epithets. It really is a dark comedy of errors and the fact the story takes places mostly in two days just adds to it. The cast are even fun and though definitely not the greatest people - none of them are good people, some are just better than others, it still kept me engrossed. Would I recommend it? Yeah definitely worth one play through.","timestamp_created":1608506426,"timestamp_updated":1608506426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqYidwfYCc6jpuwI="}
