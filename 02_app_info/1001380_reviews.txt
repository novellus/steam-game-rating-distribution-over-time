With all its low res, non-strafable controls, wonky camera, and clipping, it sure authenticaaly re-creates the days of the old Playstation 1.\n\nThose who are having trouble with the fight mechanics, consult the control page. Once you get to know them, you'll have an ass kicking good time.\n\nThere's more to be said about this particular game. Development Teams can have a various number of members working on one project. Number of members in creating the art, mechanics, cutscenes and music for Snails (actually, also everything else at Tadpole Interactive): ONE! Jesse Hamm all by himself! Seriously, how often is that achieved!?\n\nThere's also something to be said about novelty in character. It can be ridiculously distracting seeing a seven year old girl fight with the prowess of a martial arts master. But Dora's childlike vulnerabilities surface when we hear her cries of pain upon getting hit. This could potetntially get under one's skin in the similar vein as Playdead's Limbo or American McGee's Alice. But Jesse pushes the envelope of a reluctant child hero who, in Snails, could be as badass as they come!\n\nSnails is certainly not a perfect game. But what is offered will give those yearning to relive the Playstation 1 some good nostalgia. Especially coming from the devoted work of just one person, Snails is worthy of the neo-PS1 playlist!","timestamp_created":1546986278,"timestamp_updated":1546986278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx6nkl+gCeJvttwE="}
