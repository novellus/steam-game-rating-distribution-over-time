It's an interesting mix of the two and in theory, a pretty alluring concept. Unfortunately, it fails where it counts most. \n\nGraphically, I enjoy the pixelation and obvious references to Street Fighter II, from the character select screen, versus screen, victory screen and all the various portraits of the characters that accompany these. The backgrounds of the levels are limited in FOV but what you can see of them makes each level distinctly unique. The music attempts a retro feel that doesn't sound bad. Completing the single player nets you an artwork finale akin to SFII's. Shout out for giving us legit endings versus the trash you get for beating Street Fighter V's arcade mode. The story is negligible; there's some sort of story going on related to the mafia that kind of mirrors Street Fighter II's story but it's even less refined.\n\nOn the surface, this is pretty cool. The gameplay, though, is where the game bombs. I haven't played online, just single player, but this mode is busted. In it, you play 10 rounds of blackjack against the dealer at the same time your opponent does. After 10 rounds, whoever has the most money, wins. Alternatively, if someone busts out, their opponent wins. While this sounds fine - and indeed, there's nothing inherently wrong with this - the enemy AI is a complete moron. That isn't to say they won't win hands, but they definitely don't bother playing strategically, either against the dealer or when it comes to betting against you. Here's a couple examples of what I've seen:\n\n- AI will routinely \"hit\" on 20, no matter what the dealer is showing. I've seen the dealer show a 2 and the AI has hit on 20. Note, this tends to only happen if the AI hits on their first turn.\n- AI went into the 8th round of a match with $8,800 and me at $950. AI bet $8,700, lost and subsequently lost the entire match 2 rounds later when they otherwise had a 100% of winning.\n\nSo, naturally, as some other reviews have pointed out, the game devolves into just betting $50 every round and letting the AI opponent do themselves in. It's not fool proof - the AI can get streaks of luck and walk away winning - but in a typical single player game, I'd say it works about 85% of the time. There may be one match, two at the most, that you'll have to redo, but otherwise, it's a strategy that works just as well as actually trying to win the most money, if not better. There's also some bad gameplay issues that have been reported, such as an AAK constituting a bust instead of a 12. You can also double down at any point in your turn, not just your first action. If you can stomach all this, the replayability is relatively high on this game considering how many characters you have to play through to fully complete it.\n\nSome of the single player achievements are just replay/retry bait because they depend on an entirely RNG system to work in your favor, such as winning every hand against an opponent or winning a match in the first round by you betting it all, your opponent betting it all, and you getting blackjack.\n\nVisually, and in a retro-homage way, this game is awesome. Gameplay-wise, it doubles down on an 11 and gets a 12. \n\n---\n\nScore System: 0 - Unplayable; 5 - Average; 10 - Perfect\n(Note: each category is not necessarily weighted equally when determining the overall rating)\n\nGameplay: 3/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nSound: 6/10\nStory: 4/10\nReplayability: 7/10\n\nOverall Rating: 4/10 (Subpar)\n\nWorth Purchasing at Full Price/Discount: Not worth purchasing at full price (consideration given for a deep discount and as a novelty purchase)\nLength of Initial Playthrough: Short (< 10 hours)\n","timestamp_created":1602212312,"timestamp_updated":1602212312,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvPbShfUCd//dpgI="}
