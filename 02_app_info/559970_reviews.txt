It is 4 hours of pleasant entertainment, main game and the bonus chapter. Pretty graphics, nice music, not a bad story. Puzzles and HO scenes are not very challenging but still fun. The only drawback is lack of steam achievements and badges cards. Grab it when it’s on sale and you won’t regret.","timestamp_created":1522965212,"timestamp_updated":1522965212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522101819515228271","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtp3zy+ICcNDJnQE="}
