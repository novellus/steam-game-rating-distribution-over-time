Even though this review shows 0 hours played it is actually hundreds of hours, as my thousands on the base game shows.\n\nI think they did a good job for what budget they had.  The hilariously ludicrous 'collector' prices are pretty much tokens of support for the game and cannot be taken seriously.  I am not sure if the Steam version offers those.\n\nThe expansion does have one very unique feature I love quite a bit: a mirror mechanic for two of its zones that links them to allow you to port to the same location in the opposite zone.  It is very much like The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (or the newer A Link Between Worlds).\n\nThe honest truth is this game is old now. It is amazing it is still supported 17 years in.  There are some design direction decisions I loathe, such as the many nerfs to fun abilities in September of 2015, however the effort shows and with whatever low resources the development team is given I can tell they try very hard.\n\nLittle by little old annoying bugs are being fixed, and sometimes there are changes I do like such as the much-needed boost to tanking knights got very recently.  I am glad I did not buy through Steam at the expansion's launch because at that time I couldn't have recommended it.  It launched in a very bugged state, even unfinished almost. I do not blame the developers for that.  I doubt they would have launched in that state if it was their choice, but we'll never know the truth to that.\n\nThis style of MMORPG is something strange to me.  I've been playing for over twelve years now.  It is mostly my guild, for which I still play with some people from over a decade ago, that I play.  I am also very attached to my bard however, which this Steam account is named after.  The game is far better than it was a decade ago, and I will not wear nostalgia glasses for those times.  It was just downright unhealthy.  The game had to be a lifestyle to play frankly, and in many ways it still is.  Over the years it has become far less tedious however, so while I'm not sure if I'd outright recommend any game that takes so much time to someone, for those that are into it this game may be showing its age but I do still enjoy it.\n\nI hated to see a single negative review.  When it comes down to it, I think the developers did the best they could with a very limited budget for The Broken Mirror.","timestamp_created":1459825487,"timestamp_updated":1459825625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556374311447143555","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+uiY8tMCdcfuVA=="}
