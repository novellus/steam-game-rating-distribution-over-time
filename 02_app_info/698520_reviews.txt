Unfortunately, something strange happened about an hour into my first playthrough. I had been having a great time following the story and admiring the beautiful designs. Suddenly the narrative took an intense turn and the plot really seemed to pick up. I was so excited to see what was about to happen when suddenly a new character appeared, said a few words, and everything went dark before the credits rolled. I was so confused as to what glitch had occurred that caused the game to crash right when it was getting good. But sadly, after scouring the internet for other people's playthroughs I realized that it didn't crash. That really was the \"ending\" of this game. It was only after digging a little deeper that I realized that this is NOT a complete game. It is only the first game in a trilogy that never got made. \n\nI got this game on sale for a dollar, and in its current state I think that's what it's worth. If the other two games in the series had been made then I'm sure it would've been worth more. But sadly, this game by itself is nothing more than a lot of build up and world establishment for a really interesting story that the player will never get to see.","timestamp_created":1606759216,"timestamp_updated":1606759216,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuP6TjfYCe4H8tQI="}
