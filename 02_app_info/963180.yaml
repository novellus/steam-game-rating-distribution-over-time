    review: The Idea of the Game is good. In my opinion it has potential. You can
      make fast and acrobatic mooves when you catch and change direction of the trash.
      And so it can also hook into VR Fitness category. I will follow the progress.
      I really recommendthe devs also a port for oculus quest.
