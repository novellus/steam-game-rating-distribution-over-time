    review: Found this game from watching his Devlog on youtube. I dont know how he
      got verified still, but he put together a pretty fun game. Watching how it was
      made and then playing the game adds a little something extra to it. I look forward
      to seeing how he updates it in the future. Specifically, I hope to see some
      sort of in game scoreboard so I can tell if I am winning or not and also maybe
      some moving platforms. Simple game play, but i can see myself killing a lot
      of time on a game like this, especially when it comes to mobile.
