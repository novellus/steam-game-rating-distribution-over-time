I am extremely pleased to say that he has, and more importantly the internal monologues have taken a back seat and interactions have a much more conversational feel. This chapter blows the first one out of the water, now that all the heavy handed political diatribes are out of the way it feels like the story gets a real chance to breathe and not a minute is wasted. \n\nThis chapter IMO makes the first one worth slogging through. Siedh is bae. Also this guy is gonna be completely fucked up by the last chapter.","timestamp_created":1557828027,"timestamp_updated":1557828027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.428166240453720093","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p6jy2uoCcO6VwQE="}
