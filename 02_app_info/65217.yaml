    review: I like this DLC, just what I wanted for the West Highland Line.  It looks
      good, sounds good & so far I've not found any problems with it. I know that
      there are quite a few negative reviews for this unit but I guess it must have
      received some tlc in the meantime. I'm very happy with it.
