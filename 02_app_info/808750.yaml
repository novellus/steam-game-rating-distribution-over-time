    review: Video kept stalling when trying to play.  It won't download, you can only
      stream it.  I've purchased videos from steam before and had no problem watching
      them.  I rented this one and it will be the last.  I let it buffer for 5 minutes,
      then it played and studeered once 25 minutes in, then at 45 minutes into the
      movie it stopped, won't play.  I tried to skip back and ahead and the movie
      wont play.  This was on a sony vaio laptop with an i3 CPU hardwired gigabit
      connection to a 300Mbps internet gateway.  8GB of ram and a solid state drive
      with windows 10 64-bit with latest update.  Movie was good so far.  Good sound,
      effects and hot bangkok dancers.  I didn't like nicolas cage in this movie,
      too depressed looking.
