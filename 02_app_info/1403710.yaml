    about_the_game: This is not quite a game in the usual sense.<br>It so happened
      that everything that has a program code and 3D graphics is called games.<br>We
      prefer to call this project something like a digital dream.<br>For the buyer,
      including in order not to be disappointed, it is important to understand that
      there is no &quot;game&quot; here. This is a piece of a dream, and even if it
      is packed in machine code, it is not a game<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1403710/extras/ss_998552f6f9fa68cf45960c535b02896c1514a020.600x338.jpg?t=1608607867"
      /><br><br>The project pays tribute to the post-Soviet culture and captures the
      memories of our generation, for us in the future, giving an opportunity to plunge
      into the past. In 20 years, there will be no such trains, and as long as there
      are people who can reproduce some fragment of the life of a generation, we need
      to take time and preserve it. <br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1403710/extras/ss_2e436e3b17a165f294101df8d7e3a781532bf804.600x338.jpg?t=1608607867"
