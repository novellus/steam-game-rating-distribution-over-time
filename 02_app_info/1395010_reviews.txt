You gain coins for gameplay and these unlock further levels, which is a cute touch. \n+The game is fairly accessible for newbies with its simple designs. \nAlthough it can be unforgiving with mistakes.\n\n-The game only allows one mistake for the beginning portion of a level, and 2 mistakes as you progress. This is extremely limiting.\n-There is a penalty for getting clicks wrong in this game, in which the level ends and you have to restart.\nIt's annoying as I have shaky hands due to EDS and it means my hands sometimes move a bit further than I plan, or click/release when I didn't intend to and the game registers it as a mistake.\nI prefer when it lets you make mistakes but won't progress until you get the right combination. That way you can slowly process as you go along.\n\n[u]Visuals and Sound:[/u]\n+Visually it's easy to see the selected and un-selected blocks, which is good.\n+The music is calming and can fade into the background.\n\n-The numbers on the boarder, that tell you how many selected blocks you should have, sometimes are hard to read, so I might mix up 2/3 for example, and can get a penalty due to this.\n-If you put the music down to a lower level of sound, when the level is cleared the sound shoots back up to maximum and blasts out victory music. It's really odd and disorientating. The only way to fix it is to completely mute it, which sucks as the music isn't too bad.\n\n\n[u]What would make this better and more accessible?[/u]\n\n[*]Larger numbers on the sides, so you can clearly read them.\n[*]Remove the mistake penalty for relaxed playing, that still has a consequence for incorrect clicks.\n[*]Ability to save progress mid-level, for a more relaxed play through.\n[*]Allow more than one mistake at the beginning, and let gamers opt into that mode instead.\n[*]Fix the sound so the music doesn't reset to max at the end of the level!","timestamp_created":1609712101,"timestamp_updated":1609712176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuNGU5fYCe6KbwAI="}
