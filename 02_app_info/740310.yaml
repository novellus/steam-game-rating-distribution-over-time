    about_the_game: "It all started while you were routinely cleaning storage room\
      \ 2b in section 6. First the loud sound of a breaker tripping and then\u2026\
      \ pitch darkness, the facility locked down and the emergency lights switched\
      \ on.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a system reset, GRACE the research AI comes to\
      \ your rescue. She has no memory of the events leading up the failure and informs\
      \ you the specimens have all gotten free. She urges you to escape and gives\
      \ you a device only labeled as Project Transmogrfiy, that turns living matter\
      \ into usable tools and structures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWas that something skittering\
      \ in the air vents?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTransmogrify is an unusual 2D puzzle\
      \ platformer that blends challenging action and handcrafted puzzles. You play\
      \ as Chris, a janitor working at Perfect Future Laboratories. This high-tech\
      \ and secretive research facility has suffered catastrophic damage. Now your\
      \ only way out is through several radioactively colorful worlds infested with\
      \ cute but lethal monsters. Armed only with your gun and the help of GRACE,\
      \ you must transmogrify these enemies into the tools you need to solve the puzzles\
      \ and escape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRefreshingly different in its genre, Transmogrify\
      \ does not shy away from cranking up the difficulty level where most puzzle\
      \ platformers remain mechanically simple.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver 75 levels\
      \ are packed with fast-paced action, tons of enemies and powerups, all set to\
      \ an exciting soundtrack. The player\u2019s ability to manipulate the environment\
      \ through transforming monsters into blocks, springs, floating platforms and\
      \ other tools, is an innovative mechanic that is as fun as the name Transmogrify\
      \ makes it sound."
