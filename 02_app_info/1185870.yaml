    review: 'You are actually in a mental hospital, nothing in the story you go through
      is real. Should I have said "spoilers"? I didn''t because the game and the story
      is total garbage. You don''t need to play this trash game anymore so I just
      saved you some money. I am expecting a thank you


      Lmao don''t blame this is the oldest most over used extremely boring mystery
      story in literature everyone is sick of this crap'
