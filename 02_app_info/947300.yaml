    review: 'This is a really simple, but fun and challenging game. Once you''ve beat
      it, there won''t be much left to do, but learning all the systems and figuring
      out the best defense and offense is quite fun. Hint: Don''t hesitate to kill
      your own peasants if they aren''t ''good''. There is a dedicated kill button,
      use it.'
