    review: I bought this solely for Armin's exposed chest and thighs. Would have
      been better if his outfit were more like Eren's, but I'll take all the Armin
      fanservice I can get. Also would have been better if I were able to just buy
      the Armin one. The blue and yellow goes nicely with Armin's eyes and hair, and
      the patterns on the jacket look like waves for a nice ocean motif. Very aesthetically
      pleasing. Also, you can look up his skirt thing. Overall a very good use of
      $8.99.
