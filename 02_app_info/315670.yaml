      system&quot; that involves the camera pointing down normal to the player while
      the scenery moves in three dimensions: climbing, descending, and sometimes moving

      class="bb_ul"><li>Gameplay - Two player co-op mode is enhanced by an exclusive
      new attack skill: a beam that is usable whenever one player lines up in front
