    review: What a load of rubbish, firstly they advertise as its an MV compatible
      character pack, well the characters are a straight copy from the XP/vxace RTP
      PACKS, the VXACE faces are also taken from there as well as the busts. The XP
      faces and Busts are partially custom with XP style in mind. the only MV compatible
      thing in this pack is the VXACE sv battlers. everything else was just not. A
      waste of money even on sale. All i can take from this is the sv battlers, but
      without the characters or faces its useless. I wish i didn't buy this crap,
