      \ will be leaving your surprises at the doors of your favorite neighbors. You\
      \ moved to a new city a year ago. One morning, you went outside and found poop\
      \ at your door again. It looks like someone of your new neighbors left it there.\
      \ But you don\u2019t know who exactly did it, so you will have to give your\
      \ present to each of them. Be careful, for it\u2019s not something they might\
      \ like when they find poop at their doors.<br />\r\nYour task is to come up\
      \ to your neighbors\u2019 houses and leave your poop at their doors. Just as\
      \ you do so, the owner of the house will run after you. The more neighbors are\
      \ running after you, the harder it will be to escape from them."
