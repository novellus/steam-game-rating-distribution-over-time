Unlike the coasters by the same dev, Raw Lion Workshop, this game is, well, underwhelming. It didnâ€™t even feel like the same creator of the coasters I love, which are fairly polished at this point made this one. Imagine walking around Artraal, but with no real objective except to try and open a box for a pass key for a train. You explore darkly lit areas, often not sure which way you can go and you need to find the symbol for each colored petal.\nI stumbled on purple right away, but after visiting each of the other worlds for the keys the darn box won't open. This game lacks the logic of the rides, that, while surreal, have progression. It feels like it was an attempt to get away from coasters, though there are coaster elements in each world.\nAll I wanted was my train pass and the young lady was no help whatsoever. Very buggy at this point, not everything works and the in-game note says it isn't finished. The graphics need some love, and maybe just make the darn thing into four trippy coasters. That way the pitch black areas will not be an issue.","timestamp_created":1530757416,"timestamp_updated":1530767146,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521428585052490234","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwwZ+1tOQCe7WcpQE="}
