For the regular story you control size of puzzle as well as shape of the pieces (i.e. you play your way).\n\nCons: \n- The \"snap to\" feature should have a slider to control its effectiveness. It is simply too helpful for my taste.\n- When starting a new puzzle after reopening the game, you have to scroll down to find the current puzzle. It would be nice if you could see current puzzles at the top.\n\nNeither of these cons are a good enough reason for you to not check out this game.","timestamp_created":1607125489,"timestamp_updated":1607125489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41pqJmPYCf56vtwI="}
