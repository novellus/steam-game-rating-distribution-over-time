    review: 'Hidden Object: Home Makeover is a relaxing, goal-driven, hidden object
      game where you help Emma redecorate her granny''s house "down by the river".
      This will require an enormous amount of money. In fact, it will require so much
      money, one could simply have bought a new house for the cost of redecorating
      one room for granny. Fortunately for you, Emma is a sociopath who has turned
      her granny''s invitation to "bring new furniture" to redecorate a spare room
      into permission to sell all of her grandmother''s possessions in order to fund
      a shopping spree.


      Emma describes these possessions as "unused items" ... "unused items" like family
      pets, treasure chests full of doubloons, diamonds the size of a man''s fist,
      a Thanksgiving turkey, and the occasional housefly. Emma''s customers range
      from a Vin Diesel lookalike (with a totally not suspicious hat that simply says
      "SPORTS") who repeatedly asks for dozens of random tools to fix his wife''s
      pipes, to a 6-year-old boy who on different occasions purchased from Emma a
      noose, pliers, and a squirrel. This raises the question - are these actual customers
      and items, or are they Emma''s hallucinations? Is grandma even alive or did
      Emma send herself that invitation?


      Personally, I find Emma''s potential severe mental illness to be one of the
      more interesting storylines upon which to base a casual hidden object game.
      Big Fish was really taking a risk with this one and it paid off in a big way.


      As for gameplay, the game is oriented towards rapidly finding a moderate number
      of easy to find objects over swiftly recycled boards, rather than poring over
      hyper-cluttered boards looking for difficult to distinguish objects. The boards
      can be played with or without timing. Objects to find may be presented as pictures,
      silhouettes, words, or scrambled words. There is a recurring match-3 game interspersed
      with the levels. Between levels, the player has a chance to buy hyper-expensive
      decor for granny''s house. It was worth $5 to me, and I recommend it on sale
      at that price.'
