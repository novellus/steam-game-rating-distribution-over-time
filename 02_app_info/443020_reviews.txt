Perhaps the developer will kindly oblige us with some of this in a future update.\nVictory and Glory: Napoleonâ€™s Event Cards system is quite interesting and effective, and gives added historical flavor. The game has very good replayability with the extra campaigns (1800, 1806, 1809, 1812, 1813) apart from the main campaign (1805). England can be invaded if you deal with the Royal Navy first, and you can also attempt to conquer Russia, Spain and Egypt.\nThe major battles are played on a battlemap with a left flank, center, right flank and reserve area, with up to four units per the three front-line areas. Extra units are kept in the Reserve area until needed. Minor battles are played on a smaller map.\nLand combat rewards combined arms tactics with artillery, cavalry and infantry, and better leaders being able to take the initiative from the enemy.\nSea battles take place on one battlemap zone. There are no admirals.\nThe map is a little garish for my personal taste, but well apportioned with movement by region/area. Part of the game interface felt a bit awkward to use at the start, but you can quickly train yourself to use it well.\nThe manual is straightforward and easy to understand.\nA very satisfactory game overall, I highly recommend it if you are interested in the Napoleonic period, or you like simpler simulation games with lots of flavor.\n\nPS. I have a good knowledge of the period and really enjoyed Napoleon: Total War as a simulation (though it can of course be improved), and have just bought Wars of Napoleon to play.\n\nTamerlane","timestamp_created":1609420459,"timestamp_updated":1609420459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v+m73PYCe8SMvwI="}
