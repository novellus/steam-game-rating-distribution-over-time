I think the first chapter is the best and then it goes downhill a little bit from there. The art is beautiful and the characters are really cool. First chapter puzzles are also at a really nice difficulty if you're just looking for a little bit of challenge, but still pretty simple. \nAs others have said, in the final chapter there's a frustrating part where you have to keep repeating a section in order to progress, and I think you can mess it up by choosing the wrong dialogue options. I only messed it up a couple times but it's still really dragged the game down a bit having to repeat that several times. \nI finished the game in about 2 hours, it has 3 chapters to play through.\nEither way, I think it's a game worth playing! Interesting story too.","timestamp_created":1609513181,"timestamp_updated":1609513181,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49MOd3/YCcui1vwI="}
