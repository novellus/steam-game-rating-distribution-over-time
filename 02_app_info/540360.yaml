    review: "Very disappointing.  It is NOT \"pure Jewel matching experience\"  it\
      \ is more mini challenges.  \nThis game plays and lays like a phone app game.\
      \  There is no volume control on the sound, just on and off.   The game is very\
      \ loud.  The puzzles are very small and o not get bigger.  The wheels in the\
      \ images are random, no control.   Each of the \"hundreds' of puzzles are about\
      \ 9 x 9 in size which leaves no room for setting up moves.  There are limits\
      \ of 1 to 2 minutes or 15 - 40 moves so the puzzles are not the standard 5 minute\
      \ runs.\n\nIf you love Jewel Quest 1 - 3, especially the tournament mode at\
      \ the end of JQ3, this is not that game."
