I have found no technical issues (but an undo button for orders would be nice). The gameplay is extremely complicated and I only understand a little of how the game works. The half-month turns means you have to think quite a bit in advance unlike in games like HoI or Darkest Hour.","timestamp_created":1609884970,"timestamp_updated":1609884970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwweWn6vYCdv3qwAI="}
