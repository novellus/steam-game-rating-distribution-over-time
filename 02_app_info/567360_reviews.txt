There is almost no help in creating your own characters if that's even possible, then the entire setup feels forced and really buggy with frequent crashing. You cant really edit much from what you see in the video and honestly you are going to waste your money getting this because in the end you will need to replace most of the irrelevant art which is, I guess, a fantasy setting but the characters sort of look modern then there's a random desert out of nowhere and a castle with annoying music? \n\nYou are better of with Adventure Game Studio, its free and you will have a lot more control in actually seeing where your characters go on the map and placing objects in the map editor. Don't let this whole \"no programming\" scam fool you. Even Unity3D has some Adventure Game plugin if you really insist on using drag and drop visual coding or just want to port to multiple devices besides windows.\n\nIn short your throwing away 20USD for some unfinished and rushed art and I guess ok sound effects, the rest is garbage. \n","timestamp_created":1598112267,"timestamp_updated":1598112267,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533003807067871094","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r7+6i/QCcNKJnQI="}
