      /><br><strong>My Haunted Doll is a 2D Survival Horror game based on the story
      of the cursed doll of the 1800s which is said to be possessed by the spirits
      of the little girl and the Devil.</strong><br><br>Mary, the owner of the Mary
      Co. museum, loves to collect ancient antiques, clothes, dolls, bones and utensils.
      Every Saturday, she goes to a nearby antique store to buy ancient stuff in order
      to add them to her collections in her museum. On 20th September, she went to
      the shop to buy an ancient cursed doll. She was a skeptic and did not believe
      in ghosts until she experienced the paranormal activities herself. As soon as
      she brought the doll to her museum the things started to take a darker turn.
      Her museum was on the ground floor while she lived on the fourth floor and the
      rest three floors were empty. But she started experiencing paranormal activities
      including things getting misplaced, poltergeist activities and nightmare. A
      few days following the incident she started researching the history behind the
      doll and discovered that the doll was cursed. She was desperately in search
      of the remedy of the situation but she came to know that the only way to stop
      the paranormal activities was to get rid of the doll and sending it over to
      its previous location where the doll was originally kept and the curse would
      be lifted.<br><br>However, it is easier said than done. The Devil residing inside
      the doll will try to stop Mary from achieving her goal. Will she be able to
      lift the curse, placed on her? Her fate is in your hands now. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1181470/extras/mhd_gif_2.gif?t=1574436604"
