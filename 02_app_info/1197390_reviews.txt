Despite it being so short, you still get a window into the life of the Captain of the ship, and you still feel a connection to his struggle of trying to figure out if this is what he really wants to do in life.\nLots of good humour in there too, it's well worth you time","timestamp_created":1606776476,"timestamp_updated":1606776476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlurVjfYCc8CNtgI="}
