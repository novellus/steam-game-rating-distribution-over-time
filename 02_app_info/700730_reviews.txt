I also like to pick up quirky indie games, and I really wasn't sure what the heck kind of game this was from the description.\n\nIt's a sort of poor-man's non-twitchy Dragon's Lair. You're a lone adventurer exploring the dungeon of a mysterious castle inhabited by some evil entity named Darkcore. Everything is first person PoV. The camera movement is pre-rendered, so when you step into a scene, it pans around a bit as if you're looking around. You then have a contextual cursor to look at and manipulate objects, and when you're ready to have the camera move you to the next scene, you click when your cursor is a directional arrow.\n\nYou have one heal spell at the start, and it's single-cast. You can find more spells in the dungeon that solve certain puzzles. It's possible to cast a spell at the wrong time, thus ending your ability to progress and forcing you back to a previous save. You can also find inventory items that solve puzzles. Like your spells, you have a limited inventory and can't always go back if you make a mistake and take the wrong item, again forcing you to a previous save.\n\nI've died once so far to an insta-death mechanic, and I don't think there was a clue showing me that choice A led to death, and choice B to success. However, like Dragon's Lair, now I know which choice to make at that point.\n\nSince your only saves are auto-saves at the start of a level, this can mean having to re-watch many pre-rendered scenes. However, your space bar immediately terminates the current scene, allowing you to get back to where you were fairly quickly.\n\nThe graphics are primitive as can be seen in the promo shots, and the dungeon is a bit silly and inconsistent thematically -- I found a dead [spoiler]ninja[/spoiler] and a dead [spoiler]amazon[/spoiler] inside, for example, and Darkcore is a villain straight out of a Saturday-morning cartoon (these criticisms could be made about many old-school RPGs, however). Still, the game does a pretty good job of giving a sense of place. The music is decent, if a bit melodramatic. I get the sense there's a fair bit of content here; I'm 45 minutes in and still on the first of what are promised to be multiple dungeon levels. There will be little to no replay value, however.\n\nI think I got my $2.50 worth.","timestamp_created":1529979167,"timestamp_updated":1585982835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549447298049926758","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1534825349,"developer_response":"Thanks very much for your detailed review of my game, Dungeoneer.  I found it covered the game in good light while highlighting some of its pitfalls, but it does sound like you are enjoying it.  I'd be interested to know where you got killed though I have an idea since it was on level one.  I hope you enjoy the rest of the game and find the later levels more challenging and engaging.\n\nPaul Boland."}],"cursor":"AoJ4k7H8ofECd+OepAE="}
