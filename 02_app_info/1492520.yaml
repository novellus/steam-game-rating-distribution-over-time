      /><br><br>Malmyr is a story based game about building and maintaining production
      chains. It is meant to be relaxing but challenging. You will have to control
      where your resources are diverted to and ensure that there are enough workers
      to fulfill your missions. Don''t be fooled by the simple and stylized look of
      Malmyr - The game is getting very complex, very fast.<br><br>You are sent to
      the forgotten lands of Malmyr by your King to expand the kingdom''s territory
      and exploit Malmyr''s precious ore deposits. While doing so you find out about
      the sinister fate of the Dwarves that once inhabited the continent. You will
      have to protect the kingdom from suffering the same!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1492520/extras/steamBanner2.png?t=1608578367"
      /><br><br>We are two very passionate german devolpers with freshly finished
      degrees who always wanted to make games. Due to the current circumstances, we
      decided to take a leap of faith and go for it. While buying this game you should
      keep that in mind. Malmyr is made with great love for detail and we hope that
      we can offer unique challenges with each mission, but it cannot offer hundreds
      of hours of playtime like bigger games with actual funding and a budget can.<br><br>While
      we cannot promise to expand the game''s content and currently have no plans
      to do so, we will do our best to optimize the game after release and address
      any issues coming up. Ziegler gamedev has the vision &quot;Making dreams come
      true&quot;. We feel that part of that also is making the best game we can for
