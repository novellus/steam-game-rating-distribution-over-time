This means that you do require a microphone in order to play which should clearly be stated. The closest you can get without a microphone is playing quick game mode which lets you choose which enemies appear. So in a best-case scenario without a microphone you get to fight half the enemies and not play the campaign. \n\nThe second sound issue is there is zero calibration for whatever mic you have. Now I am fortunate enough to have spent the money on a condensor and audio interface rig but even with that I have to crank my mic up quite high in order for it to be loud enough to fend enemies off at a quick enough speed. What this means is most people who own microphones with much less power behind them or use laptop/webcam mics will be screaming at the top of their lungs to maybe be able to progress. An issue that was probably not thought of by the devs since the convention spaces they displayed the game at wouldn't require people to be even relatively quiet. \n\nThe other sound issue which is also calibration related is pitch. One of the enemies requires you to \"sing\" high notes... I tried for quite a while until my throat was sore and I either am simply unable to hit a note high enough for the game or it wasn't registering. So I had to whistle which isn't great because I have trouble whistling. So there's a physical requirement for this game, you either have to be able to sing very high notes or whistle. \n\nThe last issue would be that although this game would be amazing to try out in a convention centre I don't see any replayability at home besides for small children (but who honestly wants to give kids an excuse to scream at the top of their lungs?). The game simply recycles the same enemies and throws on goggles, watermelons, etc.  so you essentially have the exact same 4 mechanics of: staring, shaking your head, yelling, and whistling/singing high-pitched. This gets old very fast. \n\nBesides that there's not much to talk about, very basic graphics options (you get to choose between low-good-very good-fantastic) which don't seem to change much as evidenced by the game starting out in low to begin with and even on high the FPS counter still shoots up to 900 frames which is ridiculous and I don't notice any visual changes.","timestamp_created":1447345447,"timestamp_updated":1602110176,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577633261680603027","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsKfNgvUCeLTOSA=="}
