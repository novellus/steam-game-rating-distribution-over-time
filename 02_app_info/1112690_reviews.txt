This is just such a great concept, and executed nicely.  It's great for parties/gettogethers and it's friendly to all ages.  You should definitely have this in your arsenal if you own VR.\n\nThe Devs are also quite active in their discord and respond to feedback and bug reports, I personally have helped test several bugs I've found on the oculus platform!","timestamp_created":1605376653,"timestamp_updated":1605930597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qIe79PUCcIKvrgI="}
