It has a lot of charm, is witty, and has an interesting concept. I would also suggest just playing through it without the use of a guide that shows you everything, it's much better that way. Right now I still cannot play on the hardest difficulty, Spasmodic, but I can get through Hard just fine. It offers a decent challenge and has an interesting story with secrets to be found throughout. It has a pretty deep battle system that allows for many different types of play, which you may just find yourself constantly tweaking as you go. Which I enjoy, it doesn't trap you into one set role.\n\nThat being said it isn't perfect. It does have a bit of a grind and there aren't an overabundance of enemies, but that's something hard to really fault it on. Given the time it came out and the small team behind it. It is impressive none-the-less.\n\nI've been having a great time playing this again, it took me around 30 hours to fully complete initially. If a rhythm RPG sounds like something you'd be interested in I'd suggest picking it up. With the sale prices it's a steal in all honesty.\n\n8.5/10","timestamp_created":1609192122,"timestamp_updated":1609192122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6eTU1fYCfOWevgI="}
