Who needs the game when the music is that good. I mean this is the most relaxing album I ever heard. Each unique track is very atmospheric and immersive. I wish I could nominate it for the best OST in 2017 but nobody played this wonderful game. There are 12 entries in the album but only about 9 are unique (not counting rain sound effect) $1 on sale for 9 catchy songs seems like a good deal to me. I rarely bother to pay for music in games but this one deserves it.","timestamp_created":1514687636,"timestamp_updated":1514687711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.594454169273376465","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48Yib1eACeoCrlAE="}
