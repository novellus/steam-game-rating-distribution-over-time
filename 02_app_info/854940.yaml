    review: "This game takes heaps of inspiration from other games and executes them\
      \ all extremely well. The influences are clear but they come together to make\
      \ an RPG greater than the sum of its parts.\nYou have a battle system that's\
      \ a mix of megaman battle network and Super Mario RPG,\nAn overworld reminiscent\
      \ of earthbound, with plenty of things to find and puzzles to solve, (think\
      \ Golden Sun without the powers)\nA group of refreshing, likeable characters,\n\
      Excellent music. Lots of fun, bouncy chiptunes backed by sampled instruments.\n\
      \nThings I liked:\n- It was always worth solving that one extra puzzle for a\
      \ chest. Found items never felt throwaway.\n- The sheer amount of \"juice\"\
      \ in the battle system, and how smooth the UI is. \n- Enemy designs, in particular\
      \ the bosses, were always fun.\n- About 13-14 hours in, and probably nearing\
      \ the final 5th of the game. A nice length that doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\
      \nThings I didn't like as much:\n- MSI Afterburner overlay crashes the game\
      \ on launch.\n- It felt like the timing was very slightly later than it should\
      \ be on attacks. Could this be down to the timings being set up to compensate\
      \ for a 60hz input polling rate? I'm playing on a 144hz monitor with a framerate\
      \ likely as high.\n- The fire, lightning, and alchemy mages carved useful niches\
      \ in the party, but not so much the others. The others didn't really have the\
      \ utility to justify the lower offense (not so much the paint mage maybe)\n\n\
      I'll be keeping an eye on if there's a sequel to this, I feel like the dev has\
      \ only just touched on what can be done with the systems they've made. Would\
      \ recommend!"
