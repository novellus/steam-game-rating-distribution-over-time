Note that this is not a VN, but more like dating sim meets RPG. I played sir Brash, Dorian and Thayn routes and I must say that sir Brash is the best, while do not bother with Thayn, except you want the achievement. Thayn route was just repulsive to me, but I managed to finish it for the achievement.\nIf you haven't played Demonheart VN, then I would advise that you play that first because you get more out of this game.\n\nHowever, if you expect something like a full fledged RPG with romance options, then don't buy it or buy it on sale when the price is really low, because you'll be disappointed.","timestamp_created":1609861997,"timestamp_updated":1609862171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l+nQ6fYCeaXewAI="}
