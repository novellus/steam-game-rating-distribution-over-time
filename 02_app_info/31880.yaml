      s is also fun.\u201D<br>PC GameZone<br><br>\u201CThe Secret of the Old Clock\
      \ brings the number of games in the Nancy Drew series to an even dozen. While\
      \ this is an impressive accomplishment for any series, that\u2019s not Clock\u2019\
      s only distinction. The game is based on the first book in the Nancy Drew canon,\
      \ the game\u2019s release date is the 75th anniversary of that book\u2019s publication,\

    review: Super fun Nancy Drew game. The story is interesting and the puzzles are
      creative. A little more on the easier side, but still fun none the less.
