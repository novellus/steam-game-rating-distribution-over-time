Even though I have lost 52 heroes in total on my runs and killed more than 8k monsters to get at this point, totally worth it!!! Such an amazing soundtrack and design, a beautiful game, hiding a brutal mechanics for a seemingly unforgiving gameplay with a very unique learning curve experience.  I have unlocked almost all the characters by now and tried at-least once all of them. If you are fun of the tower defence genre with a good twist of character progression then this is a must have! 10/10","timestamp_created":1568311204,"timestamp_updated":1568311204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539327621459960938","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiruok+0CdqOO0gE="}
