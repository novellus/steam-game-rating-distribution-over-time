I would say why but i don't fell like it.\n\nEdit: Ok Ballistick just sucks. The controls for both keyboard and controller is just clunky and bad.\nThere is no option to change the sound and controls of this game and the missions and environments just feel and look so bland. Personally I do not recommend paying $2 for this game and go buy something better. \n\n(p.s: this is my new longest review)","timestamp_created":1582757823,"timestamp_updated":1584919221,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sIKjgvECdoHk9AE="}
