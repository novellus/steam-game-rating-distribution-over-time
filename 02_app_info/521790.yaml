    review: 'I like turn based tactical games, so I probably enjoyed this game more
      than many will, but I can''t recommend it due to two major issues.


      The primary issues I have with the game are:


      The game / combat is a grind

      The game becomes a grind fairly early. With 30 missions per campaign (Alliance
      / Federation) and up to 3 missions in between story missions, you can play 90
      missions per campaign if you grind the experience and resource missions in between
      the story missions. Even if you only do some of the experience and resource
      missions (as you will likely need to if you playing on the harder difficulties),
      it''s a really long and repetitive grind to the end of the game. You''ve seen
      just about all the combat tactics and variations you''re going to see about
      1/4 way into the game, and while you do get a few new ships and better parts
      and crew, the combat really doesn''t change, nor does it become more interesting.


      Story / Dialogue

      Easily the worst and most cheesy dialogue I have ever suffered through in a
      game. Not just bad, awful! You don''t expect a great story from a game like
      this, but I''m not sure if you could make a worse story with worse dialogue
      if you tried.
