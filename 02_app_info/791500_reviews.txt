While Mahjong Riichi is very simplistic from a game design point (i mean this in a good way), what it has is a very user friendly interface and it also has a really helpful easy to understand tutorial. I was able to learn how to play the game quickly and i was able to get my friends into it as well. I even went out and bought a real Japanese set in real life, this steam game version is definitely a great way to get into Mahjong.","timestamp_created":1604814693,"timestamp_updated":1604814693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qJya0/UCfqmJrQI="}
