    about_the_game: 'Defend your planet from incoming asteroids, aliens and more in
      this VR-only room-scale HTC Vive game. Position defense units in orbits around
      your planet, plant mines and keep an eye out for planet-bound threats from any
      direction.<br><br>PlanetFate is being built from the ground up for virtual reality.
      Being able to manipulate defense units'' orbits using Vive''s controllers and
      move around your playspace to identify incoming threats makes this a tense and
      action filled game.<br><br>The fate of your planet rests on your quick thinking,
      strategic skills and spatial awareness.<h2 class="bb_tag"> Current Game Modes
      </h2><strong>Time Challenge:</strong> Think you can keep your planet safe for
      a mere five minutes? We''ll see...<br><strong>Endless:</strong> How long can
      you hold off the inevitable?<br><strong>Saturn Supply Run (early build):</strong>
      See below<h2 class="bb_tag"> First mission (early build)</h2>A very early build
      of PlanetFate''s first mission is now available. Take a cargoship on a delivery
      run to Saturn and push your way past enemy weapon platforms and asteroid fields.
      Manage your ship''s power between weapons, shields and engines while trying
      to keep your cargo in one piece.<br>This is an early build of the mission to
      gather feedback from players. You will likely encounter bugs along the way so
      please report any on the PlanetFate website or in the community forum.<br><br>Tips
      and instructions on how to play the mission:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>When the
      ship is ready after leaving the shipyard, push your controller''s trackpad to
      engage engines.<br></li><li>Swipe your thumb across the trackpad to shift power
      between shields, weapons and engines.<br></li><li>To aim a turret at an enemy,
      select the turret with the trigger. Hold the trigger down and move your controller
      to point towards an enemy. When you feel the controller rumble, you can release
      the trigger. The turret will lock on and automatically fire when in range. (known
      bug: sometimes the laser pointer will not display. This is a known UE4 issue
      and is a high priority)<br></li><li>Turrets are blue when inactive, yellow when
      you select one and green while locked on to a target<br></li><li>If a turret
      or shield is disabled, diverting power to that system will speed up repairs<br></li><li>Asteroids
      permanently disable turrets and shields, so watch out for them</li></ul>A tutorial
      will be created after the mission is fully developed so thank you for your patience
      in this early stage.<h2 class="bb_tag"> Current Features </h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Full
      HTC Vive Support:</strong> Room scale with full motion controller support<br></li><li><strong>Highscores
      for arcade game modes</strong><br></li><li><strong>Adjustable planet height:</strong>

      Mission Modes in Development </h2>In addition to the arcade style game modes
      currently available, PlanetFate will offer players more game modes focused on
      strategy and longer gameplay. Here''s a sneak peek at what''s currently in development
      and how the game will expand over time:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Escort
      Missions:</strong> defend ships against pirates, through asteroid fields and
      other hazards<br></li><li><strong>Battlecruiser Missions:</strong> control a
      massive battlecruiser''s turrents, shields and fighters in various scenarios<br></li><li><strong>Defense
      Building:</strong> build and manage stations, mines, shields and more from invasions<br></li><li><strong>Skirmish:</strong>
      build and manage your fleet and engage in room scale battles</li></ul><br>The
      type of missions created will be based on the support PlanetFate receives during
      Early Access. So while the current version only offers arcade-style modes, if
      you are interested in longer form missions, consider supporting PlanetFate.'
