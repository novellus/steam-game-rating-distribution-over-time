    review: 'This is a nice game, happy to recommend, especially given how cheap it
      is. Do not fall into the trap of comparing this to Slay The Spire, they are
      fundamentally different.


      The core of the game consists of two ingredients: (1) all your cards are 1-use
      only. But don''t worry, you get plenty of cards and it is unlikely that you
      run out of cards unless you make bad decisions. (2) this is a strategy game
      in disguise of a roguelike deckbuilding. Because all the cards are 1-use, the
      game makes no effort in building real card synergies. Instead, the order of
      cards played, and where they are played on the battlefield matters. There is
      a continuous stream of enemies incoming and you should choose which cards to
      play. All of the cards have a different range and/or area of effect.


      The game has a great, coherent artstyle that is based on low-order polygons
      and limited color pallete. A downside is that I believe all enemies should have
      an outline of sorts, because sometimes they blend with the background or other
      enemies (due to limited color pallete).


      Apparently the game has a lot of content, and hidden routes. A downside is that,
      even though I''ve played for 10 hours already, I''m still not sure how to unlock
      a lot of the hidden content.


      All in all, this game is *definitely* worth its price, and also your time, if
      you like roguelike deckbuilding, or puzzle, or strategy games.'
