      \ While it certainly doesn't do anything new to win over those who aren't fans\

      s systems and layers of complexity that keep you coming back for more.On the\
      \ thirtieth anniversary of Nobunaga's Ambition, Sphere of Influence proves to\

    review: The time period is very interesting and I love strategy, but this just
      didn't have anything interesting to do. It barely has more going on than Samurai
      Warriors Empires. It's boring
