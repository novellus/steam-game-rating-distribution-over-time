    review: '[h1]Run Your Own Theatre - Your Choices Matter[/h1]


      Broadway: 1849 is a text-based game from Choice of Games, where there''s no
      music or graphics and your imagination can run free. You now manage a theatre
      all your own and must make important choices when it comes to plays, actors
      to hire, and factions to please or ignore. Will you survive your first season?


      While not as, perhaps, hands on like Hollywood Visionary (another great game
      by Choice of Games - which I loved), it has a unique vibe and feel to it where
      you can choose to seek the trust of the elite or the everyday man, hold secrets
      or sell out to help your theatre thrive. The political climate that surrounds
      such means of entertainment is almost educational in a way for the game and
      it really allows for you to seek out who you are as a character and test the
      boundaries of entertainment in the mid 19th century.'
