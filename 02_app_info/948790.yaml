    about_the_game: Party Poppers follows in the footsteps of Party Golf and Party
      Crashers but with the brand new adorable Poppers in addition to the same incredible
      customisation options and crazy competitive couch gameplay you know and love.
      There's a game mode for everyone in this fast paced platformer that is sure
      to bring a party to wherever you play!<br><br>Initially the game is a simple
      competitive platformer that places you in control of the adorable popper characters
      with a single jump and a grapple hook, and your aim is to pop as many balloons
      as you can! Yet Party Poppers truly shines when you see how powerful the customisation
      is, why not add double jump? Moon gravity? Infinite length grapples? All of
      the above? <strong>You make the game you want to play!</strong>
