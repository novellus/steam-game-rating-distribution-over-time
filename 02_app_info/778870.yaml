      notes: Cartoon ultraviolence. The game contains blood splatters and characters
        that can explode into blood/gore, albeit its all done in a cartoony way.

      If you accidentally buy this at any price, refund while you can. Don''t accidentally
      leave it in your library until your refund window expires like I did.

      All of the positive reviews for this game are a lie from paid shill reviewers.
      You want an example? Look at the review from Ego Tempest: https://steamcommunity.com/id/EgoTempest/recommended/778870/


      That account has posted 640 positive reviews, all of them with only 5 to 10
      minutes of play time on each game. That''s 640 positive reviews that amount
      to nothing more than launching the game, letting it idle just long enough for
      steam to allow a review (5 minutes) and then turning the game off.


      The other positive reviews are no better, paid reviewers who upvote everything.
      Even the forums for this game have no activity, there''s one post from 2019
      stating how bad the game is and not a single post since then.

      Since I now own this game ($1.24 with coupon) I''ll be forcing myself to finish
      it, but not without complaining about it every second until it''s done, here''s
      just a few off the top of my head:


      1. The story is the kind of nonsense written by a drunken idiot throwing darts
      at a dictionary to pick random words and string them together. You''re in your
      office suit parachuting into a garbage dump to attract talking dogs with a bone
      so they can show you where to dig up a stolen microchip then get attacked by
      cops for being in the slums... it goes downhill from there...


      2. The combat mechanics make about as much sense as using a cat for milk, you
      can dive through people while holding a shovel.


      3. You can fly by wearing a vacuum. Do I even need to explain that vacuums work
      the opposite of anything that could even attempt to push you into the air? And
      no, it''s not modified, you just randomly pick up a vacuum and use it like a
      jet pack.


      I suppose you would need to be on as much drugs and alcohol as the developer
      for any of this to make sense, but at that point you could just play in your
      own puke with a Popsicle stick and make up a story with just as much meaning.


      Excuse me, I''m going to go roll my face on the keyboard until the game is over.
