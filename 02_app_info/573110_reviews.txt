The music varies from good to great. The writing is often quite funny.\nBut the gameplay just isn't there to support it. \nYou melee attacks feel very inconsistent in their reach depending on what enemy you're facing. Some you can hit from a mile away while other you get get right up in their face, and the same goes for their reach which seem to vary just as much with no regards to if it makes sense for their character design or not.\nThe game is super easy and builds its length on forcing you to replay sections multiple times, and it's still a really short game. And for being a rogue-lite the levels have very little variation to them. The final boss, while I like the concept of it, is just pure button mashing, your position or timing doesn't matter at all, just click constantly and you win.\n\nI believe this developer could make a great game, but this isn't it.","timestamp_created":1600486909,"timestamp_updated":1600486909,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xISd0vQCct/YogI="}
