    review: 'I decided to buy the soundtrack for a reason.

      What''s the reason? Supporting the developer.

      The music isn''t bad and it doesn''t cost much.

      I honestly enjoyed the base game, it was gud.

      And I just had to support ''em a tiny bit more.

      Buying a soundtrack is the ideal way to do it.

      If you like the game, you should buy this too.

      Basement was simply a really gud experience.
