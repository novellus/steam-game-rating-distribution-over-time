The real twist of the the game though is if you doesnt fend of the evils comming at you in time you will instead get \"rewarded\" with  jump scares thrown at you out of the blue so that pretty much forces the player to take a more speedy and aggresive approach than in an usual match 3 game. The game has 100 levels with 10 enemies distributed over 10 sets of ten games and this is where the game starts to go downspiralling because its horribly balanced because compared to the usual match 3 games you actually has 3 lives to complete the entire game which frankly is an idiotic choice by the developer. Ive played my share of match 3 games over the years and hasnt even been able to reach the first boss so i feel fairly confident to say that most people wont get to that point either. When the 3 lives are gone the player will need to start the game all over again from scratch.\nAt this point and as much i would have liked to recommend the game i simply cant do that unless on a 90% discount. I'd recommend the developer to remove the 3 life feature because it will limit 99% of the player base.","timestamp_created":1604590388,"timestamp_updated":1604590388,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.638299167156219482","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwssjCzPUCccy9rAI="}
