The S-22 is interesting, but it will not give you a lot of gameplay for a rather expensive DLC. The D.III and S-16 are also of limited use. It's a tough call, but on balance there are better DLCs to be had.\n\n\n[u][b]Full review[/b][/u]\n\nThe Ilya Muromets DLC gives you an Eastern Front map, and three flyable aircraft:\n\n[list]\n[*] The Sikorsky S-22 \"Ilya Muromets\" bomber/recon plane\n[*] The Albatros D.III scout\n[*] The Sikorsky S-16 scout[/list]\n\nThe [b]S-22[/b] is a stunning aircraft. It is a giant bomber, which first flew in January 1914, way ahead of western developments.  It handles well, the forward visibility is superb, and is straightforward to fly. Although there are other \"heavy aircraft\" in [i]Rise of Flight[/i], this is the only four-engined one. It carries 10x1pood, 10x2pood or 2x5pood (a [i]pood[/i] is a Russian measure, being equivalent to 16.38 kg or 36.11 lbs). It has a single very-exposed gunner position on the top providing meagre defence. The S-22 saw a lot of service on the Eastern Front, with only one loss (12 September 1916, one S-22 vs four Albatros D.III).\n\nThe [b]Albatros D.III[/b] is also included. It is an early war variant of the D.Va, which comes free with the game. It is the perfect matchup for the S-22 on the Eastern Front, but is otherwise unremarkable. This DLC includes all the field-modifications for the aircraft.\n\nThe [b]S-16[/b] scout is a delicate early-war Russian fighter. It is slow and poorly equipped. It is easily annihilated by the D.III, which is 50% faster and twice as heavily armed. Still, it is nice to fly and has superb visibility.\n\nThere is a new map included (Tarnopol) with three separate seasons (summer, autumn and winter). The map is not needed for multiplayer games, but it is nice to have if you want to try an eastern-front campaign. The landscape has rolling countryside, a few large towns and a lot of rivers and forest areas. It is very easy to get lost on this map.\n\nHowever, ultimately, this DLC is about the behemoth S-22 Ilya Muromets.\n\n\n[u][b]So, why the negative review?[/b][/u]\n\nOverall, I really like [i]Rise of Flight[/i] and I am usually very supportive of unusual or quirky aircraft. It was very difficult to rate this one. I wish there was a \"Maybe\", rather than \"Yes/No\" review option. So, what's the problem?\n\nWell, if you are looking for a bomber, the Handley Page (from the DLC [i]\"Legendary Bombers\"[/i]) is better, cheaper, and comes with other good aircraft. The HP carried 6x the bombload and flies faster and higher. It is better armed and has more gunner positions and options. The S-22, while nice, is so slow and so weak and so vulnerable that it is a novelty to fly a few times, but it is too cumbersome to sustain dedicated interest. From a multiplayer perspective, all the other heavy bombers are better supported on maps. The S-22 will get little use.\n\nIf you are looking for an early Albatros, the [i]\"Furious Wings\"[/i] DLC has the exact same D.III. and the [i]\"Bloody April\"[/i] DLC has the Albatros D.II. Both of those DLCs have lots of other good aircraft. And the S-16 is a small spindly thing, again of very limited use. You are better off with the Russian N.17, which comes free with the game.\n\n\n[u][b]Conclusion[/b][/u]\n\nSo if you are starting out... I'd suggest steering clear of this \"Ilya Muromets\" DLC. There are better, cheaper, and more engaging DLCs out there, and I'd seriously recommend [i]\"Legendary Bombers\"[/i] in preference to this one. If, however, you really are interested in this particular area of the war or this particular aircraft, then you probably know what you are doing, and this review will encourage, rather than dissuade you.","timestamp_created":1519001251,"timestamp_updated":1519001686,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.712479948997497559","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/8nj1eECcsuxmQE="}
