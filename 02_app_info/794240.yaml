      /><br><br>Enter into a world thick with bubbling psychedelia. Descend deep into
      a new ecology teeming with multiple pathways, luminous levels, and complex obstacles.
      Transcend the material realm and assume your true form as Spinch, a hyper-agile
      organism consumed by the quest to rescue its litter of  missing offspring from
      an endless invasion of misshapen and malformed offbeats and oddities.<br><br>Bringing
      back old school difficulty, Spinch will have you replaying sections until you
      master your timing and reflexes. Dash, dodge, climb, swim, jump, and even shoot
      your own babies as you take on six enigmatic bosses in six vibrant worlds. Collect
      items to give you the upperhand while searching for your missing babies. Be
      on the lookout for your cousin - he's babysitting some of your relatives, but
      he's a little weird. With only a ticking clock and quick restarts - no lives
      or game overs - the game is welcoming to players of all experiences, but a formidable
      challenge to even the most capable of speedrunners.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/794240/extras/SP_GIF_04_616x110.gif?t=1599283921"
      /><br><br>The world of Spinch has been crafted and brought to life by talented
      award-winning Canadian cartoonist, Jesse Jacobs, known for his precise and detailed
      line work in combination with bold and simple color palettes. His works contain
      an affiliation with psychedelia, spirituality, alternate realities, and a blending
      of nature with technology. James Kirkpatrick, well known for his participation
      in the early Canadian graffiti movement and as avant-garde hip-hop artist, Thesis
      Sahib, created the audio landscape of retro soundbites and electronic sounds
      found within Spinch.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/794240/extras/Spinch_2.gif?t=1599283921"

    review: Wonky delayed controls, wonky hit box, super linear choreographed waste
      of time. Bought it because I like the illustrator's work. but the game is so
      rigid and infuriating that even that goes out the window.
