This game would benefit hugely from a modding community, there are plenty of games along the same lines of this that have huge modding communities behind them, giving them so much more and adding some of the quality of life things I'd previously mentioned.\n\nOverall, so far the game is somewhat fun but a little lacking in a number of ways, I won't say that the game is bad, as it's not, it could just do with some work.\nAlas, I will still recommend this game as it has some enjoyment factors to it and is a fun silly sort of game that has plenty of potential.","timestamp_created":1609781624,"timestamp_updated":1609781624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzMed5/YCfv65wAI="}
