    review: 'I have somewhat mixed feelings regarding this visual novel. It is excellent
      as a novel... but it falls a bit short on the visual half of the genre. And
      it''s essentially kinetic. There are 3 choices, but they do not appear to change
      the story much. The worldbuilding is also great? The setting reminded me a lot
      of [i]The Last Remnant[/i], a game I loved. Another game it reminds me of a
      bit is [i]An Octave Higher[/i]. There are some similar themes, but I liked this
      much better overall.

      I think I saw maybe one? typo in the whole thing which is impressive really.
      Characters are complex. The story is complex, without being difficult to understand
      or follow. It isn''t happy, but I often like the sad stories, and it ended fittingly.
      Loose ends are generally well tied up, and the mystery is explained as well
      as the character behind it can tell you.


      On the visual side... it has no CGs. The character sprites are nice, and I like
      most of the outfit variants. However, there are not many poses for the characters,
      (examples of variation include hoods when they''re mentioned, a violin for Vale,
      a rifle for Mero, and fighting poses for everyone) and when they''re performing
      actions, things tend to look a little odd. Moving around, and using abilities
      looks fine. Fighting is really well written! But it doesn''t look like fighting
      when no one has fight poses and there''s often no enemy sprites. There are also
      some unique creatures mentioned like sephies that I would have loved to see
      illustrated. It could also have used a bit more background variety. What exists
      is well done. But there isn''t a whole lot of variation. The start menu is also
      a little basic, though the UI is serviceable, and the text box is nice. The
      music also fits the scenes well.


      https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2015751880


      Overall, I liked it despite the gripes I have regarding the appearance of it.
      If this were a book, I wouldn''t really have any complaints? It''s a neat story.
      But I hope the team can do just a bit better on the visual side in their next
      release. Cause the writing is excellent. Would recommend this to people who
      like western VNs with more serious/sad plots.
