    review: 'Paid $1.50 with a coupon. Planned to spend an hour or two mindlessly
      shooting things. 6 hours later it was morning and I''d beaten the game with
      100% achievements.


      I wouldn''t say it''s worth the $6 full price, but it was at least $2 worth
      of fun.

      ---


      Bottom line: This is a pretty straight forward bullet hell. Medium difficulty,
      pixel graphics, decent music. It''s not going to win any awards but it served
      its purpose as an evening of fun.
