Too simplistic and the golems jumping around is jibberish.  Nice graphics.  Perhaps I should have skipped the tutorial levels to see if the skirmish gameplay has more umph to them, but doubt I would have known what was going on otherwise.  Am normally thrilled by a card play mechanic, and allowed myself to look past this game's untested nature.","timestamp_created":1582669895,"timestamp_updated":1582669895,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511139392852783203","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41cKev/ACcePL9AE="}
