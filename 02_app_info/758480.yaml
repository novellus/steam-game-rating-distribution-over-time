    review: This game is the pure entity of a video game. It has storytelling better
      than other game I have played in my life. Ukrainian ball in search of gas is
      a masterpiece of a game. In fact I would call it a lifestyle instead of a game.
      It has majestic graphics leaving you feel like its real life. It has the best
      controls I have ever seen of W, A, S, and D. this game is so amazing and  has
      so much quality that you can even explore off the map. It's the best game I
      have ever experience and it should win some awards. I believe that this maybe
      the best use of a dollar in my life.
