      /><br>Bug Attack! is a game inspired by arcade classics including Missile Command
      and Space Invaders.<br><br>Players are tasked with protecting their building
      as long as they can. Bugs emerge from the ground, many of which from random
      locations, at an increasing rate. Which is the greater enemy? The bug horde,
      or your own nerves?<br><br>To help, once you've earned certain amounts of points,
      you earn powerful bug bombs, and health-restoring building repair kits- but
      not even these can fight the bugs off for long!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/738720/extras/2pinsert.png?t=1572723740"
      /><br>Want to team up with a friend? Plug in a controller, and a second player
      can take command of a building-mounted turret(don't ask, it's a game!) to help
      fight off the never ending waves of creepy crawlies.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/738720/extras/weirdinsert2.png?t=1572723740"
      /><br>Tired of Bugs? Try to protect your wallet from the relentless savings!
      This mode is for one or two players, and replicates with 100% accuracy the pain
      your wallet feels when those Sales hit and light up your wishlist.<br><br><img
