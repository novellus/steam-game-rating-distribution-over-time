This is a continuation of the fight against Emperor Ming and his minions.\nThis sequel feel alot more like an adventure of Classic Doctor Who during Willam HartnelÂ´s era then TOS or SW.\nMore focus on people fighting this time around then space battles.\nThere is a \"spaceship\" battlescene in here that somewhat reseblems what was seen (twice) during SW ep VIII.\nAll in all a movie I can see on multiple occasions.\n\n(There is an surprisingly high amount of scenes/sets in this movies.)","timestamp_created":1530369074,"timestamp_updated":1530369074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54703831672668457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtdzGqOQCc5jgpAE="}
