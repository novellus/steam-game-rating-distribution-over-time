    detailed_description: '<h1>Developer Note</h1><p><i>&quot;Lawless Lands is meant
      to look, play, and feel like an old-school role-playing-game. Combined with
      modern features and favorites, this hybrid approach has been carefully calibrated
      to offer a unique and original experience of balance and flexibility, all while
      retaining the depth of a traditional RPG. The game features its own theme, lore,
      and storyline, and the player is placed at the center of it all. The systems
      in the game all coexist and collaborate to bring life and flavor to the game
      world. There are often many ways to complete an objective or to reach a goal.
      The equipment system is deep, and a handy prybar or a strong rope may become
      useful or even essential at times and could mean the difference between life
      and death. There is a lot of diversity between gear such as weapons and armor,
      and there are many different ways to build a character and shape them into a
      specific role, or even a jack-of-all-trades. Skills and talents also reflect
      this. The character creation system allows you to choose every aspect about
      your character. This includes gender, race, familial background, occupational
      background, traits, religion, alignment, appearance, skills, talents, and more.
      Create the fiercest slayer, the mightiest knight, the darkest occultist, the
      deadliest archer, the stealthiest assassin, or absolutely anything in between.
      The classless advancement system offers complete and total freedom without constraints.
      The game is intended to bridge the gap between traditional and modern styled
      RPGs.&quot;</i></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><i>Plunge into the Lawless Lands

    developer_response: "Hey. Thanks for checking out the game and sorry it fell short.\
      \ some have referred to this as one of the most innovative uses of RPG maker\
      \ but I guess not everybody feels that way. :-(\n\nSo after thoroughly reading\
      \ your review there are a couple things I would like to point out. One is that\
      \ you can tweak the darkness setting to your preferences in the character record\
      \ item in your inventory. also the hardcore mode is meant to be hardcore so\
      \ if you are \"griping\" about that, that seems like you should probably pick\
      \ the normal difficulty as that is the way the game is meant to be played. Hard\
      \ is freaking hard. Even I don't play on hard haha. movement speed on the world\
      \ map is significantly faster with a horse unless you are over encumbered so\
      \ be sure that you take that into account. torches can be gained freely at any\
      \ campfire and you can carry those around as well if you are having other issues\
      \ with the darkness.\n\nOstrem literally does appear on the left side of the\
      \ map. Go into the game and open up your map and you will see it in wraikin\
      \ province exactly where they say it is. You can also see that location on the\
      \ map on the store page or in the game folder because I included in all three\
      \ places. Proof: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2348763987&fileuploadsuccess=1\n\
      \nIf you needed any help you can always simply ask me as I get back to my players\
      \ usually within a few hours. I was literally working on Christmas Eve because\
      \ somebody mentioned a bug...\n\nYou can also get more party members to have\
      \ a group of up to four characters at once and you can choose and manage who\
      \ they are and how they fight. again you just need to use the character record\
      \ which is explained in the tutorial. You can upgrade your leadership.\n\nFor\
      \ quests that give vague locations you can always talk to the NPCs involved\
      \ and they will give you much more detailed instructions and you can also check\
      \ your journal because that usually gives much more of a hint.\n\nI never once\
      \ make anybody accept a single side quest that I can think of in the game so\
      \ that is false. You always have the option of what to take and what to leave\
      \ unless it is directly part of the main quest. there are also multiple choices\
      \ you can do in all of them so you can change the outcomes.\n\nI told you where\
      \ the sword was on the forums. Here is a screenshot though: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2348766602&fileuploadsuccess=1\n\
      \nThe messenger is somewhere between The starting city and Vulkold. The NPCs\
      \ give you at least five hints on where to look. It seems almost a little too\
      \ easy if you read what they say. I'm not going to explain it again here because\
      \ it sounds like you were frustrated but you can talk to at least three or four\
      \ NPCs who will all give you more of a detailed clue about where exactly to\
      \ look. That's part of the investigation. If that isn't enough, The messenger\
      \ is somewhere along the road near the tree line between the two cities. They\
      \ tell you exactly what bridge he took and what route he was taking so it can't\
      \ get much simpler...\n\nI'm sorry you were disappointed in the game. It sounds\
      \ like you were getting understandably frustrated and I'm sorry to hear that.\n\
      \n If you would like I will gladly refund your money via PayPal."

    review: 'I''ve played Waste Walkers and Disgraced and many other RPGmaker games
      since I quite enjoy the genre, but this one is the most infuriating so far.
      Firstly, I do want to mention that as of now I have not finished the game in
      it''s entirety, so this could be considered first impressions so what I say
      should be taken with a grain of salt. I will be speaking about my personal gripes
      so far and not necessarily the extra features since I haven''t experienced those
      yet, However, with that said, I''ve been very frustrated with the game to not
      talk about this. This is of course subject to change when I complete the game.


      I like the large world and I appreciate the attempt at making the game more
      difficult, immersive, and expansive, however in my opinion it falls flat in
      these two aspects. 95% of the time the game is so dark I can''t even tell what
      the world looks like when my character is stuck on something(I know there''s
      torches but those don''t last and they cost resources unless you find a fire),
      movement is slow especially on the world map even with a horse which is perhaps
      intended but it''s not like I would want to explore the game at a slow pace
      since the graphics aren''t exactly pretty to look at.I play on the hard difficulty
      and battles are incredibly boring since half the attacks don''t hit,I learnt
      all accuracy passive''s and it''s still a dodging match. Now you could say this
      is part of the hardcore experience, but in my opinion this isn''t really hardcore
      but more like rng for whether your attacks hit or is evaded over and over. In
      addition to that, it doesn''t help when the enemies are usually parties of 5
      meaning you have to wait for each and every mob to attack to do anything. The
      quests are also infuriating since like any other RPG player you accept every
      quest you come across and then forget where the quest giver is until you track
      them. Now to be fair RPGmaker games don''t have sophisticated tracking to guide
      you directly to the NPC but since the world is as large as it is, with most
      of the NPC''s being mindless husks it makes it a pain sometimes to even turn
      the quest in. Another minor gripe is when an NPC decides to block a one way
      path until they move out of the way so you can move on. The map only gives the
      locations of major areas so some quest locations are extremely vague like the
      one where you have to return some tools to a man in Dstrem but this location
      doesn''t appear on the map. One of the quests "Lost in Battle" seems to be glitchy
      since as of now I still cannot find the sword in a tiny battlefield location.More
      unforgivable is when  I almost got softlocked since the main questline required
      you to find a messenger, but how you find him was a clue only outlined when
      you received it. Meaning if you accepted the quest and didn''t read the dialogue
      initially or forgot about it as I did when I ended my session and came back
      I was clueless until I found the solution in the discussions.


      Now that my rambling is over, I do want to enjoy the game, but it has become
      so difficult to do, I see that most others actually enjoyed the game so maybe
      it''s just me.


      Edit: Dstrem is actually Ostrem, imo the ingame naming of Ostrem looks like
      Dstrem at least to me, the quest "Lost in Battle" is not glitched the Battlefield
      location is a different place from the Battleground location although in this
      case one would think a battlefield is basically the same as a battleground.'
