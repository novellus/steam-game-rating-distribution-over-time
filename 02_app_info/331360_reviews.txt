The game is 4 v 4 Bomb Run, which pits playes in a symmetrical arena with mini race tracks on either side.  The bomb spawns in the middle and the teams fight to carry the bomb through the opposing team's track and into their goal.  There are three classes: transporter, support and interceptor.  Transporters specialize in moving the ball, interceptors specialize in damage and crowd control while support specializes in heals and crowd control.  The first time I played it, I honestly thought it was a frantic mess.  Ten games later, I'm strategizing with my friends over team comp, devising new ambushes and learning to drive backwards while carrying the ball and fighting off enemies.  The game offers surprising depth and competition, while the devs have already promised new modes which all sound amazing.  I'd say the only thing the game currently lacks is a playerbase, so hop on in!","timestamp_created":1486427821,"timestamp_updated":1595994144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51549232006072998","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0L+qzPMCdra/cQ=="}
