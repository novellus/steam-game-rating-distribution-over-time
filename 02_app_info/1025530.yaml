    review: 100 Years War is a fun game.  Mildly addictive as all good games are.  A
      few minor quibbles.  Archers and crossbowmen are perhaps a little too powerful.  Almost
      every battle can be won by the effective use of archers/crossbows.  For historical
      inaccuracy though this pales in comparison to artillery which is far too effective.  It
      fires every go and inflicts significant damage.  There are a (very) few glitches
      in the software; in one battle a unit of cavalry suddenly galloped to the corner
      of the board, a distance that would normally take about six goes to cover.  Sometimes
      archers cannot fire for no apparent reason.  Light infantry can almost always
      run away from cavalry rather than being simply slaughtered.  The scenarios are
      varied and interesting and each is given a brief historical introduction.  Often
      there is more than one way to win.  For the price it is fantastic value.
