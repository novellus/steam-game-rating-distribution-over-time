I upgraded within about an hour of trying the lite version.\nThe interface is simple, but there is actually quite a bit you can do with this software once you get used to it.\nIf you like Rytmik Lite Chiptune Synthesizer, this makes it better, with a whole bunch of instruments to play with.\nNOTE: It's all electronic style instruments. There's not really any guitar or piano sounds or anything like that.","timestamp_created":1471341757,"timestamp_updated":1471341757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561477780342102051","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pLCzydYCfZqXXw=="}
