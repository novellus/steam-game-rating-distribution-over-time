Ive read many of the reviews all irrelavant to my decision to purchase this title \"the decision already having been made after 400 hours happily slogged into their previous title fallen enchantress anFE heroes edition...also 400+hours\"i found the reviews a bit lacking people with a preconcieved notion of what they wanted from this game not giving it much of a chance or simply just wanting more of the same FE. SK is a bit different but i find just as engaging as the other titles..if my hours seem a bit short,well maybe its because im nearing 1000 hours with this series and taking a bit of time on some other titles before my wife kills me! ;)..BUY IT","timestamp_created":1504694185,"timestamp_updated":1504694185,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wuWwq94CfoPThAE="}
