    about_the_game: "'The End of an Age: Fading Remnants' is a story-driven RPG game\
      \ for PC and is a Single-player experience. It is the first in the 'The End\
      \ of an Age' Trilogy. The game is being developed to fill the huge void left\
      \ behind by one of RPG's greatest sons, designed to be reminiscent of the earlier\
      \ Final Fantasys' with a focus on character development and an enriching story.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhilst it is a small-budget game, I am doing my best to\
      \ make the game as good as possible with the funds and resources I have available.\
      \ The game is being produced with RPGMakerVX Ace as this is a platform which\
      \ I am able to utilise and is fitting with the JRPG Genre as well as art style.\
      \ Of course, many aspects of RPGMaker can be customised with the use of scripts\
      \ and imported graphics and art, which will be revealed and put in place during\
      \ development. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA few of the key features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \n*Between 40-60 hours of gameplay.<br />\r\n*Turn-based ATB battle system with\
      \ random encounters.<br />\r\n*Many dungeons to explore. And Puzzles to solve.<br\
      \ />\r\n*An engrossing story of betrayal and honour.<br />\r\n*In game battle\
      \ arena to earn big rewards!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story takes place in a fantasy\
      \ world with a mysterious great evil threatening to destroy mankind and all\
      \ that it has touched. 'Fading Remnants' focuses on the character of 'Wilfred',\
      \ the son of a famous knight who was driven to madness during his many years\
      \ of battles. He eventually died, while still claiming 'a great evil from another\
      \ world would destroy all'. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt begins as the King's castle\
      \ is attacked by the Empire and their Skeleton horde, and Wilfred must return\
      \ and save his king and kingdom from destruction. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWill he\
      \ discover this other world and defeat the great evil within ?"
