I'd say the replay value can be there, but its not their by default and that's where mods in.\n\nWhat I don't like about this game currently is the ZLevel (what the developer calls it) system and can see others commenting on this problem as well. You place a set of stairs going down in one area and you expect it to go down in that area to the level below, but instead the stairs going up from the next level down is placed somewhere else at random. And you can only have one set of stairs going down/up per level to ground floor. If you place stairs going somewhere else on the same level it will remove the stairs you currently had placed and places it where you want it, but going down you will see the stairs going up is still in the same spot as last time.\n\nI really want to see more items and units added to the game for recruitment, after a while the selection gets bland.","timestamp_created":1610167573,"timestamp_updated":1610167573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4oOvd8vYCdvHbwQI="}
