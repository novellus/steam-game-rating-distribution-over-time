The Internet Browser being a train station was definitely my favorite of the areas, and I like the idea of the personifications of each of the different programs. The issue with this game is the execution. It's very buggy, and the old engine doesn't work well with newer hardware. The combat is really mindless unfortunately. There's not much strategy to it at all.\n\nIf you're looking for a good Descent-like though, the devs of the original game recently made Overload. Which is a spiritual successor to the series. So I'd definitely recommend giving it a look.","timestamp_created":1593218218,"timestamp_updated":1593236320,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8J2S+vICe87FkAI="}
