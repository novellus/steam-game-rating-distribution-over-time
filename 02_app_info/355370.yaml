      are forced to confront their impending deaths. Every night, a villager is killed,
      and the survivors are forced to alter their course in response. Every game creates

    review: "Nice game, but terribly frustrating. \n\nI spent hours figuring out the\
      \ puzzles and the world is fascinating and well developed. It has good characterization\
      \ and it's thought provoking. I was actually going to favorite this, but I changed\
      \ my mind. \n\nWhere my issue lies and what ultimately is causing me to rage\
      \ quit and never even want to look at this again is in the ending.  If you fail,\
      \ not only do you have to restart the difficult endgame puzzles but you have\
      \ to go all the way back to the day before that and redo the last boulder cave\
      \ puzzle before you can retrigger the climax.  Hours of time just freaking lost\
      \ with nothing to show for it. \n\n\nThey also throw some bizarre mirror light\
      \ puzzle at you in the endgame that the game no prior experience with and no\
      \ explanation.  it appeared that I was supposed to use them to reflect on the\
      \ switch, but I could move some of them, couldn't move others, couldn't figure\
      \ out how to flip the mirrors and had only ten minutes. Since I still don't\
      \ know what to do, I have no idea how to go about solving it, even if I replayed\
      \ through the five puzzles that i would have to redo to get back to that point.\
      \ \n\nI couldn't figure it out and I no longer want to.\n\nI already redid the\
      \ boulder puzzle once. I genuinely wanted to get to the ending (If you look\
      \ at my time, I've logged about 40 hours on this)  but it's become too tedious.\
      \ I did originally give this a not recommended, but after I cooled down a little,\
      \ I changed it to recommended. With reservations.  \n\nThis game had a lot of\
      \ care put into it and it was overall a positive experience. But it needs a\
      \ better checkpoint system or manual saves, or just a way of lowering the difficulty.\
      \ (however cheating this may seem.)\n\nOther annoyances: The character moves\
      \ as slow as molasses at times and the game crashes on you if you try to interact\
      \ with the boulders from the ground after you move them onto the geysers."
