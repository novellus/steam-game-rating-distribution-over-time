From the get go you can play any of the eight levels, so their isn't anything to really unlock. the controls are pretty wonky which after you play it for a bit is forgive-able. The game difficulty is also pretty strange. levels 1-7 took me about 6 minutes with the rest of the 29 minutes of gameplay towards beating the last level. It was crazy how easy the first few levels were. The game has surprisingly good graphics, but honestly it would feel more fitting if they used simpler graphics with simple designs. All that being said the spoon is really nice. if you have a spoon fetish this is the game for you.","timestamp_created":1608245699,"timestamp_updated":1608245699,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m7y6ufYCedmGuwI="}
