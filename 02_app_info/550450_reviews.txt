I prefer the Sparkle games with the mounted Orb Slinger. However, Unleashed is still an excellent entry to the series and just as fun, addictive and charming as the other Sparkle games. I'd say you should play Sparkle 2 first, and once you've beaten it and you need more Sparkle in your life (this is inevitable), then move onto Sparkle Unleashed. However no matter which order you play them in, they are all amazing games.","timestamp_created":1605489280,"timestamp_updated":1605489280,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwMin5/UCdqzSrgI="}
