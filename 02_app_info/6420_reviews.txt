If it were not for that broken level, this game seems like it could have been plenty of fun. In the end I'm not too disappointed as I only paid $2 for this game.","timestamp_created":1609672068,"timestamp_updated":1609672068,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwutH74/YCf8CEwAI="}
