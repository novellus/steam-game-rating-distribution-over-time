I will say I would like it if, for people like me, you incorporated comfort turning and walking through VR instead of holoport. I tend to get motion sick in VR and holoport can cause sudden movements and changes in direction that mess with me. I look forward to any updates you make. Also can you add in adjustable sound? This game was a little loud for my headset.","timestamp_created":1609463130,"timestamp_updated":1609463130,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+cze3fYCcqGhvwI="}
