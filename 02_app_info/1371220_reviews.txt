It has a deck-building type of mechanic in which you add cards to your deck, but the deck is not a draw-deck.  Cards in your “deck” influence the chances of drawing cards into the player’s five card hand from an infinite pool.  In other words, if you have only one card in your \"deck\", you have a 100% chance of drawing five cards of that type.  You are playing cards against Death as your opponent.  Death has their own deck that has similar draw mechanics, but only draws one card per turn.  Each turn one card from each deck is played with four possible events dictated by the player’s card with varying probabilities for each event known ahead of time.  \n\nCard Play Mechanics:\n\nUnlike most deck builders, cards are not purchased with resources.  After each turn (contract), there is an outcome based on probabilities that the player can influence strategically.  The events are in two layers of hierarchy.  First probability is whether the outcome is a \"success\" or \"fail\".  \"Success\" outcomes then divide into \"formidable\" (best) or just \"good\" events.  \"Fail\" results divide into either \"bad\" or \"terrible\" events.  Therefore, each player card has four possible events that can be created from a single card.  How these probabilities are controlled is based on the quantity of the various resources accumulated at the time.  Each card's four possible results (events) are unique to that card and have thematic names that must be learned by the player because influencing these events is how the player controls his deck.  \n\nAfter the contract with death is signed, the resulting outcome is shown as an event card on the table with its unique name.  Event cards are not added to your deck, but the player will be presented with three cards after the contract is burned from that event and must choose one to add to their deck.  These three cards are always the same whenever that particular event is created by any card.  Death's deck is also influenced by the events.  Death's deck mechanics must be observed and learned by the player as it is not shown to the player.  Death cards do have visible effects that are not based on the events which are shown on the face of the card.  These card effects can be countered only by finding the matching player cards that are color aligned to either cancel the effect for that turn only (blue) or to remove the card entirely from Death's deck (red).  This alignment information must be learned by observing how your hand and deck cards change color dynamically after a death card is played to the table.\n\nResources:\n\nSouls are the key to the end game god gamble.  Souls are acquired by taking more of a chance at failure by incrementally lowering the baseline chances of success for each card play contract.  Choosing cards with the highest chance of success increase chances to successfully gamble for souls.\n\nGold, Love, Fame, Law, Hate, Time, and Souls can be used to 1.) Influence probabilities of player card events to bias them to your strategy 2.) Perform rituals to exchange card types from your deck directly to your hand, convert resources to other resource types, etc.  There is also a random quantity of resources unique to each game that must be used as final payment that Death demands as a prerequisite to an ascension attempt/gamble.\n\nBlood is a unique resource gained by the ethical choices made every three turns when presented an encounter.  You can influence this even more by choosing from three different levels of corruption for your character.  More corruption will result in higher resource penalties, but more blood money and hate are the reward.  \n\nLaw is also a unique resource that is quantified in the game as a direct result from certain types of events.  Law represents the degree to which justice wants you behind bars.  You must make choices during an encounter with the law that can negatively impact your progress to accumulate resources.\n\nTime is a resource that can be impacted positively or negatively by events by impacting the number of turns left in the game.\n\nEnd Game:\n\nThe endgame is interesting and unique. I will not spoil too much, but it is designed to give replay value by having successively increasing win conditions and includes probability and gambling.  There is a mysterious puzzle aspect to the game where you may choose to answer questions posed by Death in order to take a “chance” at a higher level of ascension during the ultimate end game gamble.\n\nConclusion: \n\nFirst let me tell you why I like abstract card games with a theme.  They free up my brain’s limited bandwidth enough to allow my imagination to crunch on its own invented stories.  I can’t tell you how well the game play is balanced or fine-tuned from a skill vs. luck standpoint.  However, I found that each game length was just the right and challenged me to make careful choices and study the events necessary to manipulate them carefully.  This, in turn, led to a sense of my own story with ethical choices and corruption by my own hands.\n\nI found the game very enjoyable from a thematic and creative card play perspective with interesting probability influencing ideas.  The artwork, color palette, and music are well done. The colors and art style are bold, moody, and eye-catching.  More polish would benefit the User Interface screens in a few areas, but I eventually learned how each worked. There is a lot of English translation issues throughout the game if that bothers you, but they reminded me that this game was developed by a single person’s efforts with a creative goal and vision for his game. \n\n...\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nThis game has style,  I enjoy the art and music very much.  The colors are bold and evocative. \n The concept of controlling chance in multiple and interesting ways is intriguing.  There are language translation issues, but I don't mind as it adds to the mystery.  The tutorial could be improved, and I found it more confusing to play in \"future\" mode that was recommended for new players which has most of the tools locked in the beginning.  For example, I didn't understand card plays could result in losing turns as well as resources.\n\n...more to come has I continue to figure out how to play.","timestamp_created":1603884507,"timestamp_updated":1604891201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61538463830947876","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1603896590,"developer_response":"Hi, I really appreciate the feedback, if you have any idea how I could improve the tutorial I will appreciate it if you could tell me.\n\nAnd secondly, do you believe the removal of the \"Future\" will beneficial to new players?\n\nI'm glad you enjoyed it!"}],"cursor":"AoJ43om+1fUCdtjPqgI="}
