Although the type of music is not everyone's cup of tea it is a very good tune. Now playing review, one of the most approachable songs by Amon Amarth on the game. Only thing really tricky but still do able is either down stroking or alternating picking the verses but in general very approachable. Another thing it is the lowest tuning in the game so I suggest 11 or 12 guage people at rocksmith recommend 13s but 11 or 12 is plenty. The lowest string doesn't have to be a 50 or 60 it does fine with 48s so I suggest the power slinky pack from ernie ball","timestamp_created":1509931818,"timestamp_updated":1509931818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532293975353240967","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwweO8x98Ccc/CigE="}
