    review: 'Customization is that ''easy'' cash maker.

      Games sell customization like hot cakes.

      Do you want a cool skin? Here you go!

      So, just four bucks and it''s yours, folks.

      I honestly did not enjoy the base game.

      That''s the honest truth, I simply didn''t.

      And I already gave it a negative review.

      Not all of the DLC''s deserve it, though.

      Map packs are really cool in my books.

      Because they do increase my playtime.

      Customization however doesn''t do so.

      Just two bikes with one rider included.

      There''s also the sticker and two horns.

      It''s honestly overpriced in my opinion.

      Four bucks for customization is awful.

      I have to give this my negative review.'
