Quite often your attacks do not hit the target. It passes right through the villains without causing them any damage. This will make your progress impossible after a few levels in the game. You will simply give up after a couple of hundred re-tries. Also restarting the game from the very beginning is just plain absurd.\nGame developer needs to fix this with an update.\n\nI really wanted to like this game but.......\n \nAnyhow, I am marking this as a recommend only for the aesthetic feel of the game. It still needs a lot of polish especially in the terms of attack.","timestamp_created":1608567155,"timestamp_updated":1608567155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524253726005554199","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k92Ew/YCfa78uwI="}
