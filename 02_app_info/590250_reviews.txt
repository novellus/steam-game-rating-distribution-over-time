Ground campaign feels buggy and unfinished, guns are really boring to shoot, and horribly annoying. LightSaber type weapon can't block shots. Space campaign feels like you're driving a slug, the missiles take way too long to lock on a target that's literally touching the front of your ship. Overall, the game is just bad, and feels unfinished, also from other reviews it seems like it was released only so they can abandon it and try to make them feel good about them \"releasing\" the game even though it's not even close to ready to be released. \n\n[Quote] If you liked this review Make sure to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33220185-VR-Games-and-Tools/]Click here[/url] and give a follow for more reviews of good, bad and decent VR titles.
