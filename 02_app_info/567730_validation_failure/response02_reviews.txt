It just wasn't for me. It's gone free to play now and it is something you should grab before it leaves the Steam store on January 31, 2020, even if you don't have a VR headset if this looks interesting to you. Who knows, you may have more fun than I did in your 8K wireless VR contacts.\n\nI actually paid $3.59 USD for this game back in 2017. I didn't like it so I never played it again, but it did get some updates since then and is now a quite different game. I still don't enjoy it. It's just a 180 wave shooter with an additional throw mechanic. I think the throw mechanic is mediocre at best as I seem to get inconsistent results from the same throw mechanic form. I've definitely have played much  better wave shooters.\n\nThere are power ups and different guns you can get. There's kids that run around fast or that have helmets on. You can unlock Santa at the end if you collect enough stars. There are a total of 25 levels and I finished the game in about 1 hour. \n\n[b]Rate 5/10. I didn't have fun, but maybe you will or maybe you know some kids who would. At the price of free, I can give a neutral recommendation, besides Christmas just ended not too long ago.
