    review: 'i have to say it is a good game at where it is at, but it lacks content
      right now and many options for controls. on top of that the controls are different
      compared to VR games like it. never the less this game is exactly what i was
      looking for, it has so much potential to be such a great game: 1. need more
      control options along with things that suit the player like left handed support,
      or button layout for the player to set for themselves. on top of that reloading
      should have a option of either standard reloading or grabbing the mag: 2. more
      Guns, perk machines, doors , etc. To help keep people coming back and trying
      new tactics. also should be able to hold two guns because being limited to one
      is annoying: 3. spawns are messed up they only spawn on the bottom meaning i
      could just camp the stairs for the whole game. There are some other things that
      do need some improving like handles on the Boxes they are really low on the
      thing, maybe put them on top or something. But by no means is this game bad
      its a great game with A LOT of potential in it I love this game and cant wait
      to play it with some friends and i look forward to new updates because this
      is such a fun game!!!'
