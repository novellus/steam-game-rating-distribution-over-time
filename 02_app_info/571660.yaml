      \ VR is a challenging, truly dynamic, duck-and-dodge shooting gallery game that\
      \ takes place in the player's subconscious. Players cast light energy to battle\
      \ against the shadow aspects of their psyche in seven different themed missions:\
      \ Agency, Attachment, Fear, Procrastination, Shame, Stress, and Perfection.\
      \ Each mission features unique enemies related to the theme along with a challenging\
      \ Boss Fight! In addition, there is a Secret Boss Fight! There's even a dog\
      \ you can play fetch with in the menu area, who can also appear as an energy\
      \ form in the subconscious to save the player from failure.<br><br>Unlike games\
      \ with a passive shield, the action-based Power Up ability is both defensive\
      \ and offensive -- surrounding, protecting, increasing damage, and strengthening\
      \ slowing power with the press of a button. Add that to the five Caster abilities,\
      \ the Spotlight slow, the Energy Collect channel ability, the fluid energy system,\
      \ and the 18 different enemy types, and what you get is an on-the-fly strategic\
      \ and athletic game that truly uses the dual controller and room scale aspects\
      \ of VR, making it unlike any other!<br><br>There is an experience-based upgrade\
      \ system to empower your abilities and chances, and four difficulties to test\
      \ your skill: Easy, Normal, Mentalist, and Psychonaut. There's also an infinite\
      \ wave Endurance mode with a leaderboard where you can see how deep into your\
