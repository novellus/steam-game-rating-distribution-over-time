    about_the_game: "Welcome to the magical realm Draginsanity. It is full of dragons!\
      \ And it is totally insane! It used to be a world where dragons lived together\
      \ in peace and harmony. But one day an evil wizard cast a spell that turned\
      \ most of the dragons into evil minions. He also reduced the amount of mana\
      \ in the air. The mana enabled the dragons to fly and spit fire. Without it\
      \ the resistance against the wizard died quickly. All hope was lost until one\
      \ day a dragon was gifted with the power to see the few remaining mana hotspots\
      \ in the air and use them to his advantage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDraginsanity\
      \ is a nostalgic 2D platformer and it's easy to play. No matter which button\
      \ you press: If the hero dragon touches a green mana field he will fly and if\
      \ he touches a red mana field he will spit fire. But beware: The mana might\
      \ be moving and it's difficult to foresee where it will go. Explore five stages\
      \ and fight a boss at the end of every stage. Don't stop, because the screen\
      \ keeps moving. And watch out: If you get hit three times you go back to the\
      \ beginning of the stage."
