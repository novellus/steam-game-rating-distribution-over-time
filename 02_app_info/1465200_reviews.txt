[b]Broken Ecchi Gallery[/b] is a basic jigsaw puzzle game. There are eight puzzles to choose from, of varying difficulty. The image of the completed image is overlayed onto the playing area -- that, combined with \"snapping\" puzzle pieces make [b]Broken Ecchi Gallery[/b] a breeze.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThere is no story (and I'm not making one up).\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe titlescreen and user-interface are appealing and simplistic. However, the user-interface is slow to respond -- I found myself furiously clicking as I waited for it to respond my requests. From \"Settings\", you may adjust audio preferences. There doesn't seem to be any in-built way to window the application. There is no gallery. To review CGs, you must always complete their respective puzzles. The puzzles themselves and the playing pieces are stylistically [i]broken,[/i] but there is no way to see the artwork without the \"broken\" filters. \n\n[b]- The Goods-[/b]\nThere are eight puzzles to see, each featuring an anime babe. There is no nudity, I did catch some [i]mean underboob![/i] The artwork is decent, but you could find similar content with a quick Google search. If you're here for \"mature content\" (as advertised on the Steam Store), [i]you're going to be a sad camper.[/i]\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nI don't recommend this game, even if you're in the market for discount jigsaws. I don't ask for much -- all I want is a functional, responsive game with a good selection of artwork. [b]Broken Ecchi Gallery[/b] is the minimum of functional. There's no difficulty settings or \"save\" functionality. The UI isn't snappy, and there's no proper gallery. The artwork isn't bad, but it's both generic and not well suited for a widescreen monitor. My expectations for [b]Broken Ecchi Gallery[/b] were already rock-bottom, but this game couldn't even reach the bar.\n\n[table][tr][td][url=https://wombattrap.com/review/broken-ecchi-gallery/]To read the full length review, click here![/url][/td][/tr][/table]\n\n[h1]Support the Wombat[/h1]\n[b]<3[/b] Follow the [b]Wombat Trap Curator[/b] page for more reviews!
