It's fairly simply, you have a regular weapon and a special attack (bomb) that is very useful for defense countermeasures when enemy fire gets hectic. \n\nThere are nice explosion effects after you kill enemies that consequently can confuse/camouflage enemy fire which is a bit frustrating. Stage 10 has a spawning mine ship enemy group that attacks out of nowhere and will result in frustrating retries and loss of of score.  \n\nOverall, this is a decent game if you are into classic vertical shooters and can get it for a sale price.","timestamp_created":1609562784,"timestamp_updated":1609562784,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkODa4PYCe4LPvwI="}
