Colourful and some decent particle physics. Guns look good.\nAudio isn't the best. The robot tutorial narrator sounds like a younger brother putting on a robot voice while hating on everything you do. The guns sounds are lacking and could do with beefing up. Directional audio is just not great. At time I'm not sure where I'm getting shot from. \nGameplay is fun as a wave survival shooter can get. It looks easy, but it does get hard and more fun. There are weapon buys through the survival mode to grab and health.  At the moment survival mode is the only mode with story coming later on. I'm not sure have to work out of much health I had in game. It might of been there, but I couldn't find it. Shot the robot in the face and the drones in their jetpacks. The pistol guns over heats, this isn't fun and a little frustrating. I guess this was added to make the game a little more challenging. \nThe game is very cheap and in early access so really it isn't as bad as it sound due to the fact it can change and grow. \nAs it stands right now though I can't recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1580898792,"timestamp_updated":1580898792,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570034325122833252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1580999788,"developer_response":"Thank you for detailed review. First of all Tutorial robots was intented to be have insulting character. Depend on the backstory of this game he knows you are goÄ±ing to be destroy thousens of them and yet he have to teach you how to kill them. Anyway thats just a story direction I choose.\n\nThere was 3 HP stations exits in that map. But yes you have to play to learn where they are. Guns are overheating if you shoot rapidly but in your case you have to escape the fight to make them cooldown a bit. That mechanic was fine with teleporting play mode but locomotion just added recently. So I wouldn't recomment to play in locomotion mode.\n\n We aware the issue with grenades its only happens on OpenVR mode but Oculus mode just works fine. As you said there will be story mode as free update. Also more guns to play with. Have a nice day."}],"cursor":"AoJwpKa6ivACcuiq8AE="}
