    about_the_game: SpinZap is a challenging game in classic arcade style. Use your
      reflexes, dexterity and boss skills to conquer 81 levels of circle zapping madness.<br><br>Your
      task is to steer the spinning circles using various control methods, such as
      halting, reversing and skipping forward, in order to find a clear path to fire
      at the plasma ball hiding at the center of the circles. Hit the plasma ball
      enough times before the time runs out to win the level. Failure to do so results
      in your cannon being instantly blown up in retaliation. <br><br>Depending on
      how quickly and cleanly you finished the job, you are awarded one, two or three
      stars upon completion of each level.<br><br>The full version of the game spans
      nine worlds, each world containing nine levels and its own theme song to set
      the mood. <br><br>SpinZap starts off very easy, but grows harder for every world
      you conquer. In the end, you will need nerves of steel, perfect control and
      excellent timing to get the highest possible score.<h2 class="bb_tag">Single-player
      vs co-op mode</h2>SpinZap was originally designed as a single-player game, but
      has turned out to be a lot of fun to play in local co-op mode. All controllers
      are active in parallel, letting each player contribute to the team's successes
      (or failures) in the best way for each level. Note that there are no differences
      between the single-player and co-op modes - in fact, they are the same mode.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Control options</h2>Keyboard and joypad / joystick controls are
      supported. Only keys or buttons are used to play the game. When playing alone,
      using the keyboard or an arcade stick is highly recommended. Using a joypad
      in single player mode is possible, but can be regarded as self-punishment, or
      the equivalent of a self-chosen difficulty level &quot;insane&quot;.<h2 class="bb_tag">Resolutions
      and aspect ratios</h2>The game supports a wide range of aspect ratios, making
      it suitable for ultra-wide and ultra-tall display setups (provided that the
      GPU and its drivers support such configurations).<h2 class="bb_tag">Demo</h2>Remember
      to try the demo to get a hands-on understanding of what the game is about, and
      how well it plays on your system and with your controller setup.<h2 class="bb_tag">Warning</h2>This
      game contains circular rotating patterns which may make it unsuitable for people
      with photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitive conditions. Player discretion
      is advised.

    review: "Si ce n'est que 2 heures que j'en ai jou\xE9 pour faire les trois premier\
      \ 'Worlds', sans que le quatri\xE8me me soit 'facile' et d\xFB m'arr\xEAter;\
      \ j'en tiens tiens quelque chose de super bon.\nCaptivant comment on peut aligner\
      \ les rochers pour laisser de l'espace pour tirer de notre laser qui tire en\
      \ ligne droite. Le contr\xF4le se fait par le clavier (touche: 'E', 'D', 'C',\
      \ et \xE9galement de l'autre c\xF4t\xE9 du clavier: 'O', 'K', 'M') pour contr\xF4\
      ler une 'methode' (arr\xEAt, bouger, virer) qui, de cel\xE0, nous permettrons\
      \ de faire 'notre job': d\xE9truire le 'centre' par notre laser.\nChaque niveau\
      \ comporte trois \xE9toiles: 1. compl\xE9ter le niveau. 2. avoir compl\xE9ter\
      \ le niveau avec plus de 'hit' que de 'miss'. 3. Avoir compl\xE8ter le niveau\
      \ avec la moiti\xE9 du temps qui vous est accord\xE9.\nTr\xE8s simpliste. Je\
      \ l'accorde. Mais j'ai jamais 'smasher' tant un clavier de toute ma vie. LoL.\n\
      Les \xE9toiles r\xE9colt\xE9s dans chaque niveaux vous permet de d\xE9bloquer\
      \ les niveaux suivants.\n\nJ'en fait parall\xE8le \xE0 des jeux comme Jumpgrid,\
      \ o\xF9 il faut des r\xE9flexes rapides. L\xE0 o\xF9 Jumpgrid sont des grilles\
      \ o\xF9 tu peux bouger en endroit s\xE9curitaire; SpinZap sont des synchronisations\
      \ de rotation de rochers en forme de circulaire avec des fentes dans la p\xE9\
      rip\xE9tie de celle-ci qui permet de tirer \xE0 travers d'elles."
