You get to play through exciting environments with varying difficulties accompanied by an albeit simple art style enhanced by clever foreground and background design. The soundtrack fits the games atmosphere well and will certainly drive you mad after your tenth restart.  The games difficulty is derived from skillful timing and applying provided game knowledge, with occasional AI trickery. In it's early access state there's still a good chunk of polishing to be done but from what I've seen there is consistent and productive updates being made by a responsive dev.","timestamp_created":1605157571,"timestamp_updated":1605157571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4m5m23fUCevvvrQI="}
