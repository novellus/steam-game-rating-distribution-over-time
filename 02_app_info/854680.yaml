      \ is the first game that I have ever made, I started working on it when I was\
      \ fifteen years old. While I was making this game I was really just starting\
      \ to discover how game design worked and I didn\u2019t have a clear vision of\
      \ what the core mechanics would be, or what type of game it would become, I\
      \ just made some levels in my own fictional world named Aris and added the mechanic's\
      \ way later on. I have made multiple updates and fixed a lot of bugs, but because\
      \ my coding and game making from back in the day are now so unclear to read\
      \ and hard, to basically impossible to work with I have decided to go from early\
      \ access to full release, and do very minimal updates from time to time. It\
      \ is now 2020 by the time I put this on the store page, I am almost nineteen,\
      \ and I fear that any updates I will make to the game will only result in more\
      \ bugs and ultimately in an endless amount of fixing, to the point where I basically\
      \ have to remake the entire game, this means that most bugs currently in the\
      \ game will likely remain, though, from the feedback that I have had, I hear\
      \ that it is still definitely playable at this stage. Please keep this in mind\
      \ before you buy DeepLands, I still like to play it myself, even though it is\
      \ not the best game out there, obviously, and I believe that you can certainly\
      \ still enjoy playing this game.<br>Thank you to all those that have already\
      \ played DeepLands, I hope you enjoyed it, and to all those that will buy it\
