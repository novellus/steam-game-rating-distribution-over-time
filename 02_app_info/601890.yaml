    review: 'I wish I could get a refund for this. This is a graphic designer''s nightmare.


      Howler: yeah, there''s a reason why you''ve never heard of it.


      First of all, the program has no official manual outside of poorly-recorded
      and terribly-constructed ''tutorial'' videos on its official Youtube channel.
      The same can be said for trying to understand Dogwaffle from the written ''tutorials''
      on the official website; they''re written like third-party guides by someone
      who doesn''t fully understand the program, yet seemingly they created it. Nothing
      is ever fully explained, and worse yet, most of the creations and examples look
      horrible outside of a few cool terrain maps.


      Second of all, this program isn''t even remotely similar to Photoshop, and likely
      isn''t even trying to contend. I was a little misled by reviews claiming it
      was anything like Photoshop, but I''m pretty sure these were just planted by
      the dev''s themselves. Every tool and toy contained here just kind of marches
      to the beat of its own kazoo; nothing makes actual sense and produces nothing
      but otherworldly results. It''s a true hands-off approach to generating heaps
      of garbage with a few clicks.


      I have plenty of other gripes, too. Brushes don''t seem to go past 100 pixels,
      the undo button will oftentimes reverse 3 steps in one, and most of the unique
      ''toys'' and ''tools'' Howler has to offer will instantly crash the program
      once you attempt to actually use them. Some of the most experimental and ''cool''
      looking tools don''t even get a preview off the ground before crashing Howler,
      even though some of them look very interesting.


      Trying to pull off animation with Howler is a shitshow as well; attempting to
      create a timeline of more than 199 frames typically fails (or far less, depending
      on what Howler decides you''re doing with it today), and typically spits out
      the same 1+ GB size file regardless of compression amount and algorithm - pick
      one, they all do it. What this means is that you can get a fraction of the quality
      for the same exact file size - whoever made that mistake and never checked to
      see if it worked probably designed 99% of Howler''s other features, too.


      The keyframe feature works decent-enough for basic automation, but the problem
      is that most of the filters actually have lackluster features (read as: missing
      entirely) as opposed to how they appear in the actual filter window; so if you
      thought you were going to get a ''twirl more'' or ''random seed'' effect in
      your timeline, nope. Howler decides yet again what you can do with its own features,
      even though they existed in the general menu. What kind of oversight is this?


      I almost didn''t want to include the layering issue, but here goes: the layers
      are a complete and total clusterfuck. Oftentimes attempting to affect one layer
      puts god-awful effects on top of everything globally and sometimes even trying
      to undo this process lands you with a black screen when you started off with
      a white layer (which the program somehow equates with transparent). Even the
      worst photoshop clone can get this right; why can''t Dogwaffle Howler?


      Honestly, Howler could be redeemed if it would just stop crashing. I could see
      it not as an alternative to Photoshop, but a compliment to any traditional graphic
      design tool for the sake of generating lots of really alien texture maps and
      terrains. Sadly, it falls short in everything it even tries to do, and just
      ends up being another moderately-priced piece of garbage to uninstall.'
