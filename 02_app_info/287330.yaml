    review: 'Trials Fusion is most definitely an uninspired, manipulative money-grab
      compared to Evolution when you can''t play 80+ percent of what TrackCentral
      has to offer but: I caved in and played along and man... these are some damn
      fine tracks! What the base game should have been in the first place.'
