      shooter with rogue-lite elements and an open-ended world gameplay. Explore a
      city thrust into disarray by an unknown event and survive the hordes of mutated
      abominations that lurk at every corner.</li></ul><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1211980/extras/Postacard1Loop_6.gif?t=1603116035"
