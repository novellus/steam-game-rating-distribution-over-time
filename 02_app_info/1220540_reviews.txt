You can pick either a combat or magic oriented character. What each character can/can't do is unclear to me (since I can't read Chinese).\n\nThe goal is to find NPCs and complete quests, which generally involve killing one or more enemies. You start in a \"hub world\", which houses shops and possesses no hostiles. Each world is huge, but lacking interactive content. You can expect most of your playtime to be walking from point \"A\" to point \"B\". Leveling up is an arduous grind, and if you enter the wrong location you'll be smashed by enemies hundreds of levels above you.\n\nAs you level up, you can enhance your stats and learn new attacks. The character I chose had the ability to \"poison\" enemies, which removed a set percent of health each second. This allowed me to kill enemies that would otherwise take [i]hours[/i] to kill in minutes. She could also summon (one) companion, who made cheesing enemies with my poison [i]even easier[/i]. This game is deeply unbalanced (if you couldn't already tell).\n\nI've seen the interface and progression system in at least two other titles. [i]I smell asset rip.[/i]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe world is under siege, and um. . . these mutant monsters have wreaked havoc by \"corrupting\" otherwise normal folk. . . and you're the hero who's been chosen to beat back the mutants.\n\nI. . . can't read Chinese.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe title screen showcases cast of clashing [i]asset flips[/i], but the animated sbackground is a great touch. Under \"Set\" (or \"settings\"), the langauge, volume and resolution can be adjusted. Overall, the user interface is basic (and one I've seen from other Unity games). Even though my language was set to \"English\", the character select screen was in Chinese. The in-game assets do look good, but are [i]clearly[/i] a mash of widely used Unity assets.\n\n[b]- The Goods -[/b]\nThe \"Adult\" DLC makes a lot of (female) characters go shirtless. Expect upper female nudity.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nGiven the bugs, visuals and [i]awful[/i] balance, I strongly [i]disrecommend[/i] this game. I enjoy these kinds of (generally [i]bad[/i]) RPGs, but this is one that I couldn't get behind. I feel like I'd been pranked with an overpriced piece of [i]memeware[/i].\n\nMaybe this is shovelware, or maybe this is a passionate project made by an overextended crew. In either case, it's grossly overpriced (at ten USD) for how [i]fun and functional[/i] the content is.\n\n[h1]Support the Wombat[/h1]\nIf you enjoy my reviews, please follow my Curator page.
