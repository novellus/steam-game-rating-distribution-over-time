Go on: you know you need 'em. You know your life is meaningless without 'em. You can never have too many cute/epic animal jigsaws in your life and you KNOW it, damn you all!\n\n   I wouldn't go paying more than half-price, though. Even at 49c U.S., this won't keep you entertained for too long. Yet another perfectly competent, if highly inessential, Snkl Studio product.\n\n   Verdict: 5.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/​\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210​\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1564501424,"timestamp_updated":1564674251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545745670795440674","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j8v2puwCe4O2zwE="}
