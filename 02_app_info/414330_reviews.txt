I really appreciate a game with black protagonists and showing the dirty parts of society. This needs to be talked about and i'm glad it is. I also appreciate that you get to toggle depicition of violence on/off.\nLike many reviewers say: the graphics look like 3D games i played 15 years ago, and the camera controls are impractical. I'm not too fond of first person camera and would have appreciated if Aaron had a voice.\nAnd it is quite the walking simulation, paired with doing a lot of grinding like going to bed or counting out change at your work place. The gameplay itself is not too exciting. It is kind of immersive to have to make choices, though, and worrying along with the protagonist whether a choice will get me or loved ones in trouble...\n\nWould i recommend the game? I read a review that said it's less a game than it is an experience. I would recommend the experience!","timestamp_created":1559981457,"timestamp_updated":1559981457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554118633270263672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45v+Im+sCetP9wgE="}
