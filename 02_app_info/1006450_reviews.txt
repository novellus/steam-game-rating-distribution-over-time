But, besides the genre, another problem is that the game is OLD (1993) and feels like it.  The interface is bad, the graphics are terrible, and the sound is horrible.  Surprisingly, it also seems to load and run a bit slowly on a modern machine (I assume that's an issue with the DOSbox it runs in).  That probably would have been acceptable, but the game just didn't grab me (and I don't know why).  So, after a mere 1.2 hours, I gave up and I'm Not Recommending it.\n\nI don't know if this is allowed, but, if you're at all interested in the game, you could try it out for free at the Internet Archive:\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/msdos_Eric_the_Unready_1993","timestamp_created":1581002639,"timestamp_updated":1581002639,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532165229320526123","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46bjGjfACfbrH8AE="}
