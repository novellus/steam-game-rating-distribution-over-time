If you’re interested in spicy games that’d rise err… the room temperature feel free to check out [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38444643/]our curator[/url][/u] (we will love it if you follow it too ^^).[/code]\n\nHimeko Maid is a visual novel that puts us in the shoes of Suzuka, a lucky girl who gets the opportunity to participate in the Himeko Maid contest and win $500000 if she manages to successfully train a maid in different tasks (and “tasks” ;)).\n\nThere’s not much to say about the story, but that’s fine because the strength of the plot lies in the characters and their interactions. The characters start as archetypes but they get more and more developed as the story progresses (Alice not so much, but she compensates it with her huge appeal). There’s Suzuka, the innocent protagonist who will discover many things about herself she didn’t know about; Harumi, the cheerful but clumsy girl [spoiler]who is also very scary at times[/spoiler]; Saeko, the super-serious yet awkward when it comes to socializing; and Alice, the perpetually horny secretary of the Tachibana Mansion who is also the embodiment of all the [i]ara ara[/i] energy in the world.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2256179915\n\nThe soundtrack is fine and does its job at enhancing the scenes (especially the one that plays during the spicy scenes and 70% of the interactions with Alice). I have to say the track that plays [spoiler]when you win the contest[/spoiler] got stuck in my head and it’s giving me some very silly edit ideas. I wish all the tracks had the same volume though because a few of them were a bit louder than the rest and it made it hard to hear the character’s voices.\nTalking about their voices, the voice actresses did a great job at bringing those characters to life (Fun fact: For some odd reason Alice’s tone of voice reminded me of Ozen from Made in Abyss. Don’t ask me why).\n\nI really liked the art in this game. The characters are really well done, the backgrounds are pretty, and the sex scenes are great. \nA special mention goes to the game’s interface. The use of a font that fits the story and the addition of background images to the choices in the exploration parts of the game clearly shows how much they went out of their way to make the game as distinguishable as possible from the other visual novels in the market. \n\nIn short, get this game and play it as soon as you can. It’s a bit short (it takes about 5 hours to get all the endings) but it’s definitely worth every penny.","timestamp_created":1602799578,"timestamp_updated":1609430506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.601728677749633789","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoZPi3PYCc/2LqAI="}
