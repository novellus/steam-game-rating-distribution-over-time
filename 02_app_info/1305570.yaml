    review: 'People who know me (or follow my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34724158]curator
      page[/url]) are aware of how much I love indie games and especially those that
      are unfortunately not known by many (indie gems, in other words). That''s why
      I was waiting for this game''s release. When I first looked at this game, I
      thought the premise and the ideas looked interesting, and the art was good.
      So I wishlisted the game, bought it, fired it up and then... woah...


      I started getting worried right after I got to the main menu. The main menu
      feels like the game was originally designed for mobile phones, and the fact
      that it does not feature any form of key rebinding feature in the options or
      uses touch-like controls with the mouse instead of its buttons, did not help
      it either. Still, I told myself "what can possibly go wrong?" and started the
      game.


      Upon starting, you will get thrown into the action without any kind of explanation.
      There is no story other than what is mentioned in the store page, the importance
      of RPG elements or how they work will never get explained, there''s no mention
      of controls (you need to have read the manual beforehand), and you will have
      no idea about how the game''s features work. And don''t read the aforementioned
      manual in hopes of getting those information; because it only shows you the
      controls and nothing else. Now don''t think this lack of information has a massive
      negative effect on the game; because not only the game uses the RPG elements
      in a basic manner, but it''s purely a score attack game.


      Yes, this is a score attack game. You can get to the boss (The Dragon King)
      right in the beginning minutes of the game and try to beat him (just like I
      did). And after beating the boss, nothing special happens. You just continue
      playing the game to get a high score and can challenge the boss again until
      you lose all of your lives. That''s all you can do in this game. However, there''s
      even not a leaderboard to compare scores. So you just play the game, trying
      to get high scores for your own sense of accomplishment or to have fun.


      And about having fun with the game... I believe the experience differs from
      person to person. Some people might enjoy playing this game, but I honestly
      could not bring myself to continue playing it due to reasons. First, the RPG
      elements do not mix well with the pinball gameplay. For example, there are enemies
      all over the field that respawn constantly, making progression to the boss or
      the other play areas frustrating. Or you might get a random battle encounter
      in middle of your game, forcing you to play a mini game that not only serves
      no purpose other than increasing your score, but you can also get out of it
      before its timer expires without penalties. And when you get back to the main
      level, every obstacle and enemy you have destroyed will be back.


      Second, there''s an overuse of graphical effects. Every time you hit or destroy
      an enemy/object, you see a flash on screen with various sizes. Now imagine if
      the main character is in a small room with many enemies (like the boss room)
      and is constantly hitting everyone. Because of this, there will be times that
      the effects will not let you see the screen clearly and understand where the
      main character is.


      Lastly, I can swear that there''s an issue with the physics. I have played a
      lot of pinball games before: Devil''s Crush, Win XP''s 3D Pinball Space Cadet,
      Sonic Spinball, Pinball FX3 and so on. Because of my experience, I do believe
      there is something wrong with the pinball physics; as the main character sometimes
      gets thrown away in angles that make no sense, or gets a massive speed boost
      from bumpers that normally throw him around a little.


      So overall, I did not have a good time with this game. There is a vast amount
      of potential in both this game and the idea it''s using. However, a lot of it
      has been lost in execution. Therefore, I cannot bring myself to recommend this
      game; especially to those who have played tons of pinball games in the past.'
