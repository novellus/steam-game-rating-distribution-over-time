It has a proper story line with unlockable units as you progress.  You can upgrade those units with points earned as you play through and re-play through some maps.  You can convert less used materials to more needed materials as well, which is a nice QOL feature and just helps you level up your units faster.\n\nCurrently, there are 50 levels in the main story with an addition \"Tower Runs\" mode.\n\nThis is what you'll do during and after the campaign.  The Tower Runs mode is an endless mode with increasingly difficult onslaughts coming, the farther you go, the more materials you'll acquire for Crafting.\n\nCrafting is where you'll upgrade the units, some units share materials so there is some farming aspect involved to sort out your preferred team.  Speaking of preferred teams, let's talk more about units/upgrades/ascending...\n\nYou'll start off with some basic units, like an archer and your merchant (sunflowers from PvZ), you'll get a knight, a mage..etc.  You'll use materials you get to upgrade their stats.  Once you max their stats, you can Ascend them.  They unlock a new version, for instance, the normal mage will slow enemies; the ascended mage will have chain lightning.  The archer will ascend to a fire archer.\n\nThese kinds of choices open a world of variety.  The ascended units cost more, but do more damage/utility.  When you pick your team of units, you'll have to keep in mind how expensive they are and how viable they'll be.\n\nThe normal archer is 100 gold to place.  The fire archer is 500.  So you won't be spamming fire archers across your lanes on wave 2.\n\nI won't spoil any strats here but I'll leave you with this... \n\nIt's fun, it's a nice escape, and sometimes those are hard to find these days.  GG, indeed.\n\n\n\n\n\nOh yeah, the game has magic spells.  Have fun!","timestamp_created":1605471635,"timestamp_updated":1605471635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ446Dk5vUCf6rNrgI="}
