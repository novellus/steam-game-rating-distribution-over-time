For 5 bucks it's a fine game.  You shoot waves of blocks of red and blue with a blue 1911 in the left hand and a red 1911 in the right. Even on \"easy\" some of the waves become overwhelming, nevertheless it's enjoyable and repeatable.  Don't expect any more than what the vid shows - this is not Beat Saber after all.\n\nThe graphics are blurry unfortunately.  I'm running a 2080 ti with a Rift S on a very good gaming system but it still looks quite blurry.  I wasn't expecting 4k or anything but hopefully the dev corrects this.\n\nAs of yet you cannot add your own music but the music presented is enjoyable.\n\nFor me, the 5 bucks was worth it!","timestamp_created":1580326853,"timestamp_updated":1580326853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515151500701904297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mMO0+e8CdMH67gE="}
