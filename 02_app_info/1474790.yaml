    about_the_game: "Overview:<br />\r\nOperation BoomSlang is a Multiplayer, Free-For-All,\
      \ Top-Down Shooter that combines elements of Roguelites, Hack &amp; Slash and\
      \ Platforming. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach round a new Procedurally Generated Arena\
      \ spawns consisting of 2 dungeons each one containing a key at the end, both\
      \ keys need to be inserted into the Final Gauntlet door to open the pathway\
      \ to the finish line of the round. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDescription:<br />\r\n\
      Each round consists of 10 players split into 2 groups of 5 each starting in\
      \ one of the 2 dungeons. When a player dies they are instantly teleported to\
      \ a spawning point in the opposite dungeon, losing some items obtained and access\
      \ to the objectives the player was busy with but without losing any playtime\
      \ the player now needs to restrategize and co-ordinate according to the items\
      \ and objectives of the opposite dungeons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are multiple\
      \ ways to score different types of score points, other than obtaining keys or\
      \ defeating other players in combat, these include, hunting creatures, completing\
      \ side quests in the dungeon, collecting treasure and so much more. At the end\
      \ of the day, everyone is a winner in their own unique way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe combat and mobility combination in Operation: BoomSlang will allow for\
      \ setup that gives players fluid, fast and fully-featured controls. With a swift\
      \ sprint function, a jump/double-jump functionality and a Dash capability the\
      \ player, has full control over the player's mobility for offensive, defensive\
      \ and exploration purposes. Along with a robust hybrid shooter/hack-and-slash\
      \ combat system, Operation: BoomSlang! strives to give players not only a unique\
      \ and deep multiplayer combat experience but one that is also fun as hell!<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nOn top of this there will also be killer power-ups, Mini-Bosses\
      \ that mix things up, stellar Set-Pieces, frantic combat and a whole lot of\
      \ explosions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPremise:<br />\r\nIn Operation: BoomSlang!\
      \ you take on the role of a sci-fi soldier part of a secret future military\
      \ platoon called BoomSlang, tasked with eradicating mutant animals that have\
      \ gone berzerk and that the military would prefer to keep under wraps. In order\
      \ to accomplish this, you need to reach the core of the mutant mound and destroy\
      \ it in order to prevent more mutants from spawning. Along with these objectives\
      \ the palyer is also tasked to recover any valuable artifacts from the ruins\
      \ the mutants inhabit, complete any other side objectives to boost the military's\
      \ prospects, oh yeah and finally, compete against your fellow colleagues in\
      \ the BoomSlang platoon to see which soldiers are affluent in which categories."
