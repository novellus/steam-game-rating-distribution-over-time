The environments are engaging and varied enough without overstaying their welcome. The sound design is on the same level. The puzzles are in no way difficult but they are quick and engaging enough to keep the pacing comfortable. The game crashed for me twice in my playthrough but the autosaving is very generous only putting me a few paces behind wherever the crash happened. \n\nThe pacing was decent enough. I got stuck a few times mostly due to a lack of explicit direction at times. I can imagine a player without a watchful eye will miss pickups leading to a LOT of wandering around without really knowing what to do. Just keep your eyes open and explore every nook and cranny. \n\nIn terms of the design of the game, I rather liked the developer's approach. I don't want to spoil anything. To put it simply, the few things I thought I was going to complain about he either moved on from or fixed during the course of the game. I don't know if this is just the \"I'm a solo dev and I got better as I made the game\" or if it was intentional, but it worked out great. It really helped enhance the feeling of uneasiness, which I would say is the point.\n\nThe story hits hard the idea of being a stranger in your own home. Most of the time you are technically safe but the idea of being in danger is nearly constant. The few times you are in \"danger\" and get caught, you don't game over, you just get shook. Exactly like being emotionally abused but having no scars to prove it, no damage on the outside. \n\nMaybe the thread connecting the \"game world\" to the abuse imagery is a little flimsy, that's up to the player to decide. All I know is the feelings of having to go through that as a kid were captured really well here. \n\nSorry you had to go through that Adam, hang in there.","timestamp_created":1608872537,"timestamp_updated":1608872537,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4utWRzPYCeNn6vAI="}
