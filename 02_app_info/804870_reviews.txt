That's on the good side\nPoor and clunky controls, glitches and bugs, unbalanced difficulty settings (no difference between the skill levels detectable), unfair difficulty in mode 'base defense', bad story, stupid AI, generic level design and I could mention much more make this game forgettable.\nShame, because with some effort it could have been good. These work shows though some skill and love of the dev. \nMaybe next time, I wish so!\n\nHolyMoly1984 out.","timestamp_created":1608857943,"timestamp_updated":1608857943,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vf/Zy/YCeev1vAI="}
