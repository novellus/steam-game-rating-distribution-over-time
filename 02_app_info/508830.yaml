    review: "A very good soundtrack; yet an oddly modern-sounding one at times for\
      \ a game set in, ya know, a ye olde fantasy world.\n\n   It works, though. And\
      \ as a lover of both orchestral [i]and[/i] synth-y music, I'm hardly complaining.\
      \ The price is also very reasonable, for eight perfectly decent-sized tracks.\n\
      \n   Verdict: 8.5/10.\n\nUPDATE: Actually, this soundtrack is seriously growing\
      \ on me. And how did I not notice the similarities to the Amnesia: The Dark\
      \ Descent soundtrack before? Let's increase that Verdict a tad...\n\n   Updated\
      \ Verdict: 9/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my\
      \ two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\u200B\
