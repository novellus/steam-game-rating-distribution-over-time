Like Pokkle's dashing attack, or Pipiro's slow magical attack. but once you get the hang of the combat and the gameplay loops and more magics for Pipiro, you'll find a delightful dungeon crawler that is filled with fun dungeons and engaging combat which adds up to an addicting gameplay. Coupled with gorgeous soundtracks, great worldbuilding, hilarious characters and dialogues, and you've got a fun-filled experience of a game. The game has shown its age by the lack of QoLs that results in a lot of backtracking, there's also a certain order you have to go through these dungeons that the game does not tell you. But if you're okay with that, then you'll have plenty of fun. Good game, play it.","timestamp_created":1608118076,"timestamp_updated":1608118076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwptDTtfYCfMbWugI="}
