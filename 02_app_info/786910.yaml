      My latest game, Beyond Senses, which is a Multiplayer Horror Game, is much more
      innoative, but unfortunately, I wasn''t able to market it very well. I wanted
      to build this game together with the community but unfortunately I couldn''t
      reach out and get people involved in the further development of the game.


      Maybe it''ll change your opinion about my very first game. :) It was just me,
      not a team of experts.'

    review: "Maybe I'll take some slams for this but Deluded Mind is a stinker if\
      \ there ever was one.  It's a nuked to the ground warehouse of cliches that\
      \ didn't run well enough on my machine to even finish once after battling my\
      \ way through the slowdowns only to reach yet another in a series of hallway\
      \ running, where do I go (?) maze segments.  \n\nWhat you get here is unfortunately\
      \ your same ol' mental-illness madness tale with cement-shoes gameplay that\
      \ consists of read a little of this and a little of that, solve some very basic\
      \ puzzles, get stuck in weird hallways where you gotta stumble your way to the\
      \ exit by picking the right directions (sometimes running from a goofy baddie\
      \ or two) while generally getting annoyed every 20 minutes further.  It lacks\
      \ atmosphere by settling on dark n' dreary visual choices n' nothing but although\
      \ the sound is at least above average.  Stumbling around in the dark like a\
      \ fool in horror games is one thing, doing it like a fool with very little point\
      \ is absolutely another.  I actually had to take a couple of Tylenols after\
      \ 3 hours of this frustration and still remember needing to do so.  It gave\
      \ me a headache.  \n\nIt's not optimized as well as it could be but that's not\
      \ the bottom line problem.  The game isn't enjoyable, progression leads to more\
      \ of the same and with the running issues it became too much of a hassle to\
      \ even want to finish.  Unfortunately I put too much time into it to refund\
      \ it (I'm stubborn as hell, I like at least finishing things I buy once).  Road\
      \ closed due to avalanche, proceed with caution."
