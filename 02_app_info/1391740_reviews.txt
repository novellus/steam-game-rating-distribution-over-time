It has a strange, abstract, almost dreamlike feel to it while also having lore that suggests that this is a world with a history. Something I appreciate is that the game is weird, but it doesn't feel quirky. The stereo has a nice selection of songs that range from chill to unsettling which helps set the mood for both the horror focused levels and the platforming focused levels. \n\nInitially there's no air control which means when you make a jump you're completely committed to that jump. This is a weird choice for a platforming game, but for a horror game it makes a lot of sense. Some of the most tense moments for me were missing a jump and falling back down to where the creatures were roaming. When you do get the air control it can't be used with the antenna lights. I think this is a great mechanic for a horror/platforming game because it leads to some unsettling moments where you have to choose between being able to see and being able to control your jumps well. \n\nMost of the levels require you to collect cars, batteries, key pieces, or a mixture of all them to progress/complete the level. This works well with the horror aspect as it requires you to go around the level instead of making a beeline past enemies to get to the exit. These items aren't usually too hard to find as they all, except for the key pieces, emit some light and make noise when you're close. Even the key pieces aren't too much trouble to find because they are usually next to a car or in an area that isn't very big to search. This collecting can get a bit tedious on the larger levels because the light and sound the items emit don't go that far. The replay value is pretty high because of the secret collectibles hidden in most, possibly all, the levels and because there is an alternate ending for beating the game on the hardest difficulty. \n\nOverall, this game felt like a cult classic from the ps1 era and it seems like games like this just don't get made anymore. If you're a fan of platforming games and horror games then Shrimp is a must have.\n\n[h1] Misc/Helpful Tips [/h1]\n\nOther reviews for this game mention the physics being weird and they're likely referring to the lack of air control. This leads to some frustrating platforming early on, but air control is an upgrade on level [spoiler] 12 [/spoiler] and after you get it it's available for all levels. This makes replaying levels much more enjoyable. This game is a bit of a trial by fire where if you can get past the first 4 levels then you shouldn't have too big of a problem with the rest of the game. Also, other reviews mention the shrimp going fast to the point where it's hard to control. I think this is either lag, the camera being too sensitive, or a mixture of the two. I had the graphics on the middle setting and it seemed fine, but later I put it to the lowest setting and it felt much smoother so play around with those if you're not sure. The camera was because every time you start or restart a level the mouse sensitivity goes to the max setting. It's a bit inconvenient, but just go into settings and and click the default mouse sensitivity and then the camera movement should be good. One last tip, you can jump on your stereo. It's not necessary to beat any of the levels, but it's surprisingly useful.","timestamp_created":1609309828,"timestamp_updated":1609309828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuuaV2fYCfNDYvgI="}
