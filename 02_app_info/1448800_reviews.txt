You will need a left and right mouse button and a spacebar, if you got this then you are good to go.\n\nObviously you have to shoot zombies and not feed them. There are four color zombies indicating the amount of bullets they require for them to die, you will have to empty your gun before reloading, you will have to think about how to spend your bullets and when to reload, the only problem is you won't have time to think...\n\nGame looks great, crt filter is quite good, music is pretty bad ass.\n\nI miss lightgun games, i would love to play this with a light gun.\n\nIf you are looking for games with enduring replayability, its simple games like this that you can pick up and drop whenever you want to. If you are bored then play this game, if you are bored playing this game then play something else and return later when you feel sharp and focused.\n\nNice job Jim, can't wait to see what you will make next.","timestamp_created":1606939004,"timestamp_updated":1606939004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527025341987609863","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxunBkvYCc/fqtgI="}
