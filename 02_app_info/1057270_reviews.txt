What's missing here compared to the mission packs in 4.1 are the radio messages/story. Which is a pity, because in singleplayer I play the mission packs less, because they become very boring.\nThere is a minor new feature for the Colonists (they just look like humans). They have armor and different weapons depending on the type.\n\nOn the whole, you just get more EDF here and I like that a lot.
