      /><br>Atomine is a twin stick procedural shooter rogue-lite set in a virtual
      world with minimalist design, where the player recounts on the screen the real
      events of STUXNET, the first weapon ever created in the form of computer virus.
      <br><br>In every run the player has to clear the level area from all the enemies
      in order to unlock the portal to the next level. During the run every killed
      enemy will leave on the ground XPs, energy and/or weapon modules.<br><br><img

      /><br><br><strong>Fast and Fun</strong><br>Atomine is fast. There are a lot
      of enemies and you have to kill all of them to complete the levels. But don''t
      worry, you have infinite ammo and a (great) modular weapon system.<br><br><strong>Weapon
      System</strong><br>In Atomine the player can modify his weapon using special
      modules that can be find in the game. The modules have effect to specific parts
      of the weapons: type of bullet, number of bullets, rate of fire and other mutators.<br><br><strong>Procedural
      Generated / Roguelite</strong><br>The world of Atomine is composed by levels
      procedurally-generated. Every level has different type of enemy and environment.
      <br>The player has to complete all levels with only one life. If Atomine is
      destroyed, the game is over.<br><br><strong>Counter Hacking</strong><br>During
      a run, the system can detect the intrusion and modify the game, so player must
      act quickly! <br>If the player fails to hijack the counter hacking maneuver,
      the challenge will become really tough. <br><br><strong>Boss Battle</strong><br>There
      are not only &quot;small&quot; enemies. Atomine must also defeat big and powerful
      bosses. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/603100/extras/title_Story.png?t=1571996266"
      /><br>In 2011, Sergey Ulasen, discovered STUXNET, a malicious computer worm,
      initially spreaded via Microsoft Windows, and targeted Siemens industrial control
      systems, defined as a sleeping threat, waiting for a trigger to start its activation.
      STUXNET is the first discovered malware that spies on and subverts industrial
      systems, and the first to include a programmable logic controller (PLC) rootkit.
      The worm has been founded infecting especially nuclear power plants and oil
      drilling systems.<br><br>Atomine, like STUXNET, is a virus who needs to get
      stronger in order to reach and eventually infect and compile itself into the
      target source code. The electronic voice in the background and many element
      on screen, tell to the player what''s the target of the run.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/603100/extras/title_Feature.png?t=1571996266"
