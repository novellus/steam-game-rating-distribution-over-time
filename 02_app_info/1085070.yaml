      \ magic in a quest to start a cult and resurrect an ancient evil. The realm\
      \ of Acre is beset by a foe so powerful that no hero living can hope to save\
      \ the day. But don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ve got a plan!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\

      \ powerful array of magic. You\u2019ll leave physics behind as you learn to\
      \ phase through walls, shrug off gravity, transmute your surroundings, and weaponize\
      \ the common pumpkin. <br>Just never forget: your powers stem from the whims\

      \  Watch your homestead evolve as you meet and recruit a gallery of questionable\
