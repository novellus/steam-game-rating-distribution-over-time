Think like a CSI game but instead of 5 individual cases or so it's just one big case. Problem with this is that it was too thinned out near the end so you figure out who did it. There's still one nice plot twist though. I found the story compelling and I love these types of games. I just wish there was some voice acting.\n\nI liked that the locations are fewer and more important/complex, so you don't feel you have to go through 30 different areas to get to something or use the map constantly like the Artifax Mundi games.  The adventure flows seamlessly and everything makes sense. I welcomed the easier HO scenes after another game where they were the total opposite.  Something that I've never seen before is that you can view the silhouette of what the items look like specifically for those that can be confused for another object. Puzzles were fun and doable. Liked the extra gameplay elements like doing the lab work and the way you interrogate the suspects. Nice way to spend an evening.","timestamp_created":1607676578,"timestamp_updated":1607676578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjbm/qPYCduWCuQI="}
