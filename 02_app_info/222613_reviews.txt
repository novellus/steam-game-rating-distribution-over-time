Once it went from a 95 to a 90 around the Oxenholme area, and then recently from 110 randomly down to a 105 briefly a couple miles south of Penrith. Both of these happened to me on Quick Drives on the up line, never once have I had this issue on the down line towards Carlisle. If not for that little gripe of mine, this would be a 5/5, but I give this a 4/5. Still a good route to drive Pendos down and up between Preston and Carlisle.","timestamp_created":1607551352,"timestamp_updated":1607551352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzN/hpPYCebq9uAI="}
