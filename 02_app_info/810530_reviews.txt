If you've never listened to this soundtrack from the game, the music WILL grow on you I promise![/h1]\n\nWhen I first started playing The Void Rains Upon Her Heart, I didn't really know what to think about the game's music. It didn't help that you are limited to a few songs until you start unlocking more so I wasn't able to gauge accurately right away. However, the more I played the game, the more songs I unlocked and the more I realized that while the music is a little funky and at times whimsical--it was something I really enjoyed and wanted more of.\n\nThe more I played, the more I fell in LOVE with the game and it's amazing music--so much so that I began to feel guilty! LOL I went ahead and bought the soundtrack as a token of gratitude towards the awesome dev (got it on sale for less than a buck) and I also left one of the best reviews I possibly could for the game https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZeroAffex/recommended/790060/. \n\n[i]Which by the way if somehow you've stumbled upon the soundtrack for the game BEFORE seeing the actual game storefront--It's GOOD, I mean.. REALLY GOOD. Go check out the store page and read the testimonials to see what others are saying. Better yet, buy it and be your own judge![/i] :D \n\nUltimately--If you like weird, sci-fi, lo-fi, whimsical, retro 8 bit music then look no further! You have a good variety here to enjoy and it only cost $4 (it's on sale for $.79 cents right now!). It's a screaming deal for a soundtrack to add to your collection, you can't go wrong! \n\n[h1]Easy recommendation right here. This music is awesome and the price is great. Support this dev! Love some monsters! Love yourself! Your wallet will love you--after you buy this! Your wallet will REALLY love you after you buy this and the game! So much LOVE to be had![/h1]","timestamp_created":1593737189,"timestamp_updated":1593737189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503328502178192139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46PKIifMCdYCrkgI="}
