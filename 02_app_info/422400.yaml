      \ However, being a mercenary with no loyalties that extra money couldn't bend,\
      \ Locke sees this as an opportunity. An opportunity to get rich, and cause a\
      \ little chaos. He has reached out to Bain and the Payday gang. The deal? Work\
      \ with him, or he brings <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://Crime.net\"\

      \ to act as a command center for the mercenary army. Locke knows there is loot\
      \ stored in the deep vaults of this mountain fastness. He will guide you through\
      \ it, supplying intel and assets. Can Black Ridge survive a direct attack by\
      \ the Payday gang?<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/422400/extras/steam_assets_birth_of_sky.jpg?t=1516116323\"\

      \ great. Robbing banks, warehouses and casinos is really fucking great. But\
      \ how about robbing a plane? A military cargo plane, 20,000ft above the ground?\
      \ Murkywater is a private army with a private air force, and part of that air\
      \ force is tasked with transporting huge pallets of ill-gotten cash around the\
      \ world. One such plane is scheduled to fly over the Eastern Seaboard soon.\
      \ Locke has arranged for you to be on board. Getting the money will be one thing\
