    reviews: "\u201C..Marvin's Mittens, which looks like a game and quacks like a\
      \ game but by rejecting dogmas about goals and score is instead an experiential\
      \ art piece which beautifully captures nostalgic childhood memories of playing\
      \ in the snow.\u201D<br />\r\nRandy Smith, Edge<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CIt\
      \ is pure magic and I can't get enough.\u201D<br />\r\nhookedgamers.com<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\n\u201C...It's intensely nostalgic, especially for people (like me)\
      \ who spent days and nights like this during their own childhood. It looks absolutely\
      \ fantastic...\u201D<br />\r\ngamezebo.com<br />\r\n"

    review: An absolutely delightful game to play for December. There's no fail state
      and so its a really chilled and enjoyable game. My wife insists we play it every
      Christmas. Pretty short, but worth it in my view.
