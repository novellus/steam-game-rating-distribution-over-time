    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Can't What Now?</h2>Can't Drive This is a competitive
      co-op (it's a thing) multiplayer party racing game. Drive your monster truck
      WHILE your friend builds the road in front of you! Oh, and don't go too slow,
      OR YOU'LL EXPLODE! Like in that Sandra Bullock movie, in which she kinda does
      the same thing, but on a bus. Also, she doesn't explode (Spoiler alert). Also,
      Keanu Reeves was in the movie.<h2 class="bb_tag">Co-Op Multiplayer Goodness</h2><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Play local face-to-face couch co-op, with your best frenemy!
      Grab some friends and some controllers, and go destroy those friendships! (We
      probably should, but do not take responsibility for any damage to your interpersonal
      relationships.)<br></li><li>If you don't have any friends around, play single-player,
      or find some random internet-person to play with! Experience the joy of playing
      Can't Drive This without that annoying smelly friend next to you. You know the
      one I'm talking about.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Customization!</h2>Where's
      the fun in online multiplayer if there's no customization, you ask? A very intelligent
      question, you beautiful person! Can't Drive This features a gazillion* unlockable
      parts and a vehicle editor so you can show off your awesomeness to everybody!
      But as we all know, only one player gets to drive a car at a time. The other
      player builds the road. That's why we also included a road editor! Create your
      custom track and have your friends race on a gold-plated yellow brick road,
      if that's your jam!<h2 class="bb_tag">Feature List</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>
