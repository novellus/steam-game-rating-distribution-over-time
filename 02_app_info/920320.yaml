    review: 'This game caught me with its bright colour palette, intriguing ambiance,
      and sense of humour. My favourite aspect is most likely the little customizations;
      I loved the animals (pigs, alpacas) with the different colour swatches, as well
      as the costumes. The fighting gameplay was often surprisingly difficult, which
      I enjoyed, as I played the game on the regular setting, and the soundtrack was
      interesting enough for me to go find online and listen to again.


      MINOR/MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD; RAYOR (read @ your own risk, yo)


      The idea behind the endings is very interesting; however, I wish there was a
      bit more detail into how and why these endings occur, as well as a way to change
      the trajectory of the game without starting anew. While the game is fun and
      interesting, it is not interesting enough to warrant a second gameplay for me,
      so I googled the alternatives (I know! Flay me alive); it''s a really cool storyline,
      though I do wish I could complete it a second time without the repetition. Maybe
      more interactions with the other zodiacs would help alleviate this, providing
      a fresh run-through, as only some of them got screen-time, and the fire signs
      were a little ignored (fire sign rep here lol)... Regardless, an excellent thought-provoking
      game.'
