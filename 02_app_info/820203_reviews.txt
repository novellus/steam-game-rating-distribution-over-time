Not the recreation of it - that is excellent.\n\nThe issue I have is with performance.  Most routes on this, I'll get somewhere between 50-70fps.  Occasional microstutters down to the mid 30's, but I can cope with that.\n\nThis route, especially on the London end, I'm lucky if I get 30fps as a baseline, and then fairly regular drops to 4fps - literally unplayable.\n\nMy PC is no slouch - Ryzen 5 3600, 1660 Super, 16GB RAM.  I've tried lowering all kinds of settings, I've removed the custom shaders I usually use, but nothing I do ends up in consistent or acceptable performance.\n\nI'd refund the route if I was able, but I've spent more than 2 hours fiddling trying to get anything like acceptable performance with it.\n\nA real missed opportunity.","timestamp_created":1607596768,"timestamp_updated":1607596768,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsP+OpvYCd9bUuAI="}
