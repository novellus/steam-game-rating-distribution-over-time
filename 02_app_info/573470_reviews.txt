That is not where my grievances lie with this module.\n\nThe theme is first of hideous and does not suit the narrative for the Call of Cthulhu. This weird beige colour (which can be changed) just ruins the mood and the icons of which you find your NPC'S, vehicles, character sheets, maps and so on are low-grade at best. \n\nI have used fantasy grounds for well over two years now and I have had a great experience with this fantastic program. I have used the D&D module, the pathfinder module, the starfinder module and the call of Cthulhu module.\n\nThe Call of Cthulhu module is bleak in comparison to the others when it comes to the quality of what you are paying for.\n\nThere is no easy way for you to share images of NPC's (monsters) should they appear. The vehicles section is empty even though the rule book mentions that vehicles do exist, the chases tabs are nonsensical, several items are missing when it comes to character creation. \nThese parts can be downloaded separately created by users on the fantasy grounds forums as \"modules.\"\n\nWhat you are getting is a drag & drop feature of some items, character sheets, a list of occupations and that is it. It feels like you get the rulebook as a PDF but it is in the fantasy grounds program which makes it hard to read at times. You would be better off with purchasing this module as a PDF on Chaosium's website and running your game on Roll 20 since the character sheets there are free. It is cheaper, way way way way cheaper and less hassle.\n\nDo not buy this.","timestamp_created":1588412311,"timestamp_updated":1588412311,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":28,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.756439507007598877","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43Yyw6vECdOr/hAI="}
