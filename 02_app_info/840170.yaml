      Yesterday you drove a chair to Tomato Street, and today - a mirror on Lenin\
      \ Avenue.<br />\r\nAnd again the car broke down - which means that all the daily\
      \ earnings will go to repair.<br />\r\nThe only thing that will brighten up\
      \ these working days is music. Every week a single track is added to the radio\
      \ in the rotation. What will be a hit in February? And in October?<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA realistic courier simulator - every day is similar to\
      \ the previous one. Routine. Only addresses and cargo for delivery differ. Everything,\
      \ as in life.<br />\r\nMinimalistic text interface. Get a check-list with assignments\
      \ for each day and execute them for income.<br />\r\nA random list of cases\
      \ for each game day - a lot of combinations of subject-address, there will be\
      \ almost no repetitions.<br />\r\nMusic written by a neural network is a unique\
      \ soundtrack for every game week. But you can choose manually in the settings\
      \ you like the melody, and it will not interrupt during the game."

    review: Worst game ive ever played. It has nothing going for it. No upgrades.
      Multple trucks to speed up the day. No gas prices so you may wait a extra day
      to get gas to save. The game is so boring.
