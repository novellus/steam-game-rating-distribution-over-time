Technically a 'mystery', though it's really unusual in how it plays out (you are mainly shooting down the fallacious reasoning of those around you). Not your usual VN by any means, weird as heck, very unique art and musical style, tons of charm. I really love it.","timestamp_created":1577412777,"timestamp_updated":1577412777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.582261502742767334","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wprIou8CcJap5wE="}
