The game does have it's quirks (no.1 being awful crash detection, placing you back to the start instead of continuing where you left) but once you get used to them and practice a bit (it will be hard not to crash into the gates at first, so it can be frustrating) and once you get better at it - the game really starts to be addictive. Of all sports I most liked Skiing. Would be nice to have more tolerance towards gate passage (they are flexible ffs, don't need to crash every time, maybe just set a penalty instead) as well as more tracks. That all being said, this game is bang for the buck for sure!","timestamp_created":1603009371,"timestamp_updated":1603009371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t7uznfUCeY7LqAI="}
