The more you progress the harder it gets. Theres so many mechanics well thought through and so many puzzles I didnt think of at first. And its really fun to progress. I thought it was gonna repeat the same patterns, but its very diverse throughout the game!!\n\nIt sucks that there is no exit option other than alt+f4 and no pause menu, but its in alpha after all, so cant complain.\n\nDefinitly recommend this game, its really fun to play  !!!!\n\nPros:\n- simplicity\n- always new patterns and very diverse\n- music/tune\n- many levels\n- fun to play\n\nCons:\n- no pause menu\n- no exit option other than alt+f4","timestamp_created":1524992115,"timestamp_updated":1524992115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533582091331481934","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4k6CniOMCfJminwE="}
