In the beginning, it's very nice. It has a compelling story and characters. The fighting could use some work, I was on Easy Mode, and was still struggling a lot. I felt that on Easy, it was really on Normal because it was too intense to be on Easy.\n\nAnyway, back on the story of the game - the most important part, really - it started off well and went downhill fast by a certain point. I'm of course talking about [spoiler] the time-skip [/spoiler] which I thought was highly unnecessary. A lot of the character development is gone by doing that type of thing. It felt lazy from a writer's point of view. It does not do the story justice at all. In my eyes, this game had a lot of potential, but unfortunately it could not deliver.","timestamp_created":1595260092,"timestamp_updated":1595260092,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5qe6tvMCc92/lgI="}
