    review: "[h1]Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren\u2019t So Frightening[/h1]\n\
      \nThis is the second installment in the [i]Pajama Sam[/i] series, and my favourite\
      \ of the group. In this adventure, Sam is frightened of the storm raging outside,\
      \ and decides to put a stop to the thunder. He goes up to his attic, which takes\
      \ him to Worldwide Weather, where the weather is controlled. Upon his arrival,\
      \ and a misstep, he accidentally causes part of the system to break and machine\
      \ components to go missing. As a result, the weather across the globe is chaotic\
      \ and it is up to Sam to locate, retrieve, and return the missing units to their\
      \ respective weather services.\n\nOne of the most fun aspects of the [i]Pajama\
      \ Sam[/i] franchise is that where a missing piece is located is not necessarily\
      \ the same each time you play the game; each of the lost components may be found\
      \ and retrieved in [b]different ways with each playthrough[/b]. Not knowing\
      \ how each run of the game is setup makes the game more fun to replay. How Sam\
      \ interacts with other characters (who are not missing) changes as well; for\
      \ instance, what he has to bring to Langston the Snowman might not be the same\
      \ with each iteration of the game.\n\nWe also see the return of a character\
      \ from the first installment, [i]No Need to Hide When it\u2019s Dark Outside,[/i]\
      \ as well as portraits of characters from that same game. There are a lot of\
      \ extras in these games: in [i]Thunder and Lightning Aren\u2019t So Frightening[/i],\
      \ the player can click on a bunch of items in any given scene and things will\
      \ happen (the item might change shape or colour, or something new will appear\
      \ on screen temporarily). There is no end to the additional content included\
      \ throughout the game. There are some bonus activities as well, including making\
      \ snowflakes and seeking out copies of Sam\u2019s favourite comic, \u201CPajama\
      \ Man!\u201D In addition, Sam\u2019s \u201Ccollection task,\u201D as I refer\
      \ to it, is to find all of his missing puzzle pieces and put the puzzle together\
      \ (this puzzle changes each time the game is played, as well).\n\nOne of the\
      \ reasons I enjoy [i]Thunder and Lightning Aren\u2019t so Frightening[/i] more\
      \ than the other installments is, I think, because it\u2019s a daytime adventure\
      \ (the other games take place at night or twilight). The brightness and cheeriness\
      \ of this game makes it more fun, in my opinion, than the others.\n\nMy rating\
      \ of [i]Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren\u2019t so Frightening[/i] is\
      \ 5/5. As with the other games in this series, there are a lot of extras included,\
      \ making it more fun than it would be without it\u2014the developers gave more\
      \ than the base requirements to tell the story. Though it doesn\u2019t teach\
      \ the real way weather is formed, it\u2019s a neat introduction to different\
      \ weather systems that kids will enjoy. The characters are entertaining, and\
      \ the game has great replay value. If any [i]Pajama Sam[/i] game were to be\
      \ recommended to play, I would suggest this one. It\u2019s fantastic. It\u2019\
      s a perfect children\u2019s game."
