Not a bad game however and the effort put into it clearly show some passion for mech games. I feel the game needs more mechs, more pilots, option the pilots use the assigned mech and so on but I can reccomend this game to everyone who likes the mech universe and also likes tactical games.\n\n","timestamp_created":1609496893,"timestamp_updated":1609496893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45LLf3vYCfIWuvwI="}
