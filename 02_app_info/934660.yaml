    review: "ONLY ever buy this tier 2 \ntin can when it's on sale for $0.99, \nbecause\
      \ it sure as H*** isn't worth anything more than that. \nIt's better than the\
      \ 3-torpedo Smith destroyer, bu not by much: it's only better because its torpedo\
      \ tubes are positioned more effectively than the Smith, \nand the Tachibana\
      \ has 2 twin tubes that can all 4 go out one side,\n instead of 3 singles like\
      \ on the Smith that can only ever position 2 torpedoes from one side at bad\
      \ angles.\n\n\nLike the Smith destroyer, the Tachibana is almost a suicide-run\
      \ boat: you'll be lucky to survive in close enough to get 2 torpedo salvoes\
      \ off before you're either just dead, or too useless to even bother being in\
      \ the fight.\n\nAgain, only if it's on sale for $0.99, but if you spend more,\
      \ it's your loss."
