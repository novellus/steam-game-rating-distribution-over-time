    review: "Very good for this price\nEven though the cab doesn't work its still\
      \ fun to pretend your driving from there as the view is still correct \na bit\
      \ like the front seat on the docklands light railway\nTip: the end with only\
      \ one person at the front is the end where the interior camera is"
