Turret won't reach enemies? Turn yourself into that one then FLY AND SHOOT!! And [i]this[/i] is why it's the best turret defense I've ever played, it's so satisfying all around. \n\n[b]I highly recommend to play Story Mode first, because you [i]will[/i] need the tutorial, otherwise no way you'll get it.[/b]\n\nIt feels a bit discontinued and it feels super pre-alpha, but I hope this game to succeed. :)","timestamp_created":1600724660,"timestamp_updated":1600724846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw29io2fQCc4WhowI="}
