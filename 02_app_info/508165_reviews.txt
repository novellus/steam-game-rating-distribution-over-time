[/h1]\n[b]It is kinda the natural consequence or the aftermath of hikarus route and serves as both a tie up and together of all the other routes before AND a teaser for the sequel.[/b]\n\n [h1]Game overall: [/h1]\n- My only critique is the music, wich becomes boring after some loops. \n- CS were good but i would have hoped for more (or i'm used to get more of them in other VN/Otome).\n\n+ Other that that the game is unusually polished\n+ i personally enjoyed a more western/realistic artstyle for once \n+ and the writing was good (both in grammar AND storytelling)\n+ the maincharacter is normal, in a GOOD way. She reacts grumpy when someone is rude, shes flustered if its the situation but shes not overly anything. The writing conveyed a fully fleshed charcter wich you shape with your reaktions one by one. I really enjoyed seeing this instead of one blunt character!\n\n [h1]This particular Route/DLC: [/h1]\nthis time i start off with the rather negative stuff... (dont be scared!)\n-? i dont care for digital artbooks so this i wouldnt recommend for it\n- the POVs were really short. you get one important scene (usually climax) and have a textblock of what the guy is thinking in that moment. Most of them are pretty forgetable (like, you should know what goes on in their head if you played the route). I kinda liked tatsuyas tho i guess. On its own its not worth 5 bucks tho.\n-? as i mentioned i also likda liked the soundtrack (specially in hikarus book they tried really hard! thx guys! but the looping made me sick of it after a while. (i took a long gaming break wich kinda fixed it tho. It IS enjoyable in the game again for me and memorable, but i dont think i would listen to it otherwise so idc about the digital soundtrack either xD)\n+/- While i'm not sure if this is worth 5 bucks for everyone (and i'm actually not sure if i bought it of got it in an update since i bought this game a logn while ago) i do think its an amazing (2nd) climax to the story with ties up everything and gets you REALLY fired up for the seuel wich is heavily teased in the chaos route ( not in a bad way tho).\n+ amazing wallbreak and (like in hikarus books) selfaware-writing in a hilarious, greatly pulled of way\n\n [h1]Verdict: [/h1]\nLike usually i dont like teases like this, specially if you practically pay for it wich at least some people have to --- but this was amazing honestly. Even IF i would have bought it, i wouldnt reget... Ö.Ö\nSo all in all, i think eventho i dont care for most of the features you get here (or like i see them merely as bonus?) all together i would say its not a bad price if you liked the game. Again, as shown here and in my other reviwes i do had my issues with the game at times but all in all it was a really amazing VN wich i wont forget and would happily play and buy again (or its sequel)!","timestamp_created":1548252695,"timestamp_updated":1549484869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42Nif4ugCcKKEuQE="}
