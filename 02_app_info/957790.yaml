      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Large-scale tactical warfare in Virtual Reality</h2>With
      War Dust, we want to push the boundaries of Virtual Reality and create epic
      battles on a scale that has never been reached before.<br>A total immersion
      experience that throws you into a breathtaking action film, full of explosions
      and dynamic tactics. The opportunity to live an incredible situation where armies
      clash.<br>Our goal is to create a feeling of being a part of a real epic war,
      not just a small combat.  <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/957790/extras/SteamPicture.jpg?t=1595933041"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">64 PLAYERS</h2>We have always wanted to create large-scale
      battles rather than small skirmishes which is why War Dust gives you the opportunity
      to join a company of 32 soldiers. With 64 fighters on the battlefield, War Dust
      will take you into the largest online battles that have ever been made in VR.
      <br>Everyone has a role to play on the battlefield: one single man, at the right
      place at the right time, can make a decisive difference. Get ready to be this
      difference, to dare, to fight, and defeat your enemies.<br>Solidarity, rivalry,
      cooperation, confrontation: enjoy virtual reality from a new perspective. We
      look forward to share that experience with our players!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/957790/extras/vehicle_png.png?t=1595933041"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">VEHICLES</h2><br>We wanted to create a game that makes
      your heart pound faster and gives you the opportunity to use everything you
      can for your team to win: aircrafts, rocket launchers, grenades: the possibilities
      are endless and no two battles are alike. Each vehicle available brings a new
      gameplay and has a major impact on the battle. <br><br>In War Dust you can experience
      the conflict from various points of views. The game is not restricted to ground
      combat but also it includes aerial fighting; as a plane or helicopter pilot,
      you will be responsible for supporting your allies on the ground. We are particularly
      proud of the aerial combats that give incredible sensations when you fly across
      the battlefield. <br><br>Enjoy the thrill of a tense dogfight or help your teammates
      from far above. Get ready to storm the enemy lines, to cut through their defenses
      under the cover of a tank, to cross the battlefield at full speed on a quad
      to join your allies, to push the offensive with a helicopter or show dexterity
      dodge a missile in a plane...<br><br>Surgical strike or massive attack, you
      will have to choose your strategy and organize quickly.<h2 class="bb_tag">Huge
      battlefields</h2><br>Our goal at Raptor Lab is add a new dimension to virtual
      reality. We wanted to bring combat to a scale that has never been seen before.<br>To
      do this we had to create large and rich battlegrounds to give 64 players access
      to a multitude of different gameplays and possible strategies.<h2 class="bb_tag">Cooperation
      &amp; synergy</h2><br>There are four classes, each with their own features and
      a specific role to play on the battlefield. The battle can only be won as a
      team.<br><br>You will have to strategically communicate and interact with your
      teammates in order to crush your opponents.'

    review: "OH MY....\nWhere do i begin...\nI was VERY sceptical, when i watched\
      \ gameplay vid's from \"war dust\". \nIt sure needs a BRUTAL face lift, because\
      \ it looks like a victim of Mike Tyson, after a round in the ring.\nDON'T let\
      \ the graphics scare you away though. I almost did that mistake myself.\nThe\
      \ gameplay is FU%#ING AMAZING and this is the only game i play atm. Nothing\
      \ else will quite do it like \"war dust\". \nIf you like \"battlefield\", this\
      \ is it. Closest thing to BF in VR (so far).\n\nYou can choose to stand or even\
      \ sit in a good chair, so you can play comfortably for hours.\nWhen i'm sitting,\
      \ i do have some trouble reaching a new magazine, my nade and so on... \nI would\
      \ prefer to have all my inventory higher up on my chest/torso (while i'm sitting\
      \ in a chair), and not on my hip.\nI'm hitting my chair very often, and can't\
      \ reach a new magazine (in very hectic and fun firefights).\n\nWe should be\
      \ able to carry less stuff (drop gun, nade and knife) and then have the ability\
      \ to run a (tad) faster. \n\nThe game REALLY needs A LOT more maps.\nIt has\
      \ three GREAT maps atm :\nDesert Parables, K\xFCssnacht and Middle East. \n\n\
      The weapon unlocks are SOLID and MAD FUN. I'm really feeling the greatness of\
      \ each unlock and always looking forward to my next upgrade.\n\nFix the parachute\
      \ glitch ASAP or make it at least optional, as a server setting.\n(Paragliding\
      \ mode : ON/OFF) \nThe same goes for the nade glitch. It can be thrown through\
      \ walls, floors etc...\nEverytime i try to show this to my friends, they see\
      \ that parachute glitch and goes \"meh, not my kind of a game\". \nIt's not\
      \ exactly the selling point. \nMost people are looking for a \"Battlefield\"\
      \ experience, only in VR. \nThe graphics alone, is enough to scare people away,\
      \ so when i finally make them try it for themselves, they just see that parachute\
      \ glitch and there's no way to convince them anymore.\n\nThe ATV should be \"\
      first person\" view and to grab the steering handlebar, you should press and\
      \ hold your \"grip\" buttons. For more speed, turn your right handlebar (right\
      \ touch controller) just like in real life. This is VR, so try to make it as\
      \ real as possible. With this design, you would be able to smooth turn (left\
      \ & right) PERFECTLY <3 \nA bit similar handling, as the two guns in the chopper.\n\
      \nWhat about headshots ? Right now it doesn't matter if you hit other players\
      \ in the toe, or in the head. It's the amount of bullets that counts for a kill.\
      \ HS should be added. More damage for headshots, at least. \n\nThank you SO\
      \ MUCH for this AMAZING game. I'm finally playing VR everyday now =) \nI found\
      \ my game.\nMAD LOVE <3<3<3"
