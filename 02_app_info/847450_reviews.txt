Still, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone - there's no story at all, and everything goes down much the same way to dozens of attacks from each of your characters. Just play the original Solenars Edge Rebirth, or better yet, avoid the entire thing.","timestamp_created":1585226772,"timestamp_updated":1585226772,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553944885730743408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4p24i/ECc9Wb+wE="}
