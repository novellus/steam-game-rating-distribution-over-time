    review: "I do, but I do not recommend this soundtrack.\nThe music of Breath of\
      \ Fire 3 is great, jazzy, funky, fun. I've always enjoyed it and the chance\
      \ to have it in the best quality possible AND support the the series? Cool!\n\
      \nWhy I don't recommend it, is it's literally missing a song. The boss theme.\
      \ One of the best songs in the game to me.\nOh sure, it HAS the song in the\
      \ soundtrack, but it's the \"SE version\" meaning, for some reason, they have\
      \ battle sounds, voices played over it. \n\nI contacted capcom and asked if\
      \ this was a mistake, or if they could help out. Their reply? They can't help\
      \ because \"It isn't a game\"\n\nIs it petty to not recommend an OST because\
      \ of 1 song missing? Maybe. But I love the heck out of the song and I'm not\
      \ happy it's missing. If you can deal with that one song being MiA, then go\
      \ for it! I hope they bring the game to steam too, along with the other BoF\
      \ titles. \nBut I'm applying for a refund. \n\nBreath of Fire 4's OST has every\
      \ song as far as I'm aware of, listened to all of them & all battle themes &\
      \ boss themes. They even have the opening song without Ryu & Nina talking over\
      \ it. So that gets a double thumbs up."
