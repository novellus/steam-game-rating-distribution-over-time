    review: '[b]DLC verdict: Get it on sale[/b]


      [b]Comment:[/b]

      A set of nice songs and a (fairly long) digital artbook is what you get with
      this DLC. The songs are nice but very situational, dependant on your mood, not
      that many ... and not really worth the full price. So unless you REALLY like
      the digital artbook it is good to get this DLC on sale...
