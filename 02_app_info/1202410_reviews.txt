This is to be expected as the player base is still ramping up.\n\nHere is a deal. I will give you the Midjungard Discord server ID and  we can agree on a time and place of your choosing. I will play as many games as you would like and I am sure your opinion of Midjungard will change.\n\nHere is the Discord server : https://discord.gg/8nVDk8b \n\nPing me and let's meet in the Ur-forest.\n\n-Fred"}],"cursor":"AoJ4suyvyfYCeqnUvAI="}
