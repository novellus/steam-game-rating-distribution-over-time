    review: '"1001 Jigsaw. World Tour: Australian Puzzles" has easy and hard jigsaw
      puzzles, and a range in-between.


      When I started, I had assumed that the jigsaw would take up the entire playing
      area (which is the case with other computer jigsaw games I''ve played), but
      that''s not the case here (I thought I was missing some pieces when I first
      saw that).


      You can store pieces in the upper left corner, which is handy.


      Unfortunately, you can''t take a proper screenshot of the finished puzzle, as
      the picture fades out as soon as you complete it. That was disappointing.


      "1001 Jigsaw. World Tour: Australian Puzzles" is a good little game to play
      if you like jigsaw puzzles.


      I bought this game on Australia Day.

      I played this game on Australia Day.

      It seemed the right thing to do.'
