    review: 'I only place a negative review on this due to the fact you only get one
      chance to use this effectively. So if you''re me and you delete your myplayer
      data cause you want to restart, you''ve effectively wasted your kick start with
      no way to reset without going technical.


      I''m about to do such to get my kick start back but that may cost me every custom
      character I''ve spent hours on. I''ll edit with the results, if it stays negative,
      I lost my custom wrestlers, if it goes positive, I was able to recover them
      all.'
