First of all, unlike many other games for VR, this one is really a full-length game. It took me about 15 hours to fully complete the game, including collecting all runes\\collectibles\\achievements. The game's visuals and art style are absolutely gorgeous, the locations are lush, interesting to explore and carefully crafted. The puzzles are also well-designed; they are challenging but solvable by your own effort. I should mention the incredible sound design and music - not only are they beautifully implemented in a certain unusual way, but also they are essential for creating a truly relaxing, cozy atmosphere of the game. But what I am excited about the most is the game's plot and how the game manages to communicate to you. Instead of telling just one story XING: The Land Beyond tells you many seemingly different ones in a beautiful and poetic way, only to unite them all at the end. This game is a very rare example of a game that has a soul! Sometimes it tells you a silly joke, immediately followed by wise words that touch your heart, yet both exist in perfect harmony with each other. I also should mention the emotions you feel playing the game - not many authors are brave enough to explore a theme of death in a game, while also doing so in such a beautiful and poetic way! Because of that XING: The Land Beyond can hardly be called a \"game\", it's actually a parable the size of a book made in a form of a puzzle game, that contains an entire philosophical journey inside of it. This game was an absolutely unique experience for me, and without modesty I can say that it definitely has its place both in my personal top of games for VR and my heart.\n\nIn times of information, pace and changes\nWe hide ourselves in artificial worlds\nSome help you find your way along the edge\nAgainst all odds\n","timestamp_created":1609271753,"timestamp_updated":1609271753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kseE2PYCeJHGvgI="}
