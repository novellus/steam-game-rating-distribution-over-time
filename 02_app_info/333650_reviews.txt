The door was opening and closing at a fast pace and there was no way to leave the house.\n\nAlso some of the puzzles are insanely hard especially the one with  the 12 pictures you should match to a story that opens the door to the cupboard with the pounch and sand inside it.\n\ncan't recommend this game due to the game breaking bug and that some of the puzzles are to hard.","timestamp_created":1590924798,"timestamp_updated":1590924798,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494699656963348389","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg72gtfICd66wiwI="}
