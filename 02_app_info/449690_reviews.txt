The invisible enemies that start spawning around level 50 are ridiculous. They come at you from all sides and you can't see them or their bars and they make the whole game quite absurd. The consumables do not cost real money, but you will have to spend a lot of time farming them in order to progress thru the levels...... It is a cheap game and the first 50 levels are worth 3 bucks.....but the post 50 levels are awful and not worth playing at all........If you love this sorta thing and you have already crushed OFDP 1 & 2 and Fatal Fury buy it on sale for the first 50 levels...\nI do feel like I got my 3 bucks worth out of the first 50 levels, but......I just can't recommend this one.","timestamp_created":1589386457,"timestamp_updated":1589386457,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+pW0h/ICffS+hwI="}
