If you don't care about any of these then save your money and sanity.\n\nI bought this game for the burrito badge and novelty comic relief. The game delivers on both of these and is easily completed so I have to recommend, I feel. If you want to 100% this, however, you may spend hours in the harder difficulties as your success is based largely on luck of consumables spawning and having the braindead ai actually manage to \"leave\" the room after being... um... \"feared.\" You will likely rage as even runs that appear successful are thwarted by poor coding and design.\n\nTotally worth 50 cents.\n\n","timestamp_created":1609402535,"timestamp_updated":1609402535,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xbn32/YCdoKFvwI="}
