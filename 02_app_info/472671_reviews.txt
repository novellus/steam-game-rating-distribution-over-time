Very easy to use. In my opinion a REFERENCE MANUAL format would help but you can find all you need. It has the Player's Manual and the GM Manual book. This setting is awesome if you like Bloodborne, Van Hellsing and Victorian theme.","timestamp_created":1550600624,"timestamp_updated":1550600624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+Pq/g+kCecypuwE="}
