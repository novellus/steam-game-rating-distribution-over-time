    review: "Just blitzed through this game in 2 days' time, it was so good. \n\n\
      Knight Bewitched is a pretty standard JRPG style game, with an interesting story\
      \ and different difficulty modes. I've only played in Normal Mode so far, so\
      \ I'm not sure how the difficulty scales. \n\nIn my 13 hours of playtime, I\
      \ think I managed to do just about everything in the storyline and sidequests.\
      \ I upgraded all the weapons (although the achievement appears to be bugged).\
      \ The combat didn't feel like too much of a grind, there was a nice balance\
      \ between progression, sidequests, and leveling. \n\nThe one thing that I did\
      \ find myself wanting was a way to sort my inventory. I'd often get a dropped\
      \ item and not always know if it was a weapon, armor, trinket, or accessory.\
      \ Weapons have their own item menu, but everything else got lumped together.\
      \ Additionally, it's not clear in the item navigation which character(s) can\
      \ equip specific items a lot of the time, which means having to go through each\
      \ character and trying to figure out if they're able to equip the new item (and\
      \ determining whether that item is armor, trinket, or accessory). \n\nThe main\
      \ storyline wasn't too long or convoluted. And the romance aspect is barely\
      \ there via a handful of exchanges; at least one of which doesn't occur in the\
      \ main story, and you could miss it entirely if you [spoiler]don't go to Ruth's\
      \ house with your party when Alduin reopens the gates for you[/spoiler]. The\
      \ fact that the romance isn't forced actually feels more natural, since the\
      \ focus remains primarily on the adventure story while the party's relationships\
      \ develop. \n\nDefinitely recommend this game for people who enjoy old-school\
      \ JRPGs."
