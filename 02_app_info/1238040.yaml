    review: 'Dragon Age 2 always has a special place in me.

      I''d definitely recommend it if you''re looking for a game with interesting
      companions too ^^;

      But I''m kind of biased since I binged the whole Dragon Ag series.

      I think all the Dragon Age games have a different feel to them to some extent,
      and they''re all special for different reasons.

      I''ll be honest though, it doesn''t have a lot of replay value, this one is
      kind of a one-shot (maybe 2) thing. It''s still enjoyable, but after you go
      through it a couple times a lot of the quests lose their magic which is pretty
      sad.

      Like I said though, it''s good for what it is and I''d say give it ago if you
      like RP games.'
