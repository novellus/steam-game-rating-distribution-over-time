When I saw this game at sale, it caught my eye and seemed to have the elements I was looking for: nice graphics, exploration, a mysterious island, interesting gameplay (cause&effect). \n\nThe game delivered on what I was expecting on the graphics part and exploration. Also, the island sure is mysterious and a deserted place only populated by those knights robots. For me, the game began on a high note with the briefing at the mansion and the scene at the port. Only enough information to get to the next place. I was intrigued. \n\nI arrived at the island and it was very nice, but then some execution problems started to pop up. I was faced with a bug that prevented me from continuing the game or even start a new game. Every time I tried to get to the island, I was kicked out of it and the game ended. I managed to get around it, but it was a frustrating introduction.\n\nSome other problems happened and also other good surprises that I try to summarize below.\n\nPros:\n- Nice graphics\n- Nice atmosphere\n- Nice voice acting\n- Ok CGI\n- This game has some thing very nice and kind of rare that I always look for in games in: persistency, especially in Chapter I. If you drop an item, it will stay there. Forever. The ATVs have their position, fuel, flat tire persistent. If you leave an ATV in the back of beyond in the island, it will stay there. Your health, stamina is persistent. They only regenerate when you sleep/drink/eat. If you get a stun gun from a dispenser, it will never respawn. If you use it, then for this play through is gone. In this time that, for many games, even the health auto regenerates and every enemy you kill disappears within seconds, this is a welcome change.\n- Nice change of pace in the VR Desert (if you overcome the frustrating beginning).\n- Nice change of pace for chapters II and III. Almost different games.\n- Some vistas in chapter II and III are beautiful.\n- In chapter I, some times I saw one of those parked ships flying. Nice touch!\n- In chapter II, the room with all the old movies/cartoons. Wow! Another nice touch!\n\nCons:\n- You know the persistency I mentioned above? Well, this can be a problem when encountering bugs. On Chapter II, I was stuck in terrain. Could not by any means get out. So I exited the game and entered again. I respawned at the exactly same stuck spot...\n- The map in Chapter I cannot be scrolled.\n- No transitions. If you get caught, got shot, fall from somewhere, the screen blinks and you go back to the respawn point. There is no animation, no sound.\n- The beginning of the VR desert, if you stay put and allow the knights to come at you, is very frustrating since the respawn point is very near where the nights already are. You enter an unnerving cycle of dying/respawning.\n- Many bugs that I got stuck in terrain. Especially if you try to find every game item...\n- Could not use only the controller. To start a new game or continue, I could only do that via mouse.\n- Found some bugs trying to collect all chapter I assets. After getting 4 of them and knowing which vault the fifth was supposed to be, I kept getting the same assets I already had.\n\nOverall, I had an enjoyable experience, but ultimately I was expecting a bit more of it. Some bugs almost ruined the experience for me so I feel more polish would greatly help this game.","timestamp_created":1489539985,"timestamp_updated":1489612751,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.465409219264984131","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4idj16doCdoi1dA=="}
