The score that plays in the background is really quite beautiful and strolling the halls features an interesting mechanic to see the \"current\" view of the location.  \n\nThere's a sense of tragedy and loss to this place that I would have known nothing about if not for this title.  \n\nBut as a bonus the actual countryside is one of the prettiest things I've seen in VR yet.  Plus you can smash the cafe to hell and blast a functioning grand piano with a wine bottle gun.   And there's a helicopter you can pilot too.  I'm not sure how a developer successfully pitched that but it controls really well and leads to some nice vertigo inducing views.  \n\nThis isn't a game of which anyone will rack up a 10 hour playtime, but it doesn't need to be.","timestamp_created":1604121684,"timestamp_updated":1604121878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw36vHvvUCeZudqwI="}
