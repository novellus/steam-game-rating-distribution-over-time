      <br>The matrix is solved, if all blocks are filled with the same color, except
      white.<br><br>This is a very simple game mechanic, but can lead to very difficult

    review: "Are you looking for a Challenge?\nI mean a real, REAL Challenge?\nThen\
      \ you should have a look at MATRIX BRAIN TWISTER.\n\nBelieve me, here is the\
      \ Name Programm!\nYour Brain WILL twister.\nWell, i played so many Games all\
      \ over the Years, and i have had many challenging Puzzle Games, but THIS, this\
      \ is really REALLY amazing.\n\nSo what do we have here?\n\nAt first we have\
      \ a Cube.\nYes, a simple Cube.\n\nThis Cube looks like the Legendary RUBIK CUBE.\
      \ The One with the 6 Colours and the 54 Squares, remember?\nNo, no, you don`t\
      \ have to turn Rows to get one Colour on each side, no, you just have to \u2026\
      click!\nIt is simple. Click on one Square and it Changes. Simple, huh? Well,\
      \ no. Because the Squares next to the clicked one,are changing, too.  Oh and\
      \ did i meantion that it is a Cube?\nYou can easily turn around that Cube in\
      \ every Direction. So clicking a Square at the Border will also change the Square\
      \ on the next Side. Oh yes.\n\nYour primary Object is to get them all to a special\
      \ colour. Easy to learn, but hard to master. \nYou can do it 2 Ways. \nFirst:\
      \ Wild clicking in hope to get it solved.\nSecond: Logical Thinking.\nYeah,\
      \ the first one can lead to the wished Result, but can also be frustrating.\
      \ Better not.\nI prefer the Second but it also mean, that you have to take your\
      \ Time and think \u2026 in Rooms.  All can be done in a few Clicks, if you do\
      \ it the right way. \n\nOh and if one Cube is not enough, you can also try Hyper\
      \ Cube. 2 Cubes and clicking on one changes Squares on both. Happy braining,\
      \ dear Reader.\nIf two and even one Cube is too much, you can choose the 2D\
      \ Way. Just 9 Squares.\nA Cube is annoying for you? No Problem, you can also\
      \ have the form of a Window, a ball or a Star. A Sandclock? Or even a Skull?\
      \ Your Choice.\n2 Colours are to easy? You can go up to 6 Colours. And yes,\
      \ you can also change the size.\nIt is really amazing how many Levels you have\
      \ to solve.\nAnd if this is not challenge enough, there is also a Clickcounter.\
      \ Solve it in less Clicks and you get 3 Stars. If you need too much clicks you\
      \ will get two or just one Star. \nTo get all the Achievements you have to get\
      \ all 3 Stars.\nThank God there is no timer. That would give your Brain a Final\
      \ Fatality.\n\nOh, i forgot to mention. You can change the Background and choose\
      \ one of many animated Features for it. So amazing beautifull, that cannot be\
      \ described, that have to be seen.\nAnd not to forget the really wonderfull\
      \ Soundtrack.\n\nYes, dear Reader, we have a really rare Pearl in the Ocean\
      \ of Games here. \nThere is nothing i don\xB4t like. A technical simple but\
      \ really challenging Game in a beautifull Area with wopnderfull music. Easy\
      \ and well fit fully Mouse Control, you can also use keys, and that all for\
      \ a fair price for what you get. \nFor me it is a near Perfect Game and it is\
      \ in Early Access, so there is more to come.\nYou want a real Challenge? Then\
      \ this is for you.\n\nI also want to thank the Developer. I was heartly suprised\
      \ as he wrote me after he saw my comment under a review, that \ni\xB4am lightly\
      \ colour blind. \nYeah you can laugh, a Wyvern that sees no colour, hohoho.\
      \ \nFun aside, i have my Problems with some mixed colours. I\xB4am able to see\
      \ and knowing the Main Colours. Anyway the Developer saw my comment and for\
      \ the next update he put in Symbols and other options for People like me.\n\
      From reading my comment to implent the new Options only 3 Days were gone.\n\
      That is an really amazing gesture. I thank you so very, very much for beeing\
      \ so kind. \nI really like that Game and now i can enjoy it.\nA big, big Thanks.\n\
      \nAnd Thank you, dear Readers for Reading.\n"
