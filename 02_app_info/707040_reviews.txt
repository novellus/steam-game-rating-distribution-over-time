I'll pinch me to make much more releases and communicate what is going on.\n\nCurrently I'm at version 0.9.1, I'll upload a new version in the next couple of days and will try to summarize what is the roadmap for the next weeks.\n\nAlso, there is sometimes a \"silent\" beta-release when you switch to the beta-channel in the games properties.\n\nStay safe"}],"cursor":"AoJ4lMvD4fICfKLPjgI="}
