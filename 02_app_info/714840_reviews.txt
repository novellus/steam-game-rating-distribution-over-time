Hard to believe a small team of less than 10 people made this game.\n\nGraphics are pure eye candy and the music is great. There's 8 worlds with 2 levels each. Took me about 3 hrs to beat the game earning all the achievements. \n\nI look forward to more games from this dev.","timestamp_created":1572919425,"timestamp_updated":1572919425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499898195266723633","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/rbTnO4CdcHR1wE="}
