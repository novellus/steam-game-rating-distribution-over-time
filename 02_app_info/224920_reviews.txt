This is frustrating because there is almost no weapons to be found nearby to fight enemies without soul-reaver, and even if there was, how can I see them when the camera is zoomed so close. The most common thing to do is switch to Astral, regen health, switch to Material plane and pray that an enemy doesn't get a cheap shot off you.\n\nCombat is the very definition of clunky where some controls are subject to input delay, making combat encounters more troublesome than its worth. I would skip the combat entirely, but this is not the case where they repeatedly spawn cheap enemies inside rooms where you have to solve puzzles.\n\nMe: Stop spawning enemies man, I'm trying to solve this convoluted block puzzle...\n\nThere is no mini-map or navigation hints to highlight where to go next, leaving you scratching \n your head trying to make heads or tails of the in-game map from the start menu or look up a guide. I was forced to look at online guides on how to proceed to the next room or look up where to go next however guides can only do so much.\n\nYeah I get it, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, but it doesn't cover for badly aged game design, I would not recommend this game unless you are part of the nostalgia crowd.","timestamp_created":1609975108,"timestamp_updated":1610038912,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwITz7vYCfciRwQI="}
