    review: I really wanted to enjoy this game - and to an extent, I did. But reading
      the reviews and description I was expecting something stunning and surprising
      - not, in fact, a fairly straightforward space shooter that didn't do much to
      wow me in the 10 hours I played it. Perhaps I was doing something wrong, perhaps
      the good part was yet to come... but honestly after that amount of time waiting
      for something a bit more open ended I gave up.
