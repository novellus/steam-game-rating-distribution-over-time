    review: 'very good game untill the frog level, because it was 2 hard, and dark
      souls is not a problem for me :)

      at least its worth a couple of cents $$

      if anyone who reads this, and say the "frog" level part is easy, i will literally
      gift the game for you and see if u can  complete the frog part! :P'
