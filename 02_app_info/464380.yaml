    review: This was an interesting story that honestly had a lot of potential. That's
      the problem though... none of the potential was used. This story was over before
      I knew it, and I really didn't feel like my choices mattered very much. I was
      just finally getting into the story whenever it was over. I'm going to have
      to give this a 3/10.
