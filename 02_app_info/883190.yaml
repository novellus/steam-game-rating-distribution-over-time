      /><br><br>Help little Jorji to survive in his journey to the depths of Impossible
      Forest, in this super-hard, hand-crafted 2D platformer.<br><br>Impossible Forest
      was a very peaceful place, filled with cute inhabitants. But once upon a cruel
      wizard called <strong>Nemrok</strong> curses this place with wretched charms,
      placing seeds of evil into every living soul of Impossible Forest, even into
      &quot;the Guardians of the forest&quot; - the long-lived protectors of the forest.<br><br><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/883190/extras/camp1.PNG?t=1531308054"
      /><br><br>You are playing as forester boy, named &quot;<strong>Little Jorji</strong>&quot;
      - the one who has an immunity to the evil wizard's charms. The controls are
      very simple - <strong>jump, air-dash, shoot, climb</strong> - but levels will
      become hard very fast and your every fail will be a lesson. Fast respawns, puzzles
      and crafty enemies will make your journey even more fun. Your main aim will
      be to purge evil forces from the Impossible Forest, making it peaceful again,
      <i>while understanding why Nemrok has such an interest in this place ?</i>
