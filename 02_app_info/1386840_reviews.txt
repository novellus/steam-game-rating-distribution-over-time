The audio is missing in a lot of\nareas and the game lacks useful audio cues, such as indicators when damage is being dealt. \n\nThe game is much more linear and straightforward than most Resident Evil games as well. \n\nThe game shares many visual aspects with RE7 and is clearly a fan game. However, it misses many of the fundamentals of\nwhat makes Resident Evil games as good as they are.","timestamp_created":1608628637,"timestamp_updated":1608628637,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41KHvxPYCd4yRvAI="}
