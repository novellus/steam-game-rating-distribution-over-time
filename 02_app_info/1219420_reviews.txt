There's still some things that could be polished up a bit but we're having fun with it and that's all that matters.   This game really reminds me of the original Zelda dungeons back in the day,  and that's partly why I picked it up. The idea is pretty simple but it's loads of fun and the character designs are adorable.   This game will be hidden gem.","timestamp_created":1597020707,"timestamp_updated":1597020707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4i8P26vMCf7jAmgI="}
