I got to be a kitty and the early stages were fun.  However, as the game dragged on, the shortfalls grew too big to ignore.\n\nWhile the idea is interesting, the execution is terrible.  Playing out each part for each hero means that you have to go through many stages multiple times and there is a lot of forced waiting for your previous play-throughs to sync with you, especially after you die.  There is a fast-forward button, but it's not enough.  The game would be a lot more fun if you didn't die from every hit; some of the windows for you to move are extremely tight, especially in the later levels where the new heroes begin to feature progressively worse control.  These issues combined really wear down on patience, even without the game's buggy nature.\n\nNow, when I say \"buggy,\" I mean VERY buggy, Sonic '06 buggy.  For starters, it is way too easy to clip inside platforms and get stuck, especially in the later stages.  I didn't notice any long load times, but while I was playing through, the glitches got worse.  Previous playthroughs would break synch; some enemies I killed in previous runs didn't die half the time.  In addition, the game froze on me multiple times with most of the instances being when the game rewound my progress after I died.  My PC isn't top-of-the-line, but it's more than capable of running this type of game.  However, even my whole PC crashed because of this game.  I had to do a hard reset to get everything back up.  \n\nThe developer obviously skimped on playtesting and quality control.  Avoid this one.","timestamp_created":1521610662,"timestamp_updated":1521610741,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539347410202026367","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40KrEo+ICed2bnAE="}
