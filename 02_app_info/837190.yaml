    review: "Tanglewood is a top-notch gaming experience. \n\nIn this 16-bit platformer\
      \ (actually built, coded and assembled on original developer tools for the Sega\
      \ Megadrive) you take control of Nymn, a fox-like forest critter, and navigate\
      \ levels with puzzles, skill-based jump sequences and ruthless enemies in. \n\
      \nFirst and foremost there has to be some recognition of the game's construction\
      \ \u2013 whilst there are many games that aim for a 'retro' feel and only achieve\
      \ pastiche, Tanglewood is authentic and benefits hugely from this fact; this\
      \ is no mere nostalgia trip with nods to old games \u2013 Tanglewood is a strong\
      \ game in and of itself, not a game propping itself up against an older 'style'\
      \ (though fans of the 16 bit era of platformers will certainly feel a lovely\
      \ sense of familiarity when playing). \n\nThe game's design is excellent \u2013\
      \ the difficulty and learning curve are perfectly managed so that puzzles and\
      \ situations are challenging without ever feeling unfair, allowing the player\
      \ to garner what they need to know from playing the game rather than anything\
      \ ever being hinted to them, be it a tricksome puzzle or an intimidating enemy.\
      \ In terms of pure gameplay, Tanglewood is utterly accomplished; the gameplay\
      \ is always fun and maintains its challenge without ever stepping over the line\
      \ into any objectionable artificial difficulty padding. \n\nStellar artwork\
      \ and design run through this entire game \u2013 the character model for Nymn\
      \ is so adorable that one may find themselves reaching for the thesaurus to\
      \ find other ways to describe him (to save some time you can choose from: lovable,\
      \ charming, cute, sweet, enchanting, dear, darling, delightful, lovely, winsome,\
      \ precious and a personal favourite, bonny). The animations for his movements\
      \ add to this, making Nymn a delight to play as. On a technical level, too,\
      \ his movements are responsive and accurate, especially when navigating some\
      \ tricky elements of the game; there's no cheapness associated with any failures\
      \ to progress, it's all down to the player!\n\nSound design's always been an\
      \ important part of any game and Tanglewood succeeds in this department as well,\
      \ quite bravely taking a stripped back approach where, at times, there will\
      \ be no background music at all; only the sounds of the character's movements\
      \ and the ambient noise of the world around you \u2013 thus when the player\
      \ hits a point in the level where some of the soundtrack does kick in, it really\
      \ 'means' something and enhances the moment significantly. \n\nBy its very nature,\
      \ the expectation for this game may well be that it's going to be a warm blanket\
      \ of nostalgia for a bygone era but Tanglewood is a success unto itself \u2013\
      \ a game that knows what it wants to do and is delightfully precise in attaining\
      \ that \u2013 this is a game that would be fun in any era. Highly recommended\
      \ experience.\n\nAs an addendum, a worthy nomination for the Labour of Love\
      \ Steam Awards, 2020. Having talked to the developer and heard his passion for\
      \ Tanglewood, I had no question that this would be the game I put forwards for\
      \ that particular award."
