      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE WORLD OF Agents: Biohunters</h2>The world has been\
      \ infected by a bioparticle-like substance, causing the environment to evolve\
      \ and wildlife to mutate. The Agents have banded together to ensure planet Earth\u2019\
      s survival through this bio-crisis, but there are some who wish to use this\
      \ substance for their own sinister motives. Your mission as a Biohunter Agent\
      \ is to save the world by hunting down mutant creatures and defeating anyone\
      \ or anything standing in your path to victory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">HUNT WAVES\
      \ OF CREATURES</h2>In every match, you'll need to hunt waves of creatures to\
      \ gain experience, which will help you level up and upgrade your Agents' abilities.\
      \ When the creatures drop blue bioparticles, collect them and use them to spawn\
      \ buildings that will support you during the match.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">OUTPLAY\
      \ YOUR ADVERSARIES</h2>Coordinate strategies with your allies to defeat the\
      \ enemy team. Construct buildings to control the map; they will help you create\
      \ cover, weaken your enemies, and respawn at strategic places on the map.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">HUNT THE MIGHTY ROGNAR</h2>When you are ready, face the mighty\
      \ Rognar. To win the match, you and your team must destroy 3 of Rognar's weak\
      \ points. Each one is worth a point. The team that scores 3 points wins the\
      \ match.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EARN REWARDS AND CUSTOMIZE YOUR AGENTS</h2>Earn\
      \ Agent Credits and Biocoins by playing matches and completing contracts. You\
      \ can spend them on season passes, character skins, new motorbikes, motorbike\
      \ skins, holo-flags, emotes, gestures, victory animations, defeat animations\
      \ and much more!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/765800/extras/600x900.jpg?t=1592046229\"\
