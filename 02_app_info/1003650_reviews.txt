This game doesn't work correctly, I broke it within seconds of being in the first room. I couldn't progress more than five minutes into the game because everything just stopped working.\n\nThe only scary part of the game is the volume at which screams randomly happen as stuff appears on the screen. It honestly sounds like a lawnmower in your ears.\n\nLet's just not anymore aigh fam jam?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoFM5BDmZc0 \n\n\nIf you found this review helpful, check out the curator page.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/29029552","timestamp_created":1547791610,"timestamp_updated":1547791610,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529785335063934326","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwibbkr+gCdeXOuAE="}
