I also have enjoyed plenty of music related games. The idea of putting these into this setting, and in VR no less, intrigued me. Once it came out, I saw the price and couldn't pass it up. \n\nI will say, it is simple in its design, to which there is room for improvement. For example, the system for picking your song is hard to use, and using the scroll bar on the side doesn't always work for me. Also, I can't seem to get the special to work after getting the swords to glow, but that may be because I'm playing it on an Oculus instead of the vive. and finally, I can't quite figure out how it senses music. Some songs I think will be extremelyt hard (Through the Fire and Flames for instance), aren't, and vice versa. \n\nAll that aside, I still will give this a thumbs up, because when it comes to actual gameplay, it's a blast! Me and my son have been playing with it for a little bit now, and it's quite the workout as well. Although, like my kid, you can play this by just swinging your swords around wildly an do pretty good, the idea of being able to \"slice\" through multiple blasts at once, and do it intentionally, is quite rewarding. \n\nedit: There has been an update, and the problems of scrolling through the music, as well as not being able to fire the special, have been fixed. The UI where you pick your songs has improved as well.","timestamp_created":1503428543,"timestamp_updated":1505773021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558711647987365723","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49JzEy94CeM6ngwE="}
