    review: One of my childhood favorites. Although, this Steam release seems to be
      a bit buggy with the rifle scope not showing up when zooming in. Bugs aside,
      this is worth buying ONLY if you've played it before and want to relive old
      memories, or if you're into older, lower budget fps games. I used to have all
      Marine Sharpshooters 1-4 on disk years and years ago. Wish Steam would put up
      the other games in the series.
