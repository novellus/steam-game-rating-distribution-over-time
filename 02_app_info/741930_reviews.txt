Instead this time you only play as a single robot fighting slimes while trying to figure out whats going on. Its pretty well made but sadly the turn based combat gets a little dull after a while.\n\nThe story is good though, and its worth it if you really enjoyed stories like Waterworld or Fallout and want to see a new take on the genre.","timestamp_created":1526927864,"timestamp_updated":1526927864,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497381746768951416","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjMb/weMCeZDsoAE="}
