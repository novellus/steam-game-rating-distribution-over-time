    developer_response: 'Hello, and thanks for bringing this to my attention! There
      was a mistake in the depots when we converted the DLC to a soundtrack, and now
      you can find the soundtrack in the Soundtrack section of Steam.


      My apologies!'

    review: I just bought this soundtrack (DLC) a few hours ago, and I can't seem
      to find the MP3 files anywhere. I bought the game as well a few days ago. I'm
      very dissapointed at not being able to listen to it, even though I just paid
      for it.
