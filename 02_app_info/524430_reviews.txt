The problem is you need to finish Skool Daze to get Back To Skool and Nu Skool on and it's the most frustrating. Get past that though and it's fairly smooth sailing. The code thing from back in the day is ridiculous in 2020 mind (get codes from the teacher and work out the order... clue - use the headteacher's number first. The game will not tell you this).\n\nGood fun overall if you remember it back in the 80's. Everyone else might be scratching their heads though.","timestamp_created":1597354711,"timestamp_updated":1597354711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/dLw9PMCeKekmwI="}
