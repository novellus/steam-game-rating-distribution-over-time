The developer is very responsive in their discord about issues, suggestions, and general feedback. \n\nThe game itself is a very good recreation of the Project Diva titles (or Miracle Girls Festival if you somehow never heard of PD lol) and on its own is well made. There is not too many songs in the base game but it does allow use of charts from PPD (fan-made project diva simulator of the sort) and the community consistently is putting out charts of their own in the Workshop. If you're willing to step into community charts, you'll find a near endless supply of quality rhythm gameplay. \n\nI look forward to seeing this game in its finished state!","timestamp_created":1609820400,"timestamp_updated":1609820400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwmL2x6PYCcMzMwAI="}
