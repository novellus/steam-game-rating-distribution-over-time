The gameplay is a good mix between accessible and skill-testing  -  there are lots of nifty smaller challenges, with targets that are more reasonable to hit than in the average table, but some satisfyingly elegant paths for the ball and some tricky shots (that are nevertheless doable, mostly).  Breezy but with depth, plus a piano-chiptune soundtrack as brisk and clear as the winter air  -  but far friendlier.  If you're looking for a nice snow-themed table, don't hesitate to plunk down a couple bucks for this.","timestamp_created":1608260689,"timestamp_updated":1608260689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xtPzufYCdLeLuwI="}
