Its quite a short game at around 6 hours and was overall an adequate experience.\n\nThe art style, while a lil rough, is actually quite good. The intricate look on the armours and some environments were well designed. At some points of the game, you felt like you are in an Aliens movie. Sound and music although not memorable had its intense moments.\n\nThe game is buggy however. More then once i had to reload my save game because i couldn't walk through open doors. Animations are very rough and felt amateurish especially when you try to run against a wall and the character does a slow-motion jog instead of properly stopping.\n\nComputer AI and pathfinding was terrible as they never seem to come save you when you needed it. The multiplayer component is also dead. There are no one hosting any games at all.\n\nOverall Rating: 6 / 10\nThis is a game that has potential if the flaws are ironed out. Worth a look if on sale.","timestamp_created":1342712941,"timestamp_updated":1591406161,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xt3Mw/ICePr3Dg=="}
