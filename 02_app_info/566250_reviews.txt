The UI is full of game-breaking bugs, making it almost unplayable.  Regardless of what the developer has said in the discussions, this appears to be an unfinished, abandoned project.  It looks like it was developed using straight assembly language or C, and direct pixel drawing instead of standard UI controls, which is commendable in terms of programming effort, but with so much effort put into building a hackish UI from scratch, there was nothing left to put into screen layout or graphic design, making for a confusing and unpleasant eyesore.  The game concept seems like it could potentially be fun if this were rebuilt from scratch using a modern game development framework and a standardized UI.","timestamp_created":1584854317,"timestamp_updated":1584854317,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578096389770507813","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/LargPECfcz7+QE="}
