On several songs, they added dialogue from the game that shouldn't have been added like Odin's Theme, Kill You Through Sound, Loot Loot Loot, and HMS Serpentantic. Whoever approved this release couldn't make up their minds if this was an instrumental release or one with moments of the game added to each song.\n\nThat isn't to say no one should buy it. The main menu theme and a few other songs are released as intended for a soundtrack to be. I'm mostly salty the songs I didn't want voice work had voice overs added to them. That and most of the songs are obnoxious, so anyone buying this will typically be buying it for only themselves to listen to, or to counter protests on their streets. : ) You'll clear a crowd very fast on full blast, as my own family can attest.","timestamp_created":1514524243,"timestamp_updated":1514524243,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.44774135947227478","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w76r0OACdM6ElAE="}
