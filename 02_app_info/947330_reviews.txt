If you're not interested this is going to be huge waste of your time and money as it won't win you over.\n","timestamp_created":1563221637,"timestamp_updated":1563221637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+KbR++sCdse4zgE="}
