The soundtrack. Formatted in MP3 files @256kbps\n\nDeveloper Commentary:\n-Fun little audio snippets from the developers regarding game elements as they\nare encountered.\n-This mode is played by enabling it in the options menu. The game will now\nplay as normal, but throughout the levels you find characters representing\nthe developers who can be talked to, activating their recorded commentary audio clips.\n\nThis DLC pack is solely for fans. \nIf you didn't enjoy the game this won't add value for you.\n\nDid you enjoy the soundtrack? Here it is.\nSimilar to some dvd movies, its fun to hear the thoughts of the creators. But is it neccessary?\n\nIt is somewhat relaxing to listen to the developers while you play around in the levels now that you've \ncompleted them, but its definetly not a big deal. There are a little bit of \"thought process\" bits as you \nwould expect, but it doesn't add a lot to the experience.\n\nOverall for this pack, the value item is the soundtrack.\nThe commentary would just be an add-on. \nCould be interesting, could be not. \nDon't make it your only reason unless  you are one who must always \nwatch/listen to extra features.","timestamp_created":1424146188,"timestamp_updated":1450517209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":43,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.835715651512145996","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+oPk3NECdtesNw=="}
