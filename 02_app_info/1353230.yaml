    about_the_game: <strong>Team Reptile</strong> brings you Bomb Rush Cyberfunk,
      1 second per second of highly advanced funkstyle. In a world from the mind of
      Dion Koster, where self-styled crews are equipped with personal boostpacks,

      trick, face off with the cops and stake your claim to the extrusions and cavities
      of a sprawling metropolis in an alternate future set to the musical brainwaves
      of Hideki Naganuma.<br><br>Facts:<br>- In the game you can choose a character
      from your crew and explore the three-dimensional streets freely. <br>- Each

      slide, jump, trick and airdash to move around<br>- The goal is to get your name
      up, your name up on the wall. Every stage has many spots to find where you can
      paint graffiti.<br>- You will encounter a lot of weirdos.<br><br>FAQ:<br>- Will
      the game have online multiplayer?<br>The experience is focused on single-player,
      no further comment as of yet.<br><br>- When will the game be released?<br>Not
      this year, it's unlucky.<br><br>- Remember the future?<br>Nothing for nothing.
