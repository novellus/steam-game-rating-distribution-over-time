I regret it pretty instantly, I'm sure the game would be a fun time killer if it didn't cause my mouse to scroll out of the window constantly until i close the game; even when minimized. That could easily be remedied in fullscreen but of course the game has literally no options menu whatsoever so enjoy losing constantly or moving your mouse up and the right constantly. Really didn't think a game as simple as this that only cost me $.59 would disappoint me so immensely but it does. Judging by this companies massive roster of games all released in like the past 2-3 years and almost all mixed reviews I should have know.\n\nAvoid.","timestamp_created":1606528354,"timestamp_updated":1606528354,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7aijhvYCcdOLtAI="}
