    review: "Helicopter combat simulator. Appears you are using an Apache to defend\
      \ one island from a dictator. And then taking the fight to him. Considering\
      \ he has at least one aircraft carrier, several different types of aircraft\
      \ (I think I saw MiG-29s, Raptors, A-10s, F-117s, and some old-school prop bombers),\
      \ and a lot more\u2026 this is one wealthy dictator indeed\u2026 Each mission\
      \ only gives you a limited amount of ammunition. Which can be a problem at times.\n\
      \nSlightly older graphics, too. Decent enough, though."
