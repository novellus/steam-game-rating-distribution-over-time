I played with a friend in duo mode. This game has everything to be revelant and developers keep saying that the solution is making a big youtuber to play it. Nope.\n\nThe problem is the studio not being relevant. That problem was being solved slowly because the player base was growing, but then they made the worst decision ever: making a pay game. The slowly growing playerbase disappeared.\n\nThe best solution for the studio is making it a free to play while keeping the crystal store, of course the game won´t make much money, but the game can be used as publicity of the studio and people will look for the other games. Also the studio could make ocasional updates because when it does, everyone who played the game will receibe a notification of the update, so they don´t forget the game (this is why battle royale games have seasons, for making them feel not abandoned). There are indie battle royale games being played a lot today, so the loss of trend isn´t something to worrie about.","timestamp_created":1552272471,"timestamp_updated":1610085642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8aWl8PYCePnmvAE="}
