    about_the_game: "Rathe: The Beginning is a 2D hand drawn short story RPG that\
      \ follows a group of adventurers as they embark on a journey that takes them\
      \ all over the continent of Shen. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the giant crystal\
      \ meteor was shattered, there were 9 large chunks remaining. These chunks crashed\
      \ into the planet and forever gifted the planet with elemental energies: Ice,\
      \ Water, Fire, Bolt, Earth, Wind, Plasma, Dark and Light. Each element has its\
      \ own strengths and weaknesses against the other elements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe story starts off with the last trial of wilderness training and quickly\
      \ descends into mystery when the group finds a strange orb. A seemingly simple\
      \ errand turns into a giant adventure uncovering corruption and filled with\
      \ heroics! Find all your destined friends and unlock the secrets of the crystal\
      \ shards!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRathe brings you classic turn based combat, that\
      \ will have you commanding up to 4 heroes at the same time against a huge variety\
      \ of monsters, bandits and Mutants! Enter combat at a disadvantage or suffer\
      \ heavy damage and you can swap party members, as long as you have extra teammates\
      \ that is. Blast your opponents with powerful elemental spells and unique class\
      \ skills while mastering the elemental table to keep your edge against the enemy.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you enjoy Rathe, remember this is just the beginning!"
