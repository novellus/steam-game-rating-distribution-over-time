    review: "This program is really great if you're new to music making, and want\
      \ to branch out from really limiting phone apps. Absolutely beginner friendly.\
      \ But unfortunately doesn't seem to have keyboard support. Not a big problem\
      \ for me at my current level, but something others may be concerned about. I\
      \ upgraded to ultimate, and find both programs useful for my specific needs,\
      \ as I don't adhere to simply one genre of music. \n\nI highly recommend this\
      \ if you want to make some chiptune for your own personal projects. Or just\
      \ want to have some fun without an overwhelmingly complex program. \n\nTL;DR:\
      \ Very good beginner app and for people who just want to make something simple\
      \ for a project, if you are an expert and looking for high production software\
      \ this isn't it."
