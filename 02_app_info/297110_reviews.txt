You're a cosmic DJ and STEVE3 the cosmic conductor of the universe asks for you help to repair jamtennas so you can restore the harmony of the universe. \n\nThe story is very light, it might as well not even exist, but what writing is there is really decent and quite charming. It's a very bizarre storyline, but it works well enough considering the very trippy nature of the game, so don't expect anything deep going in and you should be good.\n\nGraphics:\n\nBest way to describe the art style of Cosmic DJ is imagine the most trippy music videos you've seen and imagine the backgrounds as the set up for the levels of this game. I will say that there's a lot of bright shining lights which could cause seizures so be careful.\n\nOverall the style is decent. I liked the trippy imagery throughout the levels and the overall simplistic design of the game. It's very pleasing to the eye, but like I said it might be too much for certain people, so look up so live gameplay to see if you can handle it.\n\nAudio:\n\nSince this is a music based game, audio has to be top notch and it definitely is. Most of the beats are preset for you, you can just layer on top of them and you can honestly make some truly catchy tunes. The main beats are decent and allow you to truly play around on your music creation skills.\n\nThe voice acting is decent and the actor for STEVE3 does a decent job, but there's not much of it. But overall the audio design is great. The only negative is that there's not more beats to mess around with, which could have been really cool. \n\nGameplay:\n\nCosmic DJ is not much of a game, but more or less a music software disguised as a game. It has a game like structure, where you go through levels by creating music, but you can barely call it a game. Each track you create no matter how simple will still advance you forward in the game, so it's more or less a very simplistic software for you to tinker around in.\n\nThe tools themselves are simple, you can mess around with the tempo, add instruments or beeps and other things and it's really easy to use and quickly you can make some truly catchy beats. It's honestly quite fun to mess around with and I had a blast with this one, even going back and redoing a track from the beginning because I wasn't satisfied with the first attempt of mine. You can also create album covers and export your music to share, which was a really cool little feature. \n\nVerdict:\n\nCosmic DJ is a great experimental \"game\". If you like music and want to mess around a software without having to learn FL Studio, then you should definitely get Cosmic DJ. It's cheap, fun and really charming so I highly suggest checking it out. \n\nFinal Rating:\n8/10\n \nPros:\n+ Charming presentation\n+ Really easy to use\n+ You can make some beats insanely catchy\n\nCons:\n- Not really a game\n- Not many beats to mess around with\n\nIf you liked this review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews\n\n","timestamp_created":1609790666,"timestamp_updated":1609790666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589238286018371582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0YbA5/YCc5G/wAI="}
