It's probably currently the Steam game I play the most. There were some negative reviews because of glaring bugs that have since been fixed. There are still some issues but nothing major.\n\nI 100% recommend this game!","timestamp_created":1605864049,"timestamp_updated":1605864049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lpm98vUCc8S4rwI="}
