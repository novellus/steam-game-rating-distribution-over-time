I will say I enjoyed it overall despite some minor frustrations, usually with difficulty.\nThe level design is pretty good, nothing amazing, but there were definitely moments of intentionality which you don't often see with these kind of flash-game like platformers. I really appreciated the unique death animations for each enemy type. I thought that was a neat touch. I also liked the simple but catchy music.\nThere are some problems with hit detection, especially on the dark blue bouncing enemies, when you jump on them. Also I found the final boss a little frustrating but once I found a strategy to keep him from shooting rockets, he was beatable. I would have also liked to see more variety in the backgrounds.\nOverall fun game to spend an hour with and it seems like there is another set of levels coming which I'll look forward to.","timestamp_created":1608791850,"timestamp_updated":1608791850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwe/dyfYCe+XYvAI="}
