    review: "Yeah, unfortunately I have to agree with most of the negative reviews\
      \ posted here. The game is really bad. And I don\u2019t know if this is made\
      \ to be walking simulator or survival horror but it fails to be any of that.\
      \ Or even as the combination of both. \n\nDon\u2019t even get me started on\
      \ bugs and glitches. I haven\u2019t seen this much since The Force Unleashed\
      \ 2! And that's saying something because that game was almost unplayable at\
      \ the time. Hell, enemy AI in this game is stuck running in place! Or he will\
      \ run randomly all around the place and hit the wall or a tree and get stuck,\
      \ you guess it, RUNNING IN PLACE! Oh, and trust me, that\u2019s not even the\
      \ half of it. Textures break, objects disappear... I mean, I can go on and on,\
      \ but I think you get the point.\n\nUgh, and as a conclusion, I can only say\
      \ that this game is total mess. Such a mess that I wouldn't even recommend it\
      \ if it was free to play. Don\u2019t waste your time."
