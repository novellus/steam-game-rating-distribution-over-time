    about_the_game: "STORY:The Final Conflict has ended. Earth exists no more. Following\
      \ a relentless cycle of brutal engagements in which victory continued to narrowly\
      \ elude the Overlords, a turning point was reached when they began to observe\
      \ the characteristics of earth's most successful predators. Insect life-forms\
      \ with their combination of strength, speed, aggression and durability were\
      \ finally selected as the optimum design for the ultimate fighting machine.\
      \ The resulting Predator was used to devastating effect in the last wave of\
      \ battle which has become known as the Final Conflict. In the aftermath, the\
      \ Overlords, in an ironic twist recreate parts of the earth they destroyed to\
      \ serve as arenas. Here, the Predators, once used to annihilate the earth, now\
      \ engage in combat for the entertainment of their creators.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nCHARACTERS: Predator machines inspired by earthly insect life-forms, each\
      \ is programmed to reflect the real-life characteristics and behaviour of its\
      \ earthly counterpart. The player is a Predator machine battling other Predator\
      \ machines in the gladiatorial arenas.Most Predators can fly. Their comparative\
      \ sizes vary but all approximate to a fully grown male of the human species.\
      \ All Predators are equipped with a CPU which enables two way communication\
      \ between the Predator and its weapon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPLAYING MODES: There\
      \ are two inter-twined playing modes, Sequential mode and Gladiator Zone. In\
      \ either mode the player chooses a Challenger identity from those Predators\
      \ available. The player then engages in combat with the other available Predators.\
      \ The number of available Challenger IDs and Predator opponents increases as\
      \ the player advances through the game. Each Predator has different skills and\
      \ strengths. When you choose a Predator for your Challenger ID you assume the\
      \ skills of that Predator. So if he can fly, you can fly...... but beware, until\
      \ you advance to flying level tread carefully as you're in danger of falling\
      \ off the edge of the game world! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSEQUENTIAL MODE: In this\
      \ mode you progress from one tier to another by defeating those Predators presented\
      \ to you on each individual tier. In this mode Predator/Challenger characteristics\
      \ are fixed and arenas are only available in sequential order.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nHOLY TRINITY: When you start to play on Tier 1 your Challenger ID is\
      \ fixed. In order to advance to another Challenger ID you have to score a Holy\
      \ Trinity. You score a Holy Trinity by killing your Predator opponent three\
      \ consecutive times without its killing you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPREDATOR UNLOCK:\
      \ When you defeat a Predator in sequential mode it is unlocked and becomes available\
      \ in the Gladiator Zone. There you have the option to fully customize its specifications\
      \ before engaging in combat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGLADIATOR ZONE: In Gladiator\
      \ Zone you can play any Predator or combination of Predators whom you have previously\
      \ unlocked by defeating them in any tier of Sequential Mode. You can assume\
      \ any Challenger ID of those Predators against whom you scored a Holy Trinity.\
      \ You can fight any unlocked Predator in any unlocked arena. Most importantly\

    review: "By far one of the worst games I have experienced in my 40 years of game\
      \ playing.\n\nI'm going to attempt a pro's and cons list... this won't be pretty:\n\
      \nPros: Steam allows refunds! I love you steam.\n\nNeutral: It's single player.\
      \ Kind of disapointing for a first person arena shooter, but I can't hold it\
      \ against them since it's honestly marked that way in the steam store.\n\nCons:\n\
      - The game has 1 level. There's buttons to change to others but apparantly they\
      \ were never put in\n\n- The game pretends to have 2 modes to play, but they\
      \ are actually identical, just the same arena with you versus another insect\n\
      \n- No music during the game, cheesy repetitive sound effects (and very few\
      \ of them)\n\n- Gun variety? There seems to be 4 but they are all slight variations\
      \ in the SAME model with just different lights, they function and sound all\
      \ mostly the same. It actually took me a while to even notice that the guns\
      \ were different occasionally.\n\n- The game description says it's all about\
      \ flying; but the \"flight\" button just makes you sort of jump and hover for\
      \ a couple seconds. It's more about \"jumping sort of not really that far\"\
      \ than it is anything resembling flight.\n\n- This is a 1 versus 1 arena game..\
      \ that's it. There is litterally NO CONTENT.\n\n- No in game feedback, the UI\
      \ is void of anything that tells you what is going on. No kill counts, no death\
      \ counts, no way to know what you are supposed to do or why. I mean sure the\
      \ goal is simple \"kill the enemy 10 times\" but you don't even know how many\
      \ kills you are currently on and no, counting for real isn't an option because:\n\
      \n- You have no idea if your actual kills were done by you or the environment.\
      \ Both you and the enemy will die randomly to things completely not under your\
      \ control. Walk near a gas cloud? you dead, Bump into a building and clip through\
      \ it? you die. Walking too fast and the game bugs out? you die. If the world\
      \ killed the enemy while you were shooting at it, you won't know.\n \n- You\
      \ will spend most of your time in this big empty arena (the only one...) waiting\
      \ for the content to find you. Just one lonely bug walking over and shooting\
      \ at you, over and over again.\n\n- the enemy hit boxes are wonky. empty clip\
      \ after clip into one body part or another and there's no feedback telling you\
      \ if you are hitting anything (no bullets, no hit effects). the enemy just occsionally\
      \ falls over dead (but then it does that even if you aren't shooting at it sometimes\
      \ so you really have no idea if your bullets are effecting it)\n\n- I could\
      \ on about how bad the content is, but there's so little of it, what's the point?\n\
      \n- Beyond that it's technically put together badly. Game has lots of bugs,\
      \ lots of clipping issues, lots of what you would expect from say an amateur\
      \ gaming developer that hasn't been properly trained. \n\n- Even the most fundamental\
      \ game basics are broken here: you have to restart the game to change the sound\
      \ effect levels; seriously? \n\n- Game breaking here: Switching the screen resolution\
      \ is on a \"cycle\" you litterally have to change and WAIT for the new resolution\
      \ (and hope your system supports it) before you can \"cycle\" to the next one.\
      \ If your monitor doesn't accept the next resolution in the list before you\
      \ get to the one you want? Too bad, the game just goes black with no way to\
      \ recover. Don't worry, it won't remember your resolution anyway so just force\
      \ it closed. You get to cycle through every resolution every time you want to\
      \ play the game. I haven't seen resolution settings this bad since DOS games\
      \ were a thing back in the '90s, haven't we all learned how to make a settings\
      \ menu that works yet?\n\nI gotta stop, there's about 1000 more things wrong\
      \ with this game. At it's very core I am finding it difficult to even call this\
      \ a game. I have personally played student graduation projects with more content\
      \ than this. At best this is a tech demo you might use to show the earliest\
      \ stage concept of what your game is going to be about. But what you have here\
      \ is a developer who made 1 big empty level and called it a full release product.\
      \ And that 1 level was not even properly designed or tested.\n\nEpic Failure\
      \ in every way.\n\nAs a final note of just how poor the development quality\
      \ is on this game? They couldn't even be bothered to name their launch file\
      \ properly. If you open task manager while playing (which I had to do several\
      \ times due to game breaking bugs that forced me to close the game) you will\
      \ find the game is named: \"Made with UDK\"; that is litterally the default\
      \ name for a file that anyone will end up with simply from launching the Unreal\
      \ Development Kit.\n\nThis \"game\" could be made in a weekend for free by anyone\
      \ simply by downloading UDK, uploading a few free models, putting in a basic\
      \ menu screen and than launching the UDK movement demo to shuffle your models\
      \ around.\n\nStill curious? Watch this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLKefFA-mgY\n\
      That is litterally 100% of the content in this game. You've missed nothing and\
      \ there is nothing else to see or do. Big empty world, 1v1 against another bug\
      \ using boring weapons.\n\nThe game has a total of 3 minutes worth of content\
      \ and none of it good.\n\n--------------------------\nIn addition to the ridiculous\
      \ comments from the developer under this review, he wanted to argue in the forums\
      \ as well. His responses are just as bad as the game is:\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/443070/discussions/0/364041517008262896/]What\
      \ a joke.[/url]\n\n--------------------------\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]\
