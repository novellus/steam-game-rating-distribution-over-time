They also consist of breathtaking graphic and scenery designs. The story plots are well written.\n\nIf you played the [b]Cat's Path[/b] before and was wondering if the [b]Sheep's Path[/b] is similar to it - well, not really. There are some plots which you may feel similar but the results are totally different from Cat's Path. If you are curious, try it out (*ゝω・)ﾉ\n\nOur Mr. Sheep, as you have seen from Cat's Path, he is absolutely charming and I have no regret playing this path (〃艸〃)","timestamp_created":1573996480,"timestamp_updated":1573996525,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43J7gvO4CdaPo2gE="}
