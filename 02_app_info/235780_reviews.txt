Instead i'll talk only about differences.\n\nLevel-design. [b]Level-design![/b] These levels are even somewhat better than HL1. They use space most efficiently, look logical and are not a one corridor from start to finish with vortigaunts licking your posterior-checks every 10 seconds in the \"free-roam\" cut-scenes. This is just great! New music is fitting and pleasant. And the story is slightly better than HL2, while writing is as bad, but narrative is just great. Also it doesn't overstay it's welcome and clocks about 4 hours.","timestamp_created":1488270995,"timestamp_updated":1511115036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1rLe6t8Cde+rcw=="}
