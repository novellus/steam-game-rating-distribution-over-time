So know going in that it's not very complex, not very long, and may be prone to jankyness. All that in mind, I still had plenty of fun with the game.\nItem placements are not random, so learning the layout of the church and location of everything was really fun. I like that there's no text or story to read and that I can just make my own assumptions about what's happening, though maybe a little more to see would've been nice. After my first couple of unsuccessful runs, I thought I was done with the game but I found myself coming back to it the next few days to learn more and give it another shot.\nCombat is unfortunately a tad easy, so after a few deaths to simply learn about enemy attacks/patterns you should have no problem beating it fairly quickly. I've gotten ~20min victory in that would've been shorter if it was possible to end the exploration phase earlier. Unfortunately I've never actually seen the final cutscene due to a consistent crash at the end, but I can tell from the achievement stats that others aren't having the same problem. The devs are still updating the game and have even fixed a minor issue that I pointed out to them, so I'll just wait for another patch somewhere down the line.\nI think it's important to experience these truly indie games. So despite the issues I've had with the game, I still totally recommend it.","timestamp_created":1609701115,"timestamp_updated":1609701115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x7jq5PYCefKUwAI="}
