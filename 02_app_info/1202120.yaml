    review: "Este jogo \xE9 perfeito para quem gosta de resolver enigmas, contem alguns\
      \ mais dificeis que outros. De modo geral diverti-me bastante a jogar e tentar\
      \ adivinhar o assassino, n\xE3o existem pistas concretas, o que nos leva a pensar\
      \ e avaliar todas as personagens ao longo dos cap\xEDtulos."
