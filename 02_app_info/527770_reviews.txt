It looks like something someone could do within a few days. The only thing good about this is the main menu and the music there. Otherwise, it's buggy as hell, the colors are very unappealing, and you have no idea what you're doing most of the time. It's also less than an hour long when you have some idea of what's happening - otherwise, it doesn't tell you anything.\n\nI have no idea how combat even works, or how invisible walls work in this game. The chainsaw seems to only work when you're in front of an enemy or a tree layer-wise? Magic is pretty much unusable because you have to consistently stock up on mana from blue mushrooms and you can't stop the magic casting animation after you play it once with magic equipped, thus forcing you to go back to spawn and respawn yourself.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think this is pretty damn impressive for what someone can do on their own - I mean, it's nothing compared to other solo-dev games like Undertale, but it seems like work has actually been put into designing levels and environments, even though they're not that good. My problem with this game is that it's just really shit. It felt like an absolute slog and I was looking forward to get to the end of it as fast as possible. Definitely a bad experience. Don't buy this game with real life money. It's not worth it.","timestamp_created":1585215209,"timestamp_updated":1585215209,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44o+Mi/ECeNuW+wE="}
