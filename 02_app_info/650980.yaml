    review: If you have Oculus Rift don't even buy this game... When you start level
      1 you see a bunch of "how to" things with only Vive controllers visible and
      nothing to tell you what to do, Oculus support is clearly not even in this game,
      I couldn't even figure out how to start the actual game.
