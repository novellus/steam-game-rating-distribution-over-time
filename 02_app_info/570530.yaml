    about_the_game: When U.S. Marine Gabriel Drummer (Shia LaBeouf) returns home from
      his tour in Afghanistan, he finds that the place he once called home is no better
      than the battlefields where he fought overseas. Accompanied by his best friend
      Devin Roberts (Jai Courtney), a hard-nosed Marine whose natural instinct is
      to shoot first and ask questions later, he searches desperately for the whereabouts
      of his estranged son, Johnathan (Charlie Shotwell), and wife Natalie (Kate Mara).
      In their search, the two intercept Charles (Clifton Collins Jr.), a man carrying
      vital information about the whereabouts of Gabriel's family. As we revisit the
      past, we are guided through the unraveling of the puzzle of Gabriel's experience,
      and what will eventually lead us to finding his family. A psychological suspense
      thriller, MAN DOWN also stars Gary Oldman.

    review: Being a Veteran myself with 2 combat deployments to Iraq in the Marine
      Corps Infantry I can say PTSD is real and has a negative stigma when diagnosed.
      Look out for your Devil Dogs. Semper Fi! Great Film it went to the very extreme
      of what can happen to Veterans however to show the true meaning of PTSD does
      it artistically described it.
