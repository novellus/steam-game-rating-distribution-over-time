    review: "Yikes. Not for me at all. \n\nThe atmosphere was solidly spooky, so I'm\
      \ really disappointed that there didn't seem to be much more to this game. I\
      \ also didn't find anything 'psychedelic' about this game. Maybe the Dev meant\
      \ 'psychological' horror? Didn't find much of that either.\n\nThere is an ax\
      \ man who wanders around and you're supposed to figure out what to do while\
      \ he's pursuing you since the game 'does not hold your hand'. Well great, but\
      \ if all this is going to be is some sort of convoluted scavenger hunt/guessing\
      \ game-- could we at least have a gamma slider so we can actually SEE where\
      \ to look? Jesus. \n\nNot knowing where to go or what to do or why is not fun\
      \ for this pastel pixie. Sorry, friends. :("
