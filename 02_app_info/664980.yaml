    about_the_game: After a horrific car accident, Anna (Christina Ricci) wakes up
      to find the local funeral director Eliot Deacon (Liam Neeson) preparing her
      body for her funeral. Confused, terrified and feeling still very much alive,
      Anna doesn't believe she's dead, despite the funeral director's reassurances
      that she is merely in transition to the afterlife.  Eliot convinces her he has
      the ability to communicate with the dead and is the only one who can help her.  Trapped
      inside the funeral home, with nobody to turn to except Eliot, Anna is forced
      to face her deepest fears and accept her own death. But Anna's grief-stricken
      boyfriend Paul (Justin Long) still can't shake the nagging suspicion that Eliot
      isn't what he appears to be. As the funeral nears, Paul gets closer to unlocking
      the disturbing truth, but it could be too late; Anna may have already begun
      to cross over to the other side.  With an unrelenting edge of menace, After.Life
      is a stylish psychological thriller which provocatively questions the line between
      life and death.
