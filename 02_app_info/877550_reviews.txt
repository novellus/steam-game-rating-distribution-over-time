It sounds simple, but no other puzzle game/software on steam makes custom puzzles so easy. Not everything about this product is smooth or user-intuitive, but it lets you import your own pictures and create puzzles out of them! To do so, you'll need to go directly to the game files and add copies of the pictures. If you love puzzles and want to do virtual puzzles with your own pictures, grab this when it's on sale. You won't be disappointed.","timestamp_created":1609125908,"timestamp_updated":1609125908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4pnY0/YCddf8vQI="}
