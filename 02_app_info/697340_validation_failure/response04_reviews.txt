You have a stolen gif of Happy on the store page. You are using Jellal and Erza from Fairy Tail. During the gameplay I saw the fat version of Virgo which is one of Lucy's summons in the show. The screen shots depict Lucy and other Fairy Tail characters such as Elfman. You are using pictures as background images stolen from the anime, a clear copy and paste. You forgot to rename Jellal to your fake name for him; Jerar, in one of the starting cutscenes clearly showing you just stole him. This game is illegal on so many counts and it should be taken down asap or changed.\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/11c97e45bc97720fab0dae553c5a62d4\n\nI was put on a ban because I exposed them for their crimes.\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/a0630a3f27cfa9b436a43f0a7f7fb07d\n\nI also just recieved a permenant ban on the community hub.\n\nFairy Light Devs know this. You have been reported to Hiro Mashima, the creator of Fairy Tail.","timestamp_created":1549699392,"timestamp_updated":1549760053,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57727205753326416","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ48Le56ugCe/yzugE="}
