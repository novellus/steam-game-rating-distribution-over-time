    about_the_game: Backfire has an arcade-inspired art style, complete with rudimentary
      sound effects. Using either a keyboard/mouse or a gamepad, you'll traverse through
      the mothership fighting not only enemies, but <i>yourself</i>.<br><br>Take control
      of Spike (or Sotira, if that's your taste) to fight against the aliens and space
      robots threatening humanity.<br>Every bullet you fire will ricochet off walls.
      The more you shoot, the deeper you descend into the depths of <strong>bullet
      hell</strong>. While keeping your shooting to a minimum, you'll have to dodge
      enemy bullets that are equally dangerous (and bouncy).<br>You're not alone,
      though! Through a mysterious transmission, you can buy upgrades for your ship
      using chips acquired from enemies you defeat.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul
