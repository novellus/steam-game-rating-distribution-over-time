    about_the_game: 'Worlds of Chaos: Invasion is a single player, party based open-world
      tactical RPG with a strong emphasis on exploration, tactical real-time-with-pause
      combats and party creation. It has a deep, fun and intense combat system that
      will challenge you to your limits, and will make clever decisions count.<br><br>You
      build a party of 5 characters that are exactly what you want : no classes or
      choice restrictions. Creating good and balanced characters with the right combinations
      of stats, skills, equipments, items and magic abilities, is what matters the
      most. In this game, a huge importance has been put on making every choice equal
      in power. What is important for a good party is not choosing the best skills,
      but an efficient combination of choices that work well together. And that is
      completely up to you, the player, to figure out. Your combinations will be unique
      to your style and choices.<br><br>Battles are fast-paced, and you will need
      to take a lot of decisions, each of which will help you overcome the difficult
      foes that you encounter. Choosing which abilities to use, when and how to use
      them, choosing the right positioning of your warriors and the right targets
      for each of them, knowing which equipments and consumables to use and when,
      are what will bring you victory. <br><br><strong>Key Features :</strong><br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>    Single player tactical RPG where you control a party of
      5 characters that you create with no class restriction, they are how you decide,
      completely.<br></li><li>    Very intense real-time-with-pause tactical gameplay
      that keeps you on your toes.<br></li><li>    Deep combat system that rewards
      clever party organization and statistical skill outside of combat, and smart
      tactical thinking inside combat.<br></li><li>    Injuries system that weakens
      enemies (and party characters) that have been hit, so focusing attacks on one
      enemy is unnecessary and often a bad idea. Injuring many enemies to make them
      weaker by taking opportunities in combat and using each of your characters at
      their best is way better.<br></li><li>    Each situation, each combat demands
      different strategies. There are no tactics that will work every time, adaptability
      is crucial. Check combat video to see this in action.<br></li><li>    No dead
      time in this game unlike most rpgs : corpses are auto-looted, you can fast-travel
      to explored places at any time, time consuming parts are taken off this game
      to keep the most interesting ones : exploration, combats, fast loots, fast shopping,
      fast and simple party management.<br></li><li>    (Early access) The game now
      has 21 hours of contents and can now be played from the start to the end. It

    developer_response: "Hi Brasidas,\n\nIf your spellcasters run into melee, it's\
      \ because party's AI is decided by the weapon they use. Melee weapons will make\
      \ your characters go into melee, but bows and staves will keep them in the back.\
      \ Staves are by far the best weapons for magicians. If you used staves already,\
      \ then it's definitely a bug and not supposed to happen, please tell me if it's\
      \ the case. \n\nThanks to your input, in party creation, I'll make it clear\
      \ that the weapon of choice for any mage is a staff, and tell it's a ranged\
      \ weapon in it's description. It's my bad for not making it clear.\n\nAlso,\
      \ the game saves every 15 seconds (out of combat), and when you die you resurrect\
      \ with a small fee and lose nothing else, which I think is not too punishing.\
      \ I suggest you create a new party and reload every one of your characters (it\
      \ automatically saves them) but give your magic users staves... or just continue\
      \ your game and make it to the first village and buy them."

    review: I don't know if this game ever had promise, but the combat AI runs spellcasters
      into melee, and they aggro the hell out of melee fighters. Also, there is no  save
      feature to protect against such "system" issues. Avoid.
