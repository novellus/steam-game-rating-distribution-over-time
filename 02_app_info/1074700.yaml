    review: "This game is pretty good. I happened to look at my shelf, thinking what\
      \ to play next. I've picked this game and it was quite well made. It stand not\
      \ stand out. But if it happens to be pouring rain outside, this is a good game\
      \ to start your day. It has elements of a classic HOPA with real-life characters\
      \ and modern protagonist propelled in magical situations that she needs to survive\
      \ or save the someone else's life. A classic gem.\n\nPROS: \n- Beautiful backgrounds;\n\
      - Journal entries are brief and sharp;\n- The Strategy Guide is very useful;\n\
      - The Voice acting is very good;\n- It contains a Main Game + Bonus Chapter;\n\
      - Extra folder with wallpapers, screensavers, concept art and music.\n\nNEUTRE:\n\
      - The characters might remind one of the story of Snow White and the Witch;\n\
      - The Witch is called by the same name as Holly's mother from the game True\
      \ Fear: Forsaken Souls.\n\nCONS:\n- No fast-traveling Map;\n- No achievements;\n\
      - No trading cards;\n- Repetitive music.\n\nAll in all, it is a good game to\
      \ play for any HOPA fan or for anybody willing to discover new experiences as\
      \ a Steam player."
