This could be the intention of the developer, but it doesn't seem clear one way or the other.\nThe controls are basic but it feels lacking in tutorial. \nIngame, there are a number of graphical and mechanical bugs/glitches that should be fixed (Namely, player collisions with walls/obstacles and the sideways motion of spaceships).\nThe main gameplay seems like it should be refined more, to lessen the learning curve and possibly add more fallback mechanics.\n\nI am interested to see how this plays out, and I hope that the developer fixes some of these problems. If the developer isn't a native english speaker, I can assist in translating the game into standard United States English. Once the core gameplay loop is fixed, I will change my review to a positive recommendation.\n\nEdit: It has been 3 hours and I seem unable to pass the first level, but I am inspired by the game itself including its flaws\n\nEdit 2: Just got an update (March 25), and I'm satisfied that the game is being upkept, so I am changing my rating to positive","timestamp_created":1584175312,"timestamp_updated":1585192433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41p61ivECfMr/9wE="}
