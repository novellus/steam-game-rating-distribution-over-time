    about_the_game: "You will play the role of a faction of leaders, in the rivers\
      \ and lakes and the hall of the flood, how to lead the school to become strong?<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nYou're going to have a lot of choices, and you're going to\
      \ have a simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; decision,<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nCan affect your school reputation, wealth, martial arts and disciples. Every\
      \ decision you make,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoth may lead to prosperity, but may\
      \ also lead to disaster. Too little wealth; The disciples did not have enough\
      \ to eat and fell into weeds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToo much wealth; May also lead\
      \ to the evil bandit's covetousness so that the clan was plundered. If the sect's\
      \ reputation is too low, it will be expelled from wulin.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      Too high reputation will be sent to the court to &quot;peace.&quot; As the saying\

      <br />\r\nIt's going to be one of your biggest projects as a manager.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game adopts the national style of ink and\
      \ wash painting, freehand art performance, and the question bank and puzzle\
      \ of taking money from the &quot;I ching&quot;,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this happy\
