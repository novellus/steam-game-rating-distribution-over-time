    about_the_game: "Taste of Power is a real-time strategy game set in alternate\
      \ medieval times, where you fight for one of 3 factions \u2013 Europe, China,\
      \ or the Middle East. In our version of history, nations clash for global dominance.\
      \ The continent is an epic battlefield, so you\u2019ll have to build cities,\
      \ recruit troops, study new technologies and wipe out your opponents. Your nation\
      \ needs a proper commander! <br><br><strong>New Medieval warfare</strong><br>Tactics\
      \ are essential in Taste of Power. The numbers of your enemies' troops don't\
      \ mean much if you meet them with a proper artillery battery. Engineering power\
      \ has no limits here, as you can build mobile defenses to protect strategic\
      \ positions. Build underground tunnels to move your forces across the battle\
      \ lines faster and surprise your opponent!<br><br>Each nation has a unique set\
      \ of units. Taste of Power offers a drastically different style of play for\
