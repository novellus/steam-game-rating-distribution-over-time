However with this it's impossible to enjoy because there's nothing to stop the AI being able to spam commands, and spam units every nanosecond. Not to mention, there's no strategy to this because everything you learnt in the tutorial is useless.\n\nThe AI overwhelms you INSTANTLY, no matter how good your initial set up is.\n\nPlus, the enemy seems to always know exactly where you are without having scouts. Yet when you have scouts, they don't spot even a tank unless it's literally on their foot. Like what? Also wtf is this \"Pinned Down\" system? It seems like an awesome idea, but you could have 50+ soldiers, several anti tanks, machine guns sat in buildings all around and tanks up against a unit of 12 enemy infantry and just because they have a \"leader\" in their squad YOUR ENTIRE ARMY just drops to the floor screaming whilst your $20,000,000 worth of weapons on wheels drives full speed towards the trees.\n\nAll in all, I've experienced enough in two hours to know that this game is NOT to be played against AI. It'd probably be really fun with friends but otherwise it's a hard no from me. As funny as it was laughing at how stupid the Pinned Down feature is, I want my money back. I wouldn't pay £3 let alone £35. Absolute joke of a price.\n\nI can't even be bothered to re-read this so enjoy any spelling mistakes there may be. I'm gonna go tug one out\n\n3/10 - I can't think of a more inaccurate World War 2 game (except COD WW2, that's pretty inaccurate too).","timestamp_created":1609961886,"timestamp_updated":1609961886,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk5rN7PYCdcWLwQI="}
