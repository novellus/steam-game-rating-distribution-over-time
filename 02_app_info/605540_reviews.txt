Comes with handy maps already with grid on with both DM and Player maps and relevant tokens and monsters stats to play. A useful set of scenarios to amuse your players with, only weakness is they were never meant to be linked together but in all honesty does not matter too much.","timestamp_created":1596230057,"timestamp_updated":1596230057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wreu0/MCfNbWmAI="}
