    review: "Another pricy DLC and just like the other it gives you two teams. The\
      \ Full Metal Mayhem have become my favourite Team, simply because of their Arena\
      \ and the fact that all the players are parodies of real life musicians like\
      \ Ronnie Maimes Dio and Mic Dagger. The Cracksumskull Jugulars are a parody\
      \ of the Jacksonville Jaguars on the other hand. \n\nWith this DLC you also\
      \ get another Race: The Hell-Spawned Demons. They are complete imune to Fire,\
      \ wether it is Traps on the field or Dirty Tricks like Flame On. They also can\
      \ jump the highest and stay a bit in the air thanks to their wings, making them\
      \ absolutely perfect for interceptions. Their big weakness is their really bad\
      \ health regeneration, they die a lot during longer matches just from all the\
      \ punishment they receive. But overall, they are a good addition. \n\nAlso included\
      \ are two Dirty Tricks. The Time Warp is really nasty, since you can use it\
      \ after a play to erase that. So, let's say on Offensive you fumbled or the\
      \ opponents intercepted your pass: Do the Time Warp and it never happened. It's\
      \ also available on Defense for some team and the same applies: Enemies scored?\
      \ Time Warp them back and they look really stupid. \nThe other is the Sonic\
      \ Blast and is used for Pass Plays. Once the Receiver catches the Ball it will\
      \ emit a massive blast wave that knocks down all defenders around it, usually\
      \ leaving the way wide open for a easy Touchdown. \n\nI obviously recommend\
      \ this one."
