    about_the_game: "Survive, explore, craft, build, fight, die! Welcome to Age of\
      \ Survival. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAge of Survival is survival simulation crafting\
      \ game from Seattletek. Your player has been stranded on an island not far off\
      \ of the coast of Africa where you will encounter creatures like boar, elephant,\
      \ lions, hippos, crocs, rhinos, and tons of sea life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore\
      \ a beautiful environment based on real life heightmap and satellite image data.\
      \ Interact with trees, ores, creatures, structures, explore the ocean, and travel\
      \ to new environments. Your player is also able to build structures anywhere\
      \ on the map, make sure to protect your valuable resources! Craft items like\
      \ you never have before : craft firearms, weapons, and your tools in a more\
      \ in depth manner by having to construct individual components, and combining\
      \ them to create a final outcome. There are currently ten types of crafting\
      \ in the game, from your basic crafting available on the character anytime,\
      \ to things like water de-salination and distillation, tailoring, reloading,\
      \ toolmaking, different types of cooking and more! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTruly\
      \ test your survival skills!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAge of Survival is a truly immersive\
      \ survival experience, which brings you to a new level of survivalism and creates\
      \ a rich experience unlike any other!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe truly care about\
      \ the community, and want everyone involved in our development throughout it's\
      \ process. With great features already, and huge plans for the future, Age of\
      \ Survival is setting itself in motion to be a contender in the survival game\
      \ arena."

    review: 'The game is back up and running, the dev is back to working hard on it.
      Not over thrilled with the fact that its like the game has been taken back to
      stage 0. working out bugs in the crafting for god sake. this used to be a simi-fully
      working game..


      i cant say "meh" for the recommended so its on "no". if anything just put it
      on a watch list and see if he is able to get anywhere on it this time around.


      current state of the game ~ been completely redone, crating is weird but functions,
      sort of


      current update of the game ~ has been worked on, but at this point not worth
      the $20.. if you can get it on sale, i would say, pass...


      current dev standing ~ working(ish)


      last know standing of the game ~ back to the drawing board..'
