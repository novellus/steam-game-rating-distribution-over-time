    about_the_game: Experience the End Times in style! This DLC contains a bold new
      look for the Witch Hunter Victor Saltzpyre. The new skin is applied when downloaded
      (to revert, simply uninstall).<h2 class="bb_tag">Estalian Leather Coat</h2>The
      Estalian Kingdoms lie far to the south, where the threat of Chaos  seems very
      remote. Like the Border Princes, Estalia is a collection of petty kingdoms.
      Unlike the Border Princes, however, Estalians  face no threat from Orcs and
      Goblins so they mostly fight amongst themselves.<br><br>There is little evidence
      of the influence of Chaos in the Estalian Kingdoms, but it is there. Subtle
      perhaps, but no less deadly. It is not the brute power of the raging Beastman,
      but the hidden plotting of secret societies and cults which is eating away at
      distant Estalia.<br><br>There are no Witch Hunters hunting Chaos in Estalia,
      but worship of Myrmidia is popular. She is patron Goddess of the art and science
      of war and the Estalians have learned her lessons well. If Tilea is known for
      its mercenaries, Estalia is known for its duellists. Fencing schools can be
      found throughout the region, many with long histories and deadly rivalries.
