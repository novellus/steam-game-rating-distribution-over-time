It's not that I thought that the voice acting was bad, but more so that I was so used to reading the dialogue myself. Hearing voices for characters that I had originally read to myself in the previous games really threw me off.\n\nFortunately, that was my only gripe with the game. And after learning about the voiceless version that you can download online I happily played through the game. Though it is a shame that I wont get any achievements on Steam.","timestamp_created":1609576114,"timestamp_updated":1609578155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v7GV4fYCf77UvwI="}
