      Office Football is a text-based sports simulation. It's a game for those of
      us who love the numbers in sports.<br><br>In Front Office Football, you play
      the role of your favorite team's general manager. You determine your team's
      future through trading with opponents, negotiating contracts, bidding for free
      agents and discovering new talent through the annual amateur draft.<br><br>You
      can also play the role of the armchair coach, setting game plans and depth charts,
      or even calling each play from an extensive playbook.<br><br>You can determine
      ticket prices and submit stadium construction plans for public approval. You
      can move your team if the public won't properly support your franchise.<br><br>Front
      Office Football Seven includes a multi-player career mode with full ftp support,
      allowing you to compete in a league with up to 31 other enthusiastic general
      managers. Multi-player mode runs independently of Steam and requires a commissioner
      to manage the web site.<br><br>The original game, released in 1998, received
      an Editors' Choice award from Computer Gaming World and a 4 1/2-star review.
      It was nominated for numerous Sports Game of the Year awards. This is the Seventh
      full version.<br><br>Front Office Football Seven features a 2015 player file
      and new careers with the default files begin in 2015 with the 2015 schedule.
      We're keeping this product on sale at half price to promote the series. For
      the latest in the series, Front Office Football Eight is available and features
      a 2018 player file and schedule.<h2 class="bb_tag">Your Goals in Front Office
      Football</h2><br>In order to succeed in Front Office Football, you need to perform
      as well as possible in four different areas.<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Team Performance.
      On the field, your primary goal is winning the coveted Front Office Bowl. Your
      fans, players and staff all want to see that championship banner raised to a
      new position in the ring of honor surrounding your stadium.<br><br></li><li>Financial
      Performance. Off the field, your team needs to show a profit, or the owner will
      become angry and threaten your job. You need to control salary and staff costs
      while balancing the need to spend money to build and upgrade your stadium against
      the risk of facing stagnant ticket revenue with an aging arena.<br><br></li><li>Roster
      Value. You need to negotiate contracts, sign free agents, make wise decisions
      in the amateur draft and outsmart opposing general managers in trade. Building
      a strong, capable roster means everything in Front Office Football.<br><br></li><li>Franchise
      Value. The bottom line is that a happy owner has a franchise that's the envy
      of professional football. Nothing means more to the owners than seeing their
      franchise on the top of the list of most valuable franchises. You help put your
      team on that list by excelling in the three other categories, but the best general
      managers look for opportunities to move the team in order to find a home town
      with a strong economy that will support your team like none other.</li></ul><h2
      class="bb_tag">Major Features of Front Office Football</h2><br>The game concentrates
      on roster management and career play. There are several key elements emphasized
      in the game design:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A realistic trading module. You
      can't simply take the players you want from other teams.<br><br></li><li>Proper
      aging of players. Players at different positions age differently. Quarterbacks
      need a couple of more years to reach their prime, but their careers last several
      years longer, on average, than running backs.<br><br></li><li>The amateur draft.
      Teams realistically assess their needs, and build through the draft.<br><br></li><li>Statistics.
      All the major stats are tracked and are available at any given time. Career
      and full season-by-season statistics are tracked in 135 different categories,
      including Red Zone and Third Down numbers. You can view and sort statistics
      by team, category and position. It's fast and accurate. Front Office Football
      also tracks and displays 182 different team statistics and league totals.<br><br></li><li>Play
      calling. Designed to allow quick selection of a large library of players, you
      can be the ultimate GM and wrest control of the play-by-play action from your
      coach. You can tailor your in-game strategy to your team's strengths without
      having to build each play from scratch.<br><br></li><li>Free agency. Teams compete
      with you to sign the best free agents. Each player has his own idea of how much
      he wants to stay with his existing team, and how much he wants to play for a
      champion. But money is still at the root of all decisions.<br><br></li><li>Home
      towns. Each player will have a home town from nearly 10,000 American cities.
      When deciding on teams during free agency, players may prefer a team closer
      to home.<br><br></li><li>Depth charts. You set the depth chart at each position
      for your team, and fill out a play preference chart. Front Office Football simulates
      games based on these charts. You can choose different personnel depending on
      your choice of formations.<br><br></li><li>Game plans. The game plan will allow
      you to specify different strategies depending on the score of the game and how
      much time remains. There are literally thousands of choices to make, or you
      can leave everything to your coaching staff.<br><br></li><li>Player ratings.
      Each player is rated for 53 different skills. But you don't have access to the
      raw numbers. Where's the fun in that? You hire a coaching staff, with varied
      strengths and weaknesses. Your coaches tell you how good they think your players
      are - and how good they think your opponents' players are.<br><br></li><li>The
      salary cap. It's an essential tool in keeping parity among professional football
      rosters. You'll have to cut your aging, high-paid veterans just like any ruthless
      general manager worth his weight in negotiations.<br><br></li><li>City profiles.
      Submit a plan to build a new stadium to your voters. If they turn you down,
      you can propose a move to any of 169 cities modeled in the game. Each city is
      rated for several economic criteria, which affects its desire for a new team.<br><br></li><li>Team
      chemistry. Players will perform better or worse in some instances, depending
      on how they feel about players in their group.<br><br></li><li>Dynamic Quarterback
      learning process. As quarterbacks learn more about the game, they will have
      access to more plays during games, allowing the smarter signal-callers to better
      confuse their opponents.<br><br></li><li>Record keeping. All team statistics
      are tracked for a manager's entire career. Team records, including all-time
      performance against every other team, are kept. A game-by-game performance breakdown
      is always available for individual players.<br><br></li><li>Power ratings. You
      can see how your team ranks using Solecismic Software's custom power rankings.
      These ratings are used to set a point spread for each game.<br><br></li><li>Enhanced
      replay value. Every time you start a new career, the core ratings for each player
      are randomly affected. For veterans, the random change will be very small. Established
      stars will always be significant players. For rookies, however, performance
      will vary significantly. This allows for a more challenging game and greater
      replay value.<br><br></li><li>Multi-Player League Support. Choose a commissioner
      to run the games for your league. Your commissioner will simulate the games
      and process every team's instruction set for each stage during the game. Up
      to 32 people can compete in each multi-player league.</li></ul><br>Thanks for
      taking a look at Front Office Football.

    review: "This game seemed right up my lane. I always loved drafts and team building\
      \  more than taking control of a player on the field.\nIt started out seeming\
      \ I would love this. So much potential. potential UNDELIVERED it turns out.\n\
      I roll up my sleeves and spend quite a bit of time working on my team building\
      \ - drafts and FA. My eyes get sore after crunching numbers for my first round\
      \ pick. I hired the best coaches I could with ratings in interviewing, player\
      \ development and young talent.\nTo no avail it seems. \nEvery season my draft\
      \ picks just die before they reach year 4. MY cornerstone LT I was so proud\
      \ to get in the first round to build my team, drops from a 71 future to 39!!!!!\
      \ This is with an interview and low volatility.\nThe LG I draft the next season\
      \ who was a 65? he drops to 42.\nThe next year the CB I draft who is a 72? Over\
      \ 4 seasons as a starter he drops to 50.\nThe 74 OLB I drafted last night who\
      \ was a 74? He comes out of pre season and his Future is now 59.\n\nIs this\
      \ supposed to be fun in anyway? How am I supposed to build a team? I love drafts,\
      \ but I would just be better off going George Allen and trading all my picks\
      \ for veterans.\nExcept it is the same with veterans. the LE I signed that was\
      \ a 71 and only 25 years old - You guessed it immediately died. He spent his\
      \ final season riding the pine and rated 36 while making 11 mil that season.\n\
      It wouldn't be so bad if it balanced out and my 2-4 round guys would have a\
      \ player or 2 that bloomed, but that NEVER happens, except maybe 5 points temporarily.\n\
      The 3rd round QB I drafted last night went from 50 -30 by the end of pre season.\
      \ Yahoo!!! So fun!!!\nOh- and those busted out players who are now 30-45 ish,\
      \ they all hold out their final season asking for HUGE salaries, and if you\
      \ don't pony up 5-13 mil per season on them they won't re-sign with you and\
      \ go to FA where they get 1-4 mil per season.\nIn 2020 I have exactly ONE Very\
      \ Good player on my team, the SS who came on the roster at the start of the\
      \ game.\n\n\nI was thinking of grabbing FOF8, but now I ill be saving my $."
