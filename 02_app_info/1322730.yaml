    about_the_game: "Imagine a standard idle game: you have a building that produces\
      \ resources, and with those resources you buy another building that produces\
      \ more resources, and with those resources, another building, and so on.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nNow imagine there are 9 of those games stacked on top of each\
      \ other in layers and each one has its own set of resources as well as its own\
      \ prestige resource that supports the layer above it. There's also a limited\
      \ set of resources you have to thoughtfully allocate between all of these layers.\
      \ All the while you're aided by Hero, who's crawling through a dungeon full\
      \ of monsters in search of resources to help you build up the Wilderness, the\
      \ Village, the City, and what lies beyond...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures a class\
      \ system, a faction system, an alignment grid, a mission system, quests, collectible\
      \ items and characters, offline progress, achievements, and more, so much more.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nOther notes: this game is primarily idle. There is no clicking\
      \ mechanic. It\u2019s also a long game and some features require days or possibly\
      \ weeks of \u201Cplaying\u201D to unlock."
