I played with a controller (keyboard is the preferred method) and beat it in less than 20 minutes.  \n\nThis is a game very much steered towards kids, and I feel this game would be great for the autistic as well.  Not only are you helping a bird find their way out of scary, dark thoughts, there are also items you pick up that (very loosely) demonstrate ways to cope when you're overwhelmed; You can't use the items in game, but items like them can be used in the real world.\n\nWhere I feel this game fails is in the use of fire to get through the darkness.  Don't get me wrong, fire is a great way to see through the darkness and get around, but when the fairy tells you to 'burn it all' alongside coping mechanisms to get out of fearful situations, I feel the over all message of the game can be skewed in a wrong kind of bad way.  On that note, if you're a parent and looking for games your kid can play, I recommend playing it first or looking up videos before committing.","timestamp_created":1577920189,"timestamp_updated":1577920295,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hZ7Yse8Cc7uI6QE="}
