Just noticed this while reinstalling some games, pretty sure is doomed to remain ripware forever. DO NOT BUY.\n\nUpdate 3: Remembered this game from over a year ago for some reason, checked back, still no word from dev, absolutely avoid.\n\nUpdate 2: Still no updates and no word of whether this will be updated, would  recommend as a pass at this point.\n\nUpdate 1: Lack of updates makes this less of a must-buy, as the one obvious game-breaking bug is still not addressed. Still find it fun, but not playable beyond NG.\n\n[strike]Fun twin stick shooter that is entertaining, if yet incomplete. The controls are pretty tight, and the initial slow movement of the characters is offset by some of the items' effects. I'd say \"think of this as a stripped-down and still in early development Nuclear Throne,\" but they seem to fill different niches, at least to me.\n\nThere are some ui and graphical issues, like the lightning effects not leaving the screen in some cases, or the player character and some static objects changing size (very minimally, perhaps because of how they are rendered?) when moving the cursor while standing still or moving slowly. The main menu and in-game pause menu need to be worked over (as the dev has said he plans to do in the next update).\n\nOverall, I feel it's definitely worth the money (whether full price or on sale) to pick this up.[/strike]","timestamp_created":1449101085,"timestamp_updated":1517387208,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.611833691596984863","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw1OrUpeECc7CYSg=="}
