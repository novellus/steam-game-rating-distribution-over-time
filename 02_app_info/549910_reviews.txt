Buggy. \n\nThe atmosphere seems promising, but altogether it is really hard to figure out what you're supposed to do in this game. I didn't get very far because this game is missing the standard journal system that helps to keep you on track of what you should be trying to accomplish. \n\nI've said this before and I'll say it again: Simply telling me to get out of a building isn't enough. There was a cell phone that would give hints, but I felt like it would have been unnecessary with better writing. And the hints aren't always very good. \n\nYou'll find an item and think, 'What now? What's this for?' And it remains a mystery until you've clicked every item in the office trying to figure out where it goes. Oh joy. That's ok, I give up haha. \n\nI'd recommend giving this one a miss, friends.
