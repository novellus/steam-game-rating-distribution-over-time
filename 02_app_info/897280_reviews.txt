I've tried multiple ways of installing, uninstalling, reinstalling, etc. Every time I attempt to start the game, I'm met with a black screen and stuck loading bar, or the game crashes and opens the first game, with no changes (I've played through it about 8 different times and still no 'DLC' content).\n\nIt's sad, because I was rooting for \"The Entity\" to be a hidden gem. My willingness to look past its many flaws was contingent on the DLC adding more playable substance to the game (and what I would have presumed to be more refined).","timestamp_created":1601534597,"timestamp_updated":1601534597,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+NK58fQCeOSTpQI="}
