    review: 'Game is complete trash ! The developer decided he cares more about money
      then his player community so pay to win items were added to the shop(Area teleporting,
      Damage blocking items, Enemy movement control and monster spawners). But that''s
      not the worst of it. Weeks ago every player could view cash prices( I''ve checked
      myself) Now i just started the game to find that the games cash shop has been
      restricted to level 100+ players only ! How the fuk is a new player who can
      afford to spend a little bit of money supposed to play this game, When you have
      high levels harassing low levels.


      If you wanted your game to resemble a piece of turd, You''ve out done yourself
      !'
