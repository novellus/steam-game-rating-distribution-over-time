I like to start with the good news first, so here are some of the things that I absolutely love about this installment over and above the previous games...\n\nTactical deployment: In combat, you can choose WHEN to deploy ships, and where to direct them to AS YOU ARE DEPLOYING THEM. This adds a whole new layer of tactical depth to combat, for those who choose to make use of it.\n\nRegularly scheduled ship and hull upgrades: The fact that Hope Station will regularly provide upgrades for you to buy for your ship hull and new weapons/systems for you to purchase means that even if RNJesus hates you (and boy, does he hate me), you can still make at least a pretense of having a decent loadout for your main ship.\n\nGreater variety of quests, and more frequent quest triggers: I have not played many games so far, but already I have noticed that I receive a wider variety of special missions than in the prior installments in the series, and receive the ones that are carry-overs from prior installments much more often. For example, I have already seen the Yellow Kawangi twice, when in all of the hundreds of games I played between Infinite Space and Weird Worlds, I never encountered them at all; I had to discover they were carry-overs here. I have received a copy of the Horloge of Primordius in nearly every game, when I have only encountered it 11 times in the past (and only once in a Universe where I had access to all of the other pieces reasonably needed to complete the quest, such as the anti-graviton shunt).\n\nAdditional/expanded content: The addition of the Calatians (did I get that right?) as a fully fleshed out race, as well as all the new ship systems, etc, are great.\n\nInformation availability: The inclusion of statistics for weapons and ships that are comparable helps when judging the relative value of weaponry and ship systems; in the past, the only method of gauging the relative value of anything was it's trade value and experimentation... which has it's own charm, but this is one of the few ways in which this game is more approachable than it's predecessors.\n\nHere are some of the things that I have... let's say, less enthusiastic feelings about...\n\nThe 3D Map: There is an entire thread on this forum created specifically to complain about this feature, and while I like it aesthetically, and appreciate the fact that it makes navigation more tactical (nebulae are a lot less of a problem if you are smart about your flight paths), it makes navigation feel like a really cluttered, less streamlined decision. This one change has made it so that I can no longer just play a game at work on my lunch break; half an hour not only isn't long enough to play a good game anymore, it's not enough to visit each star system once, even if I ignore grabbing stuff and combat along the way and just try to speed-run it.\n\nThe new combat system: This is a really mixed bag. The optional deployment feature? AMAZEBALLS. And it means that I can do stuff that is more thematically appropriate too, like using fighters such as good ol' Ripcord to scout out unknown encounters, because he will be the fastest to get away if it's an encounter with hostiles that I can't win with my fleet. The ability to \"drag\" ship paths, including turns, etc? Great, loving it. But there are times when a ship just doesn't seem to want to follow the path I am ACTUALLY drawing with my mouse, and instead, starts doing this weird jig on it's own whim. Cost me my capital ship on more than one occasion. And automating the fighters? Cool idea... if I could turn it off (can you? If so, someone please tell me how).\n\nHere are the things that I really, really disliked...\n\nUI/Controls: This all feels very non-intuitive to me. In fact, my very first game, no lie, I quit the game because I had opened the \"status window\" for a ship system and then literally could NOT figure out how to close it, and it made playing the rest of the game actually impossible (turns out it's a right-click on the mouse to close it, but nobody told me that). Whereas prior entries had a simple UI and controls that felt fluid and intuitive, such that your average child could pick up the game and figure out the basics in minutes, this one made me feel like it needs a manual, even for adults. So I gave the tutorial game a shot. It would have helped some if I had started here, but not nearly as much as I feel would have been needed. These issues impact SO MUCH of the game that while I am likely to continue enjoying this game, I am likely to clock up many more hours in WW:R2IS even now that I have this new novelty to explore.\n\nOverall, I think this is a good game, that could have been a great game. Still, it's Digital Eel... even when they don't knock it out of the park, I trust them to deliver me a largely positive experience, and Sea of Stars was no exception. And it definitely breaks new ground for the series, so at least they can't be accused of pumping out \"one more of the same\". I've already gotten more enjoyment out of the game than the monetary value of what I had to pay for it, so I don't feel cheated at all; I just think that some of the design decisions could have been reworked to turn this solid title into a true masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1609379863,"timestamp_updated":1609379863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nfug2/YCeej7vgI="}
