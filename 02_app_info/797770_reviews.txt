Would have been better if his outfit were more like Eren's, but I'll take all the Armin fanservice I can get. Also would have been better if I were able to just buy the Armin one. The blue and yellow goes nicely with Armin's eyes and hair, and the patterns on the jacket look like waves for a nice ocean motif. Very aesthetically pleasing. Also, you can look up his skirt thing. Overall a very good use of $8.99.","timestamp_created":1532583379,"timestamp_updated":1532583379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546087980270385742","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g9DF6uQCf+7ypgE="}
