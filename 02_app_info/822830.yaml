    review: 'I''m actually conflicted about this game. I really enjoyed the story
      and the cycle mechanic, [b]BUT[/b] the sex scenes are really unnecessary and
      cringy. There is even a rape scene just for the lols.


      If I stopped playing for a couple of days I totally forgot what I was doing
      and there''s no way to get a clue; fortunately, I was following a tutorial that
      saved me some headaches.


      Also, if you want to actually [u]see[/u] the sex scenes, you must download and
      install a patch from the creator.


      (oh! and you can only play it on windowed mode and it doesn''t even cover the
      full screen)'
