Looks nice on a large TV. Some challenges are difficult, but you can solve them with some patience. Interesting mix of 3D open world and \"platform-ish\" game play. Lots of potential for developing the story in the future with more levels and content. Looking forward to that. It took me about 3 hours to get though the game. Thank you to the developer :)","timestamp_created":1602220479,"timestamp_updated":1602220479,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oYryhfUCcerfpgI="}
