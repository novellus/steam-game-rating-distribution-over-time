      \ playing our game! I'll tell you as much as I can. So we're actually not the\
      \ full game. We're the demo! No one knows if the real game is out yet or not,\
      \ or what genre we're really supposed to be....it's kind of confusing. But that's\
      \ just fine, I guess! Anyway, I suppose it's already been determined where you'll\
      \ be going and what kinds of things you might be doing? I hope I get to actually\
      \ meet you later. I've really been looking forward to it! Have a nice day!<br><img\

      \ have the advantage of knowing who, how, why, and what we truly are! Well,\
      \ uh...mostly. That's where you come in! You can be the one to tell us once\
      \ and for all what we're really doing here! And with the help of your good buddy\

      \ I am the Creator. I created this Visual Novel's script, code, and music.<br><br>The\
      \ game runs in the RenPy engine and is formatted as a visual novel. Occasionally\
      \ you will choose what to say by selecting a dialogue box. There are multiple\

      \ recommended that players are at least 12 years or older. The game contains\
      \ strong language and the occasional discussion of heavy topics. There is no\
      \ shock imagery or jump scares.<br><br>The complete soundtrack is also available.\
      \ It contains a little over an hour of music.<br>Thank you to SparkBag, Keeby,\
