    review: "Stimmungsvolles Game mit angenehmen Mechaniken und n i c h t nervender\
      \ Musik. Deutsche Storyuntertitel und mit coolem, englischen Geschichtenerz\xE4\
      hler. Und ja, wir bauen den Widerstand auf gegen den b\xF6sen Sheriff von Nottingham.\
      \ Ich w\xFCnsche dem Game viel Aufmerksamkeit, auch von anderen Gamern."
