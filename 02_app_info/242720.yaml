      \ as Publisher. RIP Community.\nGo buy freeware private server OG GunZ if you\
      \ want to play.\nGunz 2 was fun until i could somewhat solo the endboss. Uninstall\
      \ afterwards. Nothing you can do anymore.\nRIP[/i]\n\n[b]Now:[/b]\n\nI do not\
      \ understand why i voted so harsh on this. \nThis game has awesome graphics\
      \ and very little actual glitches, the devs really made their part in giving\
      \ people the feeling of having the control without using things that feel like\
      \ complete game breaking glitches.\nThe K-Style skills gained in Gunz 1 is of\
      \ course worth nothing in this. Only the effort in learning it - something completely\
      \ new - is.\nGunz 2 has its own ways of competition, especially the hero selection\
      \  is very small and fits nicely into whatever feeling of a world Gunz 1 has\
      \ left behind. Of course all the K-Stylers of Gunz 1 feel intimidated if all\
      \ their skill is reset to 0 with completely new features. \nThis is like comparing\
      \ starcraft 1 to starcraft 2. Theres nothing to compare except for the looks\
      \ and the noises and sounds. Completely different games each with their own\
      \ ways of competition.\n\nIts 2019 and i still think the graphics of this game\
      \ are pretty nice. Expecially if you consider all the indie devs having a low\
      \ poly appearance in pretty much every single case.\n\n[i]\"Host system\"[/i]?\
      \ Yes indeed RIP multiplayer, but the fact that the devs thought about giving\
      \ the game the possibility to never die out just because there is no dependancy\
      \ for servers any longer makes this game one of the better LAN party esport\
      \ games. Period. \nHow do you wanna call your friends to play a game if the\
      \ servers are down because you flamed the devs for decisions they HAD to make?\
      \ Right. not at all, officially.\n\nHonestly Pro7 games is something i still\
      \ consider a crapload of trashgames pushed into the masses. But gunz 2 is far\
      \ away from that and we, the gunz 1 from back then gotta feel honored that they\
      \ actually managed to push such an esport heavy title to such a broad audience.\
      \ \n\n[i]Is it dead?[/i] Yes. \nYou gotta find people via external forums and\
      \ wait days for them to be ready to actually be able to play a game as a duo.\n\
      \n[i]\"Go buy freeware private server OG GunZ\"[/i] ?\nAs i said: This is the\
      \ honorable release after Gunz 1 was shut down. If the community wasn't full\
      \ of intimidated kids like me back then, the game probably would have made it\
      \ into esport like we actually wanted it to ever since we learned that damn\
      \ realod shot and half steps. \nNow we gotta start all over again. From scratch.\n\
      And im sorry for it."
