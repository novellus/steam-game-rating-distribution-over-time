The manipulations become very quickly tedious, and it's difficult to spend more than a few minutes on a puzzle.  If you realy like solving difficult ones, then only then will you want to keep coming back to it.\n\nPlus as soon as I saw the unity logo, I knew this would be unoptimized 3D levels thrown together. I really wish the Unity people gave their customers some pointers about 3D optimization rather than letting them believe they can just throw anything in the level without any care. This is not how videogames are created, never have been.\nOf course the dev here is using chromatic distortion and all the useless stuff he could find in the Unity toolbox. There are a million tiny particles floating pointlessly in the background and no option to customize anything or even change the resolution. Well done.\nOnce again, unity becomes synonymous for bad game.","timestamp_created":1603642516,"timestamp_updated":1603642607,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.457589268684387207","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42YijsPUCdOiJqgI="}
