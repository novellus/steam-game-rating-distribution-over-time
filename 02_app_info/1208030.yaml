    review: This game is a very simple and intuitive introduction to Japanese.  I
      wish there were more words included, but most of the words for basic concepts
      that will help you get around (modes of transportation, spatial positions, numbers,
      colors...) are included.  Definitely worth the price if you're planning a trip
      to Japan and are interested in learning a few of the basics first.
