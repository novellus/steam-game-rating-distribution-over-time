Thanks devs!\n-----------------------\n\nClassic game from XBLA. Still fun like the old days, however some things need to be addressed:\n\n-Digging while using the grappling hook needs to come back. \n-Rebinding the controls to WASD doesn't also change the menu controls to WASD. Switching from WASD to the arrow keys to navigate the menus is a little annoying.\n\nIt seems like the dev(s?) has been reading these reviews and updating the game, so I hope these changes are implemented! Really happy this game has returned!","timestamp_created":1607885256,"timestamp_updated":1610158015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1607930843,"developer_response":"Great to hear that you're enjoying the game, and thanks for the feedback!
