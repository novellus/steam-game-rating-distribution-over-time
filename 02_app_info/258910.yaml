    review: Was just trying to find a quirky RPG game that felt like Earthbound. Very
      happy purchase :) Haven't really found time to game in recent years but this
      was a good way to get me going again. Missed playing Suikoden 2 so the recruitment
      and quests here just feel so warm again.
