    about_the_game: In this Lovecraft-Inspired short, Katie (Adriene Mishler) takes
      her brother John (Brock England) to the site of an accident he's just had in
      his car. The only thing they find there is a strange amulet. When she tries
      to call John the next day, his number has been disconnected. But when she investigates
      his disappearance, her life takes a turn for the worse. Much worse. Maybe when
      you hit someone with your car in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere,
      it's best to call an ambulance.<br><br><strong>Directed by:</strong> Jason Neulander<br><strong>Produced

    review: 'What if someone stumbled upon a mystery, but they refused to investigate?
      Not much of interest, as this movie tediously shows.

      The ideas are nudged your way but never fleshed out. You never get the satisfaction
      of getting any more insight. It''s just concentraited weirdness that hints on
      something being fundamentally amiss with out naive understanding of the fabric
      of reality, but never goes to explain how eldritch horrors relate to it.

      The protagonist just... doesn''t care enough. One would think that with a life
      so seemingly empty, she''d jump at the first opportunity to sate curiosity and
      embark on an adventure, but she never does. Unless her hand is forced by immediate
      causes in her environment, stuff doesn''t really bother her to stay awake at
      night or... do much of anything.

      I guess many such anticlimactic stories "happen" to unsuspecting denizens of
      fiction; it''s just that content creators don''t usually "report" back to us
      on these.

      I barely got my money''s worth out of getting this... I bought it for $0.56
      :|.

      On a positive note - I enjoyed the toast scene. It had no real impact on the
      story, but there was something satisfying about watching (and listening to!)
      the protagonist handle toast in a very brighly lit, immaculate kitchen.

      If you''ve ever shouted "No, don''t go there!", "No, just ignore that!", "No,
      turn around and just leave!" at overly inquisitive horror characters, this is
      the movie for you.'
