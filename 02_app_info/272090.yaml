    review: 'These things should have been in the main game.

      But they decided to put them in a paid dlc instead.

      I don''t recommend buying these. It''s not worth it.

      This game has seven dlc''s and all of them are bad.

      I wanted to support the developer, so I bought it.

      But I can''t give those dlc''s a positive review. Nope.

      Buy them only if you want to support the developer.'
