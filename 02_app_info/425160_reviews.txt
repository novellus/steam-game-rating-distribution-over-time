The stages that are spread out on several screens that you access by going through doors are... less fun. They get very convoluted and the whole puzzle is about figuring out which key to pick up and which door to go through in which order. Pick up the wrong key or hit the wrong switch and you start over. And over. And over until you figure out the sequence it wants.\n\nOr, there is a tricky, time-consuming puzzle on screen 1, then you go through a door and there is another tricky, time-consuming puzzle, then a third. Die on any screen and start the whole stage over.\n\nI finally lost patience on stage 4-10. Only 5 stages left to go and I doubt I will ever finish it. It just quit being fun for me.\n\nUp until then, it was fun and worth the $5. I got close to my benchmark $1 per hour of fun out of it, so it's a recommend.\n","timestamp_created":1541329486,"timestamp_updated":1541329486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi7CZ7+YCeqCDrgE="}
