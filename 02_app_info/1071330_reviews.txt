They've also introduced a bizarre set of voices that will speak nonsense upon setting a jigsaw piece in its proper position.  I recommend muting that immediately.\n\nThe art is beautiful, the women are sexy, and the 96 achievements are easy to get.  The minimum you need to do to get all achievements is complete all puzzles with 96 pieces, timer enabled and the reference image disabled.  I completed one puzzle with 384 pieces, and it's a slog.\n\nDark Fantasy 2 is much better than the sequel, Dark Fantasy: Epic Jigsaw Puzzle, which is very frustrating to play.  Dark Fantasy 2 has art with detailed, non-uniform backgrounds that makes them a pleasure both to view and to solve.","timestamp_created":1609010993,"timestamp_updated":1609010993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49uqh0PYCfN6+vQI="}
