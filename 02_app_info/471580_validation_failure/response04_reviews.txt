I've made better videos using other applications than my last few on here, but I am still learning...(I guess, trying to be nice about this). \n\nI would definately go with a different application unless you know what features you are specifically trying to get from this program that you can't from another.  It also crashed on me a few times, where other applications work just fine. \n\nEnd game: Too expensive but adequate if you are constantly making vids.   I do not agree with the price one bit. Another reason for me not recommending this is because they have new software coming out...or already out.   Powerdirector 15.  Also about  a$200 bundle.  ....  Seriously though, check out other applications, use powerdirector and be disappointed as a last resort.\n\nUpdate: I am using one of the older versions of the adobe premiere and finding it more convenient for my outdated computers.  I think i paid like 20$ for it (and not $200) and it works perfectly fine.  For the edits i do, the adobe does everything that i did on Power director.  BUT power director 15 does have 360 features from what i saw on youtube.\n\nUpdate at 1196 hours:  I have a really freakin expensive computer now that handles well on most applications.  But this one still crashes.      I use it alot to edit minor stuff. :p  however, I definately havent been on this for 1196 hours XD but if it says so, sure.","timestamp_created":1475462593,"timestamp_updated":1585988474,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561713039875030518","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyfKRovECd73FYg=="}
