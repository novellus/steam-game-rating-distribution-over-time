Most of the puzzles have time trials and all puzzles have a move maximum as challenges (but you don't lose the level if you fail to make those).  This bumps Mahjong towards a Candy Crush Saga style.  Best for people who like \"puzzle of the day\", \"need to quit smoking\", or \"having a 10-minute break\".  I would not recommend for relaxation.","timestamp_created":1592804356,"timestamp_updated":1603495071,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40aHwq/UCft+6jwI="}
