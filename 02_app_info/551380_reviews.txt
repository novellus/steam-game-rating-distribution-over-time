The game was developed by Eipix Entertainment and published by Big Fish Games Studio.\n\n\"The Last Adagio\" is the first episode of \"Danse Macabre.\"\n\nSince this is a collector's edition, it comes with extra features that are not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are four different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual; Expert; Insane and Custom.\n\nThere is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates that there are tasks that can be completed at certain locations. The interactive map is automatically given at the start of the game.\n\nThere is a padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place to make it stationary.\n\nThere are interactive items in the game. Some of these interactive items may require extra components before they can be interacted with. All interactive items are marked with a symbol in one of the corners.\n\nThe hidden object scenes consist of the following: Traditional word lists; Shadow items; Find 'x' amount items. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interactions. Most of the hidden object scenes can be replayed in the game's extra feature section.\n\nBubble Popper is an optional mini game that is only available during hidden object scenes.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of the themes. Most of the puzzles can be replayed in the game's extra feature section.\n\nThere is a collectible in the game: Flower. They are scattered throughout the game for the player to find.\n\nThere are beyond objects (morphing objects.) They are scattered throughout the game for the player to find as well.\n\nThere is a bonus chapter in the game. But it can be accessed only after the main story is completed.\n\nThere are eighteen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game only.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThere are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Bonus Hidden Object Scenes; Bonus Puzzles; Soundtracks; Wallpapers; Concept Art; Souvenir Room and Game's Strategy Guide. Most of these extra features can be accessed only after the entire game is completed.\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend the game but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1547091943,"timestamp_updated":1600537969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549424469470977783","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lujf0/QCetj3twE="}
