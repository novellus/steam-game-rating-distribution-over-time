    review: "Bought on sale. Also bought their other game, which was a mess. You see\
      \ the stuff in the trailer? That happens sometimes. See the reloading? There's\
      \ no reason to move your hand like that, it just reloads like a pump shotgun.\
      \ You get 11 rounds and there are no other apparent weapons, but some upgrades,\
      \ and two missiles which I never found ammo for anyway. All the enemies are\
      \ the same except some have a shield and some have an axe. There seem to be\
      \ some hazards as well, but they are trivial. The armswinging is done poorly\
      \ and there is no option to change the direction of movement (I would rather\
      \ move where I'm looking that in a controller direction, since I can't shoot\
      \ backwards). \n\nThis game is a scam at this price. At $2 it was a scam too.\
      \ At least I can be the one review for it so no one will buy it. Please don't\
      \ buy things from this developer until they stop releasing shovelware and actually\
      \ try."
