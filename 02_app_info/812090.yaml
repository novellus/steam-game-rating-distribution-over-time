    review: "In Raw Footage, you play a suicidal eejit who's perfectly willing to\
      \ be disembowelled by a brutish beastie in the name of becoming a YouTube celebrity.\
      \ Armed only with your trusty vidja camera, you plunge into some mysterious\
      \ backwoods in an alternate dimension where it takes mere minutes to pass through\
      \ all the lighting cycles of a day and night, in search of the creature and\
      \ the corpses it has discarded in its wake.\n\n   Unfortunately, as anyone who's\
      \ ever wasted tens of hours of their life sifting through YouTube videos looking\
      \ for convincing evidence of strange phenomena knows, this is an era in which\
      \ every duckhead and his dog can fake such footage with cheap CGI and/or shoddy\
      \ make-up effects, invariably aided by a shaky camera and dubiously dodgy focus.\
      \ So in order to present irrefutable proof of the monster's existence, you must\
      \ attain [i]minutes[/i] of footage of it charging towards you before anyone\
      \ will believe you. \n\n   Cheap criticisms of the \"plot\" aside, it's actually\
      \ a pretty decent premise for a game, and there's no denying how suspenseful\
      \ it is when you first jump in. For myself at least, it was quite some time\
      \ before I encountered the creature - first as a sound, then spotted only from\
      \ a distance - at which point it sensed me filming it and promptly gave chase.\
      \ I valiantly maintained my cool and kept backing up and filming until it almost\
      \ reached me, then wisely turned tail and fled and somehow lost it. I then hit\
      \ \"TAB\" to check how much footage I had grabbed...and was flabbergasted to\
      \ find that I had, like, less than 10% of the footage required to beat the level.\
      \ \n\n   Undaunted, I resumed looking for Mr Monster, and when I couldn't find\
      \ him, decided to try whistling multiple times to attract his attention. He\
      \ didn't bite (literally or figuratively). I eventually just stumbled onto him\
      \ again - he appearing out of absolutely nowhere and without a sound this time\
      \ - and I had by this stage decided to try and \"stun\" him with bullets from\
      \ the gun I'd found, as instructed by the game's early tutorial. Seems I may\
      \ have shot him [i]too[/i] many times, though, 'cause while he did keel over\
      \ momentarily, he also decided to launch up into the air and hide himself before\
      \ I could pull out my camera and get even a single second of further footage.\
      \ Back to the drawing board.\n\n   Third time, I decided to stand on a small\
      \ island in the centre of a shallow pond, thinking maybe this was a tactically\
      \ smart move: perhaps the monster didn't like water or something. Nope. Following\
      \ my firing of a single bullet to attract his attention, he charged unerringly\
      \ at me once more and managed to wound me rather badly. I did manage to get\
      \ away and mostly heal myself with a medkit I'd found - and even managed to\
      \ successfully lure him another time and get a smidgen more footage - but it\
      \ wasn't long after [i]that[/i] that he found me unawares again and unceremoniously\
      \ snuffed my silly butt. Game over, no save or anything. But hey: at least I\
      \ got six out of eight Achievements and found all five out of five dead bodies,\
      \ even if I didn't grab as much as 20% of the required footage. \n\n   Look,\
      \ I appreciate that this game needed to make itself at least slightly challenging;\
      \ and given that it only has three maps, and the one that I played wasn't all\
      \ that large, I guess the devs didn't have much choice but to make the amount\
      \ of footage required insufferably high. But honestly, after less than an hour's\
      \ play, I feel like I've seen most of what the game has to offer, and can't\
      \ say I feel compelled to see even this map - much less the others, one of which\
      \ appears to require [i]twice[/i] as much footage (!) - through to the bitter\
      \ end.\n\n   If you, on the other hand, are the kind of person who loves the\
      \ challenge of rinse-repeat-rinse-repeat/don't-feck-up-once-or-it's-back-to-the-beginning\
      \ gameplay, then I can most certainly recommend this game, though possibly not\
      \ at the full retail price of ten bucks USD. It's certainly not bad as recent\
      \ indie horror games go, and will probably appeal to those with time and patience\
      \ to burn. Me? I tend to lose interest in a game as soon as I: a. expect no\
      \ further surprises from it, and b. deduce that I probably won't conquer it\
      \ any time soon anyway. Like I said: six out of eight \"cheevos\" ain't bad,\
      \ and I can probably guess what the other two are for, but don't much feel like\
      \ spending several more hours of my life attaining them.\n\n   I certainly won't\
      \ diss the developers for what is, all things considered, a pretty decent first\
      \ release. I'm interested to see what they do next, and y'know...maybe I'll\
      \ even return to this particular product at some point when I'm feeling more\
      \ Saintly in the patience department. For now, though, my curiosity has been\
      \ sated.\n\n   Verdict: 7/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to\
