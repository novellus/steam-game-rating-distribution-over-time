I understand this is an old game and i'm probably one of few that just bought this game. I have known about formula truck as i have seen it in a few YouTube videos. I just typed it in on steam and saw it was only $9.99 so i bought it. It's a very fun game i got my G27 wheel working right away and i'm obviously still getting used to the game and what everything does, as i've never played a racing sim like this. I recommend this game but just a little tip to anyone that wants to buy this now. I've been playing racing sims for awhile and you have to be patient with the game. The trucks and tracks that are in the game is nothing like in Iracing or RaceRoom or any other game. You're driving a huge Volvo cab-over and they don't handle like the all-wheel drive cars that are all pepped up in the other racing games. Anyway I really like this game already it is pretty hilarious flying around a track in a Semi-Truck.","timestamp_created":1608437431,"timestamp_updated":1608437431,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4re+Vv/YCcI7OuwI="}
