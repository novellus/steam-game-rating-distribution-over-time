    review: If this were a demo on Kickstarter I would back it - it's a great concept
      for a game - but it's just not there yet. Placeholder sound effects voiced by
      the developer (yes, including the animal noises and the rotating bzzz bzzz of
      a security camera). Hitboxes that clearly don't line up with the animals. The
      "genocide" missions are so much harder than all the others that it can't be
      deliberate. A main menu screen that's really hard to navigate. Animal characters
      with so few polygons you can't recognise them from the portraits until you've
      played a few levels. And instant-lose conditions (such as a wolf eating a squirrel,
      when you're trying to kill all the raccoons) that you don't even see happen.
      This could be a great game when it's had a bit of polish and tuning, but right
      now it's so unfinished it's more annoying than fun.
