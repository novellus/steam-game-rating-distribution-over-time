This game deserves more attention. It's easy to play but  hard to master and has many different ways to play. If you like strategy, RPG, rouge-like or card battler games than this is something you should at the very least try.","timestamp_created":1607939735,"timestamp_updated":1607939735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43aersPYCd7+KugI="}
