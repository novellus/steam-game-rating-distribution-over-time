With almost 1,5d still to go I reached Triumph score already but the scenario dragged on with zero enemy activity for the rest of the game and I just finished it using maximum playing speed for most of the remaining time (waiting for something to happen, or for scenario conlusion), did a few extra inland strikes once my aircraft were rearmed every few hours (lost a few aircraft along the way due to SAMs, but that didn't affect Triumph score at that point).\nIf steam allowed more granular scores I'd give it 5/10. I'm recommending it on a basis that 1 - it had a few twists that kept me on my toes for a while, 2 - it's cheap, I love CMO and LIVE and want to support the devs;  overall this scenario was too easy and too long.","timestamp_created":1605033133,"timestamp_updated":1605033133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vMDb2fUCcNHMrQI="}
