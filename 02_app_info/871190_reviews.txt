The heights, the ridiculous leaps of fate you need to take, the predicament you find your fellow hatchlings in along the way.\n\nThe game isn't without faults of course, the lower levels of the structure have a severe lack in variety when it comes to textures making you think for half the game that it'll all just be brickwork. You can't look up the controls in-game so I thought you had to spend a bunch of time falling to your death when it turns out there's a button to reset to checkpoint (which you can read here on the storepage.) The checkpoints seem to be somewhat haphazardly doled out, in some spots there are several very close together while in other parts they are frustratingly few and far between.\n\nBut overall I really liked the game. There's something pretty satisfying about a game that has no shooting, no gathering, no points to increase. You just travel, but the travel isn't just walking.","timestamp_created":1604312041,"timestamp_updated":1604312041,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44uCcxPUCd/LhqwI="}
