    about_the_game: <i>She Remembered Caterpillars</i> is a fungipunk fantasy about
      love, loss, and holding on, told in the format of a color-based puzzle game.
      A tale as the bond between parent and child, this lush and bewildering title
      will have players testing their wits against a variety of challenges, some devious,
      and others outright nefarious, but all beautiful and very, very strange.<br><br>This
      is the demo version. It features 8 levels from the first two worlds of the full
      release. The game is still in development. It has been tested on a few systems
      but we can not guarantee it will not crash or do other weird things. Please
      help us out and report any bugs and glitches in the community forum. Thanks
      a lot in advance!<br><br>David and Daniel

    reviews: "\u201CThe formula was simple enough, but it ramped up in difficulty\
      \ very quickly. There was a real skill to getting your head around what colours\

      Definitely one to watch, very enjoyable if you like a good puzzle, a beautiful\
