    about_the_game: '&quot;The Museum Relic&quot; is a story driven campaign that
      takes place between the two small fictional countries of Matova and Obristen.
      As their war stretches on into its fifth year, both nations are feeling the
      strain of not being able to replenish any of their lost vehicles. You will fly
      as a character who, at the beginning of the war, was just a civilian. But after
      seeing the dire situation his country is facing, decides to enlist in the Matova
      Army Air Corp. With his enlistment papers, he also brings with him his personal
      aircraft which he had donated to the Museum years ago.<br><br><u>Please note
      that this campaign and all future DCS World DLC releases on Steam, will now
      use Steam Keys instead of Starforce keys. As such, these purchases cannot be
      activated on the DCS World e-Shop version. Previous purchases will not be affected.</u><br><br><strong><i>The
      DCS: MiG-15bis or DCS: F-86F Sabre are required to be installed and activated
      into the DCS World 1.5 for the campaign.</i></strong>'

    review: "Only a few missions in so far, but having fun. I got the Sabre due to\
      \ not having been into flight sims in years and this campaign to go with it,\
      \ lots of fun, well put together, sensible missions. Bought something simple.\
      \ So glad I did. Also turned on random hardware failures, wish I hadn\u2019\
      t. I completed my mission but had to land without a landing gear and speed brakes\
      \ on. Turn that feature off if your just getting into the game, unless you\u2019\
      re experienced in your piloting skills."
