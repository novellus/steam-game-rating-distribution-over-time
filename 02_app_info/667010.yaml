    review: While I really REALLY like this game, Ive discovered a glaring issue...
      There is a melee to start zombie. And if you are like me you find that the zombie
      is outside the play area. Resulting in you not being able to start ANYTHING!
      When you first start the game you shoot the zombie, it dies and you start killing.
      But once this melee to start zombie appears you can't do anything, it doesn't
      go away. So for the time being be aware this one thing can break the game for
      you. Don't want to but have to refund the game I can't even play any more
