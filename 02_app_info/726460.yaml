    review: "Not happy with this one.\n\nUsually I enjoy these games but the pacing\
      \ and choices are all over the damn place. Minor characters do not get fleshed\
      \ out enough, killed off comically fast over one bad choice or NOT EVEN MATTER\
      \ with some choices.\n\nThere isn't even a chapter dedicated to learning how\
      \ to command a ship and manage your crew or get used to the many minor characters\
      \ that you need to rely on later. \n\nThe Honourable Rival chapter is especially\
      \ poor with choices without any suggestion that one choice which logically you\
      \ would assume would continue a character thread ending your career is a neck\
      \ snapping rapid game over."
