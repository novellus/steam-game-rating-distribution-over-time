    review: "Arc Wizards is an old style, side scrolling, shoot-em-up game.  The gameplay\
      \ is good, but a lack of storyline hurts it.\n\nSTORY:\nThere isn't a plot.\
      \  You play a female wizard.  You kill monsters.  That's it.  There's no explanation\
      \ as to why you're fighting baddies.  Even when the game ends, there is no,\
      \ \"Congratulations!  You saved our land!  Thank you, girl wizard!\"\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\
      You walk forward and kill monsters.  You'll eventually fight bosses.  Beat the\
      \ boss and go to the next stage.  You have a staff that shoots unlimited fireballs.\
      \  You can collect stars to make your weapon more powerful.  Getting hit will\
      \ make it lose power.  And you'll find capsules to replenish health.\n\nPROS:\n\
      Arc Wizards is a fairly easy game to play.  You can get through it in about\
      \ 40 minutes.  This is good, if you want a simple game to pass the time for\
      \ awhile.  Playing with a controller is great!\n\nCONS:\nI've already mentioned\
      \ the lack of story.  Losing staff power after being hit will make the game\
      \ more challenging till you find more stars.  The worse thing is no pause button.\
      \  If there are no enemies on screen, you can stand still and not be attacked.\
      \  But I would feel safer to push a button and see everything froze.\n\nOVERALL:\n\
      I'm giving Arc Wizards a thumbs up recommendation.  It's a great game to spend\
      \ an hour playing and beating.  If you prefer games with a lot more depth, Arc\
      \ Wizards is not for you. \n\nSPECIAL NOTE\nI tried Arc Wizards before.  I gave\
      \ the game a bad review because of a bug that messed up the gameplay.  I would\
      \ like to thank the developers for fixing this problem, and making Arc Wizards\
      \ worth playing."
