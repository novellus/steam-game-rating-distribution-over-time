    review: 'I played this game after finishing two other WoD games currently available
      on Steam (from Vampire series - Shadows and Coteries) and I can''t skip this
      fact as it possibly influences my view. Werewolf: HotF will be the first and
      possibly the only one of them that I will try again. Another thing is that I
      was great fan of pen&paper WoD although I never touched Werewolf. It somehow
      didn''t suit me. Then this cRPG was even nicer surprise.

      There is character sheet that resembles pen&paper gaming which is good because
      long-term character development might be observed.

      Story is interesting and well written. I didn''t loose focus on the text even
      once. Game is quite short but I doubt it took me only 3 hours as it feels like
      I spent much more time on it.

      Choices seem to matter and actually quite a lot. What I didn''t like though
      is the fact that numeric effect of choice is immediately visible. I admit that
      I often played strategically focusing on increasing or decreasing stats. It
      would be nice to have option to completely hide effect from the choice text
      or make it blurred/fuzzy logic.

      Graphics are artistically interesting and good illustration of the story.

      Sound and music are very well composed with the story, changes in the mood etc.
      It does not overwhelm but nicely fits with overall experience.

      I keep my fingers crossed that developers will not stop on one title and provide
      more WoD games on this engine and created by the same team.'
