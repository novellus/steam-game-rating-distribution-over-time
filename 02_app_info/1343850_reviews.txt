The gameplay consists of... finding things, avoiding a slow moving doctor cat thing and running when said doctor cat thing spots you. Revolutionary game mechanics I know. \n\nYou start off as a science person who is doing unknown research in a science facility in the middle of a snowy tundra. The power is off and it is up to you to turn on the generators to bring back power to your science facility. One of your fellow researchers \"Dr. Milo\" is also mysteriously missing. Dr. Milo being a cat doctor hybrid wielding a pipe? like weapon. Milo will try to stop you at each area where a generator is located. By stopping you, I mean, running at you very slowly while making a very loud earrape level sound, that is honestly the best thing about the game, it's a fucking terrifying sound. When he catches you, Milo smacks you with his pipe. You can take multiple hits from his pipe so it's not difficult to survive him. \n\nThere are some strats I discovered when dealing with Milo. In 2 of the 3 generator areas, you can have him chase you across the snowy tundra for basically as long and far as you need, just keep triggering him. Once you get him a decent distance from your target location, you can run around him and head back. He will slowly walk back to the generator area but it will take a couple minutes, giving you time to basically complete everything. In fact I'm pretty sure each area has it's own Milo, so hypothetical you could have all 3 Milo's meet each other. I'm not sure what happens when you do this (haven't tested the theory yet) but the results could be catastrophic. \n\nThe first generator room to your left is the only challenging one because the door locks behind you. You basically just have to find 2 keys while avoiding Milo. If you can survive this, then the next two areas are a give away because you can just lure Milo half way across the continent and then go back and solve the puzzles. Puzzles which include, finding a key, opening a door, grabbing bolt cutters and using them on a chained up door. The other puzzle is turning wheels on pipes in a certain order. Groundbreaking puzzles I know.\n\nAfter all the generators are on you will be treated to a final showdown with Milo. You head back to main base to use the telecommunications to contact a helicopter. I walked in and Milo spotted me, I ran to get away but he wouldn't stop chasing me. I ran halfway across the ridiculously large map and back until I ran inside the barn area, ran into the Milo of that area, he hit me, I turned a corner and lost both of the Milos. Made my way back to the main base, contacted the helicopter, went to the pad and beat the game.  I'm honestly not sure how to get past the final Milo without losing him inside the barn or another generator area. He killed me the first time I played and there are NO SAVES so you have to start from the beginning... which is really, really painful and kind of killed me on the inside. \n\nOnce you beat the game, you unlock Nightmare Mode. Which is just an impossible troll version of the normal game. There is no way to beat it. If you glitch out Milo and make your way to the telecommunications room, you're locked in that room and cannot leave. \n\nI would not recommend Dr. Milo's Revenge. The only enjoyment I got out of it was playing while a friend watched me over Discord as I suffered through the grind of trolling Milo halfway across the map as his awful earrape noise blasted every couple seconds. If you wanna entertain yourself and some friends, buy this game for a $1 during a steam sale. It 100% is not worth $5, a reminder that \"Tattletale\", \"The Music Machine\" and the first \"Welcome to The Game\" are also $5, please buy those games instead, those are good games.","timestamp_created":1597383227,"timestamp_updated":1597383380,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.59633028507232666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwoHe9fMCd9OrmwI="}
