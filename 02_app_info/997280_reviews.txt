Rewind...[/h1]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1769154635\nYou find yourself in a game where you play VHS tapes as games: each tape shows a grainy black-and-white world and is, well a little creepy. Definitely adjust your tracking.\nThe world within the VHS exists in two-realms, both of which are interconnected. The decor is a little satanic and the guests a little unruly. Good luck!\n\n[b]Hook[/b]\nAfter his girl became a witch and he lost his job at Fazbear's Pizza, Jack Fortuna's luck was about to change: being paid to watch TV! Little did he know that the TV was also watching him...\n\n[b]Mechanic[/b]\nA series of puzzles played in first-person\n- each room contains a real world and an invsible world: turing off the light allows you to walk in the phased world\n- the phase-space contains keys to solving puzzles in the real-world\n- phase space also contains monsters and demons... some visible, some not\n- real-world items can still have an invisible prescence in the phase-space, causing invisible blockers...\n- all rooms need to be solved to open the next room\n- the final room has you downloading important data while scaring away a monster invasion by using light once more...\n\n[b]Accessibility[/b]\n- nothing to overtly offensive, but the tone is scary-horror\n- no real options to control video or audio settings\n- some sections rely on audio to resolve, but with no visual tells to go with audio, this poses a real issue for those with hearing sensitivities\n- the controls are fairly standard, though change radically near the endearing\n- navigating the 3D world is clumsy: the collsion bozes around items are too big, causing you to often snag on nothing.\n\n[b]Universe[/b]\n- you enter a black-and-white world of VHS-addled madness\n- death is very frequent: get used to it\n- it is a dark, spooky and alien place\n\n[b]Delivery[/b]\n- a great sense of peril throughout\n- the horror element is initially very good\n- the level design is awful in places however; this detracts from the horrifying core: causing you instead to focus on the bugs rather than the plot\n\n[/quote]\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n[quote]\n[h1]Stay in the light. This scary game takes you to another dimension: pay close attention. Sorely let down by really minor issues, but a compelling world nontheless.[/h1]\n\nPros:\n- the universe and designs are strong\n- the VHS gimmick is well-applied\n\nCons:\n- some really awful collisions and bugs mean you spend a lot of time frantically trying to work around the game than actually fear anything within it.\n- the uneven level-progression and lack of polish, coupled with some real rage-quit sections, mean this game though pretty, will most-likely remain unfinished in your collection.\n\n[b]MY DIRTY-HEADED SCORE: 6/10 [Steam average score: 7/10][/b]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1748251362\n[/quote]\n[h1]See Also...[/h1]\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/558420/\n[h1]All [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/boyflea/][i]boyflea[/i][/url] reviews can be found at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33138741-Good-Indie-Free-Game-Reviews/][b]Good Indie Free Game Reviews[/b] [/url][/h1]","timestamp_created":1560554986,"timestamp_updated":1560555201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.689593076705932617","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ntSVrOsCdKa2wwE="}
