    review: This game has given me multiple strokes, a seizure, schizophrenia, and
      I now am now a subject in a neurologists experiments on the brain issues and
      disorders. However, I must say that this has to be my Game of The Year. Very
      enjoyable, great experience, deep and rich story, and much more await you when
      you play SALVATOR.
