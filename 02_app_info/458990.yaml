    review: "First of all yes, do recommend this game given the cheap price (\xA3\
      1.99 at time of posting), but it is not without significant problems directly\
      \ affecting game play.  The positives are an immersive VR experience, excellent\
      \ voice acting  (spaceship female British voice), a convincing alien landscape,\
      \ not bad graphics,  and a distinct structure to the experience.  The problems\
      \ experienced are related to game play, which I understand were even worse at\
      \ one point.  \n\nThere still does not seem to be any game save in the checkpoint\
      \ sense, albeit there are checkpoint entries to the game in the starting menu\
      \ - but these are all available from the onset, and possibly tagged on as an\
      \ afterthought in relation to previous saved problems.    Not ideal and not\
      \ really a save, but at least allows some form of entry position near your last\
      \ point.\n\nThere is over two hours of game play, and unlikely to be done in\
      \ one sitting; or should I say standing as its a standing VR experience.  The\
      \ puzzles are fairly straightforward which is just as well as there appears\
      \ little in the way of walk through online  (An over 2 hr video is on You-tube\
      \ without narration if desperation requires), but can be unbelievably frustrating\
      \ due to some poor control responses - and it is possible to get yourself (or\
      \ the energy orb) in an impossible to get out of position.  \n\nA few tips without\
      \ giving too much away.  The beginning where the spaceship voice prompts to\
      \ the aqueduct can take ages to figure out, albeit gives you a chance to explore\
      \ the expansive alien landscape, and force fields blocking just about every\
      \ viable pathway.  Just focus attention on the first tower to get you to the\
      \ aqueduct. As for controlling the energy orb over the huge sloped wall,  I\
      \ found following as close as you can whilst propelling the orb using carefully\
      \ aimed energy blasts was the strategy that appeared to work best.\n\nWith some\
      \ of the above tips for some of the big frustrations, I feel this is worth the\
      \ price.  It is basically a good game, albeit with some inherent game play flaws.\
      \  Worked fine in Windows Mixed Reality Samsung Odyssey Plus."
