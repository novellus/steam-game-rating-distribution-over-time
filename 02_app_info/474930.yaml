    review: "EDIT: They now have added the ability to turn off cards from decks. While\
      \ I still personally don't like the pack as much as the others- it certainly\
      \ works a lot better once you can turn off the white cards. \n\nHonestly this\
      \ DLC makes me wish there was a way to turn OFF cards. On the one hand a lot\
      \ of the black cards are rather interesting and funny in their own right...\
      \ but if you (let alone the people you are playing with) don't know who the\
      \ streamers are the white cards just massive wastes of time. I get a few of\
      \ these black cards? Awesome. Who doesn't like a glorious beard! I get a white\
      \ card that has some random numbers and letters on it? Worthless.\n\nMy point\
      \ is even if you know these streamers you may want to reconsider buying this\
      \ DLC. Even if you know them doesn't mean others will join you in that. For\
      \ me, I got this when I bought the launch DLC pack so I couldn't exactly skip\
      \ it. But now that I worked out exactly what it is I don't put it on during\
      \ games."
