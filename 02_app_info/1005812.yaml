    short_description: "Dr Harold Shipman was Britain\u2019s most prolific serial\
      \ killer with at least 215 known victims. Was Shipman simply addicted to murder,\
      \ playing God by killing many of his elderly female patients, or did his upbringing\
      \ and the circumstances of his mother's death turn him into a mass murderer?"
