The rest of the factions seem to have most of their strong points and preferred units but gave us a half-baked version of guard. If you're here for only tanks, I can see you being somewhat happy, but if you're here for infantry you'll immediately notice the lack all commands, all heavy weapons, lasgun rerolls and their ability to damage in 8 and 9e. Virtually everything that makes an all Cadian infantry viable on table top is not here. Devs need to revisit this and reduce point costs.","timestamp_created":1609656759,"timestamp_updated":1609656759,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rZ7B4/YCd5T+vwI="}
