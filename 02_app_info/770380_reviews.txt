You meet a lot of different characters / creatures.\n\nIt is actually a RPG game so you have stats like \"health\" and \"intelligenze\" (altough health has another name in this game)\n\nand these stats are used for \"interaction\" with enemy characters. You \"fight\" a word battle - which is fun by it´s own.\n\nThe humor in this game is very special and definately might not be everyones taste but if you are into gaming in generall\n\na little bit and have an open mind for ... let´s call it \"nerd culture\" you´ll definately have fun in this game.\n\nI probably just scratched on the surface of this game, given the fact that I write this review after just playing a little bit\n\nlonger than 1 hour. But let alone in this small play time I´ve had lots of fun, good laughts and so far and so on.\n\nYou should definately check out that game. There´s more going on in the game than the pictures from the shop are\n\nshowing (for example on the shop pictures you can´t see that you can make lots and lots of choices in that game)\n\nDefinately recommended. It´s ... let´s say another experience :)","timestamp_created":1523354680,"timestamp_updated":1523354785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532755613327026367","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zqrB1+ICc6v0nQE="}
