    review: "+Cooking/Dinerdash type of game\n+Decently Made\n\n- A little expensive\
      \ for it's content\n- Others games offer the same experience for cheaper\n-\
      \ Controls are a bit wonky on Index\n\n2/5\n\nIf it was a little cheaper this\
      \ would be an alright buy, but it's the same speed cooking diner dash type of\
      \ game you'll see dozens of in VR if you look. Most cheaper, and some better\
      \ quality. Also the game on steam is \"I'm Hungry\" but the photo calls it \"\
      I AM H ungry VR\" which is odd. \n\n[Quote] If you liked this review Make sure\
