    short_description: In Judged you start as a newly minted judge in lowly traffic
      court. As you weigh the evidence from police testimony, breathalayzer results,
      and eye-witness testimony you'll have to keep your appeals rate for judges overturning
      your decisions low to ensure you get promoted into more prestigious courts.

    review: Still incredibly bugged, as other reviews mentioned, the game crashes
      when you level up and you can't save it. Basically you play for 10 minutes until
      it does that or you get bored since all the cases make no sense and just repeat.
      I would request a refund but I paid less than $2 for it so not even worth the
      headache. Just save yourself 10 minutes and go play something else. I think
      this game has potential if the developer cared about it. Still missing several
      things so I don't think it'll be updated again at this point
