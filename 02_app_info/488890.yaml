    review: "This game is the perfect embodiment of 21st century humor.\nThis isn't\
      \ a bad thing though, since it adds to the games charm\nWhile the game is short,\
      \ the replay value isn't great, and the graphics are pretty bad, I believe that\
      \ this game does its job well. To be a $3 game that is completely a joke. \n\
      Do I suggest buying this? Yes\n"
