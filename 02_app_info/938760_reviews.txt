Possibly it's worth the money on sale, but I would suggest you save up your money for something more impressive. Ambient sounds are sparse. Graphic quality is super low. What bothered me the most was bizarre things in the world: poplar trees a metre across, a glossy wet rock surrounded by dry rocks, big trees growing out of solid rock, waterfalls with no splash or foam, water sections joined with visible seams, blocky objects, a single burned tree trunk, and some things we just can't identify. I wasn't relaxed. I was looking around wondering 'why?' and thinking how much it looked like a bunch of Skyrim assets tossed together.","timestamp_created":1570322681,"timestamp_updated":1570322681,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514705896377563477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ytGhz+0CfejM0wE="}
