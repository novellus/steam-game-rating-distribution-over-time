    review: '[b]A memory is a beautiful thing, it''s almost a desire that you miss.
      - Gustave Flaubert[/b]


      Well, here be the last part of the [i]East Tower[/i] series, hailing from RoseVerte''s
      collection. It sure is not among the best in their catalogue with questionable
      art choices and some blatant weeaboo humor, yet still the long wait in the series''
      completion delivers justly with a wonderful plot twist. We have waited so long
      for the revelation of our hacker, right? Well, allow me to say that none of
      us guessed this one correctly - and there were a lot more at stake on this game
      than we were aware of to begin with.


      Well, about the storyline, I''ll try my best not the spoil things for the reader,
      yet I have to warn you priorly. [i]East Tower - Kurenai[/i] is the last part
      of the series, and it is mandatory to play this one, the last. The first game,
      [i]Akio[/i] introduces us to the concept of the VR game and our participants;
      the second game, [i]Takashi[/i] reveals some elements about the past of our
      protagonist; and the third game, [i]Kuon[/i] simply nudges our attention deeper
      towards the unspoken mysteries of this VR game. This game is where all our prior
      questions will be answered, and presumable odd repetition of the prior events
      will be explained.[spoiler] Apparently, our protagonist did indeed participate
      the game three times, yet she remembers a singular one; and in this last game,
      it is not even Sakuya that participates alongside Kurenai... [/spoiler] Oh,
      I already said too much. Give it a chance, and all will be revealed.


      Paying closer attention to the character of our chosen beau, Kurenai is a sly
      arsehole to say the least. He is pretty, flamboyant, witty and deliberately
      cruel on all manners of social interactions. You know the type that you''d love
      to hate, yet end as hating to love? He is that kind. With his identity explained
      at the finale of the series, even his character shines under a different light
      - that is a feat masterfully handled by RoseVerte. Kurenai is different compared
      to all others, as we may have noticed priorly. This time, we will end up being
      paired with him, even though such wasn''t our choice. Did the hacker succeed
      in this timeline? Well, you see, Kurenai has a mission to pursue in this odd
      Dream World - one he''ll see through, even if that would be the last thing he''d
      do.


      As you may have noticed, the gameplay takes a different direction in each game,
      and it has been the hardest for this final one. Our challenges do contain some
      mini games this time, which would require your attention to detail and even
      skills on time management. As the game comes to an end, an opportunity for the
      truth emerges. This is also the longest game in the series, containing both
      an outlay of the game in the VR world, your usual character interaction process
      and the end-game revelations that would require some in-depth story elements
      to be analyzed. It would take one A rated and three S rated playthroughs to
      see all endings - considering aggressive/passive answer scale presents different
      outcomes for the nature of the relationship, giving you a total of 6-7 hours
      of playtime - and also relevant achievements.


      Could I recommend this one, knowing that it lacks a lot in display quality?
      I surely can, considering its story elements and character progression is handled
      wonderfully. If you are patient in your discovery, series do deliver by the
      end. If this is the worst title in RoseVerte''s catalogue, I can wholeheartedly
      congratulate the developer. Wonderful work indeed!
