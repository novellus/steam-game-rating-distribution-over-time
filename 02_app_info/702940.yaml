    review: "Even though I only have a passing knowledge of Shakespeare I enjoyed\
      \ this game. I really liked the fresh take on the classic characters, but how\
      \ could you not when one is a werewolf and another is a robot t-rex!? \n\nThe\
      \ story was entertaining, has some good twists and does a very good job of capturing\
      \ the essence of cliques in school. I would definitely do another couple playthroughs\
      \ to check out the other love interests that I found entertaining."
