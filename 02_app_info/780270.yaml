    review: "Very promising game! \nThe game is beautiful, really good gameplay mechanics,\
      \ nice rythm, interesting characters, this is a lot of fun no matter if you\
      \ want to play it casually or if you want competitivity, both works really good!\
      \ \nAlmost single developer so it'll take a bit of time to reach its full potential\
      \ but nothing can go wrong with so much passion! Dev is actually really active\
      \ to take all the feedback from players (i'd say everyday) and really efficient\
      \ so this is really reassuring to see that :). \n\nSo much fun already even\
      \ at this early state, i stick to it for months now and even more as the community\
      \ starts to grow!\nSo do not hesitate to try it even more if you come from games\
      \ like Battlerite for exemple, you'll definitely love it!\n\n"
