I would recommend for anyone who doesn't mind struggling with puzzles for a bit.\n\nThe place that is really quite poor (and I really wish they had done nothing rather than what they did) is the story. It... exists but really I think if they have given it a simpler story it would have been better. The animations... are pretty horrible. The music actively made the game worse and I ended up muting it.\n\nHowever, this was a small game that I paid around 3 pounds for. If you like puzzle games this is pretty great. If you want to play it for any other reason... don't.","timestamp_created":1606923768,"timestamp_updated":1606923768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjNqHkvYCfYTktgI="}
