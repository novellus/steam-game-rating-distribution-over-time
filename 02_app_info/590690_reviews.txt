I just beat the single player races just to get gold medals in all of them. I'm about to move into the challenge track sections, while I'm still looking for a group of people to play this now and then. \n\nBut this game has some fast paced action that is matched by it's catchy fucking soundtrack. In a niche market that's plagued by shooters, Sprint Vector offers a refreshing change of pace.","timestamp_created":1609917832,"timestamp_updated":1609917832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtJOl6/YCc6H3wAI="}
