    review: 'The game itself is amazing, I love it. It needs a lot of thinking, strategy
      and you have to adapt all the time to what other people are doing. I play this
      cardboard game IRL a lot with my friends :)


      [b] HOWEVER [/b] , the online game is FULL of bugs, crashes, and since the last
      update some games are just unplayable, you need to quit and come back on the
      game ALL THE TIME to try and debug, some people can''t reconnect to the game
      and so run out of time etc etc...


      [b] IT IS A SHAME [/b] , because these bugs/crashes ruin the game online, it
      is so frustrating that this game is so good and SO BAD at the same time.


      [b] PLEASE DO SOMETHING AND FIX THE GAME! [/b]'
