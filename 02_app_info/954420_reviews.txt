For starters lets take a look at the description from store page \"DotX is a 'mouse only' game, where you will challenge your ability to control the mouse, as well as verify your emotional resistance.\" sure I can agree with mouse control ability and emotional resistance if You're planing to 100% the game but whats the point of improving Your \"mouse control ability\" in this type of game especially when You can just play \"osu!\". It's a bit different than \"osu!\" because here You don't click the buttons to the rhythm but You can just play \"osu!\" with relax mod and it'd be much better. First of all improving Your aim in this type of game won't help You in FPS games that much. Second thing is that even if it improves Your aim for \"osu!\" types of games, most people play \"osu!\" with graphic tablets as it's much easier so there's no point of improving Your aim in this particular game. It doesn't support graphical tablets in any way. I've tried setting up my tablet as mouse cursor and it didn't work for me. There aren't many mods that modify the gameplay and they act like mods in \"osu!\". There aren't many settings changes that You can do and it feels like cursor change is the most limited one. First of all developer couldn't implement it so that after the cursor change it doesn't change its position which makes changing the cursor a little longer. Second of all only the first default cursor has no such thing called as \"cursor tail\" in \"osu!\". In \"osu!\" different skins have the cursor tail depending of the skin author preference which You can remove by simply removing file in skin folder. What's the point of having 10 different cursors if there's no option to turn off cursor tail. Sure its a personal preference but there could be at least option to switch it on and off. I don't understand adding 10 different cursors and the only 1st default one having no cursor tail. I know its just a cheap indie game but it doesn't feel like there was much effort put into it. I've seen many other games that were 2x cheaper and still were more polished than this. There are 100 levels and they aren't sorted by difficulty also most of the levels are mirrored. I'm not saying \"all\" but \"most\" of them. Completing some of the levels with all the mods to get achievements are nearly impossible. \"Approach rate\" and \"circle size\" with mods on in some levels just feel like they weren't tested. Overall I don't recommend this game because there's a much better and free alternative.","timestamp_created":1609580377,"timestamp_updated":1609580377,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uu6d4fYCfJ/WvwI="}
