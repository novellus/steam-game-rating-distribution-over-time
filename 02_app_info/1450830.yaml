    about_the_game: At Dead Of Night is part horror film, part horror game and part
      ghost hunt. It seamlessly blends live-action and graphics to create a unique
      immersive horror experience like no other. You play Maya, a student trapped
      in a remote hotel run by a psychopath called Jimmy Hall.  Jimmy has tied up
      Maya's friends and locked them in their rooms, with evil intentions. Maya has
      managed to escape, but Jimmy is on the prowl looking for her. However, to get
      him to release her friends, Maya must uncover Jimmy's dark secret. Using an
      ancient ghost voice receiver she finds, Maya must communicate with the ghosts
      of Jimmy's past, who materialise around the hotel and gradually reveal their
      story.<br><br><strong>MAC VERSION</strong><br><br>We're currently unable to
      release the game on Mac, but we're trying to get this version working asap.
      For now the game will only be available for Windows.<br><br><strong>CONTROLLER

    review: "With the live action method (is this how it's called?) the game sets\
      \ up a unique environment and envokes the feeling of danger without being a\
      \ horror game per s\xE9 in my opinion. The stories so far are really great and\
      \ creative. I hope this game gets the attention it deserves. Really really great,\
      \ I am enjoying this so far and hope for more games with this approach in the\
      \ future!!"
