    short_description: In the slow motion bullet-hell of Blaston, you duck, dodge
      and weave to evade incoming attacks while preparing your dazzling next combos
      in a flash of skill. You feel like Neo and leave each session with your heart
      racing - super fun tactical workout. Most importantly, Never. Stay. Still.

    review: "Amazing! And actually has players playing. Got sucked in for multiple\
      \ hours tonight. Just buy it while there is still a player base. Even once that\
      \ dies out... super fun game vs friends... but tonight got matched up with a\
      \ dozen players at least \u2014 late night PST on a Tuesday. Worth it"
