    about_the_game: "In the late 1890s the Great Western Railway were seeking new\
      \ locomotives as part of their post-broad gauge conversion modernization. The\
      \ newly appointed Chief Mechanical Engineer of the GWR, George Jackson Churchward,\
      \ sought out designs for modern steam locomotives that could serve the Western\
      \ network far into the future. His first success came from the 2-cylinder prototype\
      \ known as the Saint Class which, from 1902, would go on to serve as the standard\
      \ 2-cylinder design for the foreseeable future. This gave Churchward the desire\
      \ to experiment with 4-cylinder locomotives, which could help make a fleet of\
      \ even more powerful locomotives. Churchward convinced the GWR to acquire a\
      \ small handful of four-cylinder French steam locomotives for comparison.<br><br>The\
      \ first four-cylinder prototype appeared in April 1906 as No. 40 and with the\
      \ Class being named the \u2018Star\u2019, No. 40 was named North Star. No. 40,\
      \ much like the Saint prototypes built by Churchward before, featured a 4-4-2\
      \ wheel arrangement with the standard 4-6-0 being only a simple conversion away.\
      \ Various aspects of the design were influenced by the French locomotives and\
      \ the wheel arrangement was eventually converted into the classic 4-6-0 by November\
      \ of the same year. This was decided after reports concluded that the 4-4-2\
      \ design would suffer during low adhesion or with heavier loads. A clear indication\
      \ that the Class had set the standard four-cylinder design was the prototype\
      \ itself, which would eventually be rebuilt into a Castle Class locomotive in\
      \ 1929.<br><br>Following the success of the prototype, several series of Star\
      \ Class locomotives would be built between 1907 and 1923. Each series was given\
      \ a different overall name despite them being part of the same class; for example,\
      \ after the first batch of 10 locomotives, known as the Star series were produced,\
      \ the second batch were classed the Knight series and this trend continued through\
      \ each batch of locomotives. Each batch saw various differences between them,\
      \ however underneath the standard Star Class remained.<br><br>The final Star\
      \ Class, 4072 Tresco Abbey, was built in February 1923. After this Class had\
      \ ended its production run its successor, the 4073 Castle Class, continued on\
      \ the numbers as a more powerful express passenger locomotive which originated\
      \ from the Star Class. In fact, as many as 15 Castle Class locomotives came\
      \ to be thanks to Star Class conversions (including Tresco Abbey).<br><br>During\
      \ its prime, the Star Class fleet operated mainly as an express passenger locomotive,\
      \ hauling the longer distance journeys at higher speeds than had been seen before.\
      \ They literally were the \u2018Stars\u2019 of the Great Western from London\
      \ to Bristol and beyond. That was however until improvements were made upon\
      \ its design and the more powerful Castle Class \u2013 and also eventually the\
      \ even more powerful King Class \u2013 began to take charge of the top link\
      \ expresses out to the West. Many of the Star Class locomotives were displaced\
      \ to secondary operations while the new Castle and Kings reigned supreme, however\
      \ the most reliable of the Stars did last in service well into the 1950s.<br><br>Eventually,\
      \ the end was approaching for the Star Class, those that hadn\u2019t been scrapped\
      \ by the mid-1950s were rebuilt into the Castle Class and the final two that\
      \ were still in service were withdrawn by British Railways in 1956 and 1957.\
      \ Out of all the Star Class locomotives, only one has been preserved and it\
      \ is done so in a static state; 4003 Lode Star can be found today as the sole\
      \ survivor of the Class under the protection of the National Railway Museum,\
      \ a non-working exhibit that treasures the legacy behind some of the most iconic\
      \ GWR locomotives in history.<br><br>The Star Class for Train Simulator features\

    short_description: In the late 1890s the Great Western Railway were seeking new
      locomotives as part of their post-broad gauge conversion modernization. The
      newly appointed Chief Mechanical Engineer of the GWR, George Jackson Churchward,
      sought out designs for modern steam locomotives that could serve the Western
      network far into the future.

    review: An excellent piece of DLC - amongst the best steam engines available for
      TS.  Everything works - cab light, large and small vacuum injectors, train heating,
      firebox cover etc, plus lovely sounds, and smoke and steam effects.  Also you
      get Collett coaches in GWR shirt button livery.  This is a pro-level loco, but
      perhaps a little more forgiving than some.  If you make your own GWR freeroams
      or create GWR scenarios this is a must piece of DLC or if you just want to run
      a lovely steam engine, pick this up in a sale and you can't go wrong.  Very
      highly recommended.
