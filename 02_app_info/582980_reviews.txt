I'd heard good things about this series so I decided to grab this during the 2020 Winter Sale. I'm still debating if I want to refund this or not (you'll eventually see in the review info if I did or not) because I don't understand why this is so revered.\n\nPros:\n-A true bullet Hell with extreme challenge. Even on the very easy difficulty, you are god tier if you can 1CC this (and that's a good thing.)\n-A wide variety of characters, each of which have very different base and special attacks.\n-A wide variety of enemies which often border on nonsensical but which give you lots of attacks and patterns to learn.\n-Tons of varied bosses.\n-Local two player mode available.\n\nCons:\n-In this \"full controller support\" title, you have to disable Steam's Xbox controller mapping or it won't recognize Xbox One controllers at all. This is the only game on Steam I've ever had to do this for. Known issue, not patched.\n-There is no time in gaming history on any platform where this title wouldn't have been considered incredibly ugly.\n-Music and sound effects are subpar at best. There is also this horrific, shrill noise that plays loudly for several seconds every time you kill a boss.\n-Story that reads like it was written by an angsty 14 year old who is mad that his Mom took his anime collection away.\n-Characters are very unbalanced. Some character special attacks (in particular ????'s) require so much time to aim and execute that they are effectively impossible to use during a boss battle without taking a hit for it.\n-The game has online leaderboards but it's only a global top 10. Nothing beyond that, no friends filter. So if you aren't a god tier player, your score will never show up. I don't even know why they bothered.\n\nTo me, this isn't a good shmup and it's definitely a bad PC shmup (though I have seen much worse port jobs.) If you can stomach the story, visuals and sound, there is some incredible bullet Hell challenge to be found here. However, even for just over $5CDN, I feel this wasn't worth it and it's definitely not worth full price. It's cheap enough that I may choose to keep it in my collection but like I said, I haven't decided yet. Personally, unless you're a hardcore shmup collector or bullet Hell fan, I'd avoid this one.","timestamp_created":1609004625,"timestamp_updated":1609004625,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xsWJ0PYCecu6vQI="}
