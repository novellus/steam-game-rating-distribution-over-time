    review: "I got this game for .49 cents USD on the Halloween sale, and to me it's\
      \ worth about that. Like all the other 8floor solitaire games it has a lot of\
      \ bells and whistles. You can select from several styles of decks and even select\
      \ the large style faces that make the cards easier to read.\n\nThere's a newbie\
      \ route where things are easier. Music is OK, if a bit annoying after a while,\
      \ but you can turn it off and play your own in the background. But like all\
      \ the other titles from these devs, there are a few annoying aspects.\n\nThe\
      \ game has a store where you use coins you earn in game to buy bonus cards like\
      \ jokers, etc. OK, sounds like fun, right? Until you grind through a level to\
      \ earn enough points to get enough jokers to play. You can shuffle if you have\
      \ it or buy the option, but it usually makes hands worse, not better.\n\nWhy\
      \ do levels matter? Because if you don't score enough points you can't unlock\
      \ the next background. I'd love to see a casual route with all backgrounds unlocked\
      \ and the ability to go back through the dealt cards, because that's how solitaire\
      \ often works. And a layout choice.\n\nOverall it's a fun game with pretty cards\
      \ in a tropical setting and I'm enjoying it. There does seem to be a bug where\
      \ cards sometimes deal out two at a time, but other than that it's a fun casual\
      \ game. \n"
