    review: 'So, if you know me on a personal level, you know EXACTLY why I''m recommending
      this the same day I found, purchased and binged through an hour despite not
      really being much of a VN fan. That''s going to introduce a bit of bias/wilingness
      to forgive it for smaller things, but I''m fairly confident in saying it''s
      a pretty good experience aside from that. The poor gay part of my heart loved
      it - but it''s not without significant flaws, primarily in how it''s written,
      and too a lesser extent the audio experience.


      So, it starts out with a route selection - which caught me as odd from my experience
      of VNs. Instead of throwing you in and letting your paths branch from one, you
      can choose to pursue specifically two routes, or go at it in the traditional
      sense. This, I sort of appreciated as someone that doesn''t play many VNs, and
      is rarely inclined to go through walkthroughs. This meant I was pretty easily
      able to play through the main routes the game wanted to show me, then go through
      on my own and see what else it had to offer - which felt like a really good
      way to experience it. This does lock you in to certain choices with no flexibility
      if you choose one of those paths it seems, but the more hand-held experience
      to get to know one of the characters in a focused way before letting me loose
      was good for someone like me who barely plays VNs. If that''s not to your taste,
      you can select the "choose your path" sort of option by default, though the
      main two paths it wants you to take get much more screenspace.


      From there, we''ll touch on the art and the characters - the art makes heavy
      use of distinctive line and blocked shadowing which gave it a rather distinctive
      look compared to a sea of fairly samey looking VNs (and a whole lot of WLW VNs
      that seem targeted at men, which is kind of why I don''t play many. A bit of
      bias, and a lack of willingness to dig through such. This is not that, however
      - it pulls on the strings of my sapphic leanings very nicely. The game is for
      gay gals and not for fetishistic, leering men and I appreciate that) and is
      incredibly welcome. The character designs too - each one feels interesting and
      unique, and I enjoyed getting to know each character introduced. Nim''gann got
      my poor heart the most.


      As an aside, black/odd-coloured sclera in character designs is one of my favourite
      things to see, and this game agrees with me. I appreciate that.


      The writing and dialogue however, is a little mixed compared. Whilst the plotlines
      are interesting, and the characters are lovely - the prose it uses for both
      dialogue and description is a little stilted and odd. Not enough that it''ll
      take you out of the experience, but enough that it gives an odd... tang? to
      reading it. It feels as if the writers wanted to give the characters a sense
      of not being native speakers, where instead it ends up feeling like it''s all
      written by a non native speaker. This does lead to an strange feel of otherness
      when reading it, adding to that feeling of dipping into an unfamiliar culture,
      but still. An odd lack of contractions leads to a very formal prose, while the
      main character/POV character is written to have rather informal and colloquial
      speech -  it''s very at odds, and at times made me pause and give it another
      read. For some characters, the stilted dialogue fits how I might imagine the
      way they describe them to speak - and often times it gives a ''lost in translation''
      feeling where an expression they use sounds odd to read, but fits the vibe it
      feels they want the characters and world to have - but for our character, Roo,
      with her flirtatious speech and informal chatter, it does take me out of the
      experience at times.


      Mind - this is not me saying it''s badly written! It''s an enjoyable read, the
      descriptions are nice and vibrant and they take good time to flesh out small
      world features and facts that you might be curious, and a lesser writer would
      tend to drop and leave without expansion. The characters have their own biases,
      preconceptions and views on the world, and you can tell how that colours their
      perceptions and dialogue - and it makes for an interesting read. Occasionally
      it can be a touch blunt with bits of interest, or slightly long winded, but
      it''s much more preferable to having them skip such entirely.


      Audio on the other hand, is at best, servicable, and at worst could detract
      and wear on me. Sound effects looping in odd, stilted ways that grate were common,
      and the music, at best, tended to be servicable and inoffensive. Music or sound
      effects will also be faded/paused to nothingness at odd timings for single lines,
      before continuing, in a way that if intentional, feels ill targeted. Very often,
      audio would abruptly stop and loop in an interrupted way that was very noticable.
      Audio very clearly wasn''t their focus, and the experience does suffer for it.
      I ended up turning off the music and turning down the sounds to a very low volume,
      and playing my own music.


      All of this combined, would usually lead to me giving a positive but flawed
      review - but, if, like me, you become a useless piece of gay mush when it comes
      to a certain type, you really cant go wrong with it. There''s not much that
      caters to the specific buff lesbian orcs with clearly sapphic tones, let alone
      being as well built as the orcs it portrays, and this does a pretty bang-up
      job of it. Hopefully I''ll find the time to get through every route, because
      I very much want to, even if I''m asexual leaning and the main characters occasional
      overt horniness gets an eyebrow raise.'
