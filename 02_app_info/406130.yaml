    review: "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I]  Those wanting a challenging 2D combat\
      \ game that doesn't rely on overly complicated skills, but down to base weapon\
      \ play [/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n \nGames that play off more famous games\
      \ names usually send a big red flag for me, but Dark Maus and its similarities\
      \ to Dark Souls feels justified here, and reasonable. The combat does a great\
      \ job of providing a challenge for the player, and the gameplay is precise enough\
      \ to reward smart and tactical movement by the player. The level design helps\
      \ in providing wide open spaces when you need it (when facing enemies that charge\
      \ you like bulls), but shrinks it down to small corridors to cause some claustrophobia\
      \ as the traps and enemies surround you at every turn. The difficulty is high:\
      \ and yet fair: not relying on tricks, but forces you to adapt to your environment.\
      \ While some of the sound design needs a bit more impact and there's some goofy\
      \ menu implementation, the game's weaknesses don't overshadow the core combat\
      \ in any way. If you're looking for a 2D combat fix, you could do a LOT worse\
      \ then Dark Maus, because it's got the combat down.\n\n[b]First Impressions\
      \ Video: https://youtu.be/ZuON7xzHZaM[/b] \n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n\
      [list]\n[*] Combat is surprisingly precise and makes the combat difficult and\
      \ yet satisfying on several levels. Timing, luring, and good reflexes all play\
      \ a huge part in being successful, and button mashing won't work ever. Technically,\
      \ was surprised on how accurate the hitboxes were. \n[*] Weapons and skills\
      \ lead to variety in combat. Good enemy selection early on helps this along.\
      \ Using skills wisely can help not only through combat, but in exploration sections\
      \ as well.\n[*] Boss battles were memorable, forcing you to use what you had\
      \ learn up to that point in new ways.\n[*] The aesthetic may be simple, but\
      \ it captures the loneliness of the world and the dire circumstances the world\
      \ is in. In particular, I love the lighting affects in the game, never knowing\
      \ what's around the corner, and how it causes even more tension. \n[*] Level\
      \ Design does a great job of complementing combat as well, making the situations\
      \ a bit more tense with strategically placed traps and claustophobic conditions.\
      \ \n[*] Ok, the name is appropriate for the game.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n\
      [list]\n[*] The menu implementation needs work, especially with the map. It\
      \ became a huge chore to bring it up via the controller implementation. Maybe\
      \ a mini map would have worked better.\n[*] The sound design could use some\
      \ improvements. Turning off the sound entirely didn't seem to have any effect\
      \ of the game's combat.\n[*] There seems to be a lore here....I just wish there\
      \ was more story. \n[*] You'll get lost, and the map implementation doesn't\
      \ help. It becomes a little bit more of a problem because enemies respawn.\n\
      [/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed,\
