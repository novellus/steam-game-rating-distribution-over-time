    about_the_game: Minskies Furballs is not a port, but a spiritual clone of Puyo
      Puyo. In a tournament against a cast of crazy characters, you must guide and
      rotating falling pairs of cats of different colours to make up colour combinations.
      When four or more cats make contact, they are eliminated, and those above fall
      down, thereby possibly triggering a chain reaction. Chain reactions will make
      fish and boulders fall down into your opponent's playfield, blocking his progress.
      Eliminating blocks will sometimes give you special weapons which can be used
      to eliminate cats and blocks from the screen.<br><br>The game can be played
      in a two-player mode or against crazy cartoon opponents such as the ugly pie
      Boo Cake, Hawkings the hawk or the slimy Greebo, who express their mood using
      both samples and small animations. If you win money in the match, you can gamble
      in a fruit machine. In two-player mode, each player can have a handicap.<br><br><strong>Game

    review: I don't know much about puyo puyo but my wife and I had fun playing this
      game, which is apparently very similar to it. Originally played it on Antstream
      but then wanted a local version so I could play local multiplayer on it (Antstream
      doesn't support local multiplayer for it yet).
