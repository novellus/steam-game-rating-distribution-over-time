The story is pretty interesting with full Japanee voice acting and subtitles nice music and occasional interactive battle parts.\n\nThen there's the boss fight mode with 4 bosses each with I think 4 different difficulties and it's actualy pretty decent challenge to beat the whole game which I still haven't done yet.\nTypical turn based combat strategy where the cards are all basically different spells.  You can choose which character to play as.  You can also customize your parties oufits.\n\nIt's a slow game.  Feels very early VR.  Like they were just testing the waters.  Strategy isn't great.  There's better strategy in similar mobile card games.  Not really recommended unless you're really bored and want to squeeze as much as you can out of a pretty polished looking game.","timestamp_created":1515297556,"timestamp_updated":1595374574,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552743375301361084","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm4PvufMCcp2nlQE="}
