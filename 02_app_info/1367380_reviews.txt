Still there are moments where not much is happening and I felt as if I got stuck in some loop first.\n\nSince it felt more solid this time and I can't say I noticed any other bug, I  will be fair and give this an upvote.","timestamp_created":1596448909,"timestamp_updated":1596448909,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47KTx2fMCfOuPmQI="}
