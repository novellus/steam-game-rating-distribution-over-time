    about_the_game: 'Sun Wukong, (The Monkey King) is a monkey born from a heavenly
      stone who acquires supernatural powers. This first movie in a planned trilogy
      is the origins story -- beginning with the birth of Sun Wukong and ending with
      his imprisonment for his crimes under the Five-Peaked Mountain. Along the way
      he acquires incredible powers, which he uses to battle both the armies of the
      gods and the armies of the demons to find his rightful place in the Heavens.
      It is a classic story of the scorned underdog who acquires great abilities but
      uses them recklessly and ultimately must pay a huge price to find redemption.
      The Monkey King: Havoc in Heaven''s Palace captures the drama, beauty, humor
      and fantastic action of the classic folk legend and brings it to the screen
      in a way never before possible.'

    review: 'An action movie about the Chinese mythology that is Sun Wukong aka the
      Monkey King staring Chow Yun Fat as the Jade Emperor (who is the the emperor
      of the deities) and a bunch of other Chinese actors whose names I cannot pronounce.
      This tale although told thousands of times before is more about how the Monkey
      King came to be.


      The first half of this movie showed promise and had me chuckling at the bad
      cgi and the fact that I could not tell what was going on in the action scenes
      because they were such a mess and mainly consisted of people floating around
      waving weapons in front of faces, it even has Chow Yun Fat turn into a dragon.
      The second half began to drag on and the antics of Sun Wukong began to get irritating
      a long with the fact that they did not seem to know what direction they wanted
      to take the character often had me shaking my head and the laughter wore off
      pretty fast. Bare in mind this movie is 2 hours long and they some how managed
      to make the final 45 minutes or so feel extremely rushed. One thing I did really
      like about this movie was the scenery because although the cgi ''horses'' and
      Dragons had me chuckling to myself the scenery was truly beautiful and set the
      scenes well when accompanied by the costumes which were also very good. Acting
      was fine and although I mentioned Chow Yun Fat being in this movie he roughly
      had around 10 minutes of screen time if even that.


      In conclusion I cannot recommend this movie based on the second half of it,
      the fact the action scenes were a mess and the characters seemed to be written
      sloppily and had no real purpose excluding Sun Wukong and the Demon King who
      were the only two to be established.'
