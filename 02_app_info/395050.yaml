    review: 'A captivating novel. The author defenitly knew what he was doing, using
      subtle (and not so subtle) shifts in vocabulary depending on the current protagonist,
      and painting a vivid picture of the Cyberpunk world of Satellite Reign. I especially
      liked the chapter transitions.


      Took me around 3h 15min to read the 144 pages in one go. Since i''m a fast reader,
      but had to look up some english words (without internet in a physical dictionary!)
      i guess this cancels out, and you can expect three to three and a half hours
      of a read.


      Since i picked this up when criminally underpriced in a sale, i defenitly recomend
      this prequel novella.'
