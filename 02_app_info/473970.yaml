    review: "\"Select this building and click the icon\"\n\nWhich building? There's\
      \ like 10 and they all look the same and nothing is labeled.\n\nWhat icon? My\
      \ interface is covered in tiny icons, none of them labeled, nothing marked.\n\
      \nThe interface is a sloppy mess, sure you can figure it out, but there's no\
      \ excuse for how bad it is right from the start. Even the tutorial assumes you\
      \ already know what all the buttons are. Well no, I don't know what the buttons\
      \ are and that's why I'm playing the tutorial you freaking Muppet. When you\
      \ make a sloppy cluttered interface where everything looks the same, you either\
      \ provide a tutorial that shows you what the buttons do, or just get out of\
      \ my way and let me figure it out on my own.\n\nNope, this gives you a sloppy\
      \ interface and then gets in your way with instructions that don't bother to\
      \ instruct you how to use anything correctly.\n\nFine, skip your useless tutorial,\
      \ I'll figured it out myself. \n\nWait, this is it? This is the entire game?\
      \ The least interesting part of an RTS followed by the slowest Tower Defense\
      \ combat I've seen in a while?\n\nThis is some attempt at a hybrid mashup of\
      \ RTS base building mixed with tower defense wait and hope combat mechanics.\
      \ It certainly thinks it's clever and maybe there was a good idea in here somewhere;\
      \ but it got lost under the terrible interface, the awkward clutter of buildings\
      \ that all look alike and a souless attempt at humor with some of the cheesiest\
      \ voice acting to come out in recent years.\n\nClick on an enemy unit and you\
      \ get some child going \"grrr\" at you, as if you are supposed to be afraid\
      \ of an 8 year old girl who thinks she's a scary zombie.\n\nClick on one of\
      \ your own units and you'll get a rotating set of generic uninspired one liners\
      \ that sound like they were recorded as filler but accidently left in the game\
      \ when they ran out of budget to hire voice actors.\n\nI've played for all of\
      \ 10 minutes and I've already heard the same squeaky child say \"yes commander\"\
      \ more than 100 times for every possible action.\n\nAs a concept this probably\
      \ had potential, but it's very poorly executed and with such lackluster production\
      \ quality that it just doesn't hold my attention at all. \n\nIf you catch it\
      \ on sale for $1 or less and hate yourself, go for it, but honestly you can\
      \ find free games better than this. Not worth anywhere near its full $10 asking\
      \ price.\n\nI got this as part of a bundle so I don't feel too ripped off, but\
      \ I can't recommend bothering to buy it on purpose.\n---\n\nEDIT: Take a look\
      \ at the achievements, less than 2% of owners have bothered to complete the\
      \ final mission, more than 98% of owners abandoned this game. There's your real\
      \ review.\n---\n\nEDIT 2: I can force myself to finish the game, but I can't\
      \ force myself to like it. Many hours later my only regret was wasting the time\
      \ to play it.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While\
