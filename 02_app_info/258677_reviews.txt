I do like the cabview including the gimmick pie in the oven that gives this pack a bit of a sense of humour in my opinion. There is a couple of career scenarios included and a set of brown and cream mk1 carriages to match the Class 35 Hymek. But that is where the fun factors end with this pack which is a shame as this can be a great add-on if the following issues are corrected which I have covered below.\n\nThe bad points:\nThe handling is a bit unpredictable as its \"all or nothing\" when applying the brakes on the locomotive and this can mean the difference between stopping at the station successfully or overshooting the platform. The brakes do need to be tweaked so that the brake force isn't erratic. But the tipping point for me and this issue is what really kills the enjoyment of this add-on is the \"Hybrid\" sounds because the sounds that come with this locomotive are terrible and sound absolutely nothing like a real Class 35 Hymek when it chugs along with that Maybach musical note from its supercharger. The sounds are like a hybrid of a Class 20 and a Class 37 remixed and blended into each other and its not suitable for this locomotive. There is really no excuse because there is a couple of these actual locomotives in preservation such as the East Lancashire Railway and perhaps a recording session should be arranged so that this pack has some authentic sounds from the real locomotive as intended. \n\nVerdict:\nThe full price is Â£11.99 isn't worth it due to the poor handling and the terrible hybrid sounds. So its only recommended in the Steam sales for the time being and would make a nice AI train. I do hope that the creator of this pack will record some proper Hymek sounds and make an update in the future to an otherwise very good and well made Class 35 locomotive. So there is lots of potential to make this into a great pack if these issues are addressed.\n\nOverall Rating: 5/10.","timestamp_created":1448604590,"timestamp_updated":1448604590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.643028378486633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+/vjo9ECffHQSQ=="}
