I played in 51 minutes all the game and have unlocked all weapons. \n\nPro\n+ Grafik is ok (on some levels even great :)\n+ Weapons are implemented in a good way (laser for aim)\n+ Makes fun for some rounds\n+ A good game for the 50% off sale\n\nContra\n- Not much content at the moment\n- More balance needed. The turret kills everything till level 3, with the mini-spider bot you can go till level 4 or 5 without shooting any bullet. \n- You can't deactivate the turret or the spider bot. That makes each map borring till level 7\n\n\nExample\n- I played the map space till level 5 to receive the spider\n- then map sky till the machine-gun and then till the turret\n- back to map space till level 10 ->upgrade for the spider\n->now with this combo, nothing can stop you :(","timestamp_created":1500556706,"timestamp_updated":1500556706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558232903480529785","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjciJsN0Ce7y5gAE="}
