Now that I own it.  I feel Excalibur is an okay table.  Not quite as good as I was hoping.   When  I first saw Epic Quest I wasn't sure I would like it.  After playing it quite a bit.  It's one of my favorites.  It's very playable, clear objectives, and the music and talk / sounds are amusing.   \n\nThis pack is worth the price just for Epic Quest in my opinion.  Excalibur is just icing on the cake.","timestamp_created":1602345357,"timestamp_updated":1602345357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47LnOifUCeY+GpwI="}
