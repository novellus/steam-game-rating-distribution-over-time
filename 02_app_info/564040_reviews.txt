While using the warp to dodge enemy attacks and attack enemies is fun, what isn't fun is the game being laden with instant-kill traps that you need to warp to avoid. After the first stage the game is full of enemies and obstacles that shoot out of the terrain or from off-screen without warning, and your shield does nothing to stop contact damage from killing you instantly, so instead of the game being about using your warp to respond to incoming attacks and position yourself better, the game is mainly about trial and error of getting killed by unforseeable hazards and then avoiding them next time, since every death means going back to the last checkpoint. The game's final boss is actually what I wanted it to be; minimal contact hazards and plenty of bullets to dodge through while alternating offence and defence with your warp, and was by far the most fun part of the game. It's a shame the stage design is so goddamn obnoxious.","timestamp_created":1605344445,"timestamp_updated":1605344445,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pIj/4vUCdemjrgI="}
