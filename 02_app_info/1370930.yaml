    about_the_game: This is the Original Soundtrack for Get-A-Grip Chip - an outrageously
      fun indie platformer, wherein you play as a robot laborer making a glorious
      escape from an exploitative factory of horrors. It's good and righteous fun,
      and the soundtrack, I pray, reflects that.
