    review: 'A great add-on if you liked The Warlock of Firetop Mountain. (See my
      separate review of the initial game.)

      This DLC adds three new characters and they enter the dungeon via a new entrance
      going thru a section full of goblins & orcs before rejoining the original dungeon
      part way thru. Therefore more new missions & achievements to complete.

      There is also the gauntlet mode, where you can playthru the original dungeon
      as a monster character to defeat the warlock (six different ones with various
      strengths) in a version which has little actual plot but is combat-heavy.

      I bought this at half-price, which made it superb vfm.'
