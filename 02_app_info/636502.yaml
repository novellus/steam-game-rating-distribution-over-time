      \ springing up everywhere as the world clamors for office space here among the\
      \ history and pageantry of England\u2019s capital. In London Life, you will\
      \ be challenged to create gleaming office towers for titans of trade, elite\
      \ global stock exchanges and moguls of media. Your towers will be crowned with\
      \ soaring antennae and space-facing satellite dishes to access the global information\
      \ network. <br><br><strong>London Calling</strong><br>London Life adds 12 new\
      \ office tenants, all looking for space to let within the coveted confines of\
      \ this regal city. Financiers have always flocked to London; from small banks\
      \ to sprawling stock exchanges, everybody wants to be near the global hub of\
      \ commerce in the City. But in recent years, creatives of all types have also\
      \ found the city\u2019s spirit irresistible: from small recording studios and\
      \ indie game developers, to bustling newsrooms and lofty movie studios, all\
      \ are attracted by London\u2019s bright lights and pulsing glamor. <br><br><strong>Rule\

      \ Traditional pubs and elegant restaurants impart a bit of English charm to\
      \ your dining and drinking destinations. Luxuriant lobbies with chic chandeliers\
      \ create impressive entryways. When combined with a variety of opulent outdoor\
      \ decorations and posh new artworks, your new London premises will radiate refinement\
      \ and prestige."
