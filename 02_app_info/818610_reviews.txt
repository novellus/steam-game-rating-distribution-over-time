I played the majority of the game in offline mode because of a glitch that could crash the game in online mode. As proof of my actual playtime, look for my LP of the game on Youtube.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\n\n[i]The Great Gaias[/i] is a RPG Maker game based on the developers' Tenat D&D campaign, and as such has a lot of worldbuilding concerning the gods, different races, and countries. The main protagonist is Pots, a thief guild member who quits after a mission forces him to do something he regrets. After escaping from a slave ship with some new party members, Pots and his new friends discover they're actually the chosen ones of a prophecy, which may be the chance for redemption that he's looking for.\n\n\n[h1]Writing Quality[/h1]\n\nLike I mentioned in a forum post, Pots's sinful deed feels awkwardly written, since he regrets the deed while he's in the middle of it. His completion of the deed is necessary for a villainous character's development, but I feel like there should have been an additional factor to incentivize Pots into betraying his conscience and finishing the deed.\n\nWhile Pots is the main character, many other characters get their chance to shine with their own inner conflicts and personal sidequests, but some of them, such as Hiro and Caelia, get left with little to no meaningful character arcs. It just feels like they exist merely to ensure that we can fill out all the slots in the character selection map. I feel like Hiro in particular had a lot of potential due to his blood relations with one of the major villains, but the two don't seem to acknowledge their blood relation at all.\n\nMy favorite part of the game is when where we explore the main enemy nation, which does a good job of showing how the fascist government uses propaganda, military worship, and secretly enforces famine to manipulate citizens against the elves. Additionally, it's shown that the citizens are otherwise normal people and some of them can see through their government's BS, though some like Eldromus are beyond redemption. I find that a lot of games that try to make their bad guys racist and fascist often skip the important developments that lead to such ideas being normalized, so I'm glad this game put effort into covering that. That said, I wish we could see what life is like for the second-class, non-military associated members of the empire.\n\nAlso, the fascist part isn't hyperbole, since one of the military school teachers quotes the Norsefire from V for Vendetta.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\ntl;dr play easy or normal instead of Core Rules for the most consistent experience, unless you want bragging rights for Youtube.\n\nIn most games, skills and normal attacks tend to have similar accuracy unless stated otherwise. On Core Rules, physical skills have accuracy penalties while having fairly powerful effects. Personally, I would have preferred weaker but more accurate skills so that there's still some challenge while reducing the RNG factor, since I'm the type of person who is nettled by wasted turns and resources. The accuracy rate is saner on the easier difficulties, so I recommend going for those if you have a similar mindset.\n\nFor resource management, AP is random and rather low at the start of each battle, which is understandable because some of the later AP skills are too powerful to use at the start of battle. The MP situation is pretty bad in the beginning though, since your mages have low starting MP and therefore won't benefit much from their equipment's passive MP regen. Like with physical skills, this is supposed to be balanced by how magic skills are powerful enough to justify their cost. However, the mages really need to have an even lower tier of magic spells that do less damage and cost less than 5 MP, since the 5 MP spells are overkill for early enemies. Again, the lower difficulties alleviate this by giving you more starting MP.\n\nLike [i]Nocturne: Rebirth[/i], you can change equipment in the middle of battle without using up a turn, which really helps if you're playing blind and don't know what ailments the enemies will use. You can also do 1000 IQ maneuvers like equipping a new auto-revive accessory after using the old one up.\n\nThe bosses are balanced with the expectation that you're using buffs and debuffs wisely. Some of them also have interesting mechanics, like the bonus bosses of the final sidequest, though some mechanics will take a lot of trial and error to figure out unless you read the Steam guide. Still, it's better than simply fighting vanilla beatsticks all the time.\n\nThe game is really grindy, since you have to manage 16 characters by the end of the game. In such a situation, you'd expect that maybe the inactive party members would get half or quarter EXP, but they get absolutely no EXP. Oh, and there are story events that will force you to use specific characters or exclude specific characters, which means you cannot just bet everything on your favorite party. I get that the developers want players to use all the characters and watch them grow in levels, but according to the forum posts, people are trying to stick to only their faves, only to be frustrated when they run into events that force them to use their neglected party members. The only thing that makes up for this is that you will find situations where some characters are better suited than others, but there's also a very obvious tier list in terms of their overall usefulness and some characters feel like Masters of None, making it tempting to play favorites in leveling them.\n\nThere is a lot of equipment with special effects, and everyone has their own unique green/purple text gear. However, mid-to-late game enemies are very spammy with very game-changing status effects, making it feel like you can't really equip any Jewel other than status resist ones. There really needs to be a second jewel slot, allowing players to try out other types of jewels without fearing divine retribution from the enemy.\n\nThe New City portion of the game is a town building minigame, but it's implemented in the worst way possible. Instead of recruiting unique, meaningful, and interesting NPCs, you just enter and exit specific type of buildings to recruit anonymous NPCs of specific walks of life. Since every iteration of the town has its own Celestium Shards, you will have to spend quite a lot of time evicting and recruiting people just to get everything.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\n7/10, an average but long game. There's interesting plot elements the further you go, but some early game writing and balancing could leave a bad first impression. Also, I feel like having a huge cast of characters hurts the game more than helps it, since not all of them are sufficiently developed and the EXP system and endgame crafting situation can't really handle them all.","timestamp_created":1603661635,"timestamp_updated":1605575812,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwutTx6fUCepaRqgI="}
