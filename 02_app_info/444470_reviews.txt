It has retro graphics, quite somber mood and some nice premade locations. Derelict chambers of the castle seem to tell a story of a forgotten kingdom buried under the earth and there are some light environmental puzzles as well. However, overall the game is not that fun to play. \n\nCombat is really slow and tedious, enemies are brainless and unvaried brawlers with just different graphics and UI is somewhat clunky. RPG elements, ranged weapons and magic are all pretty much pointless, all you gonna do the entire game is basically just swinging one sword and eating health items. There are a lot of bugs, even though the author tries to fix them regularly. \n\nBut the biggest drag is total lack of any map functionality, which makes navigating the maze of random, virtually indistinguishable corridors extremely confusing and boring - and on top of that, you will have to backtrack all levels after completing the game goal of finding a gemstone or something.\n\nIt is a real shame that this title is not more polished. It would be better if instead of random map generation there were hand made levels - as given the author's knack for environment building it could significantly improve the experience. Right now supposed added replayability is not really much of an advantage, as the game will most likely bore you and wear your patience after an hour or two.\n\nMy playtime of 10 hours is by no means indicative of the amount of game content, it can be completed in 1-2 hours. I'm just a masochist that likes finding and reporting bugs in indie titles :D\n\nIf you're interested in this kind of game, but done right - \"Delver\" might be for you.","timestamp_created":1594516592,"timestamp_updated":1594516592,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514258086681365967","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2IqmoPMCccLYlAI="}
