    review: "For what is advertised as a dark comedy drama this story seems largely\
      \ void of dark comedy or drama, and is mostly just a monotonous internal monologue\
      \ simulation.\n\n\nWhile it is expected for a story to take time to escalate,\
      \ forty minutes in and absolutely nothing has happened besides the protagonist\
      \ relentlessly talking to themself about the most ordinary boring things. Forty\
      \ minutes it takes for the story to progress from the protagonist arriving at\
      \ the airport, taking a taxi, then arriving and falling asleep in their new\
      \ apartment. The protagonist has almost nothing interesting or funny to say\
      \ about anything, all they can do is perpetually ramble about extremely ordinary\
      \ and unexciting things. It doesn't even serve much to establish their character\
      \ as the main thing the reader learns is their academic background and basic\
      \ childhood. Forty minutes for that information, forty minutes of that information\
      \ continuously rehashed for zero advantage.\n\nIt seems like this might be translated\
      \ but even so the fundamental way that the protagonist talks feels scripted.\
      \ They add unnecessary descriptive words and terms onto their phrasing as if\
      \ they're purposely trying to speak like a written narrative, which is generally\
      \ not how humans talk. Nor do humans internally monologue by standing still\
      \ and relentlessly musing about random aspects of their past and whatever else\
      \ they can think up. The protagonist even gives readers a play by play of what\
      \ they're doing, \"Oh I'd better go to the lobby now and blah blah blah\" why\
      \ are they thinking this instead of just doing it; why is their monologue scripted\
      \ so inorganically. The story appears to be entirely founded on their internal\
      \ monologue yet their internal monologue isn't written like an actual genuine\
      \ monologue; it's like a combination of a narrative description and a backstory\
      \ description pretending to be the internal monologue of a character.\n\nIt\
      \ doesn't seem like any other characters in the story have talksprites. Which\
      \ is boring, immersion breaking and only continues to place more emphasis on\
      \ the rambling protagonist. The protagonist themself looks great, although some\
      \ of their talksprite sets are strangely unaligned. The default, suit wearing\
      \ state of the protagonist is fine but other sets of their talksprites like\
      \ the one where they have their airport luggage are inconsistent. In those sets,\
      \ whenever their expression changes their position on the screen also slightly\
      \ changes because apparently the different images are not aligned properly so\
      \ every pose is inexplicably standing in a slightly different place. \n\nAdditionally,\
      \ the backgrounds are a strange combination of seemingly drawn images and also\
      \ images that look like bad three dimensional models. The grocery store, which\
      \ can be seen in the screenshots, looks especially bad. Some of the backgrounds\
      \ are also incomplete as they randomly lack details like; an entire section\
      \ of the world. The airport exterior has absolutely nothing in the distance,\
      \ the entire world is just an open blue sky there's no grass fields or distant\
      \ city or anything. Many of the city backgrounds also lack buildings in the\
      \ distance, giving the impression that the world is just a blue void. And everytime\
      \ the protagonist does go to a new location the dialogue box feels the need\
      \ to tell the reader the exact name and time of the new setting before the next\
      \ scene begins, further breaking the flow of the story.\n\n\nForty minutes in\
      \ and the protagonist is still in their apartment, still talking to themself\
      \ about pointlessness. I'm desperately reading through the text hoping something\
      \ interesting will happen soon and nothing does, the self indulgent monologue\
      \ just keeps going. That is not a feeling a story should ever give to its reader,\
      \ at any point. Especially in the beginning, which is supposed to be the hook.\
      \ \n\nMaybe this story actually is a dark comedy drama slice-of-life but apparently\
      \ it takes at least forty minutes to become that. Perhaps it takes even longer\
      \ to become that, or it never becomes that. Either way after forty minutes of\
      \ listening to monotonous rambling I'd lost interest. Readers could actually\
      \ get this same experience from just finding a selfish human and attempting\
      \ to socialize with them, resulting in the human rambling for forty minutes\
      \ egocentrically about themself. That's actually just what this is, for at least\
      \ the first forty minutes.\n\nIf you're interested in finding some games that\
      \ I do positively recommend they can be found on my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38950844-Anoemalous/]\
      \ here [/url]."
