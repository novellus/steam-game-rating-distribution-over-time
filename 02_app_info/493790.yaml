    review: 'Like many VR games, this was neat when it came out but now just feels
      more like a dated tech demo. It''s probably fun for kids and it really has a
      lot of unique and creative variety when it comes to archery games. Don''t expect
      much expect for some fun mini games and lots of hidden easter eggs and minigames
      to find.


      If I could give it a neutral rating I would. Get it on sale if you really want
      to check it out or add it to your collection.'
