    review: "The concept is great and there are very little games as this on the market.\
      \ That is a big plus but...\nCannot shake the feeling I'm playing some moded\
      \ Systemshock2...\nDo NOT trust the Dev public screenshots... game looks ok\
      \ but not as detailed as in those screenshots.\nTwo things are a bust:\n1. Interaction\
      \ mechanics - they feel \"plastic\" is you know what I mean.  \n2. Animations\
      \ [,ostly enemy] - stuff a corpse full of straw and tell it to run around and\
      \ you get something better than you have in the game. \nThose two things are\
      \ a big STOP sign for me... the game feels like an Alpha version. Seriously.\n\
      At the current state I cannot recommend it to anyone."
