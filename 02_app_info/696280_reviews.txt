The visuals and music are beautiful. I actually feel frustrated at the size of the world, because there is SO much to explore and a lot of it feels copy-pasted. As an achievement hunter, I'm gonna feel the need to play again so I can get the rest of the achievements, but I'll take a break first.\n\nThis is the only game that's ever given me vertigo-- the mechanics are a bit clunky sometimes and the perspective can flip quickly, so beware if you are sensitive to this. I found the best way to play is in a dark room with blue light glasses.","timestamp_created":1608822860,"timestamp_updated":1608822860,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511278212070465088","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjpXUyvYCconmvAI="}
