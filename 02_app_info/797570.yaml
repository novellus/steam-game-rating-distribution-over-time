    about_the_game: "Up to 4 players can cheer along with squad leader Samantha in\
      \ this fast-paced game of telegraph cheerleading. When she yells &quot;Gimme\
      \ a B!&quot;, respond by entering in the real Morse code for the letter B. <strong>Go\
      \ Morse Go! Arcade Edition</strong> has four game modes that will put your Morse\
      \ code skills to the test:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Championship mode:\
      \ Race against human or CPU opponents to enter random letters the fastest. Fill\
      \ up your hype meter first to win!<br></li><li>Tournament mode: GMG!AE features\
      \ its own single-player campaign using Championship mode's rules - enter the\
      \ big tournament and face off against the best cheerleaders in the world, all\
      \ from the comfort of your home. <i>(This mode is automatically selected if\
      \ you play Championship mode with one player.)</i><br></li><li>Survival mode:\
      \ Cheerleading is a demanding sport, even via telegraph. Enter an endless set\

      \ mode: New to Arcade Edition, in this co-op mode, your squad has a set number\
      \ of rounds to fill a shared hype meter. Will you hype up the crowd, or make\
      \ them fall asleep?<br></li><li>Each mode has customizable rules that allow\
      \ you to adjust the length and difficulty of matches. Players can also customize\
      \ their appearance by unlocking new looks - accessorize, change your uniform,\
      \ or show your spirit as different characters such as the Fighting Scootsies'\

      \ tells you the exact dots-and-dashes translation, and learn Morse code along\
      \ the way (like I did while making this game). Seasoned telegraph veterans can\
      \ ramp the difficulty all the way up to Remorseless, a lightning-fast test of\
      \ your Morse code knowledge - there are also calibration tools available to\
      \ set the Morse timing to match their own personal speed and play the game at\
      \ their own pace.<br><br>Get hyped!"

    review: 'Really good if you''re interested in learning or practising typing Morse
      code. Encourages you to get better at it within the structure of a competitive
      game. Look at cute bunnies while learning real-world skills.

      It won''t help much if you want to practise deciphering/listening to Morse code,
      however.

      Don''t forget to maintain your skills by getting at least 100 rounds in remorseless
      practise mode every month :)'
