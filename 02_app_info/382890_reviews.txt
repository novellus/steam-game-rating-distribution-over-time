I love this game and if I still had a working controller for my ps2 I would've never bought this port. This port is terrible and its been years and they haven't fixed anything. There's still no cloud saving, controller still don't work officially and even with the fix you can do it still barely works, keybinds seem to reset themselves randomly, and my quicksaves just disappeared sometimes.\n\nIf you can avoid this port, do it. If that's not an option i guess get this on sale.","timestamp_created":1607733224,"timestamp_updated":1607733224,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612349510192871094","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq6iN8fYCf5CkuQI="}
