    review: "I've only struggled through around four hours so far- I purchased it\
      \ after being a big fan of the first two games, especially the most recent installment,\
      \ Gingiva.\nIt's a game in the same surreal, acid trip style as Middens and\
      \ Gingiva.\nMaybe it's my old PC, but it runs surprisingly poorly for a game\
      \ on this engine, partially because every action comes with large screen covering\
      \ effects.\nI feel like he tried to do something new with the combat system\
      \ and replace the turn-based combat that the first two games used. This is fine,\
      \ except that the engine runs very well with turn-based combat and does not\
      \ facilitate a beat-em-up style approach. It doesn't work very well in RPG Maker.\n\
      I don't mind the moon logic of how to progress-that's part of the charm, even\
      \ if I have to view a walkthrough once or twice to find NPCs who have wandered\
      \ behind some set dressing.\nI'll struggle through a bit more, but it feels\
      \ like a better funded step down. Maybe I'm not an esoteric enough thinker,\
      \ but it feels like the word salad which is so iconic of Takamo is less focused,\
      \ so it feels like he's just filling out text boxes to make the world feel less\
      \ empty. It feels like I'm reading my middle school essays, trying to satiate\
      \ a word count when I've got nothing else to say. I'm not even having a good\
      \ time.\n\n I'd suggest you save your money. Stop at Gingiva, and you'll end\
      \ on a high note."
