I saw it on steam and thought I'd give it another go.  I was not expecting to have so much fun. \nThere is a bit of a complicated upgrade system I don't think I fully understood back in the day, Maybe that is why I didn't get too far then,  but everything seems to be clicking now.  It is far more tactical than it is Hack and slash.  I really enjoy luring enemies into sappers traps, or burning them out with my archers' flaming arrows.","timestamp_created":1609608973,"timestamp_updated":1609608973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rPmK4vYCd9jlvwI="}
