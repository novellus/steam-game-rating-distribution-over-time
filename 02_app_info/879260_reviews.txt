Admittedly the translation is a bit odd at times, but still gives an overall sense of story. The skill unlocks are rather simple, yet sensical. There is a fair bit of grinding, but for those of you who like that sorta thing like me, you'll feel right at home. The art is standout for an indie like this, even  if there is some palatte swapping at times, it's sort of a cross between anime and ancient Japanese drawings. Definitely recommended!","timestamp_created":1596923040,"timestamp_updated":1596923040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.468458414077758789","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkPqB6PMCdNmimgI="}
