It was such a naughty review, with such scandalous content, that my review got \"banned\" (though you can still view it via my Truly Horrible Horror Games curator page for some strange reason). The time has finally come to make good my penance.\n\n   The soundtrack for this game, while nothing remotely special, is certainly competent; though I wouldn't go recommending it to anyone who doesn't dig low-fi synths and fake timpanis as much as I do, even at the cost of 99 cents. But credit where credit's due: it's a fairly nifty little horror soundtrack, especially if you're not lactose intolerant ('cause it IS kinda cheesy, albeit in a good way, unlike the game itself).\n\n   See, devs, it was simple. All you had to do was take away the \"vision\" part, and your game ain't so bad after all. \n\n   Verdict: 7.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1526396971,"timestamp_updated":1540737865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579943239688873291","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40sLI3eYCdp21oAE="}
