You play as Molly - a girl with a dream of entering the aforementioned competition, however the mayor and townsfolks won't make it any easier for her. It's up to the player to find a way of entering the competition - including scaring off parrots and dropping horses on people.\n\nEverything is presented in a goregous pixel art style, that makes me think I'm 10 once again, and playing a cool point 'n click on my trusty DOS machine. Just looking all the idle townfolks, backgrounds and little details puts a smile on my face. The music is fitting as well - I really dig that some locations have a variation of the same theme, and it subtly fades to the appropriate one as you travel.\n\nThe game is rather short (around 2 hours if you take your time and click at different things), but it makes up with the loads of charm and well written funny dialogue. While there are some minor things that could be done better, they don't really matter that much. Definitely recommended and well worth the price - especially if you're an adventure game fan.","timestamp_created":1609158022,"timestamp_updated":1609158022,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536178112030029297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt9rS1PYCceeKvgI="}
