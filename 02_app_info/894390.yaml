    reviews: "\u201CBernie's Nightmare is a fun, exhilarating game that puts your\
      \ wits to the test. It requires thought, and at the same time, hooks you into\
      \ the game at the very first second. 100% amazing. Well done. Developed well.\
      \ Amazing. Fantastic. Purely fun.\u201D<br>10/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/bernies-nightmare\"\

      \ game!!! I can't believe that this game was developed by a single 15 year old\
      \ developer!! Guys, just the fact that he is 15 is amazing and the game was\
      \ also very good. I really hope the developer keeps going on making games or\
      \ maybe make Bernie's nightmare a game series.\u201D<br>10/10 \u2013 <a href=\"\
      https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/bernies-nightmare\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Metacritic</a><br><br>\u201CBefore reading\
      \ my opinion on the game, please consider that this game was made by a single\
      \ fifteen year old and that in itself is impressive.   There are many pros and\
      \ cons to the game, and some things that could be improved on, as well as some\
      \ of my own personal suggestions.   Lets start with the pros:   While the game\
      \ in itself may not appear to be that scary, it may certainly catch you buy\
      \ surprise (and maybe even make you jump) given the fact that the enemy has\
      \ no audio cues that give away its location except for a constant crying sound,\
      \ however, the game keeps you on edge due to the fact that this single noise\
      \ will quiet the closer she gets, therefor she is able to catch you by surprise\
      \ because she will be virtually silent when she is nearby.   The game will immediately\
      \ throw you into it, without any clear context or objective for you to follow,\
      \ you have to figure it out as you progress. This is both good in bad, the good\
      \ is that it can bring a bit of freedom to the player, but on the flip side,\
      \ if the player gets lost they are basically going to remain lost.   The game\
      \ also provides and hiding mechanic similar to games such as Outlast in order\
      \ to lose the enemy, you are able to hide in/under beds, tables, cabinets and\
      \ more. The game is even more punishing and challenging because if you get caught,\
      \ you have to restart from the beginning. I have found no save points in the\
      \ game.   Overall I think that this game is worth at least a try, its only $2\
      \ after all.   Now lets move on to the cons:   The game settings could be improved\
      \ on, as of this moment there is no way to adjust you volume and mouse settings\
      \ in the game.   The AI for the enemy is a little inconsistent, sometimes when\
      \ you hide she will just remain there and may take a while to leave, but this\
      \ doesn't happen often.   The music is remains the same and there is no way\
      \ to adjust it, this is not game breaking by any means but it can become a bit\
      \ of an annoyance after a while.   The character movement is a bit slow, but\
      \ i guess this is intended to make it difficult to outrun the enemy.   Overall\
      \ I could see some minor improvements but I have enjoyed playing the game, and\
      \ i definitely recommend it for the price\u201D<br>10/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/bernies-nightmare\"\
