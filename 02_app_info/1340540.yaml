    review: "This is the first game I've played in the series. I don't know if it\
      \ is the beginning, middle or the ending, but what I can say for sure is that\
      \ not a single HOPA game I've played so far tackles with the basilik. An ancient\
      \ creature; this being is said to be half rooster, half dragon. Just like a\
      \ manticore; it is made of different body parts belonging to two up to four\
      \ animals. Here, in this game, you must defeat two basiliks. As a cryptozoologist,\
      \ you must put your knowledge at work in order to save the people of Serpent\
      \ Hill. \n\nPROS:\n- Beautiful scenery;\n- Chilling music;\n- Three set of collectibles;\n\
      - Main Game + Bonus Chapter + Secret Room (I've found this feature in the Haunted\
      \ Hotel series);\n- Fast-traveling map;\n- Diverse HO games;\n- Intriguing mini-games\
      \ (personally, I haven't seen these type of mini-games until now);\n- In-game\
      \ achievements.\n\nNEUTRE:\n- I would have loved some plot twists; \n- I was\
      \ constantly thinking that maybe this new sheriff might be one of them.\n\n\
      CONS:\n- No journal entries;\n- No trading cards.\n\nOverall, a good game to\
      \ play with your family. Get it while on discount."
