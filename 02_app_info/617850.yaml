      \ /><br><br>KYE Creations are all about the community getting involved with\
      \ feedback and ideas on mechanics and features we are developing during our\
      \ alpha stages. We realise not everyone who purchases alpha games wants to help\
      \ test and progress game development, but we would appreciate anyone playing\
      \ the alpha version to report any bugs or contact our team on the many platforms\
      \ available, including Steam, Discord or social media.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHAT\
      \ IS THE CURRENT STATE OF THE GAME</h2>Jaws of Extinction is currently in its\
      \ alpha stages, this is a state of the game, that is still heavily in development\
      \ and not released on Steams official Early Access program. Our store is currently\
      \ hidden from the Steam client base, because we feel, as a team, that JoE is\
      \ NOT currently ready for public consumption and should only be purchased  if\
      \ you wish to join in on testing the game in early stages.<br><br>The game has\
      \ many issues, including bugs with mechanics, missing content and performance\
      \ related issues on low and midrange machines.<br><br><i>If you wish to ask\
      \ the community if the game is playable on your current system set up, we suggest\
      \ joining our Steam or Discord community, links provided below.</i><br><br><strong>Discord:</strong>\

      \ BE AVAILABLE</h2>We are currently fine tuning current mechanics, lighting\
      \ and performance and once we are happy, you guys are happy we will start to\
      \ stagger protagonist character releases bringing with it online coop play,\
      \ starting with two player online coop or local, leading to three player, four\
      \ player and eventually dedicated servers provided by our partner GTX Gaming\

      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://www.gtxgaming.co.uk</a>), you\

      \ tebex system to help monitize your server and community.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >WHEN WILL THE MAIN STORY BE AVAILABLE</h2>As each protagonist character is\
      \ released we will also be releasing an introduction story (Single-Player) level\
      \ (optional to play) teaching you the basics of the game and the characters\
      \ abilities. We also have a team of four story artists that are hot on the button\
      \ of creating, all types of quest, enviromental naratives, character stories\
      \ and the main story and lore to Jaws of Extinction.<br><br>The main story will\
      \ be released in chapters (Non DLC &amp; FREE Updates) to make sure that each\
      \ part of the story works well and progresses in single player and multiplayer.<br><br><strong>For\

      \ of fun!) but if your rig DOES NOT meet the RECOMMENDED spec then the game\
      \ may not perform well and as much as we appreciate your support we would suggest\
      \ that you wait until later in development before you invest your money. We\
      \ don\u2019t want you buying something that\u2019s going to disappoint you.</i><br><strong>Please\

    review: "This game has a big potential. It has progressed much since last year\
      \ i played for the first time.\nThose of who gives a negative review you might\
      \ have not read producers note properly, that they initially reluctant to make\
      \ this public because they were aware of the issues. but they had to make this\
      \ game public because they need funds to keep on developing the game. Which\
      \ also shows they dont want to give up on this game, this is obviously seen\
      \ from the updates.\nSo dont come here venting out your anger by giving a negative\
      \ review thus may destroy a nice game with decent potentials.\n\n\nstill some\
      \ things to expect: \n1, being a game at test stage, bug and crashes are expected.\
      \ I encounted 2 fatal error crash in 32min of game time.\n2, the game needs\
      \ optimization. it is pretty leggy for an unreal engine game.\n3, I dont really\
      \ see the need to introduce dx12 compatibility. the framedrop of dx12 introduced\
      \ outweights the improvement of graphics.\nother than these for the price it\
      \ is till very good if you enjoy games like Conan or Ark."
