So far, I really liked my experience. It might not look like it when you look at the text below, but these are little bugs mostly. Overall, it’s clearly worth it. There is so much information but well presented in this, it’s awesome.\n\n[b]What I liked the most:[/b]\n-The graphics are really good\n-There are more and better animations (sometimes a bit disgusting but that is really how the body works! lol) I really liked the intestine movement and the eye\n-Lots of information about each parts\n-It is very instructive\n\n[b]What I didn’t like:[/b]\n-I wish you could zoom in as much as you want, even if it means going through the 3D. Right now you are blocked after zooming a bit in and you can pull the object toward you but it is also blocked at some point.\n-The main menu bar right in front of you is locked in. It’d be nice to be able to grab and move it on the side to have a full clear view in front of you\n-All menus are always rendered on top of what you look at. Which means sometimes if you are very close to an object, the menu will not render the same way on each eye making it very confusing for your brain to interpret the position of the menu. I think it should simply be based on distance, and maybe if something goes through, just make it transparent ?\n-The interior view of the lung is removed compared to the free version, why? It was very nice to be inside the lung and see the air flow and restrictions with diseases\n-The blood flow within the heart seems to be removed too, it’d be nice to have it back.\n-The loading screen when transitioning part was the thing that makes the most motion sickness because you pass from being able to move your head around as much as you want to a still image which is really looking bad. At the very least, it should allow your head to still move around while loading and not have a still image.\n-There are some pointing priority bugs between menus. For example, you can pull toward you the description menu with text, while behind there is the menu to pick individual parts and when you scroll it sometimes gets buggy with the pointer going through the menu.\n-There is also a little bug on some menus where when you point at the edge of the menu, it oscillates fast between getting bigger (because you “moved your pointer inside”) and smaller (because some parts are transparent and you point outside the menu). This could be fixed if there were no holes in the menu.\n-The circle you move in the menus to pick the divisions you want to see seems to be irresponsive. You can click it to move, but only when moving it enough does it starts to move and quite often becomes offset from the pointer. In general, whatever part of the menu you click-and-hold like sliders or that picking circle, you should be able to move it even when your cursor moves out of the menu or the slider. (Imagine your internet scrollbar if you click-and-hold and move your mouse outside the scrollbar you can still scroll, same thing would apply here)\n-The menus kept resetting its position to default when changing object which was a bit annoying because the description menu is a bit too far if you want to read, so you have to grab it and get it close to your face. I wish I could just move it where I want and make it stay there between scenes.\n-You also removed the polyps in the intestines disease?\n-It also happened that some tooltips when you wait pointing at a button appeared behind another menu making it impossible to read.\n-It also happened that when trying to point something at the bottom of a menu the other menu under it would pop up and I couldn’t click on what I wanted. I had to move the menu away. (Even when trying to point from a top-down direction instead of bottom-up.\n\n[b]Suggestions:[/b]\n-More free camera movement on zooming and moving up/down\n-Remove menu’s rendering priority and add transparency to what is in front of the menu\n-There are quite a couple typos with mostly apostrophes in text that renders as a big square\n-Add back the lungs interior view\n-Add blood flow in the heart\n-Change the still image from transition’s loading to something you can look at\n-It’d be nice to be able to visually point at parts of what you see and have the name of it appears and if you click it, it would open the description. Right now your pointer just goes through the visuals.\n-Add some background light music, it gets a bit boring when reading text that has no voice over (and whoever doesn’t want music you already have the sound menu for that)\n\n[b]What I look forward:[/b]\n-More interior views, these are awesome, really miss the lungs one\n-Skeleton view\n-More or Less interesting parts like hands, feet, legs, etc.\n-More animations like the eye\n-Visuals of what happen when you get fattier, where you accumulate fat, etc.\n","timestamp_created":1609629924,"timestamp_updated":1609629924,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqu/a4vYCdYTyvwI="}
