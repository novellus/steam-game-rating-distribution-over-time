    review: "its really not good by 2020 standards. \n\nVery basic wave shooter with\
      \ simple weapons, auto reload, easy enemies, no real story. You sit there and\
      \ kill everything. Took me 35 minutes to finish the whole game, including a\
      \ bathroom brake and replaying the first of three chapters multiple times to\
      \ figure out if there is recoil and which weapon is the best.\n\nToday you can\
      \ implement this very basic wave shooter in Unity and some asset store packages\
      \ quite easily. There are free VR games on steam that do it better than this."
