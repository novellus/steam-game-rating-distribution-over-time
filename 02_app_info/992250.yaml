    about_the_game: "Gravityball is the 22nd century sport of fast reflexes and bent\
      \ spacetime.  A mix of motocross and hockey, Gravityball is fast, exciting and\
      \ always in motion.  Ride hoverbikes around a floating platform to capture the\
      \ ball and launch it into the swirling vortex that is your opponents' goal.\
      \  The goals themselves have their own gravity, so close shots can be bent by\
      \ or even orbit the goal until they score.  The games themselves are played\
      \ in orbit around the various planets in our solar system, so try not to get\
      \ distracted by the beautiful sight of Jupiter while you're driving in for the\
      \ winning goal!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGravityball games can be played by 2, 3 or\
      \ 4 players in One-on-One, Two-on-Two or Free-for-all play.  Compete against\
      \ your friends in a split-screen format, or against AI of varying skills.  Create\
      \ Round-robin, Knockout or Group-format tournaments that are fully customizable.\
      \  Rack up stats and wins to earn achievements, rank-up your rider and unlock\
      \ new features!"
