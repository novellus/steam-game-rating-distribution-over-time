    short_description: At a captain's meeting in the Soul Society, Shusuke Amagai
      proposes to the Thirteen Court Guard Squads that they train directly with the
      squads. But Kenpachi Zaraki and Mayuri Kurotsuchi speak out against the idea,
      and the captains object due to their lack of interest.
