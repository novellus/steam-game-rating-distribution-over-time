The adventure, story part takes precedence  with some very unique puzzles thrown in . \nIt features  an engaging story about an often misjudged hero, of the 20th century  Tesla  and some parts of this story are true(well except for the time travel etc.) \nI really enjoyed it, but it is a tough one. \nThe puzzles are not exceedingly hard but really make the player think .\n I really tried to avoid the skip button and it was so satisfying to succeed!  \nThere is a map but no fast travel and indeed not much guidance , which is what adventure gamers are used to! \nYou have to pay attention to what you find and read. \nThe hogs are sporadic and not junk piles. \nHeartily recommended.","timestamp_created":1562882211,"timestamp_updated":1562884775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.646058142185211182","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xaPM8esCeOWTzgE="}
