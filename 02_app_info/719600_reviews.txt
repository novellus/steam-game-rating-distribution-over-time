So I tried to play the game again and, unfortunately, it seems the dev broke the game. I don't know if it's just broken on Oculus or not. Maybe it works on the Vive. Long story short, don't buy this game until this issue has been resolved. Until then, I am changing my review to negative.\n\n\n[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]\n\nIf you're worried about this game being in Japanese, no need to worry. You can play just fine. Almost everything is in English except for the title and a sticker I saw on the train. All the other menus and prompts were in English. Operation is easy. There's nothing complex. There are currently 2 train models and 3 tracks out of the box (4 tracks but one of them is bugged I think or locked - there may even be a 5th, the dev wrote something about it).\n\nI hestitate to even say this is a game. This is more like a short cinematic experince with limited interactions. So you can generally hit the gas/coal/whatever and hit the brakes. You can also switch the train to reverse. The tracks are of varying length. The shortest one was 3 minutes. In fact, they all seem to be about 3 minute stretches. However, the other 2 tracks have multiple stops. And they also have events that happen along the way. I'll leave it that so you can enjoy the surprise.\n\nSince there's not much game challenge here, there should be a zen type experience of operating a train. But it's just way too short. The graphics are good. The scenes are generally nice to look at, the cabin looks good. Some assets in the scenery didn't make sense. Still, it's fun / relaxing to play this game. I did notice an issue with my Touch controllers. It seemed like the hit detection was off. I generally had to move the Touch controllers some inches away from the intended object to manipulate them. Not a big deal, but immersion breaking.\n\nThere are actually leaderboards believe it or not. You get in the top by arriving exactly on time and by stopping at exactly the right spot. I got this 50% off at $6 on the Steam summer sale. I experienced one crash. And the forest track does not work at all or is locked in a peculiar way. I think I got my money's worth.\n\nRate 6.5/10. So much potential. Just please make more trains & tracks!","timestamp_created":1529875212,"timestamp_updated":1537331090,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561952471733093262","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpdqE+OUCf7eMpAE="}
