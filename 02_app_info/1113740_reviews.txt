I can't change the backup location, I can't manually start a backup of the common folder, there seems to be an option to individually backup a game but it shows TONS of games I don't even have so very, very hard to find which ones I want to target. The video shows a kind of tedious kind of way to do it.  I had such high hopes for this but the GUI is horrible. The help files don't cover much at all other than selecting which folders to back up.","timestamp_created":1597109104,"timestamp_updated":1597109337,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4us/I7fMCevTamgI="}
