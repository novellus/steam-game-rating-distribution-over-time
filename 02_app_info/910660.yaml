    developer_response: Hi there. Sorry you didn't enjoy it. We can't like everything.
      In regards to the bug, were you shuddering the cubes with the appropriate colour
      shudder bar? If you want to crack a red cube, you need the bar to be at the
      red stage, orange for orange cubes and so on. I had someone else say they couldn't
      crack the cubes and this turned out to be the issue.

    review: 'I guess I''ll be the first negative review.


      I spent most of my time trying to figure out why this game is supposed to be
      fun.  It''s not.


      And some bug prevents the Vortex Cube from shattering, so I cannot gather the
      game resource to unlock ships, etc.


      You pretty much just dodge snakes and collect the power-up meter items.  When
      your power meter grows you "shudder" the enemies then collect their body parts
      for ship upgrades like speed, score multiplier, etc.


      I suppose for some this might be fun, but I find it very boring.  And they sell
      it as a twin-stick shooter, but it is a single-stick dodging game with a single
      button to use the shudder mechanism.  This game is extremely boring. I tried
      my hardest to get into it and find the reason to keep trying, but it simply
      doesn''t hook me.'
