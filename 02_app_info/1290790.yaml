      in a garden!<br><br><strong>About</strong><br><br>In this game your goal is
      to gain control over the entire yard and you are competing against others.<br>You
      play as a hero, like a tomato - a strong unit - you can easily take out 2 or
      3 small mushrooms, but you won't stand a chance against bigger groups of enemies.<br>That's
      why the key to win is to gather your own forces and tactically place your troops
      at the right places at the right times.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul

      flowers will also grow petals over time and become stronger with them. when
      a flower is fully grown it'll spawn very strong units! the flowers grow faster

      a garden once in a while.<br><br></li><li> you can either decide to run around
      picking up troops and stationing them, but from time to time you'll also want
