I just as easily could have given it a thumbs down, but I decided it had enough good about it spare the developer.\n\nThe graphics are good, as one would expect, and I enjoyed the Egyptian theme.\n\nSome of the puzzles are quite challenging with no obvious solution to work toward, so a couple of them I solved as a matter of pure luck. Some of the puzzles, on the other hand, are mere tasks because  you're give the answer in front of you. In general, though, the puzzles were standard fare.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game is that the timer cannot be turned off. It seems basic to me that that should be an option, and I don't reckon it would be a monumental coding task.\n\nThe other big issue is that there is no way to save your progress or to pause the game. That, for me, is usually an automatic thumbs down. During my last play-through, when I actually managed to escape, my wife spilled tea on an extension cord and popped the main breaker. It was after dark, so I had to deal with it. I had to leave the clock running, which could have been a disaster with respect to finishing the game. Fortunately, I had plenty of time because I'd run through most it several times.\n\nNot having the option to turn off the clock or to pause/save the game is the mark of an amateur. I hope the developer does better next time.","timestamp_created":1607414280,"timestamp_updated":1607414280,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531059682369232178","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9O3WoPYCd56RuAI="}
