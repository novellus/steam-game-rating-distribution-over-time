    review: "Was looking for a VR blackjack. The graphics looked good in the preview\
      \ but the gameplay is very unpolished. Some TLC could make this game fun but\
      \ it's still a long way from being there. It looks like the last update was\
      \ in December '19, so I don't know where they are going with it.\n\n Needed\
      \ Additions that would make this game decent/work: \n\n-Better hand movements\
      \ to tap game board for more cards in Blackjack. \n  (right now you have to\
      \ hover over a button that takes a second or two to select \"hold\" , \"split\"\
      \ ect)\n- Listed #'s near cards to show you current hand amount.\n- A listing\
      \ of multi-player lobbies to enjoy games online \n-better placement of roulette\
      \ chips for the selection you want \n- Better integration of the wording/lettering\
      \ for directions, ect. it looks so out of place."
