    review: 'This game is utterly atrocious.


      The only good thing I can say about it is that it doesn''t crash.


      The hitboxes and collision detection is absolutely atrocious and there''s no
      fun to be had here.


      Musics, sound effects, menus, animation, graphics are perfunctory at best. There
      aren''t even any instructions... I beat the first level and then ran over the
      exit over and again; each time the exit would teleport to a new location. I
      only accidentally bumped a shoulder button on my controller, which then made
      the character do a dash and the exit activated. It''s like, once you clear a
      level of enemies, why doesn''t just walking over the exit end the level? This
      game is sooooo weak and needs an untold amount of work to be even classified
      as a game... it''s not really a game... it''s more like a student''s beginner
      project.


      Normally if I pay under $1 for a game I just let the developer keep the money,
      even if I don''t like the game. But here, this isn''t even a good-faith effort
      to make a fun game, it''s some beginner project that sucks in every way possible.
      I requested a refund.'
