I could have been more forgiving had the ride kept moving along, but no, you're stopped for ages staring at cogs in wall.\n\nThe environment's decent, so it should using the unreal engine.  \n\nSo my thoughts of the past are... I shouldn't have wasted my money on this, that's a negative thought but it's not a thought I'm going to forget.\n\nAvoid unless it's goes free, even then you'll die of boredom.","timestamp_created":1573581048,"timestamp_updated":1573581450,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.443747222423553467","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwse2wsO4CfOnT2QE="}
