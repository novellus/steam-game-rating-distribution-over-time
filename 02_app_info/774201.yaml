    reviews: "\u201CHeaven's Vault is a piece of interactive storytelling that drops\
      \ you into a dense mesh of narrative choices. The whole thing's as intricate\
      \ and inter-connected, perhaps, as one of the tiled abstract patterns that decorate\
      \ the walls and doorways of the game's Middle-Eastern and North-African-inspired\
      \ environments... This thing is a wonder.\u201D<br>Recommended \u2013 <a href=\"\
