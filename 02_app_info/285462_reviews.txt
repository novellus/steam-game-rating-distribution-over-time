Here is a thread that describes the issue, that the files are encoded incorrectly (see Ossra's first post in the thread) to be compatible with VX Ace without additional work on your part.  According to Lunarea in the thread, she was going to put in request to get the issue fixed back on 6/25/15.  I can't recommend this pack without the fix since it should be plug and play.\n\nhttps://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/the-simple-life-music-not-playing-in-project.40433/","timestamp_created":1511575176,"timestamp_updated":1511575176,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtNi5+N8Ce4DtjgE="}
