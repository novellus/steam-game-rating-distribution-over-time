That's how good the core game is.\n\nLet me clarify; it's the worst version out there because it has the least amount of content, not many options to tweak, and worst of all doesn't support custom content. The PC version could have stood apart and allowed custom songs/themes and instead it recycles some of the most generic songs from previous entries. There's also no DLC, so although you get to save some money by not buying extra songs, you'd better hope what little is there will satisfy you.\n\nPut in simpler terms, if you've played previous versions of Lumines, avoid this entry, because you've literally played/seen all that it has to offer. If you've never played it before, and PC is your only option, then sure, pick it up. It's a great color matching/block busting game with a unique clear-bar mechanic.The first 2 entries on PSP were known for having pretty good soundtracks. Every entry since then has gotten a little worse in my opinion regarding music.","timestamp_created":1375164491,"timestamp_updated":1590563012,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.587281227111816406","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2q+8qvICdeOXAg=="}
