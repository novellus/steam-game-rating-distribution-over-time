It can get dull after a few maps but it's something new at least. It doesn't suck... much.\n\nPros: turn-based strategy. I love the genre. There aren't enough tbs games out there, and even fewer good ones. This one is borderline at best. Its challenging, though mainly because of manufactured difficulty. Interesting model of guerilla warfare where enemies attack you and melt back into the jungle, whether they win or lose the skirmish. Frustrating as hell!\n\nCons: Simplistic to the extreme. There's absolutely no overwatch for your units, though the enemy seems to be able to enjoy it on occasion. Enemy units can attack you with impunity while they're standing right next to your base with artillery in it; zero fire support. But you attack their base, and they're pelting you with shells as soon as you're two hexes away. Enemy units appear out of thin air, despite the game claiming they spawn \"on the Ho Chi Min Trail\". Line of sight is practically non-existent. Only two units can see past their own hex; Green Berets can two hexes beyond, and regular infantry can see one beyond. Air units are blind whether on open ground or over the jungle canopy. The enemy has RPGs. You have nothing but rifles. No bazookas, no M79s, nothing to counter this powerful tool. Like I said... manufactured difficulty.\n\nStill, I'll recommend it if you don't mind getting stressed out over a mobile quality game that could have been so much more than a half-assed money grab.","timestamp_created":1608838450,"timestamp_updated":1608838450,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtdGPy/YCedntvAI="}
