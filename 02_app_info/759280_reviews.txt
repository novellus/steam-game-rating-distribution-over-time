It allows for a lot of freedom for the DM to put into the experience chamber what they feel like. \n-All the important NPC, Story, etc. is coded up perfectly. Only complaint is that tokens based on portrait on some of the NPCs are not included but it´s really a minor gripe.\n\nNow to the bad:\n-The structure feels like it´s all over the place. Often the relevant info for a location or a chapter is spread between the chapters at the start, the savage tales at the end and of course the plot point themselves.\n-The differentiation between info for the players and info for the DM is not very clear. So you often read something and think to yourself \"this sounds like an important detail, let me share it with my players\". 2 Chapters later it comes back and says, now would be a good time to share that info I gave you 2 chapters ago. This has hit me several times with this adventure.\n-A LARGE part of this adventure is dedicated on the travel to the Scientorium, which has some interesting plot points, that at least for me and my group were rather hard to roleplay and avoid metagaming. \n-A serious case of DM PC and not only 1 but 2. There are 2 very important NPCs that play a massive part in the story. I found it very difficult to still have my party shine with these two being around and the campaign specifically saying that they are the only ones who can do it. \n\nWhat I ended up doing was that I homebrewed quite a decent amount of the story and simply skipped some parts of the travel to the scientorium to get to the fun part, the experience chambers, as fast as possible.","timestamp_created":1560973262,"timestamp_updated":1560973262,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy7fQuOsCc4zfwwE="}
