Combined with Mountains DLC and survival mode it can be really challenging, especially if you don't have the maps memorised and where certain things occur on them. \nThe controls can be a bit slippery at times and sometimes the character can bug out. The cubs might also stop following for no reason occasionally. However the bugs aren't game breaking and you get used to them after a while and become able to work around them so that it's almost as if they don't exist.\nThe graphics are beautiful and unique although the repeating pattern can sometimes be a bit annoying to see. However as long as you're looking at plants and not open ground or water it shouldn't be too obvious.\nThe only thing that really annoys me is the auto-save feature. Having to continue playing until it saves so that I can close it is frustrating, especially if I suddenly need to do something.","timestamp_created":1610155207,"timestamp_updated":1610155207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ldWu8vYCdszXwQI="}
