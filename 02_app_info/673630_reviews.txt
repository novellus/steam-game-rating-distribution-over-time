Steam shows Heaven and Earth as running for 12 hours when I only played 5 minutes and exit. Wow !!\n\nWow this is such an implementation nightmare that I do not even know how to rate this game.\nIt is a NO RECOMMEND for me, even though I am a huge fan of RPG Maker games and own several hundreds of them in my library. This is also the very first time that I buy a game that has NO exit button.","timestamp_created":1511949629,"timestamp_updated":1511979690,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.632337331771850586","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1511988576,"developer_response":"I would like to clarify that the crash was not due to the game itself but rather a known issue that Steam has, and they have a support page for it here: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9764-IJVM-3291\n\nAs well, the Exit button will be implemented in the next patch. It has not been implemented yet because after multiple alpha tests there was not a single mention of it being a problem. \n\nThis game is still in Early Access and I enjoy hearing from the community on suggestions for how to improve it."}],"cursor":"AoJwgeXAhOACe8XVkAE="}
