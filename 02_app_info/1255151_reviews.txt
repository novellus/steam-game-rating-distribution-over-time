Really, it's the rate of fire where this thing shines. The base stat, for one pistol with no skills, is 1101. That's already nearly the pace of the Vector/Micro/Jacket's Piece. But when you factor in Gun Nut Aced and the ability to dual wield, you can have an effective fire rate of [b]3302 rounds per minute.[/b] That's faster than the fucking Minigun. Add on skills like Trigger Happy, One Handed Talent, and Low Blow and your theoretical DPS will become truly immense. However, there are some downsides. Stability, while decent enough, will strain under the pure torrent of outgoing fire. Accuracy will never be good. And of course, with great rate of fire comes with great ammo usage; you'll probably need to use an ammo bag even if you pick up most of your drops. But if you tailor your build just right, you can effectively become a hurricane of lead.\n\n[b]Czech 92 Pistol: 3/5[/b] The CZ finally makes its way into Payday 2, and honestly kinda baffles me. Its rate of fire, damage, accuracy, and stability are all slightly better than the base game's Glock 18c, yet somehow it still feels worse to use. Maybe the recoil animation is more disruptive, maybe the firing and handling noises are worse, maybe it's just nostalgia. But for some reason that I can't explain or understand, some reason that defies the objectively better stats, I would rather use the G18. \n\n[b]Igor Automatik Pistol: 4/5[/b] Like the Bizon before it, the Stechkin APS applies black magic to its 9x18 rounds to make them undeservedly powerful. Now while it's not quite 7.62 levels here, it's still as powerful as the Crosskill class of handguns. And when you apply all of the pistol skills to what is stat-wise an automatic .45, you gets some shockingly high (and stable) DPS. Really the only problems are the low ammo capacity and stability. Also, instead of using the same slightly janky reload animation that the other two weapons in this pack share, the heel-release is actually used! This results in a slightly longer, but overall more satisfying animation that helps ease the pain of Jonas Wallin (the old animator) moving on from Overkill.\n\n\n300% more automatic pistols in Payday 2 for three bucks. Pretty damn good buy.","timestamp_created":1609411925,"timestamp_updated":1609411925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wKKb3PYCftKIvwI="}
