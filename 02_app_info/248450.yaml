    review: "I enjoyed this game at first but it quickly became too frustrating/irritating\
      \ and repetitive to continue. \n\nFor example; I've just accepted a mission,\
      \ talked to the boss, jumped into my ship and then the space station is attacked,\
      \ so I then have to spend ten minutes awkwardly defending it, then I have to\
      \ go through the whole docking procedure, buy more ammo/stims, get a different\
      \ mission (because I lost the one I just got) and do that all over again because\
      \ the station is being attacked yet again! \n\nThe war strategies don't make\
      \ sense either. Why attack a faction/planet located at the other side of the\
      \ galaxy when you have a space station right above a planet home to an enemy\
      \ colony? At one point the \"Free Nations\" had just three locations on the\
      \ map. Why not focus on wiping them off the map so they can't rebuild? \n\n\
      The developer did a good job for sure. It's identical in quality to many great,\
      \ early 2000's games but I just can't recommend it, unless you have a lot of\
      \ time and patience.\n\nEDIT: I plan on giving it another chance at some point\
      \ and will see it through to completion..."
