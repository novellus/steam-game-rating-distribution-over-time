    review: 'This being close to home, I was really worried I''d end up being disappointed
      when I purchased this. I was worried they''d get my state wrong, or it would
      be riddled with bugs (and we ALL know what I''m talking about), or something
      along those lines.


      I have to say, I ran one mission (KC - Topeka) and almost immediately declared
      this one of my favorites, if not my absolute favorite DLC for this game. I probably
      took a million screenshots. The scenery was intricately detailed; it FELT like
      Kansas (which I know is a little boring for most, but Kansas has a very simple,
      farm-land beauty that you have to live around to appreciate). The slow, powerful
      build-up of speed, the screech of the brakes, the scream of the horn (by the
      way, the sounds in this DLC are just fantastic)... From the mission I ran, I
      already know I''m going to love the others possibly more than any other DLC
      I''ve purchased. I feel like they did my state justice and did it beautifully.


      Naturally, since it''s Train Simulator, there are bugs. Can''t lie. I get docked
      points for "speeding" when I am CLEARLY not speeding, etc... You know the drill.
      I pretty much expect it on most maps at this point... As always, I know I''ll
      probably have to run each mission a couple (or few) times so I can work around
      the bugs that pop up. But I guess that''s life. But you know, I won''t mind
      running these missions a few times.. I can genuinely say the trains in this
      one are among my absolute favorite (and that even includes that high-speed ICE
      train in... oh, what was it, Germany I think?)


      Ok, a little bit wordy, I know.. But this DLC deserves it. I normally wait for
      DLC''s to go on sale for $10-$15.. I got this one on sale for $25... if I had
      to do it again, would I? Oh, in a heartbeat. To be honest I might be tempted
      to pay full price.


      Verdict: If you''re looking for bug-free, look elsewhere. (Heck, if you''re
      looking for bug-free, play another game.) If you like the fast trains, this
      one probably isn''t for you. If you like hills and valleys, nope (it''s Kansas,
      where they calibrate all levels). If you want flat-land, farm-town, towering-grain-elevators,
      tree-spotted country beauty and stupid-big, ultra-powerful, super-noisy trains
      carrying dozens upon dozens of ultra-heavy train cars... Well, you better snatch
      this one up.'
