    review: 'I''m in the minority with this harsh opinion.

      But reviews should be honest, so here it is:

      These DLC''s do not increase your playtime.

      Even modders create better stuff for free.

      This probably took five minutes to create.

      I don''t like these types of additional stuff.

      This really doesn''t need to be in the store.

      You can buy it to support the developers.

      And sure, that''s a really nice thing to do.

      But they could''ve made better DLC''s too.

      I honestly can''t give it a positive review.'
