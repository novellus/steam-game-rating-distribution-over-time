Team & Buget... AFAIK - This Game is made by 2 People.\n\n-Important Note- You must Install the (free) \"R18-DLC\" to get a version with animated \"Private\" scenes.\n\n-About the Game- \n(BTW - To call it \"Game\" is maybe a little missleading - It's a Story with a Fix Play throught)\n\n1. Nice Graphics, Meshes (Models) and Textures are Nice and in good Quality.\n2. Animations are all very nice and proper. Excellent Face impressions. Body movements etc.\n3. Performance, It runs smooth and dosent need much resources (as far i can say - check the system spec's)\n4. Translation to English isnt flawless but good.\n5. The Game is only 1 Chapter of a Story... so it's Short. (5 \"Private\"Scenes) But a nice Storyline. \n(It's allredy noted on the Shop page by the Dev. that it is Short)\n6. Nice Sound that dosent bore after a few Minutes of Play. (The \"Lewd\" Sound of the DLC is a little strange but - sexy?!)\n\nSo is it worth to buy? 100% Yes! - at the moment it's Sold for 5$ and that is Cheap for what you get... I did buy much worse ones for more Money. This one is really good made and i will sure Buy the next Chapter if they ever will release one... (Big respect to the Dev's of that Game. THX a lot for your Work.)","timestamp_created":1610026519,"timestamp_updated":1610027795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o9DI7vYCe4CjwQI="}
