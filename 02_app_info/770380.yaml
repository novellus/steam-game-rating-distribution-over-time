      /><br><br>Did you miss out on Army of Tentacles, all the rage in 2016? You can
      play catch-up with this <i><strong>Ultimate Signature Awesome Other Words Used
      In Marketing Edition</strong></i>! All at a substantial discount!<br><br>Dagon
      is all like 'yo' and Perry/you is all like 'sup'. Dagon needs you to destroy
      the human town of Innsmouth, but you're all like 'there are a lot of people
      living there, so I'mma need to get an army worthy of Mordor so I can simply
      walk into Innsmouth'. Dagon's all 'sure, but you have a time limit because that's
      how this game has replayability'.  <br><br>At its heart, AoT:(N)ACDS is a coming-of-age
      tale about a boy/girl that is totally going to destroy humanity. By humanity,
      we mean a small coastal town. It is the Adventure-RPG based upon Shadow Over
      Innsmouth, where you control the eldritch horrors from beyond time and space!
      Inspired by classic RPGs, Lucasarts adventure games, and, you know, other cool
      stuff. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770380/extras/FEATURES_FEAT.jpg?t=1605581227"
      /><br><br>- ALL the paid and free DLC (minus the charity DLC) that came out
      for the base game<br><br>- Quirky 2D art with photography backdrops. Like the
      theme of sanity in all of Lovecraft's works, the art changes - sometimes drastically
      based on where you are in the game, who you are talking to, and what you are
      doing. <br><br>- Time management is also a factor, as some areas only open up
      at certain times, and you may find yourself unable to train everyone you want
      before the final invasion of Innsmouth. <br><br>- A SILENT PROTAGONIST. REVOLUTIONARY.<br><br>-
      Fully voiced cast of 60+ characters! <br><br>- Four central hub areas <br><br>-
      Whale Jesus (but only in the most awesome of playthroughs) <br><br>- Use your
      wits to engage in battles where words are sharper than swords or other things
      that hurt people in reality! Because NOBODY has EVER done conversation-based
      combat before! <br><br>- Recruit a party of THOUSANDS (if thousands meant six),
      ranging from Deep Ones to Night Gaunts, all staples of the Lovecraft mythos!
      Find hidden army squads and party members to further puff up your ranks! <br><br>-
      Do things that relate to other things and provide consequences of choice! We
      totally have more than three differently colored endings! We swear! (At least
      five! One is even pink!)

    review: "I\xB4ve seen this game come up along with some others when I was looking\
      \ for certain tags.\n\nI looked at it but was not sure if it\xB4s going to be\
      \ good or not by the pictures you get on the shop page.\n\nHowever, it got recommended\
      \ to me and so I finally decided to buy it.\n\nStarted it without neither knowing\
      \ what type of game it is (expected it to be a visual novel) nor what\xB4s going\
      \ to await\n\nme anyways...\n\nHowever... starting to play I can say this game\
      \ is hughe fun. You meet a lot of different characters / creatures.\n\nIt is\
      \ actually a RPG game so you have stats like \"health\" and \"intelligenze\"\
      \ (altough health has another name in this game)\n\nand these stats are used\
      \ for \"interaction\" with enemy characters. You \"fight\" a word battle - which\
      \ is fun by it\xB4s own.\n\nThe humor in this game is very special and definately\
      \ might not be everyones taste but if you are into gaming in generall\n\na little\
      \ bit and have an open mind for ... let\xB4s call it \"nerd culture\" you\xB4\
      ll definately have fun in this game.\n\nI probably just scratched on the surface\
      \ of this game, given the fact that I write this review after just playing a\
      \ little bit\n\nlonger than 1 hour. But let alone in this small play time I\xB4\
      ve had lots of fun, good laughts and so far and so on.\n\nYou should definately\
      \ check out that game. There\xB4s more going on in the game than the pictures\
      \ from the shop are\n\nshowing (for example on the shop pictures you can\xB4\
      t see that you can make lots and lots of choices in that game)\n\nDefinately\
      \ recommended. It\xB4s ... let\xB4s say another experience :)"
