      /><br>CPUCores :: Network Monitor Lite will allow you to check the performance
      of your network connection by examining the network quality on every hop between
      you and your game server/destination of choice.  You can examine what exactly
      is causing latency and/or packetloss issues by examining network traffic data
      on a per-node point.<br><br>This DLC will allow you to:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Click
      a single button to determine every hop between you and a server on the Internet
      (defaults to 8.8.8.8)<br></li><li>Allows you to edit the server it polls (can
      put in any website, any game server, etc)<br></li><li>Determine every hop between
      your computer and the server you indicate on the Internet<br></li><li>Polls
      every hop and determines network latency (ICMP ECHO) between you and that server<br></li><li>Keeps
      track of packetloss on each hop<br></li><li>Displays a graph demonstrating traffic
      quality/jitter on each hop</li></ul><br>This DLC will assist you in troubleshooting
      where potential network slow-downs occur between you and whatever game server
      you''re playing on.  This allows you to determine if it is an issue with your
      wifi, local network, your ISP, your game server, and more.<h2 class="bb_tag">Screenshots:</h2><br><img
