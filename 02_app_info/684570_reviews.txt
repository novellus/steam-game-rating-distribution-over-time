HUGE WARNING: unless you're extremely tolerant of 80s-era RPG elements - do not go near this one. It's very, very, very old-school, and I don't mean \"Fallout-old school\", not even \"Spiderweb Software-old school\" - this is early 90's picture with late 80's RPG gameplay. And it's really not a good thing. I'm only thumbing it up because it's a valiant effort by a single individual to create an RPG, a task I failed at mayself several times, and the game isn't even THAT bad - it's just not good, either.\n\nThe biggest problem is the huge, huge, empty world. Barring an occasionall random encounter and a few boring treasures, you won't find anything interesting in it, but you WILL spend a lot of time walking, because there is a lot of land between any two points of interest (like dungeo entrances, quest locations etc). This is made much worse by the lack of the world map (or I couldn't find one - the icon for world map is present in game files, but I found no way to activate it, maybe I missed some item - I know I haven't completed ALL quests). There are crafting ingiridents to pick, and there are random stumps with loot, and places to dig for gold, but mostly it all is useless. Compare and contranst to locations in Jeff Vogel's games: any loot is placed with a little story about it, told with visuals, or, rarely, text notes. Here, it's all random and boring.\n\nActually, itemization is boring. There are no named items, aside from a set of magic armor and one crossbow, all of which you NEED to complete the game. Otherwise, you can buy the best items in shop in the first village, soon as you get enough gold.\n\nCharacter development is also extremely plain. There is a number of skills, but leveling up isn't exciting, because you don't really feel the effect of your skills much. Not in the least because combat is extremely simplistic, slow and boring. AI is stupid and will waste turns walking randomly. Also, most monsters use ranged weapons, so you will have to run up to them, or kite them into tight places, where possible. Spells don't help much, and the choice of spells is very limited. Also, mages are pretty useless in combat until late, late levels - so if you're going to play a mage... Just don't. Or at least pick up a melee or ranged weapons skill.\n\nPuzzles are mostly uninspired, story is pretty average amateur stuff, and that's all I can say.\n\nStill, it's a thumb up from me, because this man made a game, and I haven't, and if I made mine, I'm not sure it would be much better, at least in terms of story and gameplay (but I might outgun Dr. Dungeon in terms of coding in a more modern style - really, a look at game's files make a programmer cry, the way resources are laid out).\n\nHowever, unless you're a huge fan of old RPGs or decided to play all isometric turn-based RPGs that ever came out - you'd probably better off avoiding this one.","timestamp_created":1591394507,"timestamp_updated":1591394507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j6Ogw/ICfvmwjAI="}
