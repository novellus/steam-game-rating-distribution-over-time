    review: I realize i'm just f*cking wrong actually, it's just my pc is sh*t and
      I was salty it ran like crap and looked like crap. Though I still don't exactly
      favor the new engine I've learned to accept it, embrace it and utilize it. Still
      not the biggest fan of the Majima saga, but hey what can ya do? It's good enough?
      Yeah it's good enough.
