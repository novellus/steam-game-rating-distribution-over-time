The perfect balance of story line, puzzles and HOGs. I like adventure games with lots of people to interact with, and this one has quite a few. There could have been a few more locations, but that's knitpicking. The collector's edition bonus game was pretty good too. Overall I wish the game were longer, but that's a compliment. I highly recommend this fun interesting game!","timestamp_created":1586284257,"timestamp_updated":1586284257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47pv6qvECfuT7/gE="}
