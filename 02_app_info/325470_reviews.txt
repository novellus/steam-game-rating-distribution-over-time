I got it from a Classic Wargames bundle in winter sales for like 3 euros. Full price which is 20 euros is really bad joke for it. Game have a zero support from developers and even after 5-6 years when it was released on Steam its unplayeble. Game crashing constantly for me. I tried to fix it but not succeed. On fullscreen mode my mouse pointer flickering in game and the game going slowly. I was able to got in turn 13 when my game crash and even after I load my save and do several more attempts the game still crashing. For some reason when I tried to play it in window mode game was going smoother and there was no mouse pointer flickering during game but crashing preserve. I tried to browse around internet and checking discussions on Steam for some kind of fix or help but to no avail.","timestamp_created":1608934220,"timestamp_updated":1608934220,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwjvz8zfYCePWXvQI="}
