      \ play all 8 at a time in the new 8-player PvE Uber Monster Fest Challenge mission?\
      \ Well get ready. This pack contains  gender-swapped versions of the main characters,\
      \ equipped with all new abilities, stat ramps, and more:<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\
      \t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>The Initiate</strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA student of\
      \ the mountain monasteries, the Initiate has joined her counterpart to discover\
      \ the truth behind her master's demise. While her time in the mountains may\
      \ have decreased her endurance, her increased spell-casting and movement speeds\
      \ coupled with powerful radial abilities make her a strong ally. Her Enemy Drain\
      \ ability allows her to debuff all nearby foes and her Remote Defense Boost\
      \ ability buffs the defenses of any nearby allies. She will not give up until\
      \ she discovers the truth behind her master\u2019s disappearance and avenges\
      \ him!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>The Countess</strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA proud\
      \ Etherian warrior of noble descent, the Countess can hold her own against any\
      \ of the other great warriors of the realm. Though still favoring brute force\
      \ melee combat, she can often run circles around her Squire comrades. Her Joust\
      \ ability allows her to push through enemy lines with unstoppable force, while\
      \ her Call to Arms ability allows her to rally allies to the cause, boosting\
      \ their morale. Though she can be stubborn at times, she'll never back down\
      \ from a fight!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>The Ranger</strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\
      \tHailing from the wood elves\u2019 traditional home near the great forest of\
      \ Mistymire, the Ranger is a formidable warrior. Unlike his nimble female counterpart,\
      \ his slower speed is coupled with a hardier constitution enabling him to take\
      \ a great bruising. His Invisibility Field ability enables him to cloak nearby\
      \ allies and defenses along with himself, while his Piercing Spreadshot ability\
      \ can tear through lanes of enemies in a wide arc. This pointy-eared warrior\
      \ is a powerful ally to have in your travelling party!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>The\
      \ Adept</strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAn introverted trainee in the arcane arts,\
      \ the Adept has focused her energy to hone several unique spells. Her Purifying\
      \ Blast ability can unleash a magical explosion which will destroy skeletons\
      \ in a single blast and greatly damage their necromancer masters, while her\
      \ Instant Upgrade ability allows her to channel her mana into an instant upgrade\
      \ for any Defense. Though she can be a little shy at first, her increased speed\
      \ allows her to hurry across the battlefield to wherever her urgent attention\
      \ is required!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>...as well as an all new 8-player\
      \ PvE challenge mission: Uber Monster Fest!!!</p>"
