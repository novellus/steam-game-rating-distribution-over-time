Buy it on sale if at all. Art style feels a bit too deviantart for what the game is trying to do. The devs just revealed you cannot get all of the content without using a hidden mechanic they have declined to share, which just makes the whole thing feel a bit lazier. I hope the devs find a better balance in the future of matching idea with execution.","timestamp_created":1597619184,"timestamp_updated":1597619184,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmMTh/PMCc/z1mwI="}
