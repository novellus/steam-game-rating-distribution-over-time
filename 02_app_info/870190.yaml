    about_the_game: Idris is a bonds man- a special bonds man. While most of his clients
      need to bail loved ones out of jail, a few are looking for a reprieve from someone
      they once knew. For Evalise, all she wanted was to get a bail bond for her boyfriend,
      when Idris surprised her with a simple but confusing question.<br><br><i>What

      /><br><br>That Which Binds Us (TWBU) is a visual novel about a young woman named
      Evalise whose boyfriend isn't the best guy in the world... in fact, he's constantly
      in jail. However, on this occasion of trying to bail him out, she runs into
      a bail bonds salesman who proposes a different question- what if she could make
      him forget about her completely? With a simple cut of his knife, he can make
      anyone forget about any client. Evalise, cautious but curious, goes through
      with it, only to find her boyfriend now completely unaware of who she is. Now,
      she's trying to recollect her life as a now-single woman- but a mystery still
      surrounds her.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870190/extras/divider_features.png?t=1583463601"

    short_description: All she wanted was to get a bail bond for her troublesome boyfriend.
      That's when she met Idris, a very special kind of bondsman. With a flick of
      a knife, he asked Evalise one confusing question- what if we could make him
      forget you?

    review: 'I absolutely adore this game! The story is so beautifully romantic and
      well written, I couldn''t pull myself away from it until I''ve finished a full
      route. (Seriously, don''t leave the stove on while you play!) Although the story
      has elements of magic, it is very much a slice of life with a sense of maturity
      that I don''t find in most other otome games. The events in the game are often
      mundane, with the characters having very relatable conversations about daily
      life. It makes the story feel very relatable!


      8.5/10 - Highly recommended
