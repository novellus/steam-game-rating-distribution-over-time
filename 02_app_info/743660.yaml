    review: Excellent little endless arcade game, with 16-bit art style but gameplay
      more resembing the 8-bit era, or even the early 80s. It's quite addictive, easy
      for anyone to pick upand beat a few boards (every level is single-screen, with
      movement on a grid) but with a well-implemented difficulty curve. Arcade masters
      will be breaking a sweat before they clear level 30. The stages repeat thematically
      every five levels, with different layouts and more enmeies each time. Every
      fifth stage pits you against a giant teleporting, laser-shooting eyeball and
      his minions. Controls are crisp and responsive, and music is catchy (I swear
      the title screen tune is some song I ought to recognize). You'll be surprised
      how much time has passed as the game keeps enticing you to have one more go.
      Recommended for retro arcade fans, and a good price to boot (hill).
