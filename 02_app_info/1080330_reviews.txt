It's not revolutionary by any means, but it's arguably as good, if not slightly better, than other similar, more popular games on steam. (Don't worry Super Bit Blaster, I think you're cool too!) Also, the price is mere pocket change.\nIf you have a little cash left in your steam wallet sometime, I'd recommend giving this game a go! :)","timestamp_created":1599875216,"timestamp_updated":1600555911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49aCk1PQCeO+foQI="}
