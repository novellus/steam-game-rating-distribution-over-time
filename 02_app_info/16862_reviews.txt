The map lacks the details of the others. You can find the same map on the Steam Workshop with better details and for free.\n\n[h1]Long review[/h1]\n\nThis DLC allows you to play on a map of the Americas. A map only available in Small size. Absolutely. [i]Small[/i]. The Americas. Evidently, it lacks the details the other maps of the Cradle of Civilization Pack could be proud of. Furthermore, paying for such a feature is a shame in my opinion. You can pretty much find the same using the Steam Workshop. If you really want this DLC, get it in a bundle or with the Complete Edition of Civilization V.","timestamp_created":1605634140,"timestamp_updated":1605634140,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9pTQ6/UCftf8rgI="}
