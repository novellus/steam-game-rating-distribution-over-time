    review: "No, just no, its not worth the benefit of the doubt, it'll just cause\
      \ you aggravation. \n\nPoor level design, no options to mute annoying looping\
      \ music that has no relation to the story or level, completely restart or reset\
      \ a level if you have one missed jump.  Find a better game for your time and\
      \ money."
