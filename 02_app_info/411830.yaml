    about_the_game: "From the Warring States period to the present day, the mysterious\
      \ shinobi have fought covertly across Japan. Some fight for the authorities,\

      \ VERSUS immediately follows the events of SENRAN KAGURA Burst, revisiting the\

      \ sworn enemies from Hebijo Clandestine Girls\u2019 Academy, the latter of which\
      \ have now gone underground and formed a mercenary strike team known as the\
      \ Homura Crimson Squad. In addition to their old adversaries, the Hanz\u014D\
      \ girls must also face a whole new set of foes: the students of Gessen Girls\u2019\
      \ Academy, who seek to punish them for their imperfections as shinobi warriors.\
      \ Meanwhile, a new class is in session at Hebijo, and these students mean business:\
      \ they oppose all three of the competing factions and will stop at nothing to\
      \ be the last shinobi squad standing \u2013 even if it means leaving broken\
      \ bodies and shattered dreams in their wake.<br><br>The stage is set for a shinobi\
      \ battle royale. Heroines and renegades battle saints and sinners in a flurry\
      \ of fists, feet, clothes, tattered remnants of those clothes, and sometimes\
      \ underclothes. Each school has a story to tell, full of tragedy, heroism, pathos\
      \ and partial nudity. Choose a school, prepare for battle, and follow the Path\
