This is a game that will test your planning and ingenuity as well as your reflexes.\nThe vanilla game is divided into multiple sets of 10 levels; with new puzzle mechanics being introduced each time. Such include: swapping dimensions, lock switches, flipping Gravity, different movable/breakable objects, warping lazers, timers etc. Stages are unique, quick and fair; resulting in a nice “just one more go” type feeling.\n\nThere’s a fantastic sense of progression as well. You only need to complete 7-8 levels of a set to unlock the next 10. Achievements are plentiful and are spread out quite evenly.\n\nReplayability wise: there’s speed-run leaderboards and hard to reach bonus stars in each level which require you to find more innovative ways to complete each level. \nThen there's the level editor: making your own levels and sharing them is pretty intuitive in this game :).\n","timestamp_created":1543709292,"timestamp_updated":1543709292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485374301671981812","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3s6PtucCedmctAE="}
