    about_the_game: Celestial Command is a realistic co-op crafting survival sandbox
      space game which unites an orbital mechanics, realistic physics, ship constructor
      and various features of classic space games.<br><br>Mine asteroids, salvage
      space debris, build space ships and stations, manage fuel and energy, trade
      goods, performs missions and fight against enemies in large open world with
      realistic 2D physics based on orbital mechanics or in alternative, more classic
      game mode.<h2 class="bb_tag">Realistic Orbital Mechanic</h2><br>The world of
      the game works based on simplified orbital mechanics. Everything in state of
      constant orbital motion. Perform orbital maneuvers and keep your space ships
      on stable orbits to prevent crashing on a planet or loosing ship in deep space.<br>The
      physics simulates in 2D space, this makes flying and navigation enjoyable and
      easy but also generates a lot of interesting situations due physical collisions
      which are more often in 2D space than in 3D.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/330460/extras/Orbit-Fixed.gif?t=1593290600"

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Fully Customizable Ships and Space stations</h2><br>You
      can build your own ship part by part. Each part of the ship is individual, it
      has own functions and parameters. Therefore, abilities of your ship are completely
      dependent on the modules from which it is assembled. You can build small explorers,
      large industrial ships, carriers, defense satellites or whatever you want.<br>Each
      module can be detached or attached to the ship right on the fly, which allows
      to transform your ship using found modules.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/330460/extras/Crash3.gif?t=1593290600"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Ship Management</h2><br>All resources of the ship are limited.
      Including fuel, energy, ammo and construction materials, so store them and use
      them wisely.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/330460/extras/WarpGate.gif?t=1593290600"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Command a Fleet</h2><br>You are not bound to a single ship.
      You can build as many ships and space stations as you want. And you can switch
      control between them anytime. Also it is possible to control your ships not
      only directly, but also giving movement orders.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/330460/extras/Blue-Star.gif?t=1593290600"

      salvage wreckage of broken ships in order to build new modules and produce fuel.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Economy, Trading and Missions</h2><br>Trade goods between stations
      or complete procedural missions provided by NPC stations and earn additional
      credits to buy new modules on a shipyard.<h2 class="bb_tag">Fight the Enemy</h2><br>Build
      various types of devices to fight against enemies. Cannons, lasers, rockets,
      shields and more. <br><br><br>The game has now been in active development, so
