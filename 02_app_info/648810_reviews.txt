I know it is only 50p (at least when i brought it), but this game wouldn't have even stayed in my steam library if it was free. The control scheme is horrendous, the camera angle is nausiating, and you cant even complete the first level (seriously - the finish DOESNT WORK). How can a game be made so badly. \n\nYou might as well just stare at a black screen. Its cheaper, and probably more entertaining than this game.","timestamp_created":1529267818,"timestamp_updated":1529267818,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567073404788970947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1529406590,"developer_response":"Hey there,\n\nI am sorry you feel that way about our game. I hope you refunded the game because I wouldn't want to you to have any more bad experiences with it. As for your bug report about the first level, we can't reproduce this on our end, here is a video showing it's working as intended as of the latest public version: https://youtu.be/nknnSfqyMuY Again, I am very sorry you had a bad experience.\n\nKind Regards,\nNick Helweg"}],"cursor":"AoJw4eHdh+QCf4OhowE="}
