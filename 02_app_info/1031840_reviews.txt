Then I realised there's actually a fair bit of skill required. It sort of reminds me of Wii sports Archery, but continuous and with a keyboard. I haven't yet managed to reach the end, it would be nice if there were checkpoints every five targets so you don't have to grind so much to get money to afford upgrades. Graphics are alright. At AUD $1.50 it's a good price for a pretty decent game.","timestamp_created":1597592881,"timestamp_updated":1597592881,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49pj9+/MCeYTtmwI="}
