      Munday: Well, we crash-landed that UFO in the desert and Bubba says he wants\
      \ to go home. Heck, I don't blame him 'cause there ain't no place like Hickston.\
      \ But according to my map, we're gonna have to blast our way through jack o'\
      \ lope farms and a riverboat as well as a brothel (Bubba can't wait) 'fore we\

      \ Bikers, pigs, cows and jack o' lopes. I think I even saw the King at the Slurp\
      \ n' Burp.<br />\r\nWinsday: Yeehaw! Got to joyride in a Swamp Buggy and a motorcycle\
      \ that were both armed to the teeth. I hope those peoples I ran over will be\
      \ alrite. I still got a darn jack 'o lope stuck in the grill though.<br />\r\
      \nThersday: New ways to destroy stuff! I found over 10 weapons like a crossbow\
      \ that shoots dynamite-loaded chickens and a slingblade. Mmmm-Hmm! <br />\r\n\
      Fri-day: Sure am hungry! I just need some good ol' redneck powerups like pork\
      \ rinds, cow pies and some of my granpappy's moonshine! <br />\r\nSaterday:\
      \ Boy I sure so like those toe tapping tunes by that good ol' boy Mojo Nixon.\

      \ could've come along for the ride!"

    short_description: Well, we crash-landed that UFO in the desert and Bubba says
      he wants to go home. Heck, I don't blame him 'cause there ain't no place like
      Hickston. But according to my map, we're gonna have to blast our way through
      jack o' lope farms and a riverboat as well as a brothel 'fore we get home again.
