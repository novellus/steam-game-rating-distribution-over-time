    review: "Decided to give this a try because the screenshots were intriguing and\
      \ the store page had some cute motivational phrases. \n\nMost of your deaths\
      \ will be from falling off. You know how unresponsive RPG Maker movement is?\
      \ Imagine that in a precision-movement game. Doesn't work. The gameplay is your\
      \ generic dodge the instant death as you memorize the movements of different\
      \ hazards. \n\nSorry to say the dev seems really proud of this, and the store\
      \ page is cute, but the game isn't any good. The writing once you're in the\
      \ game is bleh. \n\nI was optimistic going in, but this is another piece of\
      \ indie trash for the steam dumpster.\n\nOne last thing, when I launched the\
      \ game it opened some weird javascript dialogue. I ran an antivirus scan and\
      \ it seemed ok, but be warned."
