You feel a surging urgency to escape this... place. You MUST escape. Unfortunately, sometimes the only way out is through.

They may have you trapped in a place where something feels.... off, but by not looking at them you might just be able to escape. With no explanation or recollection of where you came from your only objective is to survive and make it out of that hell and hopefully uncover some secrets on the way.
