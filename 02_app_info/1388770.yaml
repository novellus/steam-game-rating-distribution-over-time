    review: 'Let it be known that this game is for a very specific type of person.
      If you enjoy surreal, bizarre video games like Hylics, Cube Gothic or Zeno Clash,
      this is for you. This game is playable vomit.


      It looks and sounds deliciously abrasive, with low res textures and disgusting
      colors at every turn. Your health indicator takes up an entire quarter of your
      screen. You will die quickly and often. You will often be confused. The font
      is almost unreadable. The default control binds are counter-intuitive. Once
      you submit and accept, you will only know a hunger for murder and flesh.


      My only complaints are unstable framerates and that the price tag is a bit steep
      at $20. Can''t wait to see how this game develops during early access.
