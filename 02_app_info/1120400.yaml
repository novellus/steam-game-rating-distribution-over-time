    review: 'Updated per Jan 2 2021 update.


      pros:

      [list]

      [*]I really enjoyed tabletop D&D combat, so this also.

      [*]Early game is definitely challenging (& not at all properly balanced), but
      it felt good to overcome it finally.

      [*]I really like the aesthetic.

      [*]It is possible to have enough arrows now.

      [*]I''m definitely enjoying the game a lot more having made it out of the early
      game struggle.

      [*]Seems to be a dedicated, communicative developer here on Steam.

      [/list]


      cons:

      [list]

      [*]The risk of encountering monsters during overworld travel is not clearly
      communicated to players by the system of exclamation points. "!!" is anywhere
      from ~30 to ~40% encounter chance? I''m not even sure.

      [*]Unintuitively, the system of exclamation points is NOT telling you what level
      of monsters you might encounter.

      [*]Enemies have infinite stamina, you don''t.

      [*]It''s an unenjoyable struggle to make money in the early game: shopkeepers
      absolutely gouge you on prices as a baseline (sell prices < 1/3, buy prices
      almost double).

      [*]Early game is far, far too dependent on constantly chugging potions to barely
      survive at a point where you are already struggling to make any money.

      [*]Baseline stamina regen is drastically too low in the early game, especially
      with any build not focused on STR. You will constantly need to chug stamina
      potions you can''t really afford to chug.

      [*]In the early game, rain makes ranged attacks almost useless - it reduces
      your chance to hit with ranged attacks by an unbearably massive 50%! It''s outrageous.
      Compare to D&D where rain typically reduced your d20 by 2- significant without
      rendering ranged attacks almost impossible against near-your-level hostiles.

      [*]If you are out of combat, but in a dungeon, it takes like 10 in-game hours
      to recover stamina (which you need to do anything). There has to be a way to
      rest and recover stamina out of combat, inside a dungeon...This design oversight
      also negatively contributes to the problem of having to constantly chug potions
      (you can''t really afford to buy) in the early game.

      [*]There isn''t much content yet, but be fair: it''s still very early.
