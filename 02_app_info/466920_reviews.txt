This game takes a long freaking time to get going.\n\nRecommendation #2: Be aware of all the DLC the game gives you for free. Some of these packs give items to you immediately that you wouldn't get until later on, and I found that it messed with my experience a good bit (you can disable whichever DLC you want in the menu)\n\nWith these recommendations in mind, this game is pretty freaking packed with content, not to mention the characters get pretty endearing after some time passes. If you're looking for a game with fast, overkill combat and a unique combat system to pair with it, then this game certainly does the job.\n","timestamp_created":1597295273,"timestamp_updated":1597295273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wvSN8/MCcs6RmwI="}
