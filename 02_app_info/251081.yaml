    review: "Non-essential cosmetic DLC. [b]Admiral Swiggins, PHD[/b] is definitely\
      \ the best skin for Admiral Swiggins. A great homage to Super Meat Boy's main\
      \ villain Dr. Fetus with permission from Team Meat, it still manages to fit\
      \ in well with the rest of Awesomenauts. \n\nBest bought in the [url=store.steampowered.com/sub/80318/]Awesomenauts\
      \ - Costume Party 3 DLC Bundle[/url]."
