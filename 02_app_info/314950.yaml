      \ reality to horror fans creating film-like suspense and surprises. Designed\
      \ for immersive virtual reality and 3D, truly original gameplay has players\
      \ pursued by the chilling Spectre in stunning and terrifying environments.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Spectre's single player mode, you play as a lone Seeker,\
      \ a wanderer lost inside an abandoned mansion. You'll soon discover that you\
      \ are being stalked by the Spectre, a malevolent and elusive spirit residing\
      \ in the mansion. Equipped with nothing but your headlight, all you can do is\
      \ keep moving. Your ultimate goal is to explore the mansion and obtain a means\
      \ of dispelling the looming Spectre permanently.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Spectre's\
      \ multiplayer mode, up to four players are able to take the roles of Spectres\

      \ The Spectre has its own arsenal of tricks it can use to deceive, disorient,\
      \ and ultimately, lead the Seekers into its immobilizing clutches. The Spectre's\

      \ Perhaps its most defining feature, Spectre lets the players scare each other.\
      \ With danger lurking so close, any movement, from friend or foe, is startling.\
      \ The Spectre may be hiding around the corner. Seekers' teammates may be imposters.\
      \ The Spectre and Seekers are always in pursuit."

    review: "-EDIT\nI had forgotten all about this game, and I'm not the only one.\
      \ This game is dead, and it basically always has been. It's a game that relied\
      \ on a multiplayer community that never formed, and no steps were ever taken\
      \ to create additional single-player content.\n-END EDIT\n\nI would recommend\
      \ this game, although, I admit, I may have somewhat selfish reasons for doing\
      \ so. On the surface, Spectre is very similar to many other recent survival\
      \ horror games; you wander around a dark, creepy environment, with nothing but\
      \ a flashlight to guide you. Along the way, you're stalked by a spirit that\
      \ kills you for looking at her, meaning your only tactic is to turn tail and\
      \ run anytime she gets near. Instead of finding eight items to win this game,\
      \ you just need one; the camera. Find it, snap a picture of The Spectre when\
      \ she's right in your face, and you win.\n\nAs this game is still in the early\
      \ stages, more content will certainly be added later, but for now, the game\
      \ is rather bare. I found no story elements, nor any explanation for what The\
      \ Spectre is, although they may have been there and I just missed them. There\
      \ are also a few issues with gameplay; sprinting doesn't work in Singleplayer,\
      \ and the 'Use' and 'Open Door' commands don't seem to have a purpose yet. Again,\
      \ more is sure to come, but if I were involved in the development, I'd prioritize\
      \ expanding the map; I beat the game in 18 minutes, and that includes three\
      \ deaths, and general wandering.\n\nWhere this game really stands out is in\
      \ the atmosphere; the mansion you wander through looks fantastic, and there\
      \ aren't too many indie games that can compare to it. It could benefit from\
      \ a some more rooms, maybe even a whole new floor, but it's a strong foundation.\
      \ The Spectre also looks pretty good, although I sometimes have trouble telling\
      \ if the jerky way she moves is by design or a bug. The sound design also stands\
      \ out, and while I admit it's a bit generic as far as this kind of game goes,\
      \ it still does its job of setting the mood quite well.\n\nWhat has the potential\
      \ to set this game apart from the rest is the multiplayer feature. As of this\
      \ review, I've yet to find anyone to play with, but it seems like it would be\
      \ a more polished version of the Garry's Mod gamemode 'Stop it Slender', with\
      \ one player being The Spectre, and the rest trying to locate the camera. To\
      \ me, this seems like the game's biggest selling point, but as of right now,\
      \ the servers seem to be dead, with nary a player in sight. This is the main\
      \ reason I recommend this game; the multiplayer feature seems like the idea\
      \ that this game was built around, but there just aren't enough players yet,\
      \ and it seems like the game isn't living up to its full potential.\n\nI've\
      \ also not tried the VR mode, so if that's a big selling point for you, you'll\
      \ have to look elsewhere to find out if it's any good.\n\nSo, anyone who's on\
      \ the fence about this one, consider a few things: \n\n1. Do you enjoy games\
      \ like Slender and SCP Containment Breach?\n2. If yes, have you ever wished\
      \ you could play as Slender Man/SCP-173?\n3. Are you willing to help work out\
      \ the various kinks present in all Early Access games?\n4. Do you have at least\
      \ two like-minded friends who might be willing to play as well?\n\nIf you answered\
      \ yes to two or more of those questions, then Spectre may be worth your time."
