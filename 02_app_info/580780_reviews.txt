This is a comedy set that was available on Netflix for a long time and something that I've tried to show everyone.  It is offensive and ridiculous and brilliant.  It ends in a way that I won't ruin and there's no way that you could anticipate.  It is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who  enjoys intelligent humor.","timestamp_created":1501284764,"timestamp_updated":1501284764,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlvHixd0CdpmZgQE="}
