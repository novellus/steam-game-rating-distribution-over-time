    review: "Okay, I actually think this game is not without its good points, but\
      \ it does have some fatal flaws. I love the typing angle, but more often than\
      \ not - I don't care how fast you type - it is impossible to avoid obstacles\
      \ for very long seamlessly. Why is this? Because you cannot spell RICOCHET and\
      \ then ASCEND fast enough to jump over a pit and then the spider that comes\
      \ RIGHT after. \n\nThey honestly should've programmed it so that the obstacles\
      \ and enemies HAVE to stay a decent distance apart so you actually have a chance\
      \ to avoid EVERY obstacle or enemy that shows up. You will fail multiple times\
      \ in this game and it will often not even be your fault. This alone might not\
      \ seem like the worst thing in the world on its own, but when so many runs end\
      \ with you being eliminated because of an impossible challenge rather than human\
      \ error, then the satisfaction that comes with making a decent distance is very\
      \ rare and you are left with gameplay that predominantly frustrates and disappoints.\
      \ :(\n\nThe way they switch up the trigger words with alternate ones that often\
      \ barely even pass for synonyms can also add to your confusion while playing,\
      \ even if the JUMP, SHOOT, ATTACK, and ROLL displays DO always stay in the same\
      \ spots. \n\nOverall, my point is that this game is based on a good concept,\
      \ has decent aspects, but is ultimately lacking and flawed. I may end up playing\
      \ it some more in the future, but I wouldn't say it deserves a seal of recommendation\
      \ when it is this underdeveloped and prone to frustrate. Sad, really."
