    review: I would say this one is a bit better than the first. The interactive nature
      of the game is nearly identical to the Enigmatis trilogy. You don't need to
      play the first one before playing this one. There is zero crossover as far as
      story goes and only one crossover character. The game itself is mediocre but
      interesting enough to keep your attention. Only took me about 2.5 hours to play.
      I do appreciate that the repeat HOG scenes remove the items found in the previous
      look at the scene. I know this is going to sound ridiculous given the low bar
      many of us tend to put on HOGs, but I found it annoying that some of the interactive
      items were not yet invented in the year the game takes place (early 1950s) like
      using a printer and such. Otherwise, pretty run of the mill. If you haven't
      played them yet, I would recommend playing the Enigmatis trilogy over playing
      these two games.
