The preview was a bit misleading but at the same time its my fault. Im pretty sure the only way this would be really useful if i connect a mic and put it where i want the audio to be detected from. i enjoyed this but it was okay.","timestamp_created":1588876627,"timestamp_updated":1588876627,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1589219833,"developer_response":"Hi Slyde. Agree YoloMic is not perfect yet, especially for folks with a mechanical KB next to their mic. Plan is to add an AI based noise isolation next. This would much better learn your noise environment than the current methods to know what should be alertable and whats normal."}],"cursor":"AoJ4w6mb+PECfKighgI="}
