    review: One of the more interesting stories for a VN. The plot is well written
      and it keeps you engaged in the story. The sexual content is mild compared to
      other games. With the more explicit situations unlocked post story. The sexual
      content also is not just randomly placed like a bad acting scene. It fits into
      the story. LGBTQ focused story
