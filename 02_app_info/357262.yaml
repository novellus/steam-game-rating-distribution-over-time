    review: Most of these seem HEAVILY influenced by music from old Eastwood westerns.
      Good enough for your own take on the Man With No Name, a good Saloon scene,
      or gun duel at high noon. A couple tracks offer some more Native American elements
      to the sound, which work regardless if you're an Indian or Cowboy. As a whole,
      these tracks can work in Sci-Fi and Fantasy worlds with mercenaries, bounty
      hunters, and vast expanses of wilderness.
