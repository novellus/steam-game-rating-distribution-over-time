    about_the_game: "You have been running from the people that murdered your family\
      \ ever since you were a child. Every night you dream you hear the screams of\
      \ your parents tormenting you. One night as you made camp and fell asleep, you\
      \ heard a branch crack that wakes you up, you quickly get up to see the light\
      \ of torches coming your way. As you begin to run, they hear you and begin to\
      \ chase after you. One of them catches up to you and grabs your shoulder and\
      \ turns you around, as you place your hand to his chest and dies. Distraught\
      \ and confused as to what just happened you continue to run, until you come\
      \ to the entrance of a cave and without looking back you run into, going deeper\
      \ and deeper, until finally you see a light glowing in front of you. You run\
      \ into the light to notice it is no longer night and are now in a strange forest,\
      \ then suddenly you hear a loud crash behind you as the tunnel you just emerged\
      \ from collapses. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou begin to hear a voice whispering to\
      \ you, &quot;Come to me.&quot;As you follow the sound of the voice you come\
      \ to a cloaked man standing alone next to some kind of platform. You walk up\
      \ to him as he says, &quot;I know what you've done. I've seen the power that\
      \ you hold. There are others like, hiding and afraid of the powers they possess.\
      \ I think you may be able to help them and set them free. You must become stronger\
      \ though. I can offer you this strength, but it may cost you your life, or soul.\
      \ Would you like the power to free others like you?&quot; He then floats into\
      \ the sky above the platform as glowing light begins to shine from him, then\
      \ says, &quot;If you can survive, you will wield power like this world has never\
      \ know before. Step forth if you dare.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay\
      \ through a procedurally generated dungeon as a wizard trying to obtain more\
      \ power to free themselves as well as people that also possess magical abilities.\
      \ Over come the dungeon gaining power, new abilities, and new magic as you transverse\
      \ through the dungeon. But beware the 3 elder gods and the Demon King."
