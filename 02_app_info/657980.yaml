    short_description: Tsubame and the others get a day off as the dust has settled.
      Yuumi uses her connections to go to a hot spring deep in snow-covered mountains,
      and Mana and a few of the other girls set out to find a yeti. Little do they
      know there seems to be real evidence to support their existence.
