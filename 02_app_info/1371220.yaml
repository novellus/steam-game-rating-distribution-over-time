    review: "Update:\n\nAfter a few ascensions, I have a better idea now how the mechanics\
      \ and concepts fit into this creative new game developed by a very friendly\
      \ and responsive indie-developer who has updated the game in quick response\
      \ to suggestions on the discussion forum.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/44Fzz7bToSo\n\n\
      What is it?  \n\nI would describe Death: The Ascension as a card/puzzle life-choice\
      \ simulator in which you aim to optimize your chances of a successful ascension\
      \ by manipulating event probabilities.  It has a deck-building type of mechanic\
      \ in which you add cards to your deck, but the deck is not a draw-deck.  Cards\
      \ in your \u201Cdeck\u201D influence the chances of drawing cards into the player\u2019\
      s five card hand from an infinite pool.  In other words, if you have only one\
      \ card in your \"deck\", you have a 100% chance of drawing five cards of that\
      \ type.  You are playing cards against Death as your opponent.  Death has their\
      \ own deck that has similar draw mechanics, but only draws one card per turn.\
      \  Each turn one card from each deck is played with four possible events dictated\
      \ by the player\u2019s card with varying probabilities for each event known\
      \ ahead of time.  \n\nCard Play Mechanics:\n\nUnlike most deck builders, cards\
      \ are not purchased with resources.  After each turn (contract), there is an\
      \ outcome based on probabilities that the player can influence strategically.\
      \  The events are in two layers of hierarchy.  First probability is whether\
      \ the outcome is a \"success\" or \"fail\".  \"Success\" outcomes then divide\
      \ into \"formidable\" (best) or just \"good\" events.  \"Fail\" results divide\
      \ into either \"bad\" or \"terrible\" events.  Therefore, each player card has\
      \ four possible events that can be created from a single card.  How these probabilities\
      \ are controlled is based on the quantity of the various resources accumulated\
      \ at the time.  Each card's four possible results (events) are unique to that\
      \ card and have thematic names that must be learned by the player because influencing\
      \ these events is how the player controls his deck.  \n\nAfter the contract\
      \ with death is signed, the resulting outcome is shown as an event card on the\
      \ table with its unique name.  Event cards are not added to your deck, but the\
      \ player will be presented with three cards after the contract is burned from\
      \ that event and must choose one to add to their deck.  These three cards are\
      \ always the same whenever that particular event is created by any card.  Death's\
      \ deck is also influenced by the events.  Death's deck mechanics must be observed\
      \ and learned by the player as it is not shown to the player.  Death cards do\
      \ have visible effects that are not based on the events which are shown on the\
      \ face of the card.  These card effects can be countered only by finding the\
      \ matching player cards that are color aligned to either cancel the effect for\
      \ that turn only (blue) or to remove the card entirely from Death's deck (red).\
      \  This alignment information must be learned by observing how your hand and\
      \ deck cards change color dynamically after a death card is played to the table.\n\
      \nResources:\n\nSouls are the key to the end game god gamble.  Souls are acquired\
      \ by taking more of a chance at failure by incrementally lowering the baseline\
      \ chances of success for each card play contract.  Choosing cards with the highest\
      \ chance of success increase chances to successfully gamble for souls.\n\nGold,\
      \ Love, Fame, Law, Hate, Time, and Souls can be used to 1.) Influence probabilities\
      \ of player card events to bias them to your strategy 2.) Perform rituals to\
      \ exchange card types from your deck directly to your hand, convert resources\
      \ to other resource types, etc.  There is also a random quantity of resources\
      \ unique to each game that must be used as final payment that Death demands\
      \ as a prerequisite to an ascension attempt/gamble.\n\nBlood is a unique resource\
      \ gained by the ethical choices made every three turns when presented an encounter.\
      \  You can influence this even more by choosing from three different levels\
      \ of corruption for your character.  More corruption will result in higher resource\
      \ penalties, but more blood money and hate are the reward.  \n\nLaw is also\
      \ a unique resource that is quantified in the game as a direct result from certain\
      \ types of events.  Law represents the degree to which justice wants you behind\
      \ bars.  You must make choices during an encounter with the law that can negatively\
      \ impact your progress to accumulate resources.\n\nTime is a resource that can\
      \ be impacted positively or negatively by events by impacting the number of\
      \ turns left in the game.\n\nEnd Game:\n\nThe endgame is interesting and unique.\
      \ I will not spoil too much, but it is designed to give replay value by having\
      \ successively increasing win conditions and includes probability and gambling.\
      \  There is a mysterious puzzle aspect to the game where you may choose to answer\
      \ questions posed by Death in order to take a \u201Cchance\u201D at a higher\
      \ level of ascension during the ultimate end game gamble.\n\nConclusion: \n\n\
      First let me tell you why I like abstract card games with a theme.  They free\
      \ up my brain\u2019s limited bandwidth enough to allow my imagination to crunch\
      \ on its own invented stories.  I can\u2019t tell you how well the game play\
      \ is balanced or fine-tuned from a skill vs. luck standpoint.  However, I found\
      \ that each game length was just the right and challenged me to make careful\
      \ choices and study the events necessary to manipulate them carefully.  This,\
      \ in turn, led to a sense of my own story with ethical choices and corruption\
      \ by my own hands.\n\nI found the game very enjoyable from a thematic and creative\
      \ card play perspective with interesting probability influencing ideas.  The\
      \ artwork, color palette, and music are well done. The colors and art style\
      \ are bold, moody, and eye-catching.  More polish would benefit the User Interface\
      \ screens in a few areas, but I eventually learned how each worked. There is\
      \ a lot of English translation issues throughout the game if that bothers you,\
      \ but they reminded me that this game was developed by a single person\u2019\
      s efforts with a creative goal and vision for his game. \n\n...\n\nOriginal\
      \ Review:\n\nThis game has style,  I enjoy the art and music very much.  The\
      \ colors are bold and evocative. \n The concept of controlling chance in multiple\
      \ and interesting ways is intriguing.  There are language translation issues,\
      \ but I don't mind as it adds to the mystery.  The tutorial could be improved,\
      \ and I found it more confusing to play in \"future\" mode that was recommended\
      \ for new players which has most of the tools locked in the beginning.  For\
      \ example, I didn't understand card plays could result in losing turns as well\
      \ as resources.\n\n...more to come has I continue to figure out how to play."
