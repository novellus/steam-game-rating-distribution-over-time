The lead part (which I mostly play) is of moderate difficulty, it plays great both on acoustic and electric guitar and is really fun. The rhythm part is quite interesting as well and adds its own flavor to the song. You can also play lead chords and shuffle licks as a solo without any additional backing for having a sing-along acoustic experience of your own. I have not tried the bass, but you can see the bass part in the video I linked below. All in all I think this song is really worth learning and buying.\nFor further reference, please, do yourself a favor and look at Sam Schwartz, who note-tracked this song, talk about it and play it on the Rocksmith official blues-rock stream https://youtu.be/sUJmrsCwpvg?t=2199","timestamp_created":1488637999,"timestamp_updated":1488637999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5500679612159729","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+abvzNoCeNXScw=="}
