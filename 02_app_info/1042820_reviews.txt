It starts with a weird FMV section with no real idea of what you're supposed to do, followed by a puzzle with poor feedback, THE WORST driving section I've ever played, and ends with a Rail Shooter section that you need to play with a keyboard; no mouse.  Same delayed controls, too.  The renegade humor that I'd loved appears in smaller doses, too, and you spend more time than ever wandering around to short music loops wondering which identical object is the one you're supposed to interact with.  Even the [spoiler]psychedelic alien skate park[/spoiler] was a chore to get through, and it didn't even have any minigames.  It had more of those strangely adorable dancing bunny girls, so that's a plus, but its few benefits aren't enough to save it.  A sad ending to a series that had so much potential.","timestamp_created":1609821265,"timestamp_updated":1609821271,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vea06PYCcvTMwAI="}
