Unfortunately, the game is very unfinished - controls are ok, at best. Level design, whilst in a nice style, is boring and repetetive with a weird respawn/checkpoint system. Several times I found myself entering a portal, with no feedback before immediately popping out the otherside, only to have my poor, little bald headed friend plummet off screen into what I can only assume is another pit of weird, spiky things which look a bit like dynamite :\\\nEnemies are laughable...In fact I don't even really think they're enemies - maybe just helpless, innocent denizens of the weird half city that is the setting, that baldy decides have spent enough time pointlessly moving around on this mortal coil (metaphorically and VERY literally) and so kills in an underwhelming puff of poorly animated sparks...as long as you've found the blue thing which lets you put on your blue pyjamas of ball throwing....\nGood aesthetic, but face-deskingly dull!
