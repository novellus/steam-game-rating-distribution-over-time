Overall the game is interesting to play. If you can develop the full version with the features you mentioned, it's going to be a killer. Melee should have been there in this build as an alternate option of offence. But still it's ok as I managed to use bullets efficiently and run away to objectives. Routes are tricky to find yet I liked that too. Also I agree with IZER above for every point mentioned. Overall I recommend this game to try on and is worth your money.","timestamp_created":1607825697,"timestamp_updated":1607825697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4jqX4rPYCcsfXuQI="}
