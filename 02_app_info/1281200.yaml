    review: 'So im running this game on a GTX 1060 (6GB) and it makes my GPU go to
      95% when i have it on medium quality and on the lowest resolution..... running
      this game on 4k resolution makes it go to 10/20 FPS.


      After screwing around with the settings, i could kind of make it look Okay,
      the game itself is very enjoyable'
