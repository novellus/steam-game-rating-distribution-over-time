The stories so far are really great and creative. I hope this game gets the attention it deserves. Really really great, I am enjoying this so far and hope for more games with this approach in the future!!","timestamp_created":1610197669,"timestamp_updated":1610197669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yNLQ8/YCd6HmwQI="}
