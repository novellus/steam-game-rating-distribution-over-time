It has some flaws, sure, but it is remarkably effective in its core goal: To care you. The game is truly an exercise in isolation. Your character wakes up and you are given no information to go on. So you explore. As you do you find your objectives. Simple fun.\n\nThe scares are what are truly exciting though. I did not expect much as all, after all, it is a $0.99 game with a HUD ripped right from Halo. The scares are simple, but really effective. If you've ever watched Doctor Who, it'll seem familiar. \n\nI had a lot of fun, and if you're just looking for a quick silly game with some decent scares, I would 100% recommend it. Though I will say, I think it would be more fun for someone who is streaming and interacting with an audience, as the game does have lulls in the action.","timestamp_created":1589693595,"timestamp_updated":1589693595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525316417217254639","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41+fHkPICfKSniAI="}
