    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers[/h1]\n\nYou\
      \ can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/eZOR-yk3BO8\n\nThis a\
      \ 15 minute mostly cinematic virtual reality experience. There are really only\
      \ two interactions. You have a laser pointer which you can use to point at things\
      \ (and get some factoids on those objects which are interactive) and you have\
      \ a camera to take selfies or take low quality photos of objects around, including\
      \ marine life & vegetation.\n\nRoom-scale is required to start the experience.\
      \ You have to reach the start button. That's the only time you'll use your room-scale.\
      \ I'm not kidding. They actually thought that was a good idea.\n\nSo most of\
      \ the experience is just scripted events where a narrator will tell you about\
      \ global warming and the effect of the that on this particular oceanic life.\
      \ It was all stuff that I was already aware of, but it is illustrated here with\
      \ a look at present conditions as well as the possible near future impact on\
      \ oceanic life. \n\nThe visuals are mediocre, not great like in theBlu. However,\
      \ unlike other games with this level of graphics, you can't swim around or interact\
      \ with items in a meaningful or creative way. In the end, this feels more like\
      \ it should have been a free to play title and then we could have forgiven its\
      \ limitations. I'm just not sure I got my $2.99 USD (50% Steam sale) value from\
      \ this experience.\n\n[b]Rate 5/10. I think this would be good for kids to learn\
      \ about global warming in a approachable manner and I do recommend this app\
      \ for that purpose, especially if you happen to have a LAN with several VR headsets\
      \ and PCs capable of running VR just lying around your house (don't forget to\
      \ buy a copy for each machine!)[/b]"
