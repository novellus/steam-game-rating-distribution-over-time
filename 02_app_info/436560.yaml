    review: 'Update:


      Devs abandoned it and left paying customers out to dry..... avoid anything they
      piut out...


      Interesting game that visually reminds me of wow. But at this point for early
      access the gameplay is a bit clunky but it works. Most of gameplay involves
      instanced dungeons of various types and levels that you can run solo or in groups.
      Decent class devlopment but it is clearly a work in progress. The itemization
      shows promise but needs work still. I would say the game is on its way to a
      solid 7 out of 10 if they can fix animations, hit boxes, and many other areas.


      Other cash grab from them to avoid:'
