    review: "So we have come to this point, eh?\nI'm happy we are. Hey everyone\n\n\
      Before I begin the review, I wanna point out that I'm not paid in any way shape\
      \ or form to write this. I'm simply a friend of a tester, and that doesn't mean\
      \ I won't critizize here and there of what I actually think about this game.\n\
      My friend will also be helping me of what he thought of it when he was testing\
      \ it out, so yeah.\n\nFirstly, the gameplay as it's probably what first comes\
      \ to mind when you see this. The gameplay itself is silky smooth, with all the\
      \ buttons being responsive as heck, and really makes you learn what mistake\
      \ you made. Aside from that tho, the graphics seem a bit mediaocre for what\
      \ it is, even if it's made mostly by one person. I know it's styled a bit that\
      \ way, and it's made to look like that, but it just doesn't seem right to me,\
      \ even for a Dream World. The controls get a little confusing as my friend (when\
      \ he was still testing) told me that the developer changed some controls around,\
      \ back when you had different control schemes. Interesting. \nHe said: \"Instead\
      \ of putting both control schemes in the options, he just straight up removed\
      \ the ability for you to change the controls for double tapping!\"\n Apparently\
      \ you could double tap the right and left arrow keys to manipulate the gravity\
      \ position, is what he's talking of. But idk, I think it's fine as it is.\n\n\
      Secondly, the story. This game is definitely not made for story, which is okay,\
      \ as long as it uses what it can. We follow a stickmin named Marvin, who was\
      \ just done writing on his PC when suddenly the Dream Wizard breaks in from\
      \ the sky and tells Marvin to go on some sort of scavenger-hunt to collect all\
      \ the Knowledge Orbs. (which are knowledge-able, as you get them by manipulating)\
      \ If he doesn't comply, the Dream Wizard will shut him to sleep forever and\
      \ no happy ending will come from that. So he decides to get up and try to escape\
      \ the Dream World, which is where your journey begins. I'm telling 'ya, this\
      \ reminds me of Rayman and I like it. I'm not telling you the whole thing, as\
      \ I want you to discover this! Right now Taz!\n\nAnd lastly, the hats. The hats\
      \ are some kind of powerup Marvin is accustomed to wear after he finds out he\
      \ needs these hats in order to manipulate gravity. You can get them in different\
      \ styles, sizes and colors but they don't serve as an actual way of telling\
      \ which one is better than the other and you most likely can't choose which\
      \ ones to wear. (I checked options) My suggestion, if these really don't matter,\
      \ I'd suggest letting everyone choose which hat to wear in the game.\n\nThat's\
      \ all me and my friend could think of saying, thanks Josh for this awesome opportunity\
      \ and thanks to my friend for helping me write this review. My friend truly\
      \ wants to see this become a success, and I don't want anything more but for\
      \ that to become a reality. So if you're wrapping your head around blankets\
      \ wondering if you should buy this game, I'd say plz check it out, it's a lot\
      \ of fun after all. Even better if you're playing this with family.\n\n~Pat"
