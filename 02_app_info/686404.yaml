    review: 'Do you like Skaven? Do you also like Goblins? Maybe you want a Troll
      in there for fun. Well, TODAYS YOUR LUCKY DAY.


      Underworld denizens are as you can see from the steam images, a mix of Skaven
      and Goblins with a very nice lookin Troll. This team gets access to mutations
      for all players. Yes including the Troll, talk about a big boi. That and their
      aesthetic is cool, I just hope they get some more customization in Blood Bowl
      3.'
