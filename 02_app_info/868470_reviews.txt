You can stay idle to collect coins, go kill monsters, and buy/upgrade stuff in shops. Nothing complicated or unique, but it's cheap, so not a problem.\n\nDiffuculty: 2/5: The only real diffuculty here is when your weapons don't deal much damage, and your health isn't that high. There is an easy fix to this, as you can use a ticket to collect chests worth a lot of money. After your first chest room, things get VERY easy as you will be making heaps of money and get weapons that one-shot every single monster.\n\nLasting Value: 1/5: I only played for about 15 minutes before I got bored. There is a limited skillset (only 3 moves), no unique monster abilities, and a lack of features. A decent time waster, but not much else.\n\nOverall: 2/5: Heroes Arena boils down to just another grinding RPG, just with a lot less features. I personally don't reccomend it, but the price IS very cheap, so it's your call on whether you want it or not. Just know this isn't great for the price.","timestamp_created":1532924568,"timestamp_updated":1532924642,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52931445837020874","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrbjb9OQCe5yYpwE="}
