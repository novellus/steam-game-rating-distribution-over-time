    review: "I was blown away.  This is a truly outstanding work of science fiction\
      \ by Manuel F. Cede\xF1o.  The art is [b]gorgeous[/b].  The story is compelling.\
      \ The characters are well realized.  There are some very big ideas.  The English\
      \ grammar is about 98% there, but at no time did I have any trouble understanding\
      \ what was being said. I highly recommend this gem to anyone interested in space\
      \ exploration, artificial intelligence, or strong female characters."
