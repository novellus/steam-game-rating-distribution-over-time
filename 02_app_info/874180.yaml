    about_the_game: 'Vanguardian is an action-adventure game with RPG elements, monster
      conversion (pet system), an ever-increasing list of equipment with their own
      special effects, dungeon raids, puzzle aspects, and so on.<br><br><strong>Backstory:</strong>
      Vanguardian is about a child born into the world without a true family. Amidst
      the evil that was spreading over the land, the Vanguardian Council set out cleans
      the world as prophecy had fortold, however it appeared to be far too late, the
      shadow realm seemed to be expecting the Vanguardian Council. With the aid of
      a surprise ambush on their side the Shadow realm was rumored to not only defeat
      the Vanguardian Council but to have eradicated them completely. Little did they
      know that you were left behind, too young to join the front lines. Only Gallehan
      and the Mage Council are left to aid you in your transformation from child to
      Vanguardian...the Last Vanguardian. <br><br><strong>The Action:</strong> there
      is an ever-increasing variety of monsters in the world of Vanguardian each with
      their own set of stats, movement patterns, and attack patterns. As the Vanguardian,
      on your quest you will come to find a host of skills, weapons, armor, boots,
      and shields that each have their own effects when equipped (including a visual
      change when equipped). <br><br><strong>The Adventure</strong> The Shadow Realm
      appoints a boss to reside over each town they conquer. As long as the boss remains
      alive the people of a town are trapped there. You will need to eradicate these
      bosses to free the people of these towns. Each boss will require certain upgrades
      and tactics to defeat it. Also, you will find hidden dungeons, secret rooms,
      puzzles, NPC''s with their own quests, and an ever-increasing world with much
      to discover.<br><br><strong>Monster Conversion (Pet System):</strong> Just because
      you are destined to become a Vanguardian doesn''t mean you should venture into
      the world alone. Certain monsters can be converted with essence orbs to join
      your cause currently these monsters include: Basic Slime, Advanced Slime, Hyper
      Slime, Basic Skeleton, Advanced Skeleton, Basic Goblin, Sword Goblin, Snow Golem,
      and the Snowman. Each converted monster has its own stats and level system,
      the plan is that future updates will include either or both 1) a pet gear system
      or/and 2) an evolution system with skills.<br><br><strong>Equipment</strong>:
      Currently equipment consists of Cloaks, Weapons, Shields, and Boots. Instead
      of the usual system where equipment has progressively better stats, each piece
      of equipment will coincide with your current stats. The difference will be the
      effects the gear has when equipped, from spawning orbs, to freezing your enemies.<br><br><strong>The
      Goal</strong> The ultimate goal of Vanguardian is to build a world you will
      enjoy thus, I am not limited to these aspects, any idea that you send me I will
      assess and if it can be done, within reason, I will work to bring it to Vanguardian.
      Thank you for your time and support. Good Luck Vanguardian.'
