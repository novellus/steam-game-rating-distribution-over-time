This game is dead, and it basically always has been. It's a game that relied on a multiplayer community that never formed, and no steps were ever taken to create additional single-player content.\n-END EDIT\n\nI would recommend this game, although, I admit, I may have somewhat selfish reasons for doing so. On the surface, Spectre is very similar to many other recent survival horror games; you wander around a dark, creepy environment, with nothing but a flashlight to guide you. Along the way, you're stalked by a spirit that kills you for looking at her, meaning your only tactic is to turn tail and run anytime she gets near. Instead of finding eight items to win this game, you just need one; the camera. Find it, snap a picture of The Spectre when she's right in your face, and you win.\n\nAs this game is still in the early stages, more content will certainly be added later, but for now, the game is rather bare. I found no story elements, nor any explanation for what The Spectre is, although they may have been there and I just missed them. There are also a few issues with gameplay; sprinting doesn't work in Singleplayer, and the 'Use' and 'Open Door' commands don't seem to have a purpose yet. Again, more is sure to come, but if I were involved in the development, I'd prioritize expanding the map; I beat the game in 18 minutes, and that includes three deaths, and general wandering.\n\nWhere this game really stands out is in the atmosphere; the mansion you wander through looks fantastic, and there aren't too many indie games that can compare to it. It could benefit from a some more rooms, maybe even a whole new floor, but it's a strong foundation. The Spectre also looks pretty good, although I sometimes have trouble telling if the jerky way she moves is by design or a bug. The sound design also stands out, and while I admit it's a bit generic as far as this kind of game goes, it still does its job of setting the mood quite well.\n\nWhat has the potential to set this game apart from the rest is the multiplayer feature. As of this review, I've yet to find anyone to play with, but it seems like it would be a more polished version of the Garry's Mod gamemode 'Stop it Slender', with one player being The Spectre, and the rest trying to locate the camera. To me, this seems like the game's biggest selling point, but as of right now, the servers seem to be dead, with nary a player in sight. This is the main reason I recommend this game; the multiplayer feature seems like the idea that this game was built around, but there just aren't enough players yet, and it seems like the game isn't living up to its full potential.\n\nI've also not tried the VR mode, so if that's a big selling point for you, you'll have to look elsewhere to find out if it's any good.\n\nSo, anyone who's on the fence about this one, consider a few things: \n\n1. Do you enjoy games like Slender and SCP Containment Breach?\n2. If yes, have you ever wished you could play as Slender Man/SCP-173?\n3. Are you willing to help work out the various kinks present in all Early Access games?\n4. Do you have at least two like-minded friends who might be willing to play as well?\n\nIf you answered yes to two or more of those questions, then Spectre may be worth your time.","timestamp_created":1415396023,"timestamp_updated":1545548788,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwkt747OcCcOf6MA=="}
