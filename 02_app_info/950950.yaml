    review: 'This one is bad... this one is really bad!


      You play a paranormal investigator, that is asked by the mayor to investigate
      the mysterious events in a mental hospital that has fallen to chaos.


      PRESENTATION


      Pretty bad; lots of typos and spelling errors, controller that doesn''t work
      at the start screen, and sometimes some of the buttons fail to work in the levels.
      Simple menus. The story is revealed through files, that you find at various
      places throughout the entire game, which is quite short. Sadly, these files
      cannot be read at times, obviously due to a bug.


      SOUND AND GRAPHICS


      Sound is probably the best part of this game; spooky sound effects, groans,
      lightning, weird eldritch spell noise, all of that. There are some cool lightning
      effects, and the overall graphic aspect looks appropriate, albeit low budget,
      but the bad thing is, you cannot tell apart what is an obstacle and what is
      not! There are furniture pieces such as beds and tables, that you can simply
      walk over as if they are tiles on the floor, and then there are some amorphous
      grey objects (slabs?) that stop you from moving; how are you supposed to know
      which affects your movement? Walls block movement and projectiles, but other
      times different objects work like that as well, and you cannot tell which is
      which most of the time. Graphically speaking, there are some cool details like
      skeletons, asylum debris and rotting paraphernalia, etc., but that''s about
      it. The enemies and player character look unremarkable and forgettable.


      STORY


      Simple and cliche''d, ultimately forgettable. There is an insane asylum full
      of crazy inmates that want to hurt you, there is something else going on, maybe
      all of those pentagrams painted in blood hint at something supernatural??


      GAMEPLAY


      Pretty bad. The controls are awful if you play with a controller, because your
      character is eternally locked in the direction your mouse is pointing at; think
      of it as the clumsiest version of dual stick shooters you have ever seen, but
      much worse. It''s more bearable with mouse and keboard. The protagonist is one
      of the slowest, most inaccurate shooters in video game history. The enemies
      never seek you out, they just stay in their corner until they see you, then
      they start to move and shoot. The game becomes repetitive after 2 levels, and
      the game itself is quite short (5 or 6 levels I think), it''s always the same:
      find 3 batteries (one by one because your character cannot carry more than one),
      insert them in a place after much backtracking, find the exit. Repeat. Every.
      Single. Time. Only 3 types of enemies, some of them shoot rotten flesh, others
      shoot and move a bit faster, others shoot blood instead. Yeah. You have two
      weapons, and you immediately figure out that you should use your unlimited ammo
      gun most of the time, and only use your AK when enemies spawn nearby due to
      a trigger object.


      CONCLUSION


      Good concept, even if cliche''d, that could have been a tongue in cheek experience,
      but was ruined completely due to typos, control bugs, terrible gameplay, an
      environment that cannot be navigated well due to nonsensical furniture logic
      (see SOUND AND GRAPHICS). Bugs that make it impossible to read some of the files
      in game. Lackluster ending with a cliffhanger that really doesn''t get you excited
      to see it reach a conclusion. Overall, stay away from this one. This is the
      only game in many years, that I truly regret to have played. Even Larva Mortus
      was more fun, get that one instead, but check out my review for that one first
      to see if it''s your thing.'
