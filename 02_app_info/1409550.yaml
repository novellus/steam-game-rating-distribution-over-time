    short_description: The lovechild of Ferris Bueller's Day off and Final Fantasy.
      Creepslore is a hybrid 2.5D point-and-click adventure visual novel with weird
      characters, unique art, surreal comedy, and just enough text to not make you
      go crazy. Did I mention there's also a talking lamp?
