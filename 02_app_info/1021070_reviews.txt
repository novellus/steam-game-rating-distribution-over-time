So each stage is a kind of logic challenge more than a battlefield. The design is neat (even if I still wonder why such heavily armoured people don't wear any helmet :-)) and the gameplay simple and fluid. From my point of view a good game difficult to leave (\"just one last stage...\"); main feature to improve is the cooperative multiplayer, quite limited for now but it is a new feature let's give them some time to implement it...","timestamp_created":1609610671,"timestamp_updated":1609610671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ubaR4vYCfd3mvwI="}
