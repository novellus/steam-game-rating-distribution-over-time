    about_the_game: Roll your way through a hard-core, high-speed, fury-inducing,
      nail-biting, reaction-based physics-platformer where momentum and skill is the
      difference between making the jump and falling to your inevitable death.<br><br>The
      game pays homage to a time where video games were allowed to be difficult. It
      is best described as a crossover between Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Meat Boy
      - with the level design of Super Mario... and the control scheme of Angry Birds?!<br><br>The
      premise is simple, move the ball with your mouse. However, with 360 degrees
      of options, varying speeds, and moving terrain, the movement itself becomes
      a puzzle. Even the smallest challenge becomes difficult when you just can't
      seem to stand still!<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>

    review: 'Fun game, A bit difficult controls, much rather prefer moving with wasd
      or controller.


      Love the speedrunning aspect of this game and definitely encouraged by the $1,000
      competition.


      Game is quite difficult, especially on the bosses. Good level design and platforming.'
