    review: "Updated review:\nIn general I love such games (close to M&M6-9) but this\
      \ one needs some work though.\nAnd I still can't understand why it was not released\
      \ as an early access game.\nNot much variety and depth so far and the size of\
      \ the map / the amount of content is quite small (roughly 6-8 times smaller\
      \ than M&M6), \nDon't get me wrong, I'd really like to give a thumbs up after\
      \ improvement and more content, but for now I just can't recommend it. \nHope\
      \ the dev will work on it...\nMight update my review in a few months. \nCheers!"
