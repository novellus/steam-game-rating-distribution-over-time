    review: "In addition to the Fateful Clash (1582) DLC Scenario, this is the only\
      \ other DLC for NA:SoI that adds in new events and missions; as the name would\
      \ imply, this DLC allows you to win the Battle of Nagashino as the Takeda. Though\
      \ it's much easier said than done; Nagashino as the Takeda is probably the hardest\
      \ event battle in game, and the Oda aren't easy to overcome even after the battle.\
      \ This DLC is also quite useful for the Oda as well, as there's a grocery list\
      \ of items required to trigger Nagashino ingame, so this makes it incredibly\
      \ easy to jump straight to the event (not to mention without any DLC there's\
      \ a twelve-year gap between startdates; 1570 to 1582, so this also fills that\
      \ as well). \n\nOverall, between the new events and missions, difficulty, accessibility\
      \ and challenge it offers, this DLC is well worth the $3."
