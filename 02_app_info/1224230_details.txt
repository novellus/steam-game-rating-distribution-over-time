How you control Kara, Connor and Markus can mean life or death – and if one of them pays the ultimate price, the story still continues…<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCOUNTLESS PATHS, COUNTLESS ENDINGS – Every decision you make, no matter how minute, affects the outcome of the story. No playthrough will be exactly the same: replay again and again to discover a totally different conclusion.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFULLY OPTIMIZED FOR PC – Previously only available on PlayStation® 4, Detroit: Become Human is brought to PC with stunning graphics, 4K resolution, 60 fps framerate and full integration of both mouse\/keyboard and gamepad controls for the most complete Detroit: Become Human experience to date.","about_the_game":"In this first chapter, play as Connor, the unique prototype android serving the Detroit police department and face a deviant android who has taken a little girl hostage.
