It seems as though some entity wishes to play a series of games with you, and if you complete them you are able to get your teddy back. If you lose, you are consumed by the darkness.\n\nThe goal of the game here is to stay in the light at all times; whether by actually standing near a light source or by keeping your flashlight on. The flashlight does run out of power fairly quickly, though it's rechargeable so you never run out of batteries. Though you can find and use batteries to extend the life of the flashlight, and you can also pick up lamps to throw down when there's no available light source and you're out of battery juice. If you stay in the darkness for too long, a phantom ends up coming to eat your soul. Survive this ghost's three games, and you win.\n\nEach time you play through The Bedtime Story's short 20-30 minute campaign, the layout of the house changes. If you end up dying to the ghost, you have to start back from the very beginning of the game. You proceed through the mini-games by staying in the light and finding keys to open new doors. Unfortunately, the developer didn't have enough foresight to place appropriate spawn points for everything, since necessary keys can spawn behind locked doors and you can, in theory, be playing a run of the house that is unbeatable.\n\nThe Bedtime Story is a mediocre choice if you're looking for one of those games that gives you the thrill of being hunted while you are, in turn, searching for particular items. The fact that the procedural generation is beyond broken is what truly keeps this title from being recommended; you can launch into a version of the house that is unwinnable since the developer didn't put a restriction on where the keys can be spawned, and that's absolutely no fun at all. It also launches in a small windowed screen that cannot be changed, with a default aspect ratio of 4:3. Despite this title launching in 2017, there have only been a couple of minor updates and no real developer support.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]1.5/5.0[/b] - It's Bad.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore","timestamp_created":1558188194,"timestamp_updated":1558188227,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581693410873413086","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m6/Q5eoCcJW1wQE="}
