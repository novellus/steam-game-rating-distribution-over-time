    developer_response: 'I am sorry you find the game too difficult.

      The different enemies only spawn according to which rooms you enter in the school,
      if you find the room with the projector it is relatively easy to progress since
      you get the code you need there to get to the next area. I did put 3D navigational
      helpers on most puzzles, but wanted some stuff for the player to figure out
      themselves too. Not sure what "blur effect" you are referencing, since the game
      does not contain motion blur at all.

      Thanks for your review.'

    review: "Solidly spoopy game. If you're fast and clever, you'll probably enjoy\
      \ it. Check the other reviews first as they seem to be pretty mixed.\n\nWhile\
      \ the game has some decent spoops with a good atmosphere, I don't think I will\
      \ ever complete it because: \n\n* The AI corners me in the school so much that\
      \ I'm ready to give up.\n* The blur effects that I have turned off in the menu\
      \ are still there and it makes it very difficult to play.\n* The inventory interface\
      \ feels clunky and reloading the flashlight feels like it takes forever. \n\
      * It's hard to understand what the puzzles want from me later in the game. \n\
