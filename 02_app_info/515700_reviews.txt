Multiplayer is where friends and family can hang out and throw snowballs at each other. The problem there is Multiplayer DOES NOT WORK. Had high hopes for it. Online connection is sketchy, and no LAN option either. The snowmen are really irritating as it takes away the fun from interacting with friends but then again nobody is every online and LAN connection not available. If they add a snowman option then at least have it in an optional 'Horde Mode', I was sold on the idea of snowballs and friends, sounds like good times and fun, but nothing else is added to the game, can't interact with the environment and the pointless and relentless re-spawning of snowmen a waste of time, as it cycles repeatedly without end. The price you pay for this is exorbitant! For something is is best off as a early access demo. No updates that we've noticed for a LONG time.","timestamp_created":1491800303,"timestamp_updated":1491800303,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ42cSOq9sCfJi7dg=="}
