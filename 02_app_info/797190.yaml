    review: 'Many things need to be addressed, its well iritating taht i cant reverse
      my mouse, the UI is ooff in my screen at 1920x1200 the start buttong is off
      the screen texcept a small pice of the S, other than that, H YEA THE MUSIC IS
      REALLY IRITATING AND YOU CANT TURN IT OFF, many creature comfoorts are needed
      but the dev thinks VR is more important, it was only $2 so oi hoope this dev
      groows up but as of right now this could just DIE due to poor decisioon making....
      Its like a child of the age of 12 or 13 is desiging and programing this game
      and just doooes not have enough experince to know whast important to players.....
      hope this review helps wake him up and get theses simple things fixed. if the
      game shapes up ill revisit my review.


      had to refund my purchas as the dev wouldent even respond to the music and mouse
      fliping just no communication at all... sad its a NO BUY wait a few years, and
      i really wanted to buy like 10 copys to give tto my friends but yea NOPE'
