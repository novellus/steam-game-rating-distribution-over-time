    about_the_game: Solace Crafting lets you build and go any where you want with
      one caveat, the further you travel from the start the harder everything becomes,
      to no end. A fantasy sandbox, there is no &quot;do this to finish the game.&quot;
      Explore, unlock recipes, seek out rare resources, build towns, level up, and
      own the wild.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/670260/extras/about1.jpg?t=1600951953"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Harvesting</h2>Good weapons and armor need good materials
      to make them. Resources in Solace Crafting are tier and rarity based, meaning
      the more dangerous the area you're in the higher tier of resources will be available.
      In order to help you find elite and legendary grade resources you can build
      towns and populate them with NPCs to locate rare resources for you.<h2 class="bb_tag">Crafting</h2>Recipes
      in Solace Crafting are not predefined. A leather boots recipe creates leather
      boots, but the level, tier, rarity, and color are completely up to you, limited
      only by your resources and skills. As you push further and find increasingly
      powerful materials, upgrading your equipment is paramount to survival.<br><br><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/670260/extras/about06.jpg?t=1600951953"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Enchanting</h2>As with item crafting, enchanting recipes
      are customizable and can make a huge difference in your combat prowess and harvesting
      abilities.<h2 class="bb_tag">Exploration</h2>Unlock new recipes and seek out
      rare materials high in the mountains and deep underground. Or go looking for
      the perfect island to support your main base. Solace Crafting has no boundaries,
      no off limit areas.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/670260/extras/about5.jpg?t=1600951953"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Adventuring</h2>Choose skills from four archetypes freely,
      mixing and matching your skills as you see fit. Most skills have no maximum
      level and can continue to level up with you as far as you're able to travel.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Building</h2>Our unique building system is fast, precise, and
      can be done with your eyes closed once you learn how it works. In-game guidance
      will show you how to use the keyboard to build huge structures without hardly
      needing to move.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/670260/extras/about4.jpg?t=1600951953"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Solaces</h2>Build a new solace anywhere in the infinite
      worlds of Solace Crafting and you gain the ability to teleport to and from it
      at no cost. Build up your main base anywhere you like, setting up outposts and
      hamlets wherever needed on your travels.<h2 class="bb_tag">Towns</h2>Town buildings
      can be placed within the power range of any solace, allowing you to summon townspeople
      of various professions.<br><br><br><strong><u>Developed by a gamer</u></strong><br>I
      started learning how to make games years ago because the design decisions of
      so many of the games I played often made so little sense to me. Here are some
      of the design decisions I refined over the years that I do my best to uphold:<br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>No pay-to-win, no pay-to-play, no paid DLC, no gacha or gamble
      mechanics<br></li><li>No metered progression<br></li><li>Level any and all professions
      freely<br></li><li>Minimal sub-ingredients, minimal crafting and refining timers<br></li><li>Completely
      open, point and level based branching skill trees<br></li><li>Multiple, incremental
      skill points every level<br></li><li>Classic roles, not forced balance. Some
      classes may be harder than others<br></li><li>Unlimited player levels<br></li><li>Completely
      open physics-based world, no off-limits<br></li><li>No &quot;realistic&quot;
      building physics that destroy everything when things go wrong<br></li><li>Unlimited
      access to parallel realities (alternate seeds)<br></li><li>Shape and color your
      avatars freely instead of using preset races<br></li><li>Allow alternate characters
      in the same world</li></ul><br><strong><u>Background</u></strong><br>My name
      is Kyle Postlewait (35) and I got into game development because I can't find
      the game that I want to play. I am not a veteran game developer. I do not have
      any published AAA titles. I am self-taught and I make mistakes. Having said
      that, I'm tired of survival crafting games being abandoned, focusing only on
      PvP and guns, or turning into major time sinks. I quit my day job in February
      of 2018 to focus on Solace Crafting full-time, and am doing everything I can
      to make a great fantasy survival RPG despite the tremendous challenge that is
      game development. Please don't buy into early access expecting a fully polished
      AAA game and then give it a bad review. In return, I promise to make sure that
      this game is never abandoned. If sales are more than enough for me to survive,
      then I can hire more help. First and foremost I will always work to secure financial
      longevity and legal stability.<br><br>I know a lot of fans of the survival genre
      are pretty jaded, myself included, after so many titles have lost their leadership,
      changed projects, or plain given up. I'm here every day hoping to heal that
      sore and would very much appreciate your $15 support if any of this interests
      you. There are months of frequent patch notes and forum discussions between
      me and players here on Steam as proof that I'm capable of more than a couple
      new items after weeks of silence, something far too common in game development!<br><br>Multiplayer
      like single-player will be PvE oriented, and is currently in closed alpha.<br><br>Early
      access ends when there is enough content to constitute selling the game without
      the above warning.<br><br>Getting better every day thanks to player involvement!

    review: 'Seen a lot of this before - but not like this and not in one game.


      This is cross between Force of Nature (crafting materials and tiers), Wurm (Skill
      Levelling and depth), Novus Inceptio (Resource Gathers), Alchemist Awakening
      (Free build and exploration), RPG elements and character skills.


      It looks like the developer has chosen some of the key parts of these other
      examples and integrated them together to make - well - at EA level - a fully
      functional game that is deep and rewarding.


      The dual resource system (Quality and Tiering) adds an unexpected dimension
      to crafting and the ability to produce towns that automate some aspects of gathering
      are interesting.


      My favourite discovery is the Lei-Transporter.  Build one, set a direction,
      set a distance and step inside.


      Combat - think "Salt". It is cumbersome (and the cooldown timers aren''t obvious)
      but it works.  My view is it is important mechanism but not the reason to play
      the game (note however, you cannot avoid combat for long).


      Unlike most "crafting" games - there comes a time when you wonder why you need
      to craft anything - the beauty of this game - is that as the Tiers increase
      - so you equipment needs to increase to match.  For instance, 5KM from center
      - do you really think you can chop a tree with that hatchet you made from T0
      stone?


      It has a boat (probably more than one)!


      Love the way warehouses expand and items marked as "decorative" aren''t necessarily
      cosmetic.


      As an EA game - this is one of the most rounded - with every system working
      to some extent and fairly clear which options are "to be worked upon" e.g. Careers
      and Trade (as of 1/1/2021).


      Time to eat some more cabbages and hunt.'
