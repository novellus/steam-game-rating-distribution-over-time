This is tiring and frustrating when trying to run from the cops or just move around at all. I've been playing for 10 minutes and my clicking hand is killing me. If I could move with WASD or arrow keys I would definitely recommend this game as a great time killer and casual indie game.","timestamp_created":1523928958,"timestamp_updated":1523928958,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.623586356639862061","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww9DP6OICdZ63ngE="}
