For a master student in mathematics like me, engineering students or just people with sharp minds, this math puzzle game won't be much of a obstacle for completing it. However, this game is for everyone since the gamer gets the opportunity to develop the logic skill. \n\nFor each tenth level, the gamer learns a new math operation to solve a specific problem for upcoming levels. A minor spoiler, the math operations are the four arithmetic fundamentals, adding digit left - or right wise, modulo, power and negativity sign. Once you learn the operations quickly which any person might able to solve each problem, the game actually is short. There are slightly more than hundred levels. The achievements aren't a problem to get since you only need to reach each tenth level.\n\nThe only complaints of this game is how the game handle the division operation. For example, if the quotient is 8/5, the exact result is 1.6, but the game truncate down the answer which is 1, where it really should be 2 if rounding a number really is allowed since the algorithm obviously only uses integers. But, once you understand that, it's a good thing to remember for solving the upcoming problems.\n\nThe gameplay isn't so much to mention except above, and there is none to add. The music suits the game well. \n\nIt's a good math game, actually. However, I wished the gamer could \"learn\" the \"square root\" operation to solve more math problems, where the rounding of the number is used based on the argument above. I give it a 7/10.","timestamp_created":1592698787,"timestamp_updated":1592699264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwMOR6vICdM2djwI="}
