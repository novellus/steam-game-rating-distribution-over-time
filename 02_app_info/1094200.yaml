    review: 'Early access is still buggy, but after 45 hours I''m still interested
      in the long term story plot of mysterious murders, unknown illegal medical clinics,
      old insane asylums, and how the medical board is involved or not. A lot of loose
      ends to tie off and clean up, but it has my attention and it has potential.
      Suggestions: Attributes are obtained too easily on the cheap, and they seem
      underplayed during the game. The daily grind of making a reputation as a GP
      seems isolated and can be boring. There should be surprise bonus rewards and
      heavy penalties built in beyond the current design to keep things on edge for
      more experienced players. Oh yes, Claudia owns me - I wish.'
