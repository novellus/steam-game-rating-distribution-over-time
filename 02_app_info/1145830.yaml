    review: 'This game was a trip. Clarevoyance is a visual novel with light resource
      management elements set in the Acadian municipality of Clare in Nova Scotia.
      The images in the game are all taken in the region and all dialogue is voiced
      by locals in Acadian French with English subtitles. I am from New Brunswick
      originally so it sounds pretty nostalgic.


      You play as someone visiting relatives in Clare over the summer. As you travel
      around doing different activities and "spinning yarns" with the locals, you
      start to realize that things are not quite as they seem. The story incorporates
      local legends in a way that was pretty clever and fun. The resource management
      portion involves earning money, buying food and managing your "well being",
      a sort of HP gauge that decreases when you use your powers to interact with
      the local mythology and increases when you do certain fun activities. There
      is also a time system where activities use up certain amounts of time in a day,
      and some things can only be done at specific times of day. There isn''t a time
      limit though so you can take as long as you want to proceed through the story.


      For any achievement hunters following me, a couple of the achievements didn''t
      pop properly for me, but for anyone else I would recommend this charming game.'
