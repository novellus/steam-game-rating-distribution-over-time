      small islands. When you arrive on an island, there is only few inhabitants and
      no electric facilities. <br>It''s your job to build a robust electric grid which
      can support the development of the island in every domain: tourism, industry,
      residential, health, ...<br><br>Every day starts with a preparation phase. You
      can construct new buildings, buy raw materials and manage different aspect of
      your grid.<br>When you''re ready, the clock starts and you can see in real time,
      minute by minute the electricity quantity you produced and the electricity being
      consumed by the city. <br><br>It''s important to produce enough electricity
      to match the demand and avoid power outage. On the other side, producing too

    short_description: Build and manage an electric grid ! At the start of the day,
      build new infrastructure and plan your day. Once ready, start the day then watch
      electricity production / consumption in real time to adjust your buildings settings.
      The growth of the islands depends on you !
