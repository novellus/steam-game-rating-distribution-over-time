    review: 'This game is what I would call a "hidden effort". I can''t believe that
      something that had so much effort put into cartoon qualities is so obscure,
      almost a shame.


      But a hidden gem it is not. More like hidden jank.


      You can see people really wracking their brain of making it more like a cartoon
      action, so they came wiht a structure where you have a compilation of minigames
      and walk in 3D-like maze. The maze is played from the third person and is actually
      impressive for its time, I like how you can control the devil to walk around
      in 8 direction. But you really can''t see any obstacle coming, especially with
      mutt''s muttness blocking the view. And maze is a maze with nothing interesting
      going on aside from funny obstacle animations, so.


      And minigames are horrible to control, especially their nearly one button fighting.
      It sure is not Street Fighter 2, not even 1, more like Flash animation and it''s
      bad and stay for too long. And if it''s not fighting, then it''s not terribly
      unique, probably more of annoying, like teleporters maze. There are very few
      decent minigames, as I saw in longplay video because I have too much self-respect
      to beat games nowadays, ho ho ho, but they aren''t worth it.'
