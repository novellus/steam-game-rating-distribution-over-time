    about_the_game: 'Holopoint is pure archery madness. Fight your way through waves
      of responsive targets, samurai, and highly dangerous ninjas - all while drawing,
      nocking, and shooting your arrows as quickly as possible. <br><br>Holopoint
      is a skill based game where progression is based on player skill and training
      rather than unlocks. Like many arcade style games, personal progress and a high
      score is the goal. There are two game-modes: Original, and Time-Trial.<br>The
      original game mode offers sixty waves to progress through. Targets are introduced
      as groups of waves are completed. This mode quickly becomes difficult and requires
      an active mindset. Holopoint is designed so that only a few determined archers
      will reach the last wave.<br>Time-Trial allows player to define a subset of
      targets and a play-time, during which points are awarded for targets hit, and
      taken away when a target hits back. This game mode offers a more casual and
      controlled experience, and is used by many as a timed workout.<br><br>WARNING:
      THIS GAME GETS INTENSE.  REMEMBER TO BREATH AND TAKE BREAKS.<br><br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://springboardvr.com?game_verification=11cc0aa0-f628-11e7-a16f-058d8298eb29"
