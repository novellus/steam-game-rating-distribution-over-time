It can be challenging at first, but like any game/skill it will take a bit of time to figure out enemies and abilities. The music is fantastic and adds to the atmosphere. A great game if you are looking to be challenged and stimulated but at the same time 'relax' and lose yourself in the moment.","timestamp_created":1609771898,"timestamp_updated":1609771898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwybr45vYCcL+0wAI="}
