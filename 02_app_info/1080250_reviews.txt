Cart which a lonely fool, just “gifted”(sold, essentially) to the king must share with a scared monkey, held in cage. That moment when this to lonely souls connected, touched each - other almost overwhelmed me; it will remain with me for the rest of my days.\n I cared more for this god-forsaken monkey then about the fate of kings and kingdoms; trained him and played with him despite at the expanse of building relationship with «prinxe» that was supposed to be my best friend and romantic interest. Yeah, it was foolish; but if this game taught me anything –it is that “being foolish” sometimes mean \"being right\"","timestamp_created":1606957139,"timestamp_updated":1606957139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519534111022949219","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w4CHk/YCdK/xtgI="}
