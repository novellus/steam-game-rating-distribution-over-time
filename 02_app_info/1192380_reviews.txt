Although I haven't played much a few things I'd suggest:\n\nAdding smooth turning for both sets of locomotion as I tend to play stood forward to keep my bearings and playing outfield was difficult. \n\nAlthough the throwing mechanics are one dimensional ie can't throw different types of pitches.. it does feel good landing a strike... I think that either the strike zone needs to be raised or the player (pitcher) needs to be closer to the ground as the majority of my pitches go over the catchers head when trying to hit the top of the strike zone or maybe the angle of the fastball needs to be tilted down slightly.\n\nIt's in EA so can't expect a HUGE amount of content but I would love to see a form of season mode be put into this as well even it's quite basic, it would certainly add to the replayability\n\nOverall if you're a fan of baseball then you certainly need to check this out and Multiplayer is in the plans going forward which will make it even better","timestamp_created":1608127315,"timestamp_updated":1608127315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4w+/2tfYCcrLaugI="}
