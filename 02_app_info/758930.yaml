    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Build. Fly. Build. Shoot. Build.</h2>In Captain
      Forever you build spaceships <i>while you are flying them</i>. There's no cumbersome
      editor. Just blast an enemy ship apart, grab a piece with your mouse, and bolt
      it to your ship. Done. What's more, everything is physically simulated so ship
      design has a huge impact on flight characteristics and combat capability.<h2
      class="bb_tag">All Three Games.</h2>Captain Forever Trilogy includes the games
      Captain Forever, Captain Successor, and Captain Impostor. Forever is the original,
      award winning game. It's vanilla. Successor adds tons of new modules and ship
      types. It's a whole ice-cream shop. Impostor blows the formula apart by allowing
      you to instantly clone any of the game's enormous, fantastical ships. It's an
      all in ice-cream shop food fight.<h2 class="bb_tag">Better Than Ever.</h2>With
      its brand new renderer, Trilogy is faster, slicker, and shinier than ever. What's
      more, the new wing shaped modules massively increase the scope for cool looking
      ships and thoughtful design. New audio has been added, and best of all, acclaimed
      novelist Cassandra Khaw has pored over every line of text in the game, rewriting
      most and adding many more. The Captain Forever universe is now exactly that
      - a universe. And it's all here in Captain Forever Trilogy.

        pretty sure the min spec should be much lower than this, but I don't have

        and the game runs okay for you, could you let me know? Thanks &lt;3</li></ul>

    review: I remember playing Captain Forever as a Flash game as a kid. So happy
      to see it's on steam and I didn't even know the 2 sequels games existed, what
      an awesome surprise! Straight forward concept of defeating difficult enemies
      and taking their ship components. Challenging and rewarding.
