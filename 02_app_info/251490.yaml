    review: "This is a weird one. On one hand, the game presented a unique mechanic\
      \ that I haven't seen in any other game, but on the other hand the overall experience\
      \ was kind of mediocre. This feels like a game that was more impressive when\
      \ it came out on the less saturated indie scene, but now doesn't reach the standards\
      \ that the market is at now. \n\nGravity Ghost is a 2D puzzle platformer all\
      \ about using the gravity of planets to traverse and collect objects scattered\
      \ across the level. The actual gravity mechanics feel solid (picture 2D Super\
      \ Mario Galaxy for comparison), although when you have multiple planets gravity\
      \ pulling against you, movement can be frustrating. The ability to terraform\
      \ planets to create different gravity effects was a good puzzle element introduced\
      \ that kept each level fresh and interesting. Another thing I quite liked was\
      \ how all the permanent upgrades you got in the game were completely optional\
      \ yet powerful additions to your toolset. However, the game is very easy, and\
      \ eventually with all upgrades you can ignore any challenge a level presents\
      \ and breeze through it in seconds. This leads to an overall very short playthrough,\
      \ which while not always a bad thing, feels weird in the context of the game.\
      \ The first couple areas took me 15-25 minutes a piece, while the later ones\
      \ were done in less than 5 minutes. \n\nThe art and music is incredible in the\
      \ game, and is probably the two standout features of the game beside it's gameplay.\
      \ There is this neat, hand-drawn artistic style used for the backgrounds that\
      \ gives the levels this dreamlike wonder, and Ben Prunty knocks it out of the\
      \ park with the game's soundtrack. While the characters in the game have their\
      \ own style as well that I have no problems with, the animations are not good,\
      \ especially with the movement of the arms and legs. The voice acting is a mixed\
      \ bag as well, with some voice actors sounding decent, while others sound like\
      \ they were recorded on different equipment and are extremely muffled. The actual\
      \ voice acting is decent, although a couple of the side characters sound really\
      \ strange to the point that they are irritating to listen to. Not a great experience\
      \ in general.\n\nFinally I had problems with the tone of the game, which tries\
      \ to pair this incredible spiritual aesthetic with childish humor which don't\
      \ mesh at all. I honestly think I would have had a better experience if the\
      \ game was completely dialogue-less. The actual story of the game is presented\
      \ in a fragmented sort of way that was more confusing than interesting. I will\
      \ give the game that it had a satisfying conclusion, but the overall \"message\"\
      \ of the game has been done in many other better indie games. There was also\
      \ just a lot of story beats and details that were not needed to tell this kind\
      \ of story yet I guess they were included for the sake of charm? Like I said,\
      \ this is a weird one.\n\nUltimately I am going to recommend this game, as it\
      \ is not completely terrible and the actual gameplay was really solid. But I\
      \ would strongly advise getting it at some discounted price, as there is not\
      \ enough content available at it's base price. At least buy the soundtrack,\
      \ cause it is real good."
