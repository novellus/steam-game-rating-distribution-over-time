I can imagine I would have enjoyed it more when I was a kid. It was a nice, quick distraction on a boring night. Get it super discounted if you're really interested in playing it.","timestamp_created":1608361689,"timestamp_updated":1608361689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+vf0vPYCe6CvuwI="}
