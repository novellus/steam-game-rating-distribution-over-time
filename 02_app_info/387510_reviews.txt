I can count on one hand the number of characters, including minor/side characters, who have any redeeming qualities whatsoever. If I took a shot every time I wanted to punch a character in the face, I would have died of alcohol poisoning before the film was over.\n\nLet me see if I can do a proper review of this movie. See You Next Tuesday is an indie dramedy (drama/comedy) film which tells the story of Mona, a single twenty-something mother-to-be.  Mona is different, and by different I mean that I suspect the goal was to portray a person on the autistic spectrum, or maybe with some unspecific psychiatric disorder. Mona is estranged from her mother and sister, is tormented by (most) of her co-workers, and lives in a hovel of an... apartment? Bed-sitting room? At one point Mona says she does not have a kitchen, and she appears to share a bathroom, but now I'm losing the point.\n\nMona is just sort of adrift in life. Aside from living in squalor, near social isolation, and having a job that she hates, Mona does not seem to have any idea of what she is going to do once her child is imminently born, nor is it clear that she knows how to care for a child. Despite having a job, Mona does not appear to be financially stable, [spoiler]as evidenced by her eviction partway through the movie.[/spoiler]\n\nThe film focuses on Mona, her relationship with her mother and sister (and to a lesser extent, their own struggles), and the various people who are antagonistic to Mona as she makes a series of very unfortunate decisions. Characterizing the plot of See You Next Tuesday is difficult, because there isn't a plot in the traditional sense. What we are shown are a series of loosely connected experiences, almost like a collection of short stories with an overarching theme.\n\nThe acting is believable, in a way that is sometimes uncomfortable to watch. Music is used sparsely, nothing in particular stands out to me. Cinematography is done competently. There is a lot of swearing, bigotry, ugly crying, and raw, nasty emotion. There are occasional dabs of violence, but nothing graphic. There are also a couple of brief shots of women's nether regions, for reasons that are not entirely clear.\n\nThe subject matter did not particularly appeal to me, and at times it feels like the movie is just floundering, not unlike Mona herself. There are a number of scenes in this movie I found to be distasteful bordering on offensive. The movie ends on a somewhat positive note, at least. It would be difficult for me to recommend this movie to most people. Probably best enjoyed if you are interested in experimental or off-beat films. It wasn't my cup of tea, personally.","timestamp_created":1462924366,"timestamp_updated":1462924366,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629189610481262207","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi8rFztQCd7qvVw=="}
