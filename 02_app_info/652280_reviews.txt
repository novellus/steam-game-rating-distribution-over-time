It is possibly the most misleading program I have purchased on VR so far\n\nI was lead to believe I would be able to explore Ancient Rome.  What I got was a cinematic of prerended 360 scenes with no interaction, no movement and little in the way of 3D graphics.  There are no controls for interaction or movement only next, back and select.\n\nBeing stuck in predefined places while a guy talks to you about the history and you just sit and listen is not exploring Rome.\n\nI know this is educational and I wasnt expecting much, but its Virtual Reality and the images are of 3D scenes and the videos are of realtime 3D environments with moving cameras.  This strongly gives the impression of having some degree of freedom and the ability to look from more than one angle\n\n","timestamp_created":1509703065,"timestamp_updated":1509703065,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629085779190063477","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42pPUwN8CcqOeigE="}
