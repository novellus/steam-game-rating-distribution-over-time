Along with its hefty 4,000 horses derived from Electro-Motive’s 16-cylinder 710G3B power plant, the SD70 was notable for its use of EMD’s HTCR radial truck. By the time the SD70 series of locomotives was introduced, the “North American” cab design had become the standard for new locomotives (making the SD70M, in effect, the “standard” model). Seemingly, EMD’s angular Spartan Cab design, which dated back to the GP35 of 1963, had reached the end of the line. But such was not the case, as four railroads ordering the SD70 type choose to specify the Spartan Cab design and these units would thus carry the straight “SD70” designation. At final count, 122 Spartan Cab-equipped SD70s were constructed between 1993 and 1999.<br><br>Among the railroads buying the SD70 was the famed U. S. railroad Illinois Central, which purchased 40 units (IC road numbers 1000-1039) during the period 1995-1999. Originally dressed in IC’s black and white livery, the SD70s became mainstays on the IC’s Chicago-New Orleans main line.<br><br>The year 1999 also marked Illinois Central’s integration into North American giant Canadian National, and soon the IC SD70s began appearing in CN’s flashy livery with IC sub-lettering. Today, the majority of the SD70s purchased by Illinois Central continue to serve the CN and can be found operating throughout both the United States and Canada.<br><br>The Canadian National SD70, created by Dovetail Games third-party programme partner Travel by Train, is outfitted in CN’s black, red, and white livery and is provided in standard and winter textures. The SD70 is an ideal addition to the Train Simulator stable and is appropriate for use on a number of North American Train simulator routes given that CN locomotives often serve in run-through service on other railroads.
