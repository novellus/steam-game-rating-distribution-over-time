Star Baron looked like prety promising release.\nThe idea of riding a sci-fi beast mounted with lasers was a great attractor for me. And i could say it was nicely embodied.\n\nThe main good thing is - i was really able to experience the feeling of ride without heaving a seasick after couple of minutes of playing. \n\nThe second good thing is the way main character sometimes talks with the beast. It reminds me of a badass speeches of Duke Nukem or Ben Throttle, but with some meaningfull roar in responce.\n\nLevel design is reminding me of some megalomaniac landscapes from Star Wars. I guess that was something from \"Force awakens\".\n\nAI of human engineers is hilariously dumb. Sometimes i'm asking myself \"So, that's the way the guys with university degree attempt to fight tank-like creature on the open spaces, huh?\". They should've been called stormtroopers, lol.\n\n\nTo be honest, i still have one thing to wish of the game, mostly about the making controls provide more rein-like experience. \nI can do \"Strafe Leap\" with Touch Device gesture - it feels great. So why not try to perform \"Turn\" with similarly gesture (instead of moving thumbstick), just like you do it with the rein to control horse in real life? I belive, that could be an awesome update.\n\n\nThanks and good luck to you all!","timestamp_created":1531823203,"timestamp_updated":1531823203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629897892475128174","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4q+Tx0+QCeqqgpgE="}
