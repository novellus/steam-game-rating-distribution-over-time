    review: "\"Free Edicts? More like Free Support!\" \nSo, if you want to ensure\
      \ your position in power forever, get this DLC. Sure, you handicap yourself\
      \ with the problems of getting and spending Swiss money. But you can remove\
      \ half of the cost-benefit problem of the edict system. And you can also, for\
      \ example do free building after that with the conservatives and build as many\
      \ Wind Turbines and Solar Power Plants as you want. And finally, you can kick\
      \ out the members with next to no downside and keep ALL the benefit. Not to\
      \ mention there's a trait for no corruption on spending, and the capitalists\
      \ unique benefit is half corruption gain. People who say corruption is too punishing\
      \ don't know how broken the benefits are. ...Or they are playing the mission,\
      \ which is a real miss seeing as you have to on several occasions send your\
      \ corruption up to max. It's really the only bad thing about this DLC. \nIf\
      \ you don't have 100% support in at least three factions with this DLC, you're\
      \ doing it wrong. It's like Tropico 3 and 4's faction system. Very easy to max\
      \ their support out on most, if not all."
