    about_the_game: "In the world of Might and Magic no hero is more powerful than\
      \ their army, no weapon is mightier than a keen strategic mind, and no enemy\
      \ is too difficult to overcome for heroes who join forces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nMight &amp; Magic\xAE Heroes Online (MMHO) is a free-to-play MMO strategy\
      \ RPG game in which you control powerful Heroes and their armies as they do\
      \ battle throughout the fantasy world of Ashan.<br />\r\nJoin a faction, chose\
      \ your hero and select your favorite path: become an impregnable bulwark or\
      \ a powerful mage with access to very old and destructive spells. But it is\
      \ a long way to go and you have to deserve your hero reputation first before\
      \ facing the wreckful evil in the final battle. During your journey through\
      \ that handcrafted universe, you will solve a huge amount of exciting quests;\
      \ you will fight dozens of fantastic creatures, you will raise and upgrade your\
      \ personal army and you will command and run your own towns. Enjoy the deep\
      \ and fascinating turn-based battle system, alone or with the brand-new cooperative\
      \ mode \u2013 any battle in MMHO is playable with a friend! But there is much\
      \ more to explore: find and complete powerful artefacts, enter with a group\
      \ of people special raid provinces or compare your power and skill in duels\
      \ with other players. One of the biggest, deepest and most colorful games ever\
      \ made in the Might &amp; Magic universe."
