Set contains a bathing suit for Renka which she does not have one available in the base game. Each part is color customizeable [i]except[/i] the sakura buns on Renka's hairstyle as they always stay the same rosey pink when changing hair color. The negative part of this pack is that the costumes themselves are a bit monotone and lack some color variety, although this is a matter of taste and other accessories can help boost appeal.\n\nAsuka's Sakura Scarf has one of the color options to be the crimson red she normally wears which is not obtainable in the game as of now. One of the better surprises when I grabbed this pack.\n\nI recommend this pack if you are looking for a bit of extra swimsuit costumes and accessories as it struck a decent sweetspot for price and quantity.","timestamp_created":1520877080,"timestamp_updated":1520877080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511111080646514893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3NHVjeICcpbDmwE="}
