The Allosaurus has a lot of parts that have no name listed.  I'd really like to find out what the funny-looking scapula arrangement is really called (and have my kids learn that).  Same with the odd sacrum and hip configuration.  Even big bones like the humerus, femur, tibia, and fibia are not named.\n\nAlso, with both the Allosaurus & dog (Haven't done the other 3 yet), there's not the same level of dismantle-ability as the human skeleton.  On the human skeleton, you get to take apart the pelvis, pull out the teeth (as a unit), etc. With these models, the teeth are fixed in the skull, and the pelvis is a single unit.\nOn the up-side:  No more removing each individual rib one at a time!","timestamp_created":1609372714,"timestamp_updated":1609372714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwdiF2/YCdML4vgI="}
