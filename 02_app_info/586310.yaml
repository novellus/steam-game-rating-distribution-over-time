    detailed_description: "<h1>Buzz</h1><p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gunman Taco Truck\
      \ has been getting rave reviews!</h2><br>&quot;Without question, one of, if\
      \ not the best roguelike game I've ever played.&quot;...&quot;Crazy good roguelike,\
      \ very challenging and extremely fun. Cannot reccomend more highly!&quot; \u2013\
      \_Steam Review<br><br>&quot;Rather than a silly kids\u2019 game, Gunman Taco\
      \ Truck is a competent action roguelike with some strategy and planning elements\
      \ thrown in for good measure. Instead of a simple distraction, there is a robust\
      \ game here that is going to provide quite a challenge, and you\u2019ll see\
      \ a significant amount of gameplay before you reach the end. There are also\
      \ decals to collect along the way, and there are various routes that you can\
      \ take across the country, so expect to spend quite a bit of time with the game\
      \ if you want to see everything. It can be a bit tedious to have to replay the\
      \ early parts of the game over and over as you start from scratch each time,\
      \ but as you progress it feels good to get a bit further. All in all, Gunman\
      \ Taco Truck is quite fun, and it surprised me with just how much game hides\
      \ just behind the vibrant, silly surface.&quot; \u2013 TechRaptor<h2 class=\"\

      \ Taco Truck was designed by Donovan Brathwaite-Romero when he was 9 years old.\
      \ The game idea was so good that his parents, John and Brenda Romero, decided\
      \ to make its development a family project. Over 2 years and lots of fun have\
      \ gone into making Gunman Taco Truck an unforgettable experience, and the realization\
      \ of Donovan's dream of making a video game. Donovan has been learning how to\
      \ code for the past 3 years.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Gunman Taco Truck\
