The sliding mechanics on multiple faces of the cube is unique, and rotating the cube in Vive's virtual environment feels amazing with the overall design of this game. \n\nI just love the puzzle, and it gets challenging over the period. I wish there were a little more variation with the sliding tiles mechanics, but for the price, I think its a good game. And if you love playing puzzle games on any platform, you will just love Solaright!\n","timestamp_created":1492395394,"timestamp_updated":1492395394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531259357929229736","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvdDsvNsCcfv9dg=="}
