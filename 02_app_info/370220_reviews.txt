I finished one dungeon and it was repetitive and boring. Not to mention that the soundtrack gets grating after a while, really really grating, I thought I was going insane as I died over and over again to the platforming.\n\nBut I do have to say that the art is actually really really pretty. Though I don't like the PC's walk animation the visuals are decent enough","timestamp_created":1515948415,"timestamp_updated":1515948415,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49497753381729126","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gaPk+uACdryKlgE="}
