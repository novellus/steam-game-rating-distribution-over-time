Has an interesting concept and is executed fairly well for being made in 2005. I felt like the information of text was a little overloaded, but quickly found myself learning the ropes. My only complaints are:\n\n-Graphics are fine, the lack of resolution support leads to a lot of graininess and makes the text hard to read.\n-The UI is not self explanatory, and lead to my death. Would of been nice if the game explained you needed to put a checkmark next to new recruits to have them participate in battles. \n-Misclicks are easy to make and fatal like many others have stated controls aren't very polished\n\nAll that aside, you should know that is what you are getting yourself into purchasing this. I do think the un-discounted asking price is steep, but I found this game fun and inspiring and hope to put some more hours into it in the future.","timestamp_created":1573162794,"timestamp_updated":1573162794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwefzo+4CcrWv2AE="}
