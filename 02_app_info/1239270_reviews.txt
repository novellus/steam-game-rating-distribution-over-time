I'd say it would be worth $9 to someone like me. HOWEVER; if you are a passionate VR player, you may see that this game has a lot of potential, as I also see. If you would like to support the developer in making this game and watching the game as it progresses, then go ahead and buy the game and join their discord. \n\nThe one thing that I will make sure I say, though, is that the developer does seem like a genuine guy and passionate about this game. I look forward to seeing the progress of this game in the future, but right now it isn't worth buying to an average consumer.\n\n*edit* - I decided to list the things that I thought ill of this game to help people see why I was harsh, please keep in mind im not really trying to be spiteful, just honest, and again if you as a consumer want to support the developer, go ahead!\n\nIn order of time experienced, they go as follows: the vast majority of objects in the game are apart of the map asset and are as such uninteractable. the grab/hold mechanism in the game feels very floaty and unimmersive. the physics of the player is not realistic with fixed falling speeds, no sprinting, your hands can go through walls (speaking of hands the player's hands are not well-attached to the wrists and in the case of the player opting to not have arms, it instead defaults to the SteamVR toolkit in Unity's default gloved hands, which isn't very neat. my right hand disappeared while in the tutorial. the tutorial itself accidentally was skipped somehow and I couldn't restart it. I had to blindly figure out that you had to use grip while casting to hold and then throw your spell. the sound of you successfully creating a rune and holding it is loud and obnoxious. when i loaded into the first level my second (left) hand dissapeared along with my right. in various locations on the map you can get caught on rubble and pop your head through the wall/ceiling, revealing the entire map from within the wall (very G-Mod no-clip esque). the first giant boss' death animation made him fall halfway through the wall. the second giant boss (spider lady/queen) was very goofily animated and I didn't even know I killed her while I was running away lobbing spells behind me. (her death animation also put her halfway into a wall). upon approaching the spider queen's lair my computer started chugging as my reprojection rate went as high as 45%. I kept walking for 30+ seconds through corridors only to find they were dead ends and I had to walk all the way back (doesn't sound like a lot but annoying to do that for a minute straight). at this point I tried drinking my potion by dropping it on my head (as at first it didn't seem like i could just tip it back and sip it. this crashed my game somehow. I loaded it back up and saw my arms again for the first time since prior to when my tutorial glitched out. i accidentally clicked on the 2nd (or 3rd maybe?) level and didn't have a chance to fix it before i loaded into it. Had to walk a few minutes in a admittedly pretty canyon to find a giant sandworm that started attacking me. I wanted to die to go back to the main lobby but it didn't seem like it was damaging me at all. eventually it burrowed into the ground over me and clipped my player's hitbox through the floor of the canyon and I fell through the map forever. That was a compilation of all my complaints in my 22 minutes of playtime :).","timestamp_created":1591154486,"timestamp_updated":1591155445,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.626172780990600586","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ40KmQvPICeMjviwI="}
