    review: 'The game basically is very similar to MCF: Huntsville. It has the same
      style and reuses the same sound effects and music. It''s longer than Huntsville,
      but amount of scenes to search the items for is about the same - you just have
      to go through the same locations again and again. There are 20 prime suspects
      to investigate and about 25 different locations. With each suspect you have
      to search 6-7 locations, which means some of them repeat a lot.  Also, the same
      as in Huntsville, there is a time limit and if you run out of time you have
      to go through the same locations again. Basically in later stages of the game
      it becomes more of a memory game - you don''t search for items, you just remember
      there they are.

      The graphics feels dated and the game works on 800x600 screen resolution, which
      makes some smaller items really hard to spot.

      Also the game doesn''t work fullscreen on Windows 10. You have to manually set
      desktop resolution to 800x600 before running the game. You can run it In a windowed
      mode, but I found it practically unplayable this way - items are just too small
      to spot.'
