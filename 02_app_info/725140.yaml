    review: "Nogard es un juego entretenido, sencillo, pero al mismo tiempo no se\
      \ hace pesado, tampoco excesivamente f\xE1cil y, presenta algunos retos al jugador.\
      \ La est\xE9tica \u2018low poly\u2019 hace que tenga un atractivo propio manteniendo\
      \ una parte visual llamativa. Aunque la duraci\xF3n puede ser breve, el aspecto\
      \ rejugable, en especial si eres alguien a quien le gusta completar todo, est\xE1\
      \ previsto para que al menos tengas que pensar, buscar e intentar llegar a sitios\
      \ aparentemente imposibles. Puede que no sea perfecto, pero es un juego con\
      \ el que te lo pasar\xE1s bien, y \xBFa qui\xE9n no le gusta pas\xE1rselo bien?\n\
      Si hay que ponerle una nota, es un s\xF3lido 8/10"
