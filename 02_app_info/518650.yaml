      /><br>Illumine is a roguelike. However, illumine's world is not a static procedurally
      generated place. In illumine the player interacts with the environment, triggering
      its dynamical transformation. Each situation then becomes a self-contained puzzle,
      which the player can approach from any angle and deal with however he wants,
      whether by stealth or by manipulating the AI. <br><br>Not all inhabitants of
      this world are friendly. In order to progress, the player will not only have
      to keep his eyes open but he will also have to listen closely to his surroundings.
      As the soundtrack is generated in real-time by the various AI and gameplay elements
      in the player's vicinity, any change in the music will inform him of the dangers
      that might be lurking in the dark. <br><br>The main character will eventually
      overcome these hurdles, if not in this life, then in a future reincarnation.
      As past lives will affect his future, how the main character interacts with
      others will shape his experience. It will ultimately be up to the player to
      find his purpose, be it his own personal development or others' well-being.
