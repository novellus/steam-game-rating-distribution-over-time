    review: "Abusive dads, pre-transition cringiness, omelettes and chill tunes: The\
      \ most accurate trans girl simulator available on Steam. TOO ACCURATE FOR MY\
      \ OWN TASTE.\n\nEdit: I initially left a positive review, but after a few hours\
      \ in (I was at the 4th day), I'm changing it to a negative one. There's only\
      \ one probleme, but boy, it's a big one: technical issues, including a bug blocking\
      \ my progression (I checked with other people who played this game and even\
      \ watched walkthroughts, and I'm doing everything correctly, the issue isn't\
      \ with me).\n\nI tried playing this game on another computer (and since cloud\
      \ saves don't work, it was quite the hassle to retrieve my save), same problem.\
      \ \n\nIt seems I'm not the only one encountering bugs (for example, a lot of\
      \ people seem to not unlock achievements), so... Nope, don't buy this game.\
      \ I really wish it worked, but as much as I like the writing and the general\
      \ design, I can't recommand a game that refuse to let me play it."
