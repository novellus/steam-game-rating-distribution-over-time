It is a shame as I believe this game had real potential had the improvements been implemented and more content added.\n\nI'm really enjoying this game so far, even though it is obviously still in the early stages of development. After several restarts I think I have finally mastered the basics and have figured out how to make my ranch reasonably profitable. I'm slowly but surely getting better equipment and working my way up to more exotic and profitable breeds. There are a few downsides, the controls seem a bit clunky as it can be hard to click exactly where you want to. It could also do with a more in depth tutorial but I'm sure this will all come in time as the dev seems very responsive to ideas on the forum. All in all a good game which I am having a lot of fun playing.","timestamp_created":1533046718,"timestamp_updated":1599590815,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504504501819610596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ40drCt/QCcdSlpwE="}
