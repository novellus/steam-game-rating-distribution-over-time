    about_the_game: <strong>SAVE HUMANITY, FIND YOURSELF.</strong> The year is 2156
      and Earth has been decimated. All that remains of the once great planet is desert
      and human life is dwindling due to water and food scarcity. You play as Landon,
      one of the last surviving humans, who stumbles upon a wormhole. The wormhole
      you accidentally find transports you light years across the universe to a strange
      and beautiful planet where you meet a new alien friend named Zip. With Zip as
      your guide, you will hunt for a new planet for you and your wife Jessie to inhabit
      and carry on human existence. <br><br>Created by a single developer over two
      years, this story rich and atmospheric game poses many questions about what
      makes life worth living and how we as humans can save our planet before climate
      change destroys it. Will you be the one to save humanity before it obliterates
      itself?<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1165910/extras/gif_1.gif?t=1586354392"

    review: I wonder where the good reviews come from. Graphics look like they're
      from 1999 (and the game takes up 20 Gb on the hard drive). Sounds and models
      were probably taken from some free Unity asset packs. Dialogs are just terrible.
      "There are 1200 people. They are dying from lack of food or from killing each
      other. I think the global warming will kill us all." Yeah, why bother.
