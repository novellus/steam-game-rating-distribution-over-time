    review: It seems some aspects of the module weren't fully converted to fantasy
      grounds (Manuever's aren't listed for the players, dragon companion NPC is exclusively
      the hatchling, aerial combat rules are... nonexistent), but rather left in the
      reference material. While I have no issue implementing it myself, I don't think
      it is something I /should/ have to do if I am paying for the module. Otherwise,
      The reference material is great, and hope that the fantasy grounds conversion
      gets the love it deserves.
