      \ is JU.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">how to Play?</h2>Use KEY WSAD(or \u2191\u2193\u2190\
      \u2192) to control the green cube move to the red area. Don't worry too much\
      \ about operation, it's really easy. But you should be really careful about\
      \ the path you choose, because there are some path traps in the game, such as\
      \ an endless loop.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>80\
      \ Levels<br></li><li>4 play rules:<br></li><li><i>1.Basis rule (Level 1 - 20):\
      \ Move green cube to the end area(the red block). When you use key to move the\
      \ green cube, it just keep moving until touch a block-wall. </i><br></li><li><i>2.Following\
      \ rule (Level 21 - 40): Beside the basis rule, the end area will move when you\
      \ try to move the green cube. So you should think about the strategy: move the\
      \ green cube or end area as a chief way. </i><br></li><li><i>3.Twins rule (Level\
      \ 41 - 60): Beside the basis rule, there will be two green cubes in the game,\
      \ and two end areas. And be careful: When the green cubes touch each other,\
      \ they will become one entirety.</i><br></li><li><i>4.Zu rule (Level 61 - 80):\
      \  Beside the basis rule, you will find a few green area which will move one\
      \ block. What you need to think is that move to the end area before anyone of\
      \ the green areas moves to the left-end-area. And be careful: You need move\
      \ to the every blue block one time, or the end area will be blocked. This rule\
      \ could be a little hard, remember it: Think before Move.</i></li></ul><h2 class=\"\
