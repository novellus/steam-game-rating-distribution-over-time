The designers obviously wanted this to look and feel like an original NES game, and with respect to sound and fx it is a perfect fit.\n\nControls: 7/10 - It feels like an average NES game.\n\nGameplay: 6/10 - The main mechanic is that your \"health\" bar (or hunger bar) continually drains unless you pick up food.  So you cannot just wander around forever.  The problem is, it drains just a bit too fast and this seriously hurts the enjoyment as you usually feel like you are having to speedrun the level, not just keep a regular pace. That really killed the fun for me.  There are no difficulty settings which even some of the most basic NES games had.\n\nOverall, this is a difficult game to review.  Understand that this is considered a \"retro\" game, but really there a two different types of \"retro\" games.  There are retro games that are 2d and use pixel art but use modern approaches to gameplay, controls, etc.  And then there are RETRO games where they are designed to be just like a game you could buy and play on your NES. This game is definitely the latter and realize that comes with that design choice is a lot of the limitations that NES games have, namely the controls. I docked some points because even some NES games have better controls than this. What ultimately keeps me from recommending this is the gameplay.  The lack of difficulty setting and the health bar that drains far too quickly just make this an annoying mess and is surprising given the obvious effort that went into his aesthetic elements.  Ironically, this makes it more similar to an real NES game that most retro games like it. So, despite my negative review, just know that if you are a gamer who has played the entire NES catalog and wished there had been more actual NES games, this game is for you.","timestamp_created":1608925600,"timestamp_updated":1608925600,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkIvczfYCf5aTvQI="}
