    review: I definitely can't recommend this game. I got it from a Classic Wargames
      bundle in winter sales for like 3 euros. Full price which is 20 euros is really
      bad joke for it. Game have a zero support from developers and even after 5-6
      years when it was released on Steam its unplayeble. Game crashing constantly
      for me. I tried to fix it but not succeed. On fullscreen mode my mouse pointer
      flickering in game and the game going slowly. I was able to got in turn 13 when
      my game crash and even after I load my save and do several more attempts the
      game still crashing. For some reason when I tried to play it in window mode
      game was going smoother and there was no mouse pointer flickering during game
      but crashing preserve. I tried to browse around internet and checking discussions
      on Steam for some kind of fix or help but to no avail.
