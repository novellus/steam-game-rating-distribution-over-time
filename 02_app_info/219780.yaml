    reviews: "\u201CDivinity II is a wonderful, welcome surprise. It's been a long\
      \ time since I've played an RPG that manages to balance a lengthy, in-depth\
      \ story with such a self-aware and hilarious script\u201D<br>\u2013 <a href=\"\
      https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.incgamers.com/2010/11/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga-review\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >IncGamers</a><br><br>\u201CThe writing\
      \ is consistently terrific, from the genuinely creative quests with multiple\
      \ solutions to the NPCs which are all hand-crafted and infused with personality.\
      \ Where other games would have copy + pasted Unclickable Villager A and B a\
      \ few dozen times, Divinity 2 gives you an actual village, complete with gossipers,\
      \ philanderers, military deserters, the occasional secret murderer, and even\
      \ a few normal people\u201D<br>9/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.somethingawful.com/d/video-game-article/dragon-knight-saga.php\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >SomethingAwful</a><br><br>\u201CIt's\
      \ amazing such a good game remained undiscovered until this &quot;remastered&quot;\
      \ version was released. (...) The quests are surprisingly good, with charming\
      \ voicework and a great sense of humour - and then there's the exploration,\
      \ with hidden caverns and keys rewarding diligent players\u201D<br> \u2013 <a\
