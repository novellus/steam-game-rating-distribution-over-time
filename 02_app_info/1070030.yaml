      The Good:

      -Gameplay is simple, but not too simple as to become boring.

      -Story is decent, but it''s the side stories that really shine.

      -Descriptions, dialogue, flavor text, etc. can be humorous.

      -Music and art is beautiful, and ship designs are eye-pleasing.


      The Bad:

      -Music sometimes overlaps multiple tracks, which can be annoying.

      -Certain bosses can become bugged and unable to attack, sometimes unable to
      be damaged as well.

      -Despite the pretty aesthetics, some nebulae can cause an extreme performance
      drop, causing the game to stutter to a near-halt.

      -Bounty Hunts, and many bosses, are either the same ship, same ship with a different
      name, or a similar ship.

      -Some enemies, mainly the Connect-a-Mines, can and will spawn on top of/follow
      you after death.


      The Ugly:

      -I''m unsure that this is a bug, or if it''s intentional, but after you finish
      one of the game-ending quests I kept on receiving a black screen with no options
      to quit, restart, continue, etc. no matter how long I waited.'
