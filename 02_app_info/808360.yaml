    review: Haven't played more than a few levels, but it's an alright game. I think
      it still needs more guidance in regards to how far along you are, since there
      is no plot and no achievements, although there is an overview of the available/completed
      levels. In my personal opinion everything in the game feels a bit too inconsequential
      when there's no clear sign of progress. Other than that, the graphics are alright
      and the music suits the game. All in all, the simplest of simple puzzle games,
      which could be enjoyable if that's what you're into.
