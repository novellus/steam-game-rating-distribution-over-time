Some reviewers here have compared this game to Space Pirate Trainer. That has to be a joke. It's such a bad joke that it may become a meme in the not too distant future.\n\nIt's a stand still wave shooter with 2 weapons. A pair of handguns that feels like a water gun with bullets slowly getting from point A to point B that even a nerf gun feels more powerful. You could also choose to throw these Qi balls at the enemies with physics that'll make you question your sanity for choosing this option.\n\nThere's only a few enemies. I finished the game on easy (after the boss there's infnite levels though) in about 12 minutes. I haven't beaten the game on medium difficulty, that's only because the game throws many enemies at you at level 8, thereby making the game difficult to beat (to hide how short it actually is).\n\nMaybe you'll find the memes funnier than I did. But the gameplay is awful and there's no hiding that. Look past the jokes, look past the music & sounds. The gameplay is just terrible. The shooting mechanic is bad. The graphics are bad. I honestly think this game is full of fake reviews as you can see the time played for all these people talking about how great this game is.\n\n[b]Rate 3.5/10. It's so bad, it may become fodder for when people want to make fun of the 2010s and how people used to spend time with memes back then. Remember then? Yeah, people were so stupid & corny back then.[/b]","timestamp_created":1552872451,"timestamp_updated":1552872636,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw5v+ax+kCcMqmvQE="}
