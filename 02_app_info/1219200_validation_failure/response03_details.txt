The player controls the protagonist and explores multiple levels of a mysterious dungeon with secrets to uncover.

The player can also access a time-traveling merchant to increase the power of their gear and buy new equipment. <br>\tIn every dungeon, there will be an assortment of enemies, most notably: zombies. The game plays like a third-person roguelike game. The player will begin in a room that is neutral and has not many (or none at all) items. Since the layout will be randomly generated there could be a door to his left, right, front, and behind. After the player goes through a door he will be confronted with a random set of enemies and obstacles. Once the room is cleared the door that is either left, right, front, center (reference random generation) opens so that they can do it again in a new room with different enemies. In every layout, there is a random room with the merchant in it to purchase no gear\/equipment so that the stronger enemies don't stand a chance.<br>Nostalgic, “PS1 Like Graphics” and intentionally clunky controls to give the game a hard and atmospheric yet enjoyable experience. The project is projected to make it in early access after a month which is also supposed to give it its novelty.
