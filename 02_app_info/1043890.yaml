    review: "Great game. \n\nI nearly gave up in Chapter 2 as i couldn't find how\
      \ to progress, but i came back to it later and had a eureka moment. I'm very\
      \ glad i persevered cos it turned out to be a great original story with lots\
      \ of clever intuitive fun puzzles and interesting environments. For me personally\
      \ it also had a healing aspect to it. \n\nIf you only want AAA games then this\
      \ isn't for you, it's an indie game, and as such it doesn't have big studio\
      \ production levels, but it's obviously been made as a labour of love and is\
      \ a rewarding experience in my view.\n\nVery highly recommended."
