GTA 2 like gameplay in the dark future\n2. Space exploration\n3. free roam narrative (although lacking)\n\nCons: \n1. barely any story\n2. price....9.99? for this? cmon. (that seems to be a bad trend among indie developers, but I'm sure Valve recommended the price.. surely)\n3. not enough tutorial, not enough guidance, and there really needs to be a better sector map in these kinds of games. \n\n\n10/10 because we dont have enough games like it, wish SPAZ 1 would have more games.\n\nEDIT: games is still good. but man does it still need love. The concept is solid as fuck. We really need more games like this. I swear Im addicted to SPAZ 1 type games..... \nif you like this game check out games like CRYPTARK, Space Pirates and Zombies.","timestamp_created":1469379529,"timestamp_updated":1526128723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549727439880371094","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w4iXquMCdJq8XQ=="}
