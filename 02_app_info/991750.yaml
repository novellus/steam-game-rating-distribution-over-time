    about_the_game: <strong>Be agile and grow big to overcome this game.</strong><br><br>Beat
      40 levels by being fast, eat yellow dots and grow bigger. If enemies are smaller
      than you, they turn green and you are able to eat them. Remove all enemies from
      the battle arena to win the level. The game gets gradually more hectic and thus
      harder.

    review: '[h1]Dodge''em-up where you grow when catching power ups.[/h1]


      [b]Note that there''s a [url=https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/716921]free
      version[/url] available on browser.[/b]


      Another nice and short [i]Nannings[/i] game. [i]Super Grower[/i] is best played
      with mouse (but can be played with gamepad).


      In each level your task is to eliminate enemies by grabbing power-ups that grow
      you (a square block) making it harder to dodge the enemies but making them vulnerable
      to you.


      Most levels are rather easy. I was stuck in one or two for a few minutes. Having
      completed the game, you can tackle the Endless mode to compete for high scores
      on Steam leaderboards. Endless mode essentially replays some of the more difficult
      levels until you fail.


      There was about 20 minutes of gameplay in the 40 levels.


      [h1]The Steam and free versions only little differences[/h1]


      The free version felt a little easier for me, since playing in a window allows
      cheating by teleporting the square from an edge to another when playing with
      a mouse. Otherwise, there was no notable difference in performance between the
      versions.


      The Steam version adds technically unlimited amount of gameplay in the Endless
      mode and its Steam leaderboards. For me the latter''s novelty lasted just for
      5 minutes more.


      If you want the Steam version anyway, get it on sale - I think the content is
      not quite enough for the full price.
