The developer has since updated the game so that the controls are clearer, and the bug that caused endless deaths has also been resolved.\n\nThose issues having been resolved, I still would not advise this game as something you pay for.\n\nHowever, as a free experience, it does a good job of conveying melancholy and is worth the few minutes of your life it would take to play through.  I wish the fish and whales at the beginning were a little less finicky, and a little less \"gamey\", but it is worth your time.","timestamp_created":1486846025,"timestamp_updated":1494987764,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkt6NitwCfdLycQ=="}
