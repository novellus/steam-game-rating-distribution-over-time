There are way too many stats to keep track of, such that I don't think the creator properly factored in the crossover of having certain combinations. You will almost always hit walls of choices where none of your stats are suited for any options, and it doesn't feel intentional or good to play. The game doesn't clearly communicate which stats mean what and the crossover between stats makes it all the more confusing. I didn't even get a chance to decide if I was honorable or cunning in the tutorial so I went through the game without the ability to choose either option. And in choices where 2/3 were the honor and cunning choice I'm obviously restricted.","timestamp_created":1583662624,"timestamp_updated":1583662624,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0L3p3PACcdHn9gE="}
