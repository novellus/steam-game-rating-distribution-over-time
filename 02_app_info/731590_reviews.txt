It kind of looked like what would happen if Killer 7 met Duke Nukem with a hazy, phasing artwork style wrapping it up.  The unfortunate problem though is that ideas don't hit full-tilt unless execution is backing 'em up.  Midnight Ultra falls short and it's a shame because with more polish to the gameplay and presentation this could have been a good one.  \n\nDon't worry about plot here.  You're a bounty hunter/mercenary type with a knack for taking on the supernatural and it's your job to clear out a desert area that's become a hive of cultists and beasts.  A plus right off the bat was being able to choose different weapon sets that include both long-range shooters and melee, hand-to-hand smashers.  It helps flux the gameplay to suit different styles of FPS players.  After that, well the game sort of takes a sharp rudder turn into troubled waters.  \n\nThe graphics are cool but there is absolutely no impact to animations, attacks, etc.  Oftentimes you just line up, press fire and hope for the best.  It's like gambling in Vegas as to whether or not you're gonna win or lose the fight.  Even less responsive is the melee combat which requires a degree of closeness that's very hard to judge with the game's chosen graphic style.  That's a shame because the look is cool but impairs every action that you try to perform because of it.  It doesn't lend to having good depth perception in combat or exploration.  You'll probably die a fair amount and there is some challenge to be had but the game's short-length and the amount of pick-ups made it only a fair challenge to complete in just over two hours (as far as skill is concerned).  The graphics and shifty, drifty aim/control/visual acuity bungs up what should have been the game's best features.  \n\nVariety is also a problem as all of the things that made the old school PC shoot 'em ups a blast (extensive weapon variety, increasingly dangerous and different enemies and attack patterns, bosses, switch puzzling, etc.) aren't really part of Midnight Ultra's world.  It's more or less aim and blast and try to squint your eyes in certain areas to see which direction you're supposed to head next.  That's really all you're doing and the reason this review isn't going to be much longer.  \n\nFor its cheap price you can't lose by picking it up and giving it a try.  You might love it, you might hate it.  I don't even feel neutral with this one.  I didn't have much fun or feel legitimately challenged by the game.  There was a certain FPS itch I was hoping to scratch when I saw it released but sadly I had to get my fix elsewhere.  I will say this though, the stylistic presentation and coolness of weapon set choices are certainly something to build on and I think these developers can hit a stride in the future.  In the meantime, MU is far too mediocre for me to feel good about recommending.","timestamp_created":1607991577,"timestamp_updated":1607991776,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsOrxsfYCfNqmugI="}
