I find they have an alluring appeal, only to disappoint an hour into the game. Multi-Task Master is one of those games with an alluring appeal that can keep those who like being constantly stimulated or with an ADD brain not only occupied, but satisfied. I absolutely love the level of simplicity mixed in with complexity – if that makes sense. \n\nMulti-Task Master is a game where the player must balance their attention between four screens. All four screens have different activities occurring within them, and are all controlled differently from one another. I absolutely love the fact that the tasks are related. In one task, you might be robbing a bank, while trying to keep the hostages calm, while attempting to take out the suspects, while attempting to catch money falling out of the building. In another task, you might be a boxer doing different training regimes all at one time. Another scenario puts you on a factory assembly line. All the scenarios I’ve encountered so far are pretty neat, engaging, and fun. The [b]gameplay[/b] delivery on this one is rock solid, straight forward, and original. There are a lot of different scenarios and challenges to go tackle. Each scenario becomes increasingly more difficult and quicker over time. The player is given a certain amount of lives (to make mistakes). Make one too many, and there goes your effort! \n\nThe [b]graphics and visuals[/b] are well suited to the game. It is a little goofy and even slightly cartoon-ey, but it adds character to an already fun game. It uses unity engine and more or less all details (even particles) are included. The [b]sounds and music[/b] are actually quite key in this game. Different game modes will produce different sounds when new obstacles or challenges come your way. This prompts the player to react and understand which of the four screens is asking for the player’s attention. This is a super important (minor) detail that will save the player’s butt when push comes to shove!\n\nOverall, this is a pretty rock solid game for what it is. If this doesn’t pique your interest at first, I would say continue on your game search. If this does seem appealing to you, I’m sure you’ll love it. I’m a person that likes a lot of stimulus and challenge; Multi-Task Master provides that and more. It is a little slow at first as it forces you to walk through the tutorial. Even for non-gamers, the game provides an interesting opportunity for them to step into the gaming world. A few family members and even my girlfriend enjoyed it, but the game got a little too hard and a little too fast for them. They still got a kick out of trying it. I would highly recommend a purchase on sale! \n\n[h1] RATING : 7/10 [/h1]\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]Gameplay[/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Story / Campaign[/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Sounds / Music[/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Replay-ability[/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Overall [/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n","timestamp_created":1578439765,"timestamp_updated":1578439765,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549071609973907471","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wO2Vwe8CctrL6gE="}
