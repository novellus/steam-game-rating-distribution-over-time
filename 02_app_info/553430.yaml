    developer_response: "Hi Hellmo,\n\nThanks for checking out our app.   I'm sorry\
      \ it didn't meet your expectations.  \n\nWe're considering adding guided meditations\
      \ to the app once it's available for GA.  Is that something that would make\
      \ you be interested in checking out the app again?  What else would you like\
      \ to see?  You might also check out the computer-guided breathing and the music\
      \ in-app until we reach GA.\n\nBest,\n@owocki\n"

    review: 'This game has nothing to do with "learning" meditation. I will explain
      simply what this game does.


      1. You pick a location

      2. You hold the controller to your chest and a big floating ball floats in front
      of you inflating and deflating as you breath


      That is all this game does. No voice explaning any exercises or anything


      Should be reported to be honest for naming the game "Learn meditation"'
