    review: "OK i never write reviews, but I feel this game could use some earned\
      \ words, so here goes!\n\nLight Tracer 2 is a grand-scale vision of 1 indie\
      \ team, combining a lot of different genres and a huge story into one bursting\
      \ package that asks the player to explore, experience and immerse. Did it succeed?\n\
      \ \nSail and go!\nFrom the start you notice that this is not your regular indie,\
      \ as in they went for a pretty big open world, or maybe better open ocean game\
      \ where you travel from island to island. It\u2019s pretty overwhelming and\
      \ I didn\u2019t expect this at all, recreating some sense of wonder and excitement\
      \ once you set sail\n \nOnce you did a few puzzles and won some battles you\
      \ get a very good idea of what this game is about. The puzzles are great and\
      \ exciting, and the battles serves more like an in between to gain some more\
      \ resources, although some of them have alternative solutions which is cool\
      \ to discover\n \nThe boss fights can be pretty hard but once you get thru to\
      \ them (if too hard you can go back and gain more resources and so power up\
      \ the princess) you can set off to the next island which is great.\n \nThere\
      \ will be a huge change also nearing the end of the game which I won\u2019t\
      \ spoil here but it will take you to very different places.\n \nWhat\u2019s\
      \ Good, What\u2019s not?\n \nIf you jump into light tracer expecting a triple\
      \ A experience you will find a bunch of stuff to complain about, since it\u2019\
      s made by a small team. Some things just feel a bit off or not exactly as you\
      \ wanted them, let\u2019s say some animation or some effects.\n \nHowever, if\
      \ you are willing to look thru it this indie is quite the gem, for a fraction\
      \ of the price it offers a huge, very long adventure that will some truly original\
      \ puzzles and battles while also drawing you in its story.\n \nFor me, it gave\
      \ me back some of the feelings I had from games I grew up with, that surprised\
      \ me and took me to place with a wild variety of gameplay and sights that made\
      \ me excited for that next puzzle, that next scene.\n \nSummary:\n \nIt\u2019\
      s not perfect and at the same time I have a very good experience. It\u2019s\
      \ an indie\u2019s take op an open world adventure game and like I mentioned\
      \ above: if you\u2019re willing to look past some issues and blemishes, and\
      \ if you like games like windwaker, you should definitely try this game out."
