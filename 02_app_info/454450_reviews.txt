The music is no exception - quality lofi with 8bit undertones, and each track sets a particular mood for various scenes. It ties the entire thing up very nicely.\n\nIt's great music to chill and read to, and, last but not least, it's amazingly varied and high-quality for an otome game (let alone a Western one). Sometimes the soundtracks of otome are comprised of free-for-alls that get recycled through various companies. Most of the time, whether or not they're commercially shared, they're just plain generic and forgettable. That a quality soundtrack like this was composed for a Western otome game is just pleasantly shocking.","timestamp_created":1568173308,"timestamp_updated":1568173308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533453464508056641","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhreaj+0Ce8SD0gE="}
