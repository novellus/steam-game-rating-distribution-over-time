      /><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Are you hungry for power? Would you like to become
      the best martial artist in the galaxy?</strong></h2><strong>Ultra Savage</strong>
      tells the story about a perfectly bred fighting machine<i>(YOU)</i>, who manages
      to escape the secret laboratory and now is travelling through planets, defeating
      other fighters to become even faster, stronger and find out who was the person
      who trapped him in the first place. <br><br><i><strong>Ultra Savage</strong>
      is the spiritual successor to Great Hero's Beard. Set in future &amp; Improved
      in every way.</i><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1056390/extras/Test.gif?t=1589768252"
      /><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Game features fast combat where everything comes
      down to your character build, your gear, the active skills &amp; their cooldown
      management. Have a humble beginning and turn into ultra speed killing machine.
      <strong>There's no attack speed limit cap in this game!</strong><br></li><li>The
      character build managing is one of the strongest points of the game, so it's
      only right we give you the freedom to mold your character into a <strong>super
      freak of a martial artist</strong>. You can distribute stat points, buy both
      active &amp; passive combat skills &amp; also equip yourself with up to 7 different
      item types.<br></li><li>Normal enemies tend to drop ordinary gear, while bosses
      have chance to drop rare &amp; very rare loot. As you will progress further
      the more challenging enemies will start to drop epic and eventually legendary
      gear. Each item has randomized stat rolls that can roll up to <strong>five stats</strong>!
      All the unwanted junk can be sent to fusion, which returns back rewards. Finally
      to truly maximize your potential you can enhance all your gear with <i>crystals</i>
      you find around the galaxy.<br></li><li>Once you start to feel exhausted you
      might consider trying out <strong>Time Travel</strong>. This will give you permanent
      stat, skill points &amp; XP. But that's not all, it also further increases the
      maximum enhancement level &amp; also unlocks <i>new skills</i> to choose.</li></ul><img
