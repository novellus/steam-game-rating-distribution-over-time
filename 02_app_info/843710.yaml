    review: "Deja Vu is a calming, minimalistic puzzle game with some great twists.\
      \ It starts with a basic tutorial that reinforces the basics of any puzzle game:\
      \ Movement, Levers, Switches, Lasers, Blocks, etc. All of this is seamlessly\
      \ integrated into different levels that reinforce each concept. \n\nAs you get\
      \ accustom to the flow, it introduces its three main mechanics one by one: \n\
      1. Time Clones: This is the core concept of the game and is well executed here.\
      \ You are forced to imagine where your clones may go when doors open in a future\
      \ that hasn't happened yet. \n2. Spatial Clones: You can think of this as the\
      \ perceived twin effect (whatever happens to one twin happens to the other).\
      \ You have 2 blocks and you control both at the same time. Using walls to your\
      \ advantage, you arrange your blocks to solve most of these puzzles. \n3. Death:\
      \ Death can sometimes be just fine. Upon death, the clone becomes gray and you\
      \ can even drag your past lifeless block to its rightful resting place (usually\
      \ a switch).  As long as one of your clones reaches the finish line, you beat\
      \ the level. \n\nThe game gets really interesting once you have to combine these\
      \ mechanics. When you time your clones just right, it feels quite gratifying.\
      \ Imagine your original clone pulling a switch, letting your future clone through,\
      \ waiting for your future clones to pull a switch, and then the original clone\
      \ pushes against a door your future clone will open. These are the kinds of\
      \ decisions you have to think about and they are delightful. A few times, I\
      \ found myself overthinking solutions to a puzzle and then finding a much easier\
      \ way to accomplish what I set out to do. This is exactly what I want from my\
      \ puzzle games! \n\nPuzzle games are notoriously known for their lack of replay\
      \ value. The one downside is it feels too short. I kept wanting more and more\
      \ puzzles. I finished the game in about 2 hours. The average puzzles were solvable\
      \ in at most 5 minutes. This is confusing because, later on in the game, you\
      \ are introduced to a new mechanic: NPCs. This felt like it would be another\
      \ section of the game that would incorporate the rest of the mechanics above.\
      \ However, it turns out that is about where it ends. I was looking forward to\
      \ adding that concept to my repertoire to solve more puzzles in more unique\
      \ and interesting ways. \n\nPros:\nSimple, Calming\nInteresting, Challenging,\
      \ and Unique Solutions\nYearning for More\n\nCons: \nShort\nCost"
