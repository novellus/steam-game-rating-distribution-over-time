    about_the_game: <i>&quot;When you die, you normally have only one simple wish
      - to return and tell them - &quot;Hey, guys - it's OK! No need to feel sad!
      Cause you know what? It's actually OK on both sides, really.&quot; But returning
      is not easy - the only way would be dreams - &quot;half-dreams&quot; - &quot;ghost-dreams&quot;.
      The problematic part is if you get stuck - you turn into a demon. Hard to say
      what exactly it is, but we presume it's a painful and useless existence. Better
      to avoid doing this, really.<br>My personal &quot;problematic part&quot; is
      that I am already stuck here. No idea how I'll get out this time...&quot;</i><br><br>On
      his journey to the &quot;Other Side&quot; Reader (and his &quot;natural companion&quot;
      Writer) meets various Ghosts and Demons, Holy Spirits and Gods. He also meets
      Singer, who is neither Ghost, nor Demon. At some point she becomes important
      to Reader. Realizing this won't stop him though.<br><br>The world of Ghostdream
      should be scary, but it is not - it is just dark. The story should be sad since
      all the characters are more or less dead, but it is not, because they normally
      remember nothing, except some minor detail or two (for example the protagonist
      remembers himself reading a book - this is why they call him Reader. It is his
      only memory after all). <br><br>Ghostdream is a retro-style Point and Click
      Adventure game with puzzles, exploration and story.<br><br>- 55+ entirely animated
      locations (rooms)<br>- 10+ characters<br>- 8 Major Puzzles (no items required,
      exploration of the whole accessible area is a must) + standard adventure actions
      (like get here, talk there, press this, press that...)<br>- 16 000+ words story
      (fully voiced)<br>- about 10 hours to beat Ghostdream for the first time.<br>-
      20+ songs OST<br>- 60 pages art book (with a puzzle guide)

    review: 'Thumbs up and thumbs down doesn''t offer a whole lot of nuance. There
      are parts of this game that I love and parts that I hate. The art and music
      are absolutely gorgeous and the writing is fun, but the city puzzle is a nightmare.
      Most of them just need some note-taking, but that one requires you to click
      on almost exact pixels with no specific indication of where. There is a clue
      given for where the spots are, but the clickable space is incredibly tiny. Even
      with a tutorial, they''re a chore to pinpoint. A later puzzle requires precise
      clicking as well, but the location is much better indicated.


      I''m not sure I could recommend it for $5.99, but it''s definitely worth it
      on one of its 90% off sales.'
