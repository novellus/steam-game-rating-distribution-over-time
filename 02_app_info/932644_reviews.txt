Idk why everyone is so upset without actually looking into the animation sheets themselves. It's not 100, but I'd say around 70-75 animations which is worth the $10 in my opinion.\n\nUpdate: I've finished and I made 71 animations. I both merged a few into one animation, as well as kept out an entire sheet with 71 animation. Meaning this is easily 75+ animations if you use them all. So in my opinion it is completely worth the $10","timestamp_created":1608332656,"timestamp_updated":1608438413,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47M6Zv/YCeq2muwI="}
