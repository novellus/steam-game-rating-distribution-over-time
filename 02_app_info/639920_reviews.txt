Not amazing but not bad either. Unfortunately the game really doesn't feel very polished and it is a little buggy. Objects sometimes float in midair when you release them and other times they drop to the floor. Of particular annoyance, I tried the larger rooms since teleport was added to the game, but I reached one room and the teleport stopped working properly so I couldn't progress any further.\n\nIf the bugs were removed and the game polished up a bit, I would recommend this game to someone who is really into escape/puzzle room games, but if you're not fussed either way, this isn't a particularly special VR game and you're not missing out.\n\nWould I recommend this game to a friend? No. But if they really felt the urge to try it, I wouldn't warn them against it either.","timestamp_created":1511622352,"timestamp_updated":1511622480,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiJLu+d8Ccv2YjwE="}
