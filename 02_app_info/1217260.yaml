    review: "A bit 'wave your arms'sy at times, but can be fun with an interesting\
      \ art style and good story that doesn't end when you think it would. My BIGGEST\
      \ complaint, and a potential deal breaker for those who get motion sickness\
      \ easily; STOP TEARING OUR VIEW AWAY FROM US! There is little more jarring than\
      \ being in the middle of a fight to have your view shoot to the side just for\
      \ a cinematic shot of your partner running and jumping. \nAll that said, i do\
      \ recommend this game, but on sale."
