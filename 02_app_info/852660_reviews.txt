It's OK for how cheap it is, but it's not great and it's not even as good as some of this developers free games.\n\nIt feels like it was thrown together in a weekend using parts from \"Think To Die\" since even the successful act of feeding your chickens has the same blood-splatter-on-camera-lens that you would get from scoring in Think To Die where your goal is to kill all of your people as opposed to this where you are feeding animals, so what's with the blood splatter? It just shows a lack of attention to detail.\n\nIt's not terrible and If you're getting it on sale or just as a quick achievement game, go for it. But I can't be bothered to actually recommend it as it's just really basic and kinda buggy.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]","timestamp_created":1609714825,"timestamp_updated":1609714825,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548872172832489014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48t6e5fYCeNScwAI="}
