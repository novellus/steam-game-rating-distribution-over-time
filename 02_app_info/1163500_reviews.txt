[/h1]\n\nWarp Drive. i... have no words for this game... it is ern... kinda good, but ultra swallow. i mean, this feels like a mobile gacha game wearing an anti-grav suit. wich is fine, as long as it is not using MTX, wich it is not at the moment. but... i don't know what to say other than that...\n\nThe graphics 7/10: the are colorfull. nothing \"oh, nice graphics\", but it has its own flavour. like those sweet candy you get on a grocery store that is very sweet but also very good. the cell shading is very well done, and all, and all the vehicles look interesting, but i gotta warn you one thing, very clearly:\n\n[h1] IF YOU HAVE PROPENSITY TO EPILEPSY DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME [/h1]\n\nit flashes collors and flashes it on your face, A LOT. thank goodness i have zero issues with this, but this could serve as a warning to anyone that wanna play the game.\n\nMusic 7/10: Bland. i was expecting better. the main theme done by Hideki Naganuma is actually pretty good, and reminded me a lot of jet set radio, the other musics are okay... but nothing catchy\n\nGameplay 6/10: again, it is... okay... it doesn't do anything wrong in this regard... but... really there is nothing much to say. once i got a +3 speed craft i started obliterating the AI, and got a 17 win streak that seems that it will never be beaten. i dunno if it is because i am just good at AG racing games, but... welp... i dunno...\n\nStory: None. it's a racing game. so i'll not consider this point. there is one or two lines of dialogue from an alien that gives you tutorials and that's it. but i would like some lore. Redout and Ballistic NG have lore, so this game should have too.\n\nFinal Veredict: 7/10\nif you're morbidly curious. get this one on a sale. i heard there is more content coming tho. this really should be an early access game. because it feels like it. i gonna keep it tho. but i... expected better. i wish there was a neutral button on steam tho. i'm iffy on this one.","timestamp_created":1608164061,"timestamp_updated":1608164061,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49IWDt/YCdKnpugI="}
