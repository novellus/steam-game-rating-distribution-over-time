      notes: This title is an adventure game with overhead exploration in a haunted
        school. Contains excessive violence depicted via full-screen art stills, textual
        descriptions, and Japanese-language voice-acting, specifically including the
        mutilation, torture, and murder of children. Also contains images of female
        anime-style characters with exposed cleavage and buttocks. In some instances,
        female characters are shown bathing with strategically placed steam to cover
        up private areas. Numerous examples of suggestive dialog and foul language
        can be found in translated text, including slurs such as "b*tch" and heavy
        swears such as "f*ck." In one instance, a character's past trauma is mentioned
        which includes a reference to sexual violence.

    review: 'Blood Drive was mostly a disappointment to me. Except for 1 EX chapter
      and the characters that I also liked in the previous games there was nothing
      else that I would say was better than average.


      Horror

      The vast majority of this game wasn''t scary at all. Sure it scared me a few
      times but those were minor like in the first Half Life and that this is kinda
      weak for a horror game. Especially if the other 2 games were actually scary
      most of the time.


      3D graphics

      The biggest factor why this game wasn''t scary. It doesn''t look good at all
      and is more laughable than shocking or creepy. The perfect example would be
      the row of heads that are in both this game and the first game. Just using 2D
      RPG style again would have been so much better than the new look.


      Wrong endings

      Those weren''t satisfying at all. Sure some wrong endings in the previous games
      weren''t interesting too like the green skull ending in the first Corpse Party
      or 2 endings in Book of Shadows where you reach 100% darkening but that''s it.
      In Blood Drive nearly all were forgettable and not shocking or dark. Most wrong
      endings happen when you fail an escape or similar things. If you ever die because
      of a phantom then you already know how boring these endings will be. There are
      no CGs and even rich text that describes how brutal the deaths are is a rarity.
      So these are typical game overs that are just called wrong endings.

      The best wrong ending for me would be last chapter wrong ending 4 which was
      actually dark.


      Music

      OH MY GOD WHY IS THE SOUNDTRACK SO BAD! The first game had one of the best soundtracks
      ever and Book of Shadows while not having many new tracks had some tracks that
      were good and for the rest just used the tracks from the first game. But this
      game had no good tracks at all. These were either just forgettable or annoying
      after a few loops. Also tracks like the infirmary track or similar that alone
      can scare you even if nothing happens aren''t in the game.


      Characters

      The old ones are as good or bad as always but the new characters weren''t really
      interesting and we also got Kuon Niwa who is with Yuka the worst Corpse Party
      character.


      Story

      And the biggest reason why this game and the 8th chapter of Book of Shadows
      should be ignored and not seen as canon. The new stuff with the witches and
      the cults just makes the overall story of the series just worse and I just can''t
      take it serious anymore. The original lore was good enough and the expansion
      of the story wasn''t needed.


      Misc

      The fast-forward option is really slow thanks to the fact that the game now
      only fast-forwards dialog and never animations and your characters has only
      little stamina because of the chases that are just annoying after the 2nd time.


      EX Chapter 01

      The only good thing that is new. It has more Kizami and Morishige in it. You
      should actually look it up online because it doesn''t have much to do with the
      new story so playing Blood Drive isn''t needed.


      TL;DR Just skip Blood Drive. Nothing of value except for that one extra chapter
      is in the game.'
