I have gotten it to work in AC (issues with downloaded tracks that are not Kunos'  not registering start finish)  and ACC.  When it works it is brilliant and massively helpful but it has issues not the least is the price.  I cannot get it to work in rfactor 2 or PC2 even after doing the things on the website.  It really should have a pdf with instructions in the download  because it is not intuitive especially about needing a separate download of circuit tools (analysis software) from another website.  Haven't tried in iRacing yet given the known bug.  I would love to see it in R3E and AMS2.\n\nThe analysis tools with video is pretty awesome and helped me define a braking issue I was doing.  As always be careful with early access software and bugs.","timestamp_created":1600548883,"timestamp_updated":1600548883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1600782862,"developer_response":"Hello there, many thanks for the review - great to hear that you've already started to make gains. Circuit Tools v2.9.30 or later is recommended - this is accessible from the 'Help' tab within VBOX Sim, so you shouldn't need to go to the website for it (the public release of Circuit Tools on our website is actually an earlier version - 2.8). \n\nRegarding game support - there is a 'getting started' section on the 'Help' tab, which offers instructions and also provides the rfactor2 plugins when you click on 'Files can be found here'. The only other thing required is a restart of rfactor2. For Project Cars 2 the only requirement is to turn on 'Enable Shared Memory' in game options. If the above doesn't help, or if you have further issues if you could drop us a brief email at simsupport@racelogic.co.uk then we will get you up and running reliably."}],"cursor":"AoJ4o7mJ1PQCed7sogI="}
