But really! Why the video is 6 minuites long and its short time leaves so many plot holes. We only see 2 humans in the entire short about 4 dinosaurs most of which do not actually do anything. I saw some prime evil app assets used (the velociraptor) and one scene shows a chickens feet just walking around. You can tell half of the stuff here is gifs of google thrown together on moviemaker. The resolution is crap, nothing looks real, the main guy just walks outside with a damn rifle BEFORE anything breaks out (plot hole) and speaking of plot holes the guy jumps out of a car while being chased by a google gif oops i mean t rex. Into some random woods and is then seen with a dilophosaurus WHICH IS NEVER MENTIONED AGAIN. And he and that woman lady just run out fine. there are no employees or visitors at all. just some rifle lying around for some illegal reason probably.","timestamp_created":1545509654,"timestamp_updated":1545509654,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw37nj6+cCc+SDtgE="}
