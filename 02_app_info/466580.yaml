    review: 'Bad dialogue, bad English, bad story, bad music, bad eventing, bad mapping.
      Actually, the mapping is so bad that the game cannot be continued at a certain
      point because the creator accidentally blocked all pathways. Oops.


      I presume this is the work of some 12-year-old who put all his heart into it,
      so I''m not going to refund and perhaps make him a happy day. But how this ended
      up on Steam in the first place is beyond me.'
