    about_the_game: "The second generation EMD GP20 ushered in a new era of turbocharged\
      \ locomotives on American railroads, and now this 2,000hp heavy freight hauler\
      \ is available for Train Simulator in Southern Pacific livery.<br><br>The EMD\
      \ GP20 was seen as leading the way in a new age of turbocharged diesel locomotives,\
      \ even though some of EMD\u2019s competitors had been experimenting with higher\
      \ horsepower models several years earlier. In reality, the GP20 only offered\
      \ a small increase in horsepower over its predecessor, the GP18, but EMD\u2019\
      s salesmen touted the locomotive\u2019s ability to reduce consist sizes and\
      \ maintenance costs, and increase speeds to secure sales.<br><br>GP20s could\
      \ be identified ahead of similar GP7, GP9 and GP18 models by an additional small\
      \ radiator fan ahead of its large aft fan, the prominent bulge behind the cab\
      \ which housed its turbocharger, and a single large exhaust stack.<br><br>Of\
      \ the 260 models built by General Motors\u2019 Electro-Motive Division between\
      \ November 1959 and April 1962, Southern Pacific operated 34 locomotives and\
      \ also took ownership of the four demonstrators originally used by EMD. Many\
      \ of the locomotives served reliably for more than 30 years but were less promising\
      \ for rebuild programmes than other GP classes, and most were scrapped. However,\
      \ some can still be seen on short lines today with two models officially preserved.<br><br>The\
      \ EMD GP20 for Train Simulator, developed by Reppo, is available in Southern\

      \ procedure, accurately modelled simulation, engine overheating and working\

    review: "This loco is AMAZING! It is one of the, if not the best diesel on the\
      \ train simulator market. It has so many awesome features including a realistiic\
      \ cold start procedure. There are even working engine fans and heaters to control\
      \ the temperature of the engine, and you can overheat it, so be careful! It\
      \ has a prototypical horn (Nathan P3) for SP. \n\nPROS:\n-Amazing sounds, awesome\
      \ horn and bell, nothing recycled\n-Full start up procedure\n-So many working\
      \ switches in the cab\n-Bell has air sounds turning on and off like a real one\
      \ does\n-Incredible amount of detail on the outside\n-Other touches like the\
      \ opening cabinet which even sways as the loco drives when you leave it open!\n\
      -If you set the weather to foggy and leave the loco sitting for a while, the\
      \ windows get blurry with fog!\n-Working marker lights \n\nCONS:\n-No working\
      \ windows or doors\n-No conductor\u2019s side view\n\nI give it 9/10. Overall\
      \ this is one incredible loco. \n"
