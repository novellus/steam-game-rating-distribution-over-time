    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">A puzzle game bound to test your ability to
      think out of the box.</h2><br>Deadly rotating blades. Bottomless ditches of
      death. And a demented woman with an unfortunate affinity for bad puns at the
      most inappropriate times gunning for your death. As if that wasn't bad enough,
      your soul has been trapped in a doll courtesy of the aforementioned 3-in-1 mind
      games playing, cold blooded killing machine, and psycho-lunatic of a lady. <br><br>The
      Puppet Master is a puzzle game that is bound to test your ability to think out
      of the box. While being severely limited in many aspects by the fact that you're
      imprisoned in half a pound of cotton and felt made into the vague likeness of
      a human being, you are otherwise granted the Hogwarts worthy ability to transfer
      your soul into the bodies of other puppets around you. A skill that, if used
      well, just might save your life. <br><br>An exhaustive amount of meticulous
      planning and perfectly timed executions are vital in the survival of the game.
      Carefully take note of your surroundings, and you might even outsmart the puppet
      master and get your body back. It's a game of control or be controlled.<h2 class="bb_tag">AMS
      Game Development Association</h2><br>The Puppet Master is distributed under
      the AMS Game Development Association, a student run game development club located
      in the University of British Columbia. Every year, members of AGDA get together
      and make new games, mixing in our collective talent and creative efforts to
      make fun, engaging games that are hard to put down. Our goal is to work towards
      expanding our knowledge of the tools, techniques, and processes used in video
      game development.

    short_description: Deadly rotating blades. Bottomless ditches of death. And a
      demented woman with an unfortunate affinity for bad puns at the most inappropriate
      times gunning for your death. As if that wasn't bad enough, your soul has been
      trapped in a doll courtesy of the aforementioned psycho-lunatic lady.
