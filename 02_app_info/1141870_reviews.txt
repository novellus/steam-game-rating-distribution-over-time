Rough around the edges and not translated very well (some text toward the end wasn't translated at all), but the ending justified the playthrough.  I'm a bit slow with puzzles so it took me a while to collect all of the dates, but someone could potentially play through this game pretty quickly if they knew what they were doing, and probably in under 5 minutes if it wasn't their first playthrough.  Just a tip for the English version since I wasn't sure at first: dates are in MM/DD/YYYY format as opposed to DD/MM/YYYY.","timestamp_created":1569028899,"timestamp_updated":1569028899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513692498207092285","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i6DaqO0Ccq/M0gE="}
