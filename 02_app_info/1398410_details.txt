We've all wanted to confront the limits of our sanity via dropping into a savage arena where grotesque displays of cannibalism and regurgitation are not only encouraged, but vital to claiming victory. We've all daydreamed of clambering over towering corpse piles of unworthy foes, fuzzy bunnies, and bougie bankers. It is our unspoken but commonly shared aspiration to gaze into the recently deceased open eyes of our own previous incarnations, before consuming said corporeal familiars to fuel nefarious future acts. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd lo, the efforts of humankind have been squandered into misguided deeds such as “moon landings” and “disease eradication”, and thus no such sublime arena yet exists. Attempting to fill this void, Epic Banana Games offers humanity a crude facsimile, a digital simulacrum mimicking the raw emotional intensity that such a glorious arena will elicit (once it inevitably exists).  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAccumulate the most wealth. Survive the longest – or become a petulant ghost to torment your rivals. Utilize arcane ingestion techniques to imbue your vomit with flame and ice, spreading chaos and destruction in your wake.
