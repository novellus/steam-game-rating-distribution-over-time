What?!?  $15 USD for 8 levels?  Ugh.\n\nNo upgrades available except for the ability to get better guns (6 total) as you progress.  Ugh.\n\nNo power-ups anywhere.  No cash to grab.  No loot to make killing enemies feel rewarding.  Ugh, Ugh, and Ugh.\n\nCheap deaths where you fall off or get knocked off into the water and then cannot get back up and die even though you are using your boost desperately trying to get back on land.  Big Ugh!\n\n..It's a respectable first indie title by this developer but needs more content added, needs controller support if it's going to be called a \"twin stick shooter\", and needs to eliminate the cheap deaths where you can't get back on land.\n\nNot even close to being worth the hefty $14.99 USD asking price at launch.  My score at launch on May 1, 2019 is a dismal 37% (and trust me when I say that is a generous score)..  My score is mostly hurt by the absurdly high asking price (-40%).\n\nNot Recommended until the price drops significantly and much more content is added.","timestamp_created":1556726645,"timestamp_updated":1556729306,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579496085643768311","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuYOTuuoCfvenwAE="}
