Personally I think the full RETAIL price is abhorent BUT if you can get it in some sort of bundle for say $30 with ~20 other game then I'd say go for it. \n\nOverall 4.20/1000 (Blaze it, and by that I mean burn your copies)\n","timestamp_created":1581285856,"timestamp_updated":1581285856,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483870983123779297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsOr+lfACcvyg8QE="}
