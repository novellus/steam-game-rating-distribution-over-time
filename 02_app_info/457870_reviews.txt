I didn't have any fun playing any of the mini-games and I didn't get .49 cents worth of entertainment value. The whole experience felt clunky, especially on the Oculus Rift where every minigame starts behind you. \n\nThe minigames themselves wouldn't be so bad if the physics felt right, but they don't. On the sword swinging one, there is no tactile feedback to your swings. On the basketball minigame, the ball physics seems like it's too rigid which makes it difficult to put some trajectory with the further targets. On the target shooting one, the gun angle is wrong on the Oculus Touch Controllers and you have to spam the trigger finger. Finally, on the hoop throwing one, the physics feels too floaty ... like you're throwing a ball in space with little gravity.\n\nThere are local leaderboards for each minigame. However, I don't want to play any of them anymore after a total of 15 minutes of play. Not worth the .49 cents I paid.\n\n[b]Rate 4.5/10.[/b]","timestamp_created":1562017681,"timestamp_updated":1562017681,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546385705471038818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45sng1+sCdr+ZygE="}
