The BASIC language is so far gone there aren't really any tutorials out there because nobody really uses it anymore and the in-game manual is so confusing and is the same length as a novel. I would only suggest this if you already know how to code in BASIC, and like the idea of Workshop support. Do not buy this if your new to BASIC or coding in generally.","timestamp_created":1609873151,"timestamp_updated":1609873151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wdr66fYCdeLkwAI="}
