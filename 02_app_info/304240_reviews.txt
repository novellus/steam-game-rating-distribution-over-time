The script drops most of the campy dialog and takes on more of a grounded approach. There's a new sub-plot that also introduces new locations while providing lore. New gameplay mechanics have been added such as the \"Crimson Heads\" and \"Defense Items\" which will change how you approach different situations. The soundtrack is pretty damn good! Especially the more ambient pieces that settle into the background and enhance the atmosphere. For replayability you have a choice between Jill and Chris as always but there's also modes such as Real Survival and Invisible Enemies to try out!\n\nIf you like slower paced, atmospheric horror games with plenty of opportunities to explore and item management then this game is 100% for you!\n\nI will warn you that this game uses \"tank\" controls and fixed camera angles which can be difficult for some players to get used to(especially if you're used to modern over the shoulder games.) But, I assure you that they really are an integral part of this game's feel and with a little but of time, you'll settle right in!\n\nEDIT:typo","timestamp_created":1582505352,"timestamp_updated":1610176933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yMWB8/YCeNGc9AE="}
