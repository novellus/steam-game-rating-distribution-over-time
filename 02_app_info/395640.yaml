    about_the_game: Welcome to a racing game where track memorization is a thing of
      the past!<br><br>In Velocity Stream one player takes control over the Paver,
      a spacecraft that flies through the game world, leaving a trail of energy in
      its wake.<br>It's on this trail that the other players race each other. The
      Pavers goal is to create a road so difficult that the other players fall too
      far behind and get eliminated, while the Racers aim is to be the first to catch
      up with the Paver. To create more exciting and difficult tracks, the Paver can
      pick up powerups in the surroundings, including narrow roads and obstacles.<br><br>This
      mechanic results in a racing game where victory is solely decided by skill,
      rather than track memorization. The racer who wins will be the one who can find
      the best racing lines, master the handling of his or her racer and be able to
      make the car drift when necessary.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Infinite race

    review: I liked how the track can be custom made by flying a spaceship, but as
      far as I can tell, Multiplayer is dead, and Single Player is a joke.  I'd like
      a refund.
