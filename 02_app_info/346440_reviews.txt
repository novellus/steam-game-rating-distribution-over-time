It was so simple, yet whenever there's competition, there's interest. The trick is to run the race as efficiently as you can. It requires some experience, some experimentation, and some mental toughness to do it well.\n\nI haven't played this long, but I love that I can spend 10-15 minutes on this when I'm bored. Depending on how tough the competition is, I might spend more, or less. It's perfect for people who don't have a lot of time throughout the day to play a game.\n\nHaving users create, and vote on upcoming tracks is really clever too.\n\nUpdate: \n\nOver 20 hours in, and I enjoy it more. I've only just realized that the cosmetic changes available to your car, are NOT just cosmetic. They actually offer enhancements. This makes choosing the right car for the track, a big part of the game.\n\nNew & Improved Update:\n\n37 hours in, and I find myself enjoying it even more. This is a game of actual skill. This isn't a case of grinding for gold to buy the best gear, or just leveling up a character. No, this requires skill. You're racing to shave a split second from your score, and to do that, you need to cut those corners as tightly as possible without crashing.\n\nThis game is asynchronous, but that doesn't mean that you don't get to know other players. When you look at the leader boards, you'll see familiar names over and over again. You can chat with them if you want, and so far, it has been good natured.","timestamp_created":1526782395,"timestamp_updated":1532820523,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502164542675018311","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/6DO8eQCcZrcoAE="}
