      \ York City, New Year's Eve 1999. An unlikely team of four professional cleaners\
      \ for the mob gathers to drink and reminisce about their careers at the turn\
      \ of the millenium. As the details of their stories stop matching up, the ugly\
      \ truth behind their cooperation begins to reveal itself. What starts as a celebration\

      \ them at a very strange time in their lives.</strong><br><br>An homage to 90s\
      \ cinema - from Tarantino\u2019s classics through cult crime thrillers to B-movie\
      \ action favorites and more - <strong>Serial Cleaners</strong> remixes those\
      \ familiar places, characters and scenes into its own unique spin on a decade\
      \ full of brightly colored optimism... and the grime underneath it all. Our\
      \ rich soundtrack is composed of many genres that defined the end of the 20th\
      \ century, from East Coast hip hop to industrial metal and rave. Doesn\u2019\
      t matter if the sound of \u201Cyour\u201D nineties was defined by the clubs,\
      \ the festivals, or the radio - we\u2019ve got you covered.<br><br><strong>Move\
      \ without sound. Clean without emotion. Disappear without trace.</strong><br><br>Four\
      \ characters, four perspectives, four play styles. Street smarts, brute force,\
      \ cutting-edge tech skills or good old fashioned tricks of the trade: each will\
      \ allow you to tackle a similar obstacle much differently. Choose your path\
      \ through the non-linear story by picking the part of the narrative you want\
      \ to hear next, and then approach each mission as carefully or brazenly as you\
      \ like. Utilize stealth, exploration and speed as the situation - and your preferred\
      \ experience - warrants it. Get rid of the bodies and other damning evidence\
      \ to wipe the decade's slate clean before the new millenium comes!"

    short_description: Serial Cleaners is a single-player stealth action crime story
      in which you alternate between playing four eccentric mob cleaners taking on
      the bloodiest jobs the carefree 1990s had to offer. If you remember the nineties
      differently, their dirty work is the reason why.
