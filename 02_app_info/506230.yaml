    review: '"A, B, C. Always Be Closing."


      If it weren''t for [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elrnAl6ygeM]that one
      scene[/url] with Alec Baldwin, I probably would''ve never heard of this film.
      Even though much of what his character claims can be [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MehvWs5B7J0]refuted[/url]
      in the face of newly developed sales strategies, nothing alters the true impact
      that both the audience and the surrounding characters feel during those first
      15 minutes. A change in motivation for said characters isn''t easily accomplished
      by one mere speech though, and with everyone''s job on the line in spite of
      all the years they''ve worked at the agency, things get a bit stingy in the
      Big Apple.


      Being a faithful recreation of the play, Glengarry GlenRoss dedicates much of
      its time to the characters and their reactions to the conflicts that arise in
      the film. And as expected, the main cast conveys these emotions flawlessly,
      with every line of dialogue hinting at something relevant and meaningful to
      the film. Jack Lemmon goes above and beyond in his portrayal of Shelley Levene,
      and truly shines when conversing with Kevin Spacey''s character, where we get
      to feel Levine''s innate desperation to protect his job at any cost and regain
      his pride as a salesman.


      Much of the underlying subtext is brilliant as well; at the conclusion of the
      "closing" scene, Baldwin''s character walks back into the main office with the
      camera positioned in a way that emphasizes the "Salesmen are born, not made"
      banner above the office window. That message comes largely into play later,
      and can arguably explain why the characters in the office didn''t exactly heed
      Baldwin''s advice. The thunder & lightning in the first half also does justice
      in escalating narrative tension, notably in Dave Moss''s monologues about his
      attitude towards Mitch & Murray (Owners of real estate agency that sent Baldwin''s
      character to "motivate" the salesmen), and almost all of the scenes with Jack
      Lemmon.


      Jack Howard Newton is an unknown name to me as far as the music department goes,
      but when music does play, it captures the noir-rich atmosphere of the film''s
      setting just right, with New York-style saxophones & bass guitars dominating
      the score. My only gripe is that the guitar was a little hard to hear during
      Al Pacino''s scenes in the second half; I didn''t like how his voice kept drowning
      it out, but that''s probably just me.


      On behalf of the estimated [url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Glengarry-Glen-Ross#tab=summary]$1,775,000[/url]
      that the filmmakers lost during theatrical release, it''s safe to say that Glengarry
      GlenRoss isn''t for everyone, regardless of the film''s all-star cast. Sales
      jargon is practically omnipresent, so talk of "leads" and "pipelines" can easily
      throw off viewers whom aren''t acquainted with the jargon beforehand. No marketing
      research required, but this is definitely one of those "Ah schucks, I''ve gotta
      watch this turkey again to understand it better" movies.


      All in all, Glengarry GlenRoss is a cinematic classic, and a film I recommend
      to anyone who loves movies with great characters, well written dialogue, and
      A-list actors.'
