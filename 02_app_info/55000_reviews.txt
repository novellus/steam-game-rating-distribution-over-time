The ship battles are fascinating with remarkably deep strategies. The graphics are wonderfully retro and uncluttered. The crazy world the game is set in is fantastic. But the thing I like best about Flotilla is the music- the freaking piano music in the middle of an intense space battle. It seems undeniably, perfectly right, and I can no longer play any other space combat game without thinking of Chopin.","timestamp_created":1304392732,"timestamp_updated":1607747182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2+PMqvYCfLG/Ag=="}
