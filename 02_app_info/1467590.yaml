    about_the_game: <strong><i>Pirates of Frontier's Reach</i></strong> is an arcade
      flight combat game set in the Frontier's Reach Universe. A universe where humanity
      has taken it's first steps into the stars and begun to establish colonies across
      hundreds of worlds from the most habitable to the most hostile. Players will
      assume the role of a fighter pilot serving in the privateer fleet of the Republic
      of the Frontier Worlds where human's from every culture and tongue have come
      to seek opportunity and an escape from the overbearing authority of the Sol
      Confederacy of Planets.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467590/extras/WelcomeToTheFungalSmall.png?t=1608731956"
      /><br><br><strong><i>The Gameplay of Pirates of Frontier's Reach</i></strong>
      will see the player skip the long trips between locations and drop right into

      players can pilot their starfighter around areas filled with obstacles and secrets
      where barnstorming will be the only way to get the prize. And <strong>Campaign</strong>
      missions will keep the story moving forward and unlock new and interesting starfighters
