      if you will. The deal was if cats agreed to become familiar companions for them,
      the last of dragons would be imprisoned inside a powerful magic jar, along with
      any minions he might have had in his service. So the deal was done, and Eolus
      was trapped inside the magic jar.<br>The only complication was after some time
      the jar became lost, tipped over by a paw, and beheld by remorseless eyes as
      it rolled down into darkness, never to be found again.<br><br>Until now.<br><br>The

      life into peril, as well as the lives of every other cat on Felis Island. And
      it's up to you to bring them all to safety once again.
