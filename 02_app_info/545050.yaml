    review: 'First of all, i suggest that you don''t buy the game now and wait until
      it''s more developed and balanced.

      THE GAME KEEPS CRASHING FOR NO FREAKING REASON, AND I LOSE MY SAVE EVERYTIME.

      Nice game!

      i enjoyed the experience,

      but the developer abandoned the game, he has to update it and add more features
      and upgrades.. and to lunch the full game, because this is a alpha version..

      The movement of the horse isn''t realistic, make it like RDR2

      And the armored car''s gun is so bad! you have to improve it.. you must make
      it more accurate and make the bullet go verrrry fast

      Add a negotiate option when having problems with a " Qaryah or Village" or "
      Camp", so you can talk to the Sheikh instead of killing them all..'
