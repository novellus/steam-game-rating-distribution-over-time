    review: 'This game is trying really hard to mimic The Talos Principle by offering
      you poorly-made puzzles and laughably bad writing.


      The puzzles are never actually challenging - they''re either trivial or far
      too arbitrary. There''s no middle ground; you either solve them immediately
      or you''re looking up a walkthrough. The writing is hilariously bad, especially
      with all the grammatical errors (or just generally bad translation if you select
      English). Now top it all off with numerous technical issues and having to redo
      the same puzzles whenever you get one wrong.


      There''s nothing good to be said about this game, so here''s a list of cons.

      [list]

      [*]No hints or workarounds if you''re stuck

      [*]Half the puzzles reused from the first game

      [*]Must redo the same puzzles over and over

      [*]Horrendous loading times

      [*]Down to 30 FPS with 1080 Ti, not even on ultras

      [*]Blatant grammatical errors all over Russian version

      [*]Bad English translation

      [*]Collision issues everywhere

      [*]No mouselook sensitivity adjustment
