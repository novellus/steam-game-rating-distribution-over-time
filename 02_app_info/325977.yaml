    about_the_game: "The classic Rail Blue livery of British Rail from the 1960s typified\
      \ the heyday of diesel traction across the UK\u2019s railway network, as depicted\
      \ in this collection of diesel locomotives for the Weardale &amp; Teesdale Network.<br><br>The\
      \ <strong>BR Class 03</strong> was one of the most successful small shunters\
      \ that British Rail ever produced, built between 1957 and 1961. With a very\
      \ short 0-6-0 wheelbase, the Class 03 had a top speed of 28.5mph (46km/h) and\
      \ found itself working at places like Ipswich Docks where heavier Class 08s\
      \ were unable to operate, and as station pilots across the UK network. Today,\
      \ a total of 56 in the Class have survived into preservation, with one remaining\
      \ in active service until 2008 for Govia Thameslink Railway as a yard shunter.<br><br>With\
      \ a demand for faster, less restrictive diesel locomotives in the early 1960s,\
      \ the <strong>BR Class 25</strong>, with its 1,250bhp engine and 90mph (145km/h)\
      \ top speed, could be seen across the UK network, earning their affectionate\
      \ nickname of \u2018Rat\u2019. Initially designed for freight work, some \u2018\
      Rats\u2019 were fitted with boilers so they could heat passenger trains, in\
      \ particular on the Crewe to Cardiff services in the 1980s. In March 1987, the\
      \ final Class 25 was withdrawn from service with 20 examples surviving the cutter\u2019\
      s torch and today can be found in various states of operation at heritage railways\
      \ across the UK.<br><br>The diesel-electric <strong>BR Class 31</strong> was\
      \ built by Brush Traction between 1957 and 1962 with Mirrlees engines and a\
      \ top operational speed of 80mph (129km/h). Their original 1,250bhp or 1,365bhp\
      \ engines proved to be unsuccessful, and the fleet was subsequently fitted with\
      \ English Electric engines instead \u2013 the same motive power as fitted to\
      \ Class 37s but with a lower 1,470bhp. The Class 31 is probably best known for\
      \ its numerous variants, the /0 variant easily recognisable for its lack of\
      \ headcode box above the cab, earning the nickname \u2018Skinhead\u2019.<br><br>The\
      \ sound of \u2018Tractors\u2019 is synonymous to the 1960s, the <strong>BR Class\
      \ 37</strong> being a frequent sight across the UK, in particular in East Anglia\
      \ and Scotland hauling InterCity services. Built between 1960 and 1965 by English\
      \ Electric at their Vulcan Foundry and Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns, 309\
      \ of the Class were produced. British Rail initially placed an order of 42 locomotives\
      \ in January 1959, with the remainder of the Class being built between 1960\
      \ and 1965, very much as a mixed traffic locomotive, easily pulling coaches\
      \ or hauling freight.<br><br>Built by Cravens between 1956 and 1959, the <strong>BR\
      \ Class 105</strong> had the same side design profile as Mk1 coaches, utilising\
      \ the same doors and windows for efficiency and cost saving. A total of 302\
      \ cars were built with 150bhp per engine and a top speed of 70mph (112km/h),\
      \ initially made up as three-car (19 units) and two-car configurations. The\
      \ Class 105 was used throughout the UK on rural and branch line services in\
      \ East Anglia, North East and North West England and parts of Southern Scotland,\
      \ and also running in and out of London Kings Cross on suburban services before\
      \ electrification.<br><br>The BR Blue Pack for Train Simulator recreates these\
      \ popular diesel locomotives as they worked over the Weardale &amp; Teesdale\
      \ Network in the 1960s. Also included are PCA, PCAV and YGH \u2018Sealion\u2019\
      \ freight wagons, plus BR Mk1 passenger coaches in blue/grey livery.<br><br>The\

    review: The Class 25 and 31 are both great, but it's the 37 that spoils the addon.
      In the scenario in which it appears, 'Tractor Traction', the brakes are massively
      over-responsive, and it is way too easy for them to go into emergency. Similarly,
      take the brakes off, and the entire train shoots forward like a rocket.
