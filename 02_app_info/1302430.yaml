    review: 'If $5 is a huge deal...then its not worth it for you.  If you like having
      a wide variety of little experiences and $5 is the equivalent of an espresso,
      then its worth a try.  Had one decent scare but mostly its a bit odd.  Still,
      ill keep it installed as a quick showcase for friends or family that dont have
      VR and want to quickly try a few different things.  Plus i dont want to discourage
      further development of these types of things ...


      EDIT:  I played a trick on my 5 year old who has loved VR so far.  He either
      plays Angry Birds/Spiderman/Flying Hero games, drivers, Roller Coasters or short
      Videos.  I told him this was a new video...  Hes not stupid.  He was getting
      a creepy vibe and asking if it was going to be scary.  I lied.  And got a heck
      of a good laugh at his inevitable scream :)'
