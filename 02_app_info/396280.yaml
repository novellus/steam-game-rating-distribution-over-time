    review: This game has one of the most customizable leveling systems I have seen
      in an MMO. It is definitely dated, and has a steep learning curve for new players,
      but the community tends to be very helpful. Paid or free play is a blast and
      half of the fun of playing the game is getting gear put on. I love this game.
