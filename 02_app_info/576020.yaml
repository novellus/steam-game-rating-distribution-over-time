    review: This game is fun for all of... one playthrough.  That's it.  The attached
      card game is superfluous and adds nothing to it.  It's the same story no matter
      what you do.  The only thing that will change is who you lose the opportunity
      to interact with over time, and that will just be based on who you haven't.  So
      whoever you chose to romance by the end, they'll probably be safe anyway.  There
      are different endings, but you can just save before the final choice (which,
      again, never changes) and do each from that save.
