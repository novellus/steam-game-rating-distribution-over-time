    review: "[b]Road trip stories represent the journey that characters are on, often\
      \ serving as an allegory for the entire narrative that reminds us the destination\
      \ is rarely as important as the experience of getting there. That's the core\
      \ of Sam and Max's story. It is a journey of nonsensical discovery, a story\
      \ of hijinks and humour that, as dumb and childish as it might be, is still\
      \ funnier than it has any right to be.[/b] \n\n[h1]First Rundown[/h1]\n[b]Sam\
      \ & Max - Hit the Road[/b] is a 1993 LucasArts point-and-click adventure. Based\
      \ on the 1987 comic book franchise, the game follows a pair of anthropomorphic,\
      \ vigilante/private investigators of New York City in their crazy paranormal\
      \ investigations all around the USA. Although it may look like a cartoon, it's\
      \ most definitely not designed for kids. Max, a psychopathic little fur ball\
      \ of a rabbit, and the more sensible canine shamus dressed in a suit named Sam\
      \ are an odd couple. Even today (I still have the floppy disks somewhere in\
      \ my basement), this classic stands as an enduring testament to adventure gaming's\
      \ finest and funniest hours.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2352503121\n\
      [h1]\nIn Deep\n[/h1]\n[quote]\n[list]\n[*][h2][b]Story[/b][/h2]\n\u25FC\uFE0F\
      \ [b]Writing[/b] \nA bizarre but amusing adventure across North America in which\
      \ the detectives must solve the mystery of a runaway carnival bigfoot. Their\
      \ quest is continuously opposed by the evil schemes of a famous country-western\
      \ singer that wants the creature for his business. Between a rescue mission\
      \ and a manhunt, Sam and Max discover that nothing is as it appears. The story\
      \ is a rollercoaster of totally hilarious and nonsensical situations, which\
      \ parodies American culture. It offers a marvellously funny mystery, a cast\
      \ of memorable characters. There are also lots of references to politics, films,\
      \ celebrities and 80s pop culture in general. Some of them too old for us to\
      \ catch, but still funny.\n\u25FC\uFE0F [b]Characters and dialogues[/b] \nThere\
      \ are many visual jokes, but the backbone of the game is in its dialogues. The\
      \ humour strongly relies on verbal acrobatics, on the use of polysyllabic words,\
      \ old English and other such oddities.\n\n[*][h2][b]Gameplay[/b][/h2]\n\u25FC\
      \uFE0F [b]How it plays and nice features[/b] \nUI interface includes five basic\
      \ commands (walk, examine, take, use, talk to) that the player can change by\
      \ pressing right-click. In the game, the player controls Sam while Max follows\
      \ him by entertaining himself by doing stupid stuff in the background. Essentially\
      \ most of the time the interactions are made within Sam and the items collected\
      \ and stored in the inventory. Those can be used to combine the junk gathered\
      \ and this feature is often used to create the most strange solutions to enigmas.\
      \ Occasionally, Max can perform special actions to characters or objects. By\
      \ getting new clues and progress with the plot, new icons will appear on the\
      \ map. That allows Sam and Max to continue the manhunt across the States. In\
      \ some areas can be found several independent subgames to play, most are useful\
      \ to get story items, some are just for fun.\n\u25FC\uFE0F [b]Overall difficulty[/b]\
      \ \nThe puzzles consist mostly of object-based problems, some are so illogical\
      \ to the point of being surreal, making them hard nuts to crack. Over the playthrough,\
      \ you are free (and encouraged) to try out all the craziest actions until you\
      \ find a solution that works. I can\u2019t lie. My memory is not as good as\
      \ it used to be, and I got stuck two times during my play. Looking online for\
      \ a tip is not an unforgivable sin, who didn\u2019t check the solution on pc\
      \ magazines in the golden years?\n\n[*][h2][b]Graphics[/b][/h2]\n\u25FC\uFE0F\
      \ [b]Art Design[/b] \nMade by splendid graphics and with a cheesy colourful\
      \ cartoon style atmosphere. The backgrounds and the characters are gorgeously\
      \ drawn and beautifully sketched in 256 colours, with many wacky palettes and\
      \ details to study. A few scenes also include 3D rendered elements which blend\
      \ in surprisingly well (like UFOs and helicopters).\nLevel design is memorable,\
      \ Sam and Max's investigations will take them to interesting roadside attractions\
      \ (or better the satirical version of the real ones) such as the world's largest\
      \ ball of twine or Mt. Rushmore (where you can bungee jump from a president's\
      \ nose), several highway stations, a Twilight Zone park and the alligator-infested\
      \ marshy south.\n\n[*][h2][b]Audio[/b][/h2]\n\u25FC\uFE0F [b]Music and effects[/b]\
      \ \nThe old jazz music is well scored and pleasurable to listen to. You'll also\
      \ hear blues, some tribal and medieval themes, surfer rock and lots of country\
      \ tunes.\n\u25FC\uFE0F [b]Voice acting[/b]\nThe voice-acting is incredibly high\
      \ quality and the crazy dynamic duo of detectives have very fitting voices that\
      \ add to the comical lead's wisecracking attitude.\n\n[*][h2][b]Extra[/b][/h2]\n\
      \u25FC\uFE0F [b]Replayability[/b] \nWhen I bought the game, I was probably just\
      \ having a fit of nostalgia. That\u2019s the main reason to replay this title\
      \ after all those years. If you are new to the genre, I can\u2019t recommend\
      \ it as a starting point. \n\u25FC\uFE0F [b]Game length[/b]\nI finished the\
      \ game in around six hours but it wasn\u2019t my first playthrough.\n[/list]\
      \ \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2352505164\n[/quote]\n\
      \n[h1]\nBugs and Issues\n[/h1]\n[quote]\n\u25FC\uFE0F Not a single game-breaking\
      \ bug but some glitch between voice tracks and subtitles.\n\u25FC\uFE0F Most\
      \ of the puzzles are completely illogical, you can solve them by trial and error.\n\
      \u25FC\uFE0F Like the majority of Lucasarts point-and-click adventure games,\
      \ it is developed and uses the SCUM system. To open menus you need to press\
      \ F5. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2352505569\n\
      [/quote]\n\n[h1][b]JUDGEMENT[/b][/h1][quote]\n[b]Sam & Max - Hit the Road is\
      \ a classic cult point-and-click adventure game, definitely one of the funniest\
      \ games I've ever played. However, it\u2019s not the best choice as a starting\
      \ point for new players to the genre. If you just enjoy the cartoonish adventures,\
      \ you\u2019ll get a kick out of it, but the first approach to the investigation\
      \ is infuriating, to say the least.[/b]\n[/quote]"
