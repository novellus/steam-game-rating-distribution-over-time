    review: this game was thrown together it's not a bad idea though it's a bit outdated
      and could use some tlc it isn't so buggy as others say it just happens to be
      complex to play despite the simple setup umm this game was built for an older
      OS take one look at the local files and you will learn just that. it might of
      made a good GBA game but as for pc it needs a bit of work. so good try dev but
      please put more effort i can't recommend this game in it's current state. in
      my end statement you get whatcha pay for lol so don't expect guitar hero paying
      what you did for this game lol
