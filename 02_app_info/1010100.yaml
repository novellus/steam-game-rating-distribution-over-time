    review: 'I like VR games with flying, I like good music and shooting one-handed
      guns. But the amount of content in this game is so small that it is more like
      a tech-demo, not a proper game. Let''s describe issues in detail.


      1. The gameplay and controls

      While the controls and flying mechanic feels mostly OK (played on Vive) there
      are many things which could be done better. The combat area is big and empty
      and most of the time you close the distance. Stationary enemies always spawns
      too far, while the moving ones are always on your tail no matter how fast you
      where flying. Fast in-game movement is cancelled out by the distances.

      There are static obstacles floating around but they don''t participate in a
      gameplay. It is not feasible to hide behind them and there is no challenge to
      navigate through them like through some asteroid belt. They don''t work as decorations
      as well: all obstacles looks the same - providing no distinct memorable points
      on a level.

      The shooting doesn''t feel rewarding: the sound and visual effects are not "crunchy".
      The boosted shot sound is quieter than a regular shot - why?!

      Sights feel useless especially when boosted mode is active and that floating
      magical rune on a muzzle obstructing the view. The tracer effects of regular
      shots are white making them hard to see against the background. The overall
      short length of pistols makes it even harder to aim.

      Typical engage distances feels too far for the weapons: you always forced to
      fly closer before shooting and new enemies are always spawned all across the
      combat area. The enemies either small or fast making it hard to hit without
      "spray and pray". At least that feels inline with useless sights...


      2. The content

      Can''t decide what to name first. The game is lacking content on every single
      aspect: there is not many types of enemies, very few weapons, no singleplayer
      campaign nor story, the levels are empty with no memorable landmarks or decorations.
      Game feels engaging first 3 minutes and then it becomes repetitive and boring.
      No matter how many enemies you killed - the area remains filled with foes providing
      no sense of progress. And then it suddenly says "level X completed" when you
      killed some predefined number of enemies. The game offers you to replay the
      same level again and again with gradually increasing difficulty and that''s
      it. No interesting locations, no story, no meta-game with upgrades and loot.


      TL;DR

      The price is way to high for what game offers. With so little content it is
      a glorified tech demo at most, not a proper game. Going to ask a refund.
