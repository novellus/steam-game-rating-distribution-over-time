    review: 'Props to the young devs for finishing the project, but this game is horrible
      trial-and-error-and-a-sheer-bucketload-of-random-luck crap and should be freeware.
      Some of the hitboxes (esp. in boss "battles") are either completely arbitrary
      or just plain broken and several (that''s the larger amounts of "several") times
      I''ve managed to die from apparently touching the enemy some fifth of the screen
      width away. The awful blinking noise backgrounds make me feel nauseous for the
      first time ever from such effects in games. The bosses barely telegraph their
      attacks or phases and some projectiles are even practically invisible in all
      the visual clutter (whatever those turd-like ice-cream-sticks are that one of
      the bosses launch at you) which is a big damn no-no since everything is instakill.


      Keep making games, guys, you''ll get better at it, I promise. But this one I
      cannot recommend for anyone to buy.'
