    review: "This is a side-scrolling shooter with some retro feel and a few things\
      \ I haven't seen before. The basic gameplay is as expected:move right and shoot\
      \ anything that moves and some things that don't. The weapon choice is nice\
      \ because one can switch between different weapons mid-game. The difficulty\
      \ ramps up well, but has the dark souls quality of no saves right in front of\
      \ boss rooms and the knowledge that until you know every pattern you are going\
      \ to be throwing lives at your problems. \n  The art style gives a hand-drawn\
      \ look to a genre that I see more 8 or 16 bit games for. This can be fun at\
      \ times and confusing at others. I'm not entirely sure what I destroyed in some\
      \ levels but if my bullets collide I'm going to keep firing.\n The level design\
      \ is fun in that it stays interesting and each level is given at least some\
      \ context by the overall story. Also the bosses are well designed and fun to\
      \ fight although the battles can run a bit long with most bosses having a fairly\
      \ simple pattern.\n The music for this game is interesting and keeps pace with\
      \ the gameplay. Sometimes it feels a bit overwhelming though when combined with\
      \ the sound effects and the sound of my character's pained grunts after being\
      \ hit. \n  I would recommend this game to those who enjoy a challenging shooter\
      \ with an active developer who is concerned about the game even this far into\
      \ the product's life-cycle. If you are anywhere near my skill level it will\
      \ cost you fewer quarters on steam than it would've in an arcade."
