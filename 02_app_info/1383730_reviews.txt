Like betting on a marble instead of a horse and let the race run free to see what place everyone comes in against ALL the other random marbles with a point system like F1. I hope this is part of what championship mode is. Just a thought. The more options the better.","timestamp_created":1608349177,"timestamp_updated":1608349731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i6nHvPYCeMOruwI="}
