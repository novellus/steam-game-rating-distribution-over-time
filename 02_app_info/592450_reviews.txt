Its not a large area, but it is fully modelled which gives you much more detailed objects than photogrammetry would do. \nI was particularly impressed with the TV screen - it looked 'real'. I thought it was the best use of an 'in game' screen Ive seen. I hope you add audio controls in the future. Likewise, the rest of the environment was well designed. I can imagine that the real life area looks just like this.\nI hope you get to expand on this. I can imagine that such a virtual landscape would be a useful aid to schools and univeristies in the future. \n","timestamp_created":1488034384,"timestamp_updated":1488034384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiNnwutoCeISLcw=="}
