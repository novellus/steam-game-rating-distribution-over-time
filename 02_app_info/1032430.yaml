      a fanatical cult.<br>Built from the ground up for VR using proprietary character
      physics and gore systems, Blood Trail offers an unprecedented shooting experience
      not for the faint of heart.<br>With realistic gun mechanics and damage effects,

    review: There is soo much potential for this game. The ragdolls, graphics and
      gore is all there. My only real complaints right now is that AI will mag dump
      you even when youre behind cover, the maps need work and that the AI rarely
      make any noise when inflicted pain. Anyways, detail on the character models
      are great as well as textures, models and sounds for the guns. looking forward
      to the progression of this game.
