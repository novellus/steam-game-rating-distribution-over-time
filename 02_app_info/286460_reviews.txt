I think it is as good as the first one.\n\nStart of the game looked a bit complicated before I searched all places and talked with all characters in the town.\n\nPuzzles was interesting enough to solve them without guide. Having key showing all clues, objects and ways on screen is making game much more enjoyable, because fishing pixels is not needed. In first game, there was just key to show ways where to go, but not clues and objects.","timestamp_created":1609748086,"timestamp_updated":1609748086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz8+d5vYCfOapwAI="}
