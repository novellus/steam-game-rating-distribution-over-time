The concept is pretty simple, but with all the extra mechanics it is fun to play. For example: you can craft traps to help you survive the night. But the game has some small bugs or glitches, like your stick is not showing but you can still hit puppets, or that you cannot move an item in your invertory and it is just stuck. I've played this game for 4 and half an hour and it has crashed like 5 times, and that SO annoying, because all your progress is GONE. Because it is in early acces you can expect those, but I hope that crashing is getting fixed soon. I know the game needs just updates so that will probably be fixed in the future. I do recommend this game, but it just needs updates and then it's all good!","timestamp_created":1609958872,"timestamp_updated":1609958872,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502188205718994141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwvNrB7PYCcf+JwQI="}
