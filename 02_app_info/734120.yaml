    review: "Interesting little game! I don't regret getting this on sale. It's really\
      \ short, but the story is unique and I liked playing as a toddler. It was creepy!\
      \ Subtitles were good as well for any deaf/hard of hearing folks. \n\nIt's not\
      \ the most polished or lengthy game out there, but I enjoyed it for what it\
      \ is. I hope the developer will release more stuff like this in the future!"
