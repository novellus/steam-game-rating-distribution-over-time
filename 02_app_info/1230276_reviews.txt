I am particularly impressed with the forestry. I see a significant improvement in the trees over his previous release of the Peace River Region. The scenarios are very enjoyable.\n\nThat being said, I must concur with some previous reviews of this route in that the route could do with some more \"eye candy.\" Scenery objects are rather sparse relative to the FOV of the camera angles.\n\nAll in all, I could see this becoming one of my favourite routes and I have no reservation about recommending this route to others.","timestamp_created":1609797137,"timestamp_updated":1609797137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pt7Y5/YCftPCwAI="}
