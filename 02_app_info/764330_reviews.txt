Not hundreds of battlers, but rather only a few, but with matching busts and sprites. Definitely worth a buy.\n\nTo the creator: Why limit busts to square images that cut out most of the monsters? With the rat and a few others it's fine, but with larger ones like the chimera and the cerberus it just looks silly. You clearly already have made the art at full size, since the battlers are just the unzoomed version of this, so why not include the full monster bust?","timestamp_created":1588407628,"timestamp_updated":1588407628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjp6e6vECfp/+hAI="}
