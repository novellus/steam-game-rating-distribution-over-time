    review: "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I]  NES fans looking for a Trip of Nostalgia\
      \ [/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nDon't let the graphics fool you. It's a nostalgic\
      \ trip back in several ways, where you would play in front an old CRT screen\
      \ and its glow during the night. The presentation and control set complement\
      \ this quite well, keeping things simple but still engaging. Now granted, if\
      \ you're expecting a NES hard platformer, Super Win is not the game for you,\
      \ as the difficulty is a bit on the easier side in most cases. Sure, once in\
      \ a while you'd get a difficult section, but this is more of a walk in the park\
      \ to remember the old days then a controller throwing affair. The soundtrack\
      \ is a good mixture of the old 8 bit classics, and its clear that the developer\
      \ remembers those days fondly. For me, it's the perfect sale title: while you\
      \ won't be blown away by any one of the game's elements, it's solid across the\
      \ board, and a mostly relaxing experience. A good sale title. \n\n[b]Video Review:\
      \ [/b]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X42Xsth7QKc\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n\
      [list]\n[*] Captures the nostalgia and retro feelings of sitting in front of\
      \ CRT TV. The graphics may look \u201Cbad\u201D, but it's used to capture the\
      \ era of the games its trying to represent, and it succeeds. \n[*] Catchy 8\
      \ bit sound track. \n[*] Despite the title, smart level design and gameplay\
      \ that takes you back to the era of the NES. \n[*] Controls work for the most\
      \ part. They are designed with precision in mind, but not being too flexible.\
      \ It will punish mistakes, which I want.\n[*] Powers and the overworld allow\
      \ you some good flexibility in terms of your adventure. Good mixture of difficult\
      \ and easy gem gathering, and that sweet spot where an item that you got would\
      \ make it easier, but you can get the gem if you use your skills.\n[*] Good\
      \ variety of hazards put together in different ways.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n\
      [list]\n[*]  KO punch. There's no oompf in the end, nothing that knocks you\
      \ out. It's solid in a lot of ways, but nothing that screams \u201Cyou have\
      \ to play this\u201D. \n[*] While you can go to the fortune teller at any time\
      \ to get a hint, there's a lack of direction as a whole that can get annoying.\
      \ \n[*] The ice in the ice levels needed to effect you more. If you're attempting\
      \ to go for slippery, this wasn't it. \n[*] Wanted more difficulty in several\
      \ ways. It didn't capture the NES hard. \n[/list]\n \n[b] If you want more reviews/information\
