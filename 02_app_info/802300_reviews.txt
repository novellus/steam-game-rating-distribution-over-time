It has fielders and everthing but ultimately it's just another hitting contest.\n\nIt's not just home run derby though since you get points for infield hits too.  You have to score a certain number of points to beat the AI.  Pitchers have a variety of pitches.  You can unlock a number of bats that are basically the same but the sound is different. Still pretty satisfying.\n\nIt didn't take much to make this the best bball game at the moment.  MLB Home Run Derby has better graphics but there's no fielders and the hitting is messed up.  VR Dream match is more realistic with real speed pitching but there's no game to it.  It's just a batting cage.\n\nThis one has game elements.  You can aim for powerups and have to clear each level with increasing difficulty.\nIt's a good arcade baseball game with some amount of realism.","timestamp_created":1530431743,"timestamp_updated":1530431743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502824842929840088","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4weS1quQCcqLqpAE="}
