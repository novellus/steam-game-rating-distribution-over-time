    review: '- Weak story.

      - Everyone keeps laughing. Like three times per page, "he laughs", "She giggles".
      It''s meant to be a postapocalyptic horror nightmare world, and everyone''s
      walking around guffawing for no reason like they''re doped up on laughing gas.

      - Some choices literally tell you, "no you can''t do that, choose the other
      thing". Then don''t put a choice there and waste my time.
