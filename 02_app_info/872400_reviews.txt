As far as some areas of improvement, I would say this is geared towards controls and from the controls to the lack of mouse cursor etc its not really streamline for a desktop gaming experience. I would say the experience on Steam for this game is that it was confusing without the ability to use mouse or even see a cursor, and once inside the game I had to use the arrow keys as WASD wasn't working as intended, not to mention my mouse didn't work so I couldn't pan around and it was a bit disorienting to walk around using arrow keys and not be able to pan around like in a traditional 3D game, so it seemed like a 3D experience but confined in a 2D overlay. Lastly, I jumped right into the game and it wasn't immediately clear which button maps to attack and I think there should be some hints/HUD messages during the beginning to educate and inform the user on what does what in terms of attack and defense to get them started without fumbling around and without having to exit to the menu to see what keys mapped to what.","timestamp_created":1594223526,"timestamp_updated":1594223526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470157712697982788","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwh5DIl/MCd7zpkwI="}
