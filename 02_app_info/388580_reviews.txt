Cannon Fodder is still worth playing 20+ years later, and Helldivers is a modern example of the genre done right. KAC, on the other hand, is a mess. It's visually messy so you can't easily identify threats, especially because you end up rescuing tons of other soldiers who mindlessly copy your actions.","timestamp_created":1486914816,"timestamp_updated":1486914816,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569142401218414307","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgPHBmdoCdP77cQ=="}
