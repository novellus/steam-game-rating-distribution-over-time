    review: 'When I was younger I only played the original without the expansion packs,
      and even now I don''t see much use for the expansion packs when the base game
      is so much fun. It''s good RTS fun for those who like to build and win slowly.
      The boring man''s RPG you might say. And I''m as boring as they get. You get
      to really build your empire and feel like you''re winning, rather than C&C where
      you just keep spamming units at the enemy until they get destroyed.


      It''s varied enough that I went through almost all the "small" map scenarios
      one after the other without wanting to play a different game. Wow, I AM boring.'
