    about_the_game: "In this demo, you will have free access to the tutorial. After\
      \ its completion, you will be given 45 minutes to play the Twin Elms Apartment\
      \ section of Chapter 1. If you die, half of the time since your last save will\
      \ be refunded. For example, if you have 10 minutes left when you die, and saved\
      \ 30 minutes ago, you will be refunded 15 minutes - thus making your remaining\
      \ play time 25 minutes total. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will be given the first\
      \ melee weapon and gun to start with, to expedite your ability to play the demo\
      \ without spending too much time wandering around unarmed. <br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nWhen your timer hits zero, the demo will be over, and you must purchase the\
      \ game to continue playing. Saves will not transfer, as this demo skips the\
      \ prologue and gives weapons out of order."
