    review: 'This game has basically no effort put into it. If you really wanted to,
      you could probably play this game blind.


      The animations are crud. The weapons kill for you. Almost everything is one
      shot or three shot, even the "Bosses". The weapons don''t work as they should.
      You can''t move on your own. 1/10 (They at least did some lines of code) Models
      are probably off the asset store as well.'
