    review: A satisfying Choice of... game that lets you develop your own fighting
      style, become a teacher, and defend the Middle Kingdom. Or simply seek enlightenment.
      While the events aren't as dramatic as other Choice of... games, the main character
      is self-motivated and the story feels complete, neither rushed or hanging on
      the usual cliffhanger.
