    review: "\nThis game starts off really cool, going from building to building and\
      \ stabbing and throwing arrows at supervisors in a night time neon lit city.\
      \ I felt so cool landing a throw from across another building. However, it progressively\
      \ got worse as the game went on. \n\nI felt like it was going in a new and original\
      \ direction, with a new environment when you go from a train to rooftops. But\
      \ pretty soon you are right smack back into offices. Some new things they added\
      \ like pneumatic tubes and the bow just break quite often. The gate on the tubes\
      \ can dislocate and become near impossible to open, leaving you exposed when\
      \ you may need to get back.\n\nThe bow sucks, hard.  It feels like something\
      \ that was slapped together last minute when they wanted to add another new\
      \ thing before launch. You cant shoot through vents without the arrow hitting\
      \ random hitboxes. You cant aim for shit because the devs decided the crosshair\
      \ should consist of 2 vertical lines. \n\nSPOILERS:\n[spoiler] In the final\
      \ level you really feel the effects of the shitty bow design. In the level you\
      \ are facing a horde of robots with shields and heat-seeking grenade launchers.\
      \ When you have the bow out, it takes up one hand, but to use it you need the\
      \ grab tool on the other. So you are completely out of movement when you use\
      \ the bow. When you \"nock\" the grenade, a good portion of the time it will\
      \ just not allow you to pull the string and you are just stuck with a grenade\
      \ on a stick. The enemies you face arent exactly the hardest. The tactic I learned\
      \ while playing was to just teleport right onto them and stab them as they bled\
      \ out very fast. But when your only weapons are grenades it gets kind of difficult.\
      \ The level with the map and fuses was just stupid to play in general.[/spoiler]\n\
