If you like stacking and re-stacking boxes after carrying them around the entire base in front of you (and sometimes having the POV stuck INSIDE of them), then jumping (only about half a foot off the ground), missing, knocking over boxes, re-stacking, jumping, etc., then this is the game for you. If you appreciate a game that doesn't base it's puzzles' requirements in badly executed physics, then take your money elsewhere.","timestamp_created":1555574302,"timestamp_updated":1555574302,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520383656024932861","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw04Tdl+oCesW9vwE="}
