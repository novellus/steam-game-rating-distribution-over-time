Players assist the indomitable title character as he travels through various worlds in search of gems which yield smiling silver coins.  When three or more gems of the same colour are matched horizontally or vertically they transform into the coins, much to the delight of the covetous cat.  After a set number of coins are collected, Pushcat can escape through the catflap and proceed to the next area.  Although Pushcat can become trapped or reduced to ashes by exploding Aztec Death-heads and have no choice but to restart the level, he never needs to worry about being crushed from above by falling blocks; this element makes the gameplay far less tedious than that of many [i]Boulder Dash[/i] imitators.  Most levels require some degree of planning, but every once in a while there are more freeform, endurance-focused trials where Pushcat simply needs to stay alive while pocketing a larger number of coins.\n\n[i]Pushcat[/i] boasts numerous chiptune renditions of notable ragtime and classical pieces (The list of featured works is conveniently located in the credits scroll).  The soundtrack eschews Scott Joplin tunes in favour of slightly lesser-known pieces from the ragtime repertoire, and they're all quite perky.  The intense Baba Yaga segment from Mussorgsky's [i]Pictures at an Exhibition[/i] is effectively employed in the levels where Pushcat encounters the cumbersome but dangerous ghost who seeks to put an end to his silver hunting, and there's a vivacious arrangement of Chopin's [i]Ã‰tude Op. 25 No. 1[/i] as well.\n\n[i]Boulder Dash[/i] fans will appreciate this nicely presented, moderately challenging puzzle adventure.","timestamp_created":1606603949,"timestamp_updated":1606603949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vNjDiPYCe5zotAI="}
