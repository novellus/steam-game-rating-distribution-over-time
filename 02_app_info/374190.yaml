      /><br><br>Using a revolutionary, or at least it was back in 1988, leveling system,
      Infernax is an old school adventure platformer game with puzzle elements. It's
      a whole new innovative style and since nobody has ever done anything of the
      like, we'll name it ourselves, ARPG, which stands for Awesomely Radical Playing...
      Game, patent pending.<br><br>All kidding aside, we tried to capture the essence
      of the games that left a mark on our childhoods, the ones who lit up the spark
      that made us want to make games of our own.<br><br>This is a recreation of that
      experience we had growing up playing obscure NES games, the kind of game that
      left you with a feeling of accomplishment once you beat it, several months after
      the initial purchase.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374190/extras/infernax-steam-story.gif?t=1600190440"
      /><br><br>Set in the early years of the crusades, Infernax is the adventures
      of a great crusader who returns to his homeland only to find it plagued with
      unholy magic. <br><br>While on your quest to find and destroy the source of
      this corruption, you will face ruthless creatures, dangerous beast, precarious
      terrains and pretty unforgiving game-design.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374190/extras/infernax-steam-features.gif?t=1600190440"
      /><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Dangerously open world to explore<br></li><li>Many
      secret areas to uncover<br></li><li>Challenging dungeons and boss battles<br></li><li>Level

      based on player's decisions.</li></ul><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374190/extras/infernax-steam-gore.gif?t=1600190440"
      /><br><br>Because it wouldn't be a Berzerk game without at least SOME blood,
      we've added gallon of bloody bits for you to oogle at.<br><br>Buckle your seatbelt
      dudes because it's about to get gory.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374190/extras/infernax-steam-book.gif?t=1600190440"
      /><br><br>Secrets up the wazoo, so many that we had to implement a Game Wizard
      to contain them all.
