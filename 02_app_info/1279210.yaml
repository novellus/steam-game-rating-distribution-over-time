    review: 'Another okay addition. If you like the randomness that events brings,
      then this simply dilutes the pool and adds some more variety to that.


      None of the cards are much to write home about, with the one exception of ''Patience
      Rewarded'' - this allows both players to set aside one card in the trade row
      in turn to be purchased later, with each player reserving exclusive buying right
      to the card they set aside. Reserving a powerful card for you to buy later can
      be pretty important.'
