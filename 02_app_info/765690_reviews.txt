It misses the custom option in the difficulty. It is a bit all or nothing with that. The voice acting is meh, the drawings could have been better. But what irked me most is that it was not really enjoyable to play, the story was rather illogical, you had to run from here to there, picking up items that were rather more random then really part of a thought through narrative. The characters were not really believable either. It came to a point where I almost stopped playing it altogether because it got tedious in the end.","timestamp_created":1604931557,"timestamp_updated":1604931557,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46ILY1vUCcY2trQI="}
