To emulate the legendary [i]Plants vs. Zombies[/i], it's all about balance, which is where this title stutters a bit. \n\n[b]The high point with [i]Hipster Attack[/i] is in the humor, artwork, and animation.[/b] And that stuff is seriously great. The low point is with some of the mechanics. Most of the mechanics are a straight rip from inspiration, but the new ones are not great. There is flying tofu that you have to click to kill and it makes the whole thing overly twitchy and spammy. Another thing is that the battlefield gets really chaotic and it's easy to lose your cursor and even clickables. I think it's just the nature of the artwork. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fantastic artwork and animation\n+The humor is great\n+Most of what is here is fun\n+Price point is great\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-[strike]No Vsync so the gaming rig screams[/strike] Fixed!\n-[strike]Needs options for larger cursor[/strike] Fixed!\n-New mechanics aren't great\n\n[b]Yeah, I mean it's worth three bucks.[/b] Sure. It isn't perfect, but it scratches that itch.","timestamp_created":1535125067,"timestamp_updated":1535642406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.672575175762176514","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1535625944,"developer_response":"Hi everyone!
