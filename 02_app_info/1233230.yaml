    review: '9/10 Early Access Review (14 minutes at time of writing)

      Even with the current build lacking much in real ''gameplay'' I would still
      recommend this for anyone who has looked into finding a good bird flight simulator.
      Its (relatively) low poly world make it a fast running game, even on my lower
      end gaming laptop. (which isn''t really meant for VR). But even if you are playing
      on a higher end computer and are all about that *Detail* don''t let the low
      poly-count dissuade you from getting this, as the vibrant colours make it a
      whole experience on its own.


      This is by far one of the better if not best VR bird games I have tried. Even
      at only 14 minutes of gameplay I found it very easy to get a handle of. The
      weight of your flaps really propel you high into the air, making this a great
      game for just soaring rather than trying to get a workout. Landing took a pass
      or two to get the hand of, but even that wasn''t too hard after a minute of
      attempts.


      There are some minor terrain bugs(as of my playing) but since this is a relatively
      new game that is reasonable to expect. But this minor inconvenience is quite
      insignificant compared to the near professional quality of the rest of what
      the game has to offer.


      Other nitpicks I have is that flapping your wings backwards (back to chest)
      don''t slow you down nearly as much as it seems they should(given how much power
      flapping up and down yields) making stopping from a fast glide to a landing
      somewhat problematic.

      I would hope that there becomes an option to adjust how fast you pitch/roll
      setting in the future as tilting and moving your wings to roll makes you yaw
      more than actually rolling (which I guess for some would be preferred because
      of motion sickness) I find this hinders your ability to preform aerial maneuvers.

      and a slight suggestion would be to increase the max speed for gliding/diving


      All in all this game exceeded my expectations and even in it''s current state
      I would say is still worth the $22.79 CAD that it is priced at. Great work Othercrow,
      I look forward to future updates.'
