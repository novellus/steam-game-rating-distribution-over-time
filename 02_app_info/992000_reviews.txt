The one big \"cut scene\" is overly long and unskippable if you have seen it before.  The whole game comes to a conclusion with the only choice you have in the game.  Truely disappointing.","timestamp_created":1561667315,"timestamp_updated":1561667315,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558750569820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ404SozesCcYu+xAE="}
