    review: "[b]DLC verdict: Don't get it[/b]\n\n[b]Comment:[/b]\nWhile the strategy\
      \ guide for the expansion is cool to have the price they put on it is too high\
      \ (I am looking at 6.99\u20AC at the time of writing). No matter how big or\
      \ useful it is, especially in this day of internet guides. I could tell you\
      \ to get it on sale (there were -90% sales in the past) but on GoG you get this\
      \ for FREE as part of the Epic Edition. As such it seems like a cash grab here\
      \ on Steam so just get it somewhere else if you want it.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
