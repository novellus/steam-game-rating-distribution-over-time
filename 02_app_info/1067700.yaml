    review: "This is indeed early access. Only buy if it's half price or you want\
      \ to play through a very rudimentary Minecraft clone.\n\nIn just 20-30 minutes\
      \ (using a controller):\n\n1) Can't invert the Y-axis view - that makes it almost\
      \ impossible for me to play. \n2) You can't tell what anything is, there are\
      \ no tooltips for things in your inventory and no indication of what you're\
      \ looking at.\n3) Basically I figured out how to dig up the ground but that\
      \ was the only thing I could figure out how to do other than wander around (looking\
      \ up when I meant to look down :) ).\n\nOn a positive note, the graphics are\
      \ nice and this may be the foundation for a good game. But in my opinion, they've\
      \ made it public too soon. If nothing else, they need to provide some rudimentary\
      \ quality of life upgrades ASAP.\n\nI'll revisit the game in a few months and\
      \ hopefully I'll be changing my review when I do!"
