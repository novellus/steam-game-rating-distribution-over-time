Has late 2000's flash game vibes in the best way. Gameplay can get kind of repetitive though. Might want to think of adding a horde mode where you defeat waves of enemies with increasing difficulty. Music choice is really good as well. I like Alex Lisi's stuff a lot. Might want to add some sort of feedback when receiving damage so the player knows when their health is getting low. Felt like my runs ended abruptly a lot when I wasn't paying attention to the health bar and focusing on enemies. Just adding a simple pulse or faint red screen filter would do, or both. Would also love if enemies dropped weapons on occasion. Maybe also add an auto-pickup toggle option for weapons. \n\nOverall, very solid 2D shooter. Look forward to full release and climbing the leaderboard. Number 5 right now :)","timestamp_created":1608537773,"timestamp_updated":1608537773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4vNKUwvYCdJvyuwI="}
