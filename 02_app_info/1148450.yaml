    review: 'Excellent time management game! This changes up the GameHouse formula
      just a little bit. In the first fifty levels, you move between locations as
      it makes sense for the story instead of being confined to one location for ten
      levels at a time. The mini-games are no longer timed which takes a bit of pressure
      off.


      My one criticism is that the final upgrades come at a time when you no longer
      have levels to play, making them useless.


      I am very excited for more Detective Jackie games since this one ends on a HUGE
      cliffhanger!!'
