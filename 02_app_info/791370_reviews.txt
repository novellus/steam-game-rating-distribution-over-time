They are an entirely mechanical RPG experience, and while the fights are fast, the level advancement is leisurely paced. The challenge is how much do you push your luck of advancing? And the game gives some nice areas to explore, such as quest locations and ruins.\n\nTechnically, I played this game on Ubuntu Linux 18.04, with radeon mesa drivers. It has a 11MB install size, and plays without fullscreen mode. Due to a GM2 game engine issue, the original game failed to start for a while, but the developer was extremely patient in forum responses. That ensured that Xploquest 2 went on my wishlist. I have not had any other issues with this sequel.\n\nI hope the developer adds some user-interface features, because it is tricky to get started. While sometimes there is a ? that provides help, most of the UI is not labelled. It would be helpful having a some tutorial pages, from the main menu. Also, it might be interesting to have beastiary information on the monsters, perhaps even to learn their weaknesses.\n\nXploquest is a quick RPG for people looking to do some quick combat and levelling up. It has polished underlying mechanics, despite the shockingly simple graphics. It is not going to be for everybody, but I highly recommend it to people who enjoy board game experiences.\n\n(Update: the last fifth of the game really gets bogged-down, in the pace of gameplay. Each fight becomes a mess of mouseclicks. This later part of the game is an extension from the first Xploquest, and it did not get the same quality play-testing. Too bad, because that part of the game introduces a couple puzzle elements. The fight sequences are just a slog and they are not fun. However, I had 8+ hours of fun gameplay before I got to that later part of the game.)","timestamp_created":1543455187,"timestamp_updated":1549586145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.660566866397857666","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47oOi5egCceH7swE="}
