Maybe story missions. However, I do this kind of thing for a living and can play a similar game at work and get paid for it. It was kind of fun at first, especially with some of the humor. I kinda hoped for something like portal I guess.\n\nI still recommend it, just not for factory workers. :P","timestamp_created":1545040478,"timestamp_updated":1545040478,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540034115314483643","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1545674977,"developer_response":"Thanks Xionwalker for your review.
