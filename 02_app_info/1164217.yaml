    review: I've bought the other assets from this artist and I find them quite good.  However
      this one like dang I don't know what to say, cause I really wanted to make these
      cool Christmas style dungeons here, and the water doesn't look as cool as they
      have it in screen shot 6 of 8.  Like I tried doing something similar to it,
      and even made the river area small like in the picture.  It doesn't look awesome
      like in the screenshots.  Also screenshot 3 of 8, I can't make the bottom of
      the water look all super cool white and blue style.   I mean I have to recommend
      it, because it's def still good, but I mean I don't know I can't get the water
      stages to look super cools like the way the screenshots have them.  Maybe I
      just suck I wouldn't mind admitting that, I don't know it for sure lol.  Maybe
      the developer can help us out on how to understand the tile sets more best.  Anyways
      thumbs up and thanks for the addition to the rpg maker mv assets.  Hope you
      bring your jungle assets also, cause I would like to buy that also.  Cheers!
