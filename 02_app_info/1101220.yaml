    reviews: "\u201CRemember that movie Osmosis Jones?  If you wanted to play that\
      \ game in VR, then Anticorps is exactly what you need. Set inside infected patients\u2019\
      \ bodies, you must destroy pathogens as you protect an antibody developing inside.\
      \ The game mixes strategy with action, and there are 23 different enemies to\
      \ battle as well as a giant boss. Nine game modes are currently offered at launch.\
      \  Fitness Potential Anticorps blends slower strategy gameplay with direct combat.\
      \ You have access to a hammer weapon for beating up enemies that draw near.\
      \ The hammer is also used for deflecting projectiles that are thrown your way\
      \ by the virus. For tougher encounters, a wand device can spray out a healing\
      \ mist. We hope our immune systems aren\u2019t actually this violent in real\

    review: I wish it was easier. I never understood how to play the game. I kept
      running out of water but when I put down the water tower it didn't work. The
      tutorial is completely broken.  I remember having to look up a Youtube video
      of you playing the game to understand more. I would love a easy mode or a mode
      where there's only one supplies your trying to maintain. I enjoyed it. I just
      wish it was more well explained.
