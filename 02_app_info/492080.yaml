    review: 'This is one of the worst scams that I remember, along with Pregnancy.
      At least this has cute art.


      While taking photos of the aurora borealis, you''re kidnapped by an Icelandic
      elf. The game promised before release to talk about Iceland. Probably the writer
      knows nothing about Iceland, or elves, for that matter. Why my elf behaves like
      a Japanese waifu? Why would you write about an elf girl if you want to do a
      generic, trope-ridden story?


      The elf tells you a sob story of how she was bullied for being different, and
      bam, the game is over. You won''t have time to curse the insipid writing. You
      will be ejected to the main screen in no time. This isn''t even a bad experience.
      This isn''t even an experience. It''s over as fast as a car crashing against
      a wall at 150 mph.


      Purin, I change my mind. I''m not amused. Even if it sells for next to nothing,
      that''s because the game offers nothing. For 3-4 euros you can get some good
      deals, on key pages, dealers and even Steam, to grab a game way, way better
      than this fail.'
