It's worth more than that.  So many critics write \"I can't figure it out, sob, the developer won'tr hold my hand...\"  Well, this is a throw back to the golden era where you didn't need instructions to play, but you learn by playing.  It's a dungeon crawl, in a post-apocalyptic theme, with great ambient sound and a lot to figure out as you play.  It's difficult; \"EASY\" is by no means easy, but at least lets you keep your items when you die and restart.  The game is a crawl, and is fun to whittle away the time.   It's likely a mobile game with very little PC polish, but it's fun, and for 63 cents, who can complain.  I like that you need to use your imagination and fill in a back story as you discover scrolls (story notes).  Its an inexpensive amateur game that lets you feel a little bit of wonder.  I could imagine this exact game on the C64 back in the day.","timestamp_created":1609708647,"timestamp_updated":1609708647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527897000312805176","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pZaH5fYCeKuZwAI="}
