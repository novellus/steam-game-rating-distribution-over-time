      \ Whereas today we are used to full-screen video in resolutions of 4K or more,\
      \ the inclusion of \u2018real-life\u2019 filmed content within the context of\

      s corruption by a member of his family. To keep the game fresh over multiple\
      \ plays (with multiple endings, again a mechanic well ahead of its time) the\
      \ family member is chosen at random from those that Reed has gathered together\

      notes: "Voyeur is an interactive murder-mystery/interactive movie, with live\
        \ action cut scenes originally released in the mid-90s. It is a \u2018point\
        \ and click\u2019 political thriller with a mystery for you to solve, with\
        \ mild, non-explicit sexual content, characters in skimpy clothing, adult\
        \ language, and other mature themes. All performers are over the age of 18.\
        \ The player (equipped with a video camera from the vantage point of their\
        \ apartment) peers in on the lives of the Hawke family through the windows\
        \ of Hawke Manor. Experiencing the thrill of the voyeur, the player sits in\
        \ wait, watching and listening, as the family's twisted affairs unfold. Voyeur\
        \ combines the suspense of Hitchcock's \"Rear Window\" with an elaborate cast\
        \ of accomplished Hollywood actors, including Robert Culp, of \"I Spy\" fame\
        \ in the lead role as Reed Hawke, and Grace Zabriskie, known for her role\
        \ in \"Twin Peaks\"."

    review: 'This is a point and click game where you are searching for incriminating
      evidence against a future president and you do this by filming his mansion from
      a neighbor building. You then can pick a window you want to take a closer look
      at with your camera to see some details in the room or view a very bad video
      sequence, which may be of importance. However, the time is ticking and spying
      into one window will cause you to miss, maybe important details of another,
      and missing a sequence in this game will cause another sequence to never appear,
      so it''s really trial and error all the way through.

      If you can pick it up for 2$ and you have time to spare, go for it.'
