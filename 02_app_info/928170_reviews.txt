Ya got a bit of variety for your mechs different weapons you can unlock etc and play with all in all games great. my only complaints are balancing is somehting that needs to be looked into atm it feels like Martinus  who has heavy artilery kills eveerything pretty effecitvly and Warmongers laazer beam skill of death basically just melts anything that gets stuck in front of it. meanwhile poor Cordila and Ventanum are stuck unless they get some better weapons im not aware of yet. so far the Sniper rifle i got today for Cordalia is great damage when its charged but charging  it takes a second to charge up which you can only do when not moving.\n which is bad because you're almost never gonna be standing still for 3 seconds and then wait for the reticle to turn light blue to get a crippling shot. ya do that in a normal match you're asking to get melted by artillery or *ahem warmongers laazer beam gatting wall of death. Ventaum is the most manuverable and helpful with the ability to turn everyone on the team invisible or boost their speed or scan and find all the enemies on the map but the default machine gun is absolute garbage. it asks you to get up close and personal which isn't gonna end well when Warmongers  turret mode will melt you in a instant Martinus will blow you to pieces with rockets, Gregor has a shield and Kara will just stun you and shoot ya in the face with their lighting rifle. and don't get me started on  Ventanium's plazma rifle. sure it does decent damage but the range is absolute ass. you'll need to get up half way to be effective using it  and again as stated before, Martinus=exploded, Gregor=all your damage being blocked and reapeatedly being shot in the face while you have almost no sustainability also you have  the lowest armor, kara=get stunned, annnd Warmonger = \"OH GOD IM MEEEELTTTIINNNGGG AAAAAHHHHH!\" also pew pew pew but your gun does barely any damage No other player is going to be  scared of you or fearful of you unless ya catch them when they are on extremely low hps. But, I digress so far this games pretty fun. Only problem is..ALMOST NOOO ONE KNOWS OF IT. The Devs of this game shot themselves in the foot asking for 18/20$ for this. Ten dollars would be fair enough.  it needs more people though People LIke YOu who are currently reading this. The people who play this game  need more people for game matches..please.. I am sick of playing against bots.. \nYou don't know HOW TERRIBLE IT IS I WANNA FIGHT REAL PEOPLE WHO USE REAL ACTUAL TACTICS AND DON'T GET STUCK IN WALLS LETTING ME DESTROY THEM.*ahem anyways thats what i have to say on it. other notes the Game is in Early access. So that is both a good and bad thing. Good because its new and still has alot of time to grow and get bigger.  bad because it might never get out or grow. I hope more people will try this game out because it could be something amazing.\n\nEdit:  That review from 2017? ignore it this games been discontinued and yet it remains on the steam website. potential it had. but no longer I'm so sick of game devs putting something on steam as a project for class or as a game idea.  but never completing it fuck off with your unfinished games or projects.","timestamp_created":1542845497,"timestamp_updated":1587326319,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501979470252990723","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4ma+ByvECc+/prwE="}
