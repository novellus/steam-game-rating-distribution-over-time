I spent a lot of time talking with the developer and making suggestions to make the game more fun and accurate, but they had no interest in changing anything. I waited to write my review to see if anything would change, but not a single update has been made. I wouldn't pay $5 for this game as it is, let alone the $30 or whatever it was that I actually paid. You can tell a lot of thought was put into the fighting and training algorithms, but nothing in the game is explained and everything else was just an afterthought. It feels like its only about 25% complete, and it doesn't look like any updates are on the horizon.","timestamp_created":1571520037,"timestamp_updated":1579378702,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507609724998474121","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1579513528,"developer_response":"Nevertheless we're glad to see you were absorbed enough to play for 39hrs.
