Technial game.  Look forward to other races and chapters.  Few things I would like to see added.\n1. Needs a map of the stars.  The coordinates x,y,z for each system makes it hard to get places and get back.\n2. Some of the lighting is dark.  Real space is dark but itmakes it hard to find things in the game.\n3. The jump system is a mash of 2D and 3D and sometimes the HUD shows over the jump thingy.\n4. The combat addition is cool but I found it hard to understand the specs on ships and weapons.\nSome of the audio is quieter than others.  Looking for these updates.","timestamp_created":1546464929,"timestamp_updated":1546464929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581957638263702393","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1547054929,"developer_response":"The galaxy map was added recently.
