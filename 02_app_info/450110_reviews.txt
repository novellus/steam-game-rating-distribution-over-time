There is one issue though. You are probably meant to be about 6 feet tall, but the camera placement has you at about 8 feet tall. Though this did not prevent me from completing the game. If you so chose, you can play the game crouched on Vive, putting you at about the right height and most of the time can still sprint, even while crouched. There was one small section, where you're in a low duct filled with water. For that one section, I had to get off my chair and get down on the ground to be low enough to see, but it's not a big section and it's late in the game. As for the game itself it was pretty good. Much longer than many VR horror games. Great atmosphere. Decent puzzles. A little problem with some of the translations, but I enjoyed playing it. Definitely worth the price. Glad I finally got to play it.
