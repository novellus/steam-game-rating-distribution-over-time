It's not without its flaws, but it has good action and platforming, without being too difficult. The powerups are diverse, with only 1 being useless, and there is a good sense of exploration. Length is 5-6 hours. But the map could be better, both the ingame map (show one-way exits and uncollected powerups) and the layout (put powerup barriers at the start of areas rather than the middle, because otherwise you waste time going down a path only to find that you cannot progress further).\n\nA tip for the dev: when deciding whether the player can jump, rather than just checking if the player is on solid ground now, it's better to check 2 or 3 frames in the past (if the player walked off a ledge shortly before, and allow the jump in that case) and future (buffer the jump for 2 or 3 frames if in mid-air, and jump if the player landed in that period). If you don't do that the jumping will feel unresponsive/buggy.","timestamp_created":1609817632,"timestamp_updated":1609817632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0PWm6PYCccfLwAI="}
