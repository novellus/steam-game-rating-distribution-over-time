    review: This is sort of like a cross between marbles and billiards, except instead
      of balls, there are little colored disks. Aim them at other disks for combo
      shots and interesting ricochets. It's laid back and pretty, but can also get
      exciting and challenging. Works great with low end computers and low end wallets.
      The art is lovely and the music relaxing.
