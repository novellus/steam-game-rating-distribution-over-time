    developer_response: 'Sorry to hear you had a bad experience.  We want to make
      this right.  WMR is currently not supported but maybe we can earn your business
      for the non-VR mode.  If you have a moment, let us know about the bugs you encountered.  We''ll
      do our best to earn a good review from you.
