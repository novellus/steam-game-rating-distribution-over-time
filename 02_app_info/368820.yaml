    about_the_game: Last Word is an adventure in pontification, a gallop into the
      realm of gossip, and a really cool game. It's a conversation piece about conversation
      that can be enjoyed to the last drop, like a fine red wine (unless you prefer
      white).<br><br>Experience the intriguing and ear-defying original soundtrack
      to Last Word. It blends piano, strings, horns, and marvelous-ness. The eerie
      tones and continuous themes add to the world of St. Lauden in a special way
      that will have you chattering all night long!<br><br>All tracks are composed
      by Lannie &quot;Merlandese&quot; Neely III and brilliantly mixed/mastered by
