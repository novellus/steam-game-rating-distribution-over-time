It has an interesting overworld system not usually seen in RPGs that allows for some alright puzzles, and the RPG elements, though very standard, are still fun.\n\nThat said, I can't recommend it. I liked it a bit because I like RPGs, but the average player probably will not. The first thing of note is that the gameplay is sort of eclipsed by everything else. The story is okay, if a little confusing and cliche, but a lot of players will probably be put off by the cringeworthy dialogue, terrible art, stolen monster designs, and wholly unnecessary sexual themes. I mean, I get it if you want to play a porn game, but this isn't even a porn game. There's no sex, there's just a developer who inserts his own sexual desires and fantasies into a video game. If you're embarrassed by that one socially awkward weeb kid in high school, this game will make you cringe.\n\nA lot of players will be made uncomfortable enough by all of that they won't be able to enjoy the gameplay, which is why I consider it secondary. If the above doesn't bother you, though, then you'll find a game with alright gameplay. There was clearly not much effort put into design. There are only a few monsters you can fight in each level, but there's no distinction in the way you approach them. You will fight them all the exact same way. The difference is that some are radically easier than others, so once you've learned their patterns, the game basically becomes learning how to only encounter the right enemies so you can repeat the exact same process enough to grind for the boss. The bosses are usually challenging enough that fighting them is actually exciting and pretty fun, but the rest of the gameplay is very samey. Unless you're a hardcore RPG fan, I wouldn't recommend this one.","timestamp_created":1554161634,"timestamp_updated":1554161634,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.465111672878265381","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrZHQ7ekCfI2uvgE="}
