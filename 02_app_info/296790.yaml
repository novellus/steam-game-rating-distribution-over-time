    review: "Ignore people complaining about the controls if you were a Iron Man Stewart\
      \ Super Off Road fan, they are exactly like that. \n\nGame is tons of fun, menus\
      \ are rough and need work, but this is highly recommended to anyone who likes\
      \ the old top down racers, I even like the other views. \n\nWorth the money!"
