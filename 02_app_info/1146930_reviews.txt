A lot of this expansion is built around quality of life additions that are much welcome, and other new additions that feel fun and interesting to use.\n\nWhile the metro network was overhauled in a simultaneous free update, it really shines in this expansion with the addition of numerous hubs that allow you to very seamlessly connect the various intercity services (coaches, trains, airliners) directly with your metro network. The expansion also adds intercity buses, helicopters, and trolleybuses.\n\nSunset Harbor also drastically overhauls waste infrastructure with the addition of the waste transfer and processing facilities, and it adds new options to landlocked cities such as large water towers and inland water treatment plants.\n\nFinally it adds the new fishing industry for coastal cities, and an aviation club complete with small aircraft.\n\nOverall, this expansion is well-recommended; if you had to chose only one DLC to buy for Cities Skylines, it should definitely be Sunset Harbor.","timestamp_created":1609914379,"timestamp_updated":1609914379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r/2X6/YCeZj2wAI="}
