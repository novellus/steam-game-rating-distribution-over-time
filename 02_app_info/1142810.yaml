    about_the_game: '<i>A ball, two goals, and... toasters : <strong>Welcome to Toasterball</strong>.</i><br><br><strong>Toasterball
      is a multiplayer sport game (2-4 players), where you play as toasters.</strong>
      The game is based on physics, and packed with lots of random gameplay variants,
      explosions, and a bunch of toasts for you to burn!<h2 class="bb_tag">How do
      you play?</h2>Hold down one of the buttons on your toaster for a short time...
      release it, and that''s it! Your toast flies through the air! The longer you
      hold the button, the higher your toast will go. Each ejection also makes you
      jump, allowing you to hop around the field in both directions. With only these
      two buttons, you can now move, jump and throw toasts everywhere. From there,
      any means are allowed to put the ball inside your opponent''s goal!<h2 class="bb_tag">Athlete
      toasters</h2>You can already choose from one of the 15 different toasters present
      in the initial line-up of athletes. Each toaster has it''s unique backstory,
      with four colors available and it''s own locker.<h2 class="bb_tag">Random variants</h2>After
      each point, a new random gameplay variants is chosen. There are more than 20
      different variants, including the ones you see in the screenshots of this page
      (ice rink, explosive ball, pong mode, etc.). All of these variants can be played
      with giant and small toasters, with or without toasts: like variants of variants
      (whoa dude).<h2 class="bb_tag">About us</h2>We are Alex &amp; Simon, the Couch
      Game Crafters, and we made this game! It''s our first big release together and
      we''re thrilled to let you try it!<br>We also share all kinds of behind the
      scenes content on social medias, feel free to join us on Twitter or Discord
      to see how we made this game and chat with us :)'
