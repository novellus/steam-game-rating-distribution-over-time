I've had a lot of fun in there and also laughed at some good dialogs. Puzzles are kinda difficulty sometimes but still possible. Except for that one puzzle on the door where you can open the chest: it's impossible to solve. Otherwise it's still a very fun and good game :).","timestamp_created":1609713943,"timestamp_updated":1609713943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nbCb5fYCdpycwAI="}
