    review: "The first \"horror\" experience I tried on my Vive. From the moment I\
      \ started in the room where you choose your locomotion mechanic, I was hooked.\
      \ I've played it a number of times since, and thoroughly enjoyed the feeling\
      \ of the hairs on my neck as it unfolds. I'm running it on a G1-1070 and it\
      \ looks sweet, although the black elements could do with a little work as the\
      \ HMD has a strange grey output in full black which feels like diving through\
      \ barely visible soup\n\nThe only negative is the full locomotion option - it\
      \ took me time to work out how to avoid simulator sickness, making sure to face\
      \ forward whenever moving, and also rocking my head slightly from side to side\
      \ to trick my vestibular system into thinking I am walking - its crude but works,\
      \ and helped me enjoy this game (and other games with full locom) without suffering\
      \ any nausea effects. \n\nThis is a very effective piece of work, and the complimentary\
      \ demo shows great potential for the full experience."
