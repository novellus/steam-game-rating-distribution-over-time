I had this game on my wishlist for a while now, because when the game comes out of early access it sends you an email.  I received this email and immediately purchased it with excitement, because I love this genre.  Upon loading up the game however, I get a giant message says \"we're still in early access\" Only 2 of the planets are available for playing, and there's lots of things that are clearly unpolished.  I'm incredibly annoyed that they would advertise themselves on steam as being a fully released game when they clearly are not.","timestamp_created":1607808794,"timestamp_updated":1607808794,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559158444404602051","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2ee3rPYCeOTPuQI="}
