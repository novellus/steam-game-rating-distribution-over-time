    review: wow this game sucks and its short and broken i beat the whole game in
      10 min if you buy the cheapest character and sell him you get more money then
      you  spent so you can get hundreds of points and makes no challenge there is
      a total on 8 levels thats it this game is really bad i recommend getting rock
      and roll defense i think thats what its called but get that if you are trying
      to get a tower defense game
