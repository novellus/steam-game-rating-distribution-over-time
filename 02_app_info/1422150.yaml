    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Basic Presentation</h2>PP Puncher is a turn-based
      RPG, mostly text-based, about a guy going on a quest to save his waifus, by
      punching his opponents' PP. The game stacks new game mechanics to the fight
      system, as the player progresses into the game.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Story</h2>A
      scientist named Brenn finally managed to make his waifu real, by turning his
      body pillows into real people. Unfortunately, he also published music under
      the name of &quot;Brennfeu Cthulhu&quot;, which made Cthulhu angry. Cthulhu
      then sent Espinoza, a newly created Eldritch God to kidnapp Brenn's waifus.  <br>Brenn
      now has to free all waifus, and confront Espinoza.<h2 class="bb_tag">In-Game</h2>The
      game is a turn-based RPG. As you progress into the game, you unlock new game
      mechanics, making the game slowly more and more complex.<h2 class="bb_tag">Origin
      of the Game</h2>At first, this game was a discord bot, allowing you to play
      duels against other discord users (or the 'A.I.'). We then realized that the
      game had no learning curve, and was too complex for new players to get into.
      We then decided to turn this bot, into a game, with its own story based on the
      lore that was slowly created around the bot.

      notes: "This game's main theme is punching penises, though it has no texture,\
        \ and does not feature anything sexual. If you feel uncomfortable with this,\
        \ I probably would advise you not to play this game.\r\nThis game is not suited\
