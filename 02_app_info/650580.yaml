    review: 'Sorry but this is well before early access. Firstly, when you press to
      move forward you move 2 steps, which is annoying. The stepping issue actually
      effects the gameplay because of the tight spaces the player is in. Some of the
      sounds are just straight up pulled from bioshock, whcih is strange. The door
      opening sound throws you out of the gaming experience and into AIM nostalgia.
      I stopped recording because I ran out of battery and just started stumbling
      around and could not see anything. Ran out of battery at 39% which does not
      seem quite right. In its current state it seems that not only is it not worth
      the money but it will most likely not drastically improve. Seems that the snapshots
      shown were nitpicked and do not give an accurate representation. Getting a refund
      and would not reccomend.


      Edit: And one other thing. The flashlight is so wonkey. It is so small, you
      are able to make it bigger but the second you get close to something the flashlight
      goes away.'
