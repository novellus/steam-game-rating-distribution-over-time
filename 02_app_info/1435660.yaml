    review: "Let's make a twin stick shooter without two sticks lol. If you're playing\
      \ on controller this game really fn sucks, you have to click push in the right\
      \ to shoot and can't remap the controls to say something like right trigger?\
      \ \n\nIt's fine on mouse and keyboard. \n\nGood job making sure all those 10\
      \ year olds get carpal tunnel by the time they're 20. Fix the controller support\
      \ dev.\n\n*and I swear if you reply to this with \"Thanks!\" I'm refunding this\
      \ game."
