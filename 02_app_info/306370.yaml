      \ of Subways&quot;. A feature list to be exited about.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"\
      ><li>Animated display monitors at stations.<br></li><li>Random animated persons\
      \ at stations<br></li><li>Realistic shift service to schedule.<br></li><li>Incident\
      \ options which can happen during shift service.<br></li><li>Intelligent and\
      \ custom announcements<br></li><li>Passenger volume dependend on time if day.<br></li><li>Simulation\
      \ of wear and tear caused by style of operation (can be selected via options)<br></li><li>Extensive\
      \ scoring system, adding to the excitement and fun.<br></li><li>Custom setting\

      \ seen from either inside or outside, controlled by the player<br></li><li>Doors\
      \ can be openend seperately. Options are the doors on the right and left side\
      \ of the train. Of course you can also open both sides at the same time.<br></li><li>Break\
      \ Spark - Spaces in between the live rails can produce break sparks on the current\
      \ collectors which can be seen as lightning flashes and which can also be heard.\
      \ This is best to be seen in a tunnel as the tunnel walls will be lit for a\
      \ split second when this happens.<br></li><li>Train vibration \u2013 as soon\
      \ as the train starts moving, vibrations will take effect on the train.<br></li><li>Train\
      \ swings \u2013 The train will start swinging the higher the speed. You will\
      \ especially get this kind of feel in the cab. Hard braking will also produce\
      \ this effect and the train will still be in a swinging motion when it has come\
      \ to a full stop.<br></li><li>Configurable key commands \u2013 The player can\
      \ freely configure keys to his liking. He can for instance configure the key\
      \ for the brake lever wherever he wants.<br></li><li>3D \u2013 Cockpit with\
      \ rotatable camera \u2013 allowing the player to look around. By using a key\
      \ stroke the view angle will be centered again.<br></li><li>Free movement inside\
      \ the train \u2013 While the train is stationary at a station you will have\
      \ the option to switch to an ego perspective inside the passenger car. You can\
      \ move by using keyboard commands, view angles can be controlled with the mouse.<br></li><li>Free\
      \ movement on the station \u2013 you can get off the train at any station and\
      \ move around (ego perspective). There will also be some missions starting on\
      \ the platform of a station. The player will have to walk into to the train,\
      \ into the cab which is seperated from the passenger area by a door.<br></li><li>Changing\
      \ of cabs at a terminus \u2013 sometimes you will have to change the cabs during\
      \ a mission. You will have to do this at Hoboken at the weekends when shift\
      \ operation is active. The train driver has to leave the cab, the train and\
      \ then walk along the platform to the other end. He then gets into the train\
      \ and cab again to prepare for departure.<br></li><li>Realistic lighting on\
      \ the trains \u2013 Pixel lighting allows a correct display of the amount of\
      \ light. You probably know what it looks like when thinking of a flashlight\
      \ shining agains a wall. Pixel lighting allows the display of such lighting\
      \ effects as can already be seen in some ego shooter games. This effect will\
      \ amaze you when driving at night or through a tunnel.</li></ul><h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Physics</h2><br>The physics have been developed considering the real\
      \ life physics and as used on training simulators. It also contains the vibrating\
      \ of parts of the 3D cockpit and the movement of the carriage in relation to\
      \ its speed and brake power. Another plus in terms of realism is the turning\
      \ angle inside the cab.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/306370/extras/physik.jpg?t=1568893941\"\

    short_description: The World of Subways 1 line is going from New York beneath
      the Hudson-River to Newark. The original route is almost equally split in underground
      and above ground sections. Coming with excellent graphics this simulator also
      puts a lot of emphasis on original physics of the train and wagons.
