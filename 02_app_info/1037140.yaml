    review: 'This game is worth it. A pretty unique mechanic to use a rudimentary
      programming interface to control the most efficient path to mow a lawn. The
      game is challenging enough to get you through the various levels, and quite
      easy to pick up thanks to the interactive tutorial.


      The object is path efficiency and getting the highest score, which is displayed
      through leaderboards. You use a bunch of buttons to program your mower to go
      a certain direction, or to turn the motor on or off.

      The lawn mower with an electrical lead provides a welcome added difficulty where
      you have to think about when to turn on the motor.


      I also think the author is hoping for user generated content with the level
      editor, and a having friend groups competing against each other to beat authors
      of user generated levels. Since the number of levels are a bit lacking, I would
      very much welcome more content made by players.


      If you can see past the programmer graphics, you''ll find Mow Problem a very
      rewarding game.


      Pro''s

      =====

      * Game mechanics are pretty solid, after a few minutes you get what to do (protip:
      use the tape measure).

      * Nice soundtrack.

      * Gradual difficulty.

      * Tutorial blends in with the other levels.

      * Overall fun and relaxing to play.


      Con''s

      =====

      * Text "Biggest rival" pops up way too much.

      * The colouring scheme makes things a bit confusing at first.

      * No "Menu" button or hint text in game for people who haven''t discovered the
      [Esc] button yet (it''s in the top left corner of your keyboard).
