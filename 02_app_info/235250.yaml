    review: "Super Sanctum TD is a fun, clean little TD game. I had a few hours of\
      \ fun with it - the reason I didn't continue is because of the harsh balance\
      \ issues that others have referenced. \n\nI picked it up on sale for $0.99 and\
      \ would recommend it at that price - I definitely got my money's worth even\
      \ if I'm not interested in fully beating the game."
