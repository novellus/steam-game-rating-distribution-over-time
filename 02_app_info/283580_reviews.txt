However there is a peculiar problem reminiscent of Dirt Rally; it only works with 4-core CPU, not more. Also like other reviewers have said, the performance is poor. I had to reduce light and shadow range from the default 65 and 55 to 0 and 0 respectively. When glow and blur effects are also disabled i could get above 100 fps at 720p. However that makes the graphics quality and realism looks really crappy. [b]5/10[/b]\n\nMore details later.\n\n[b]Update 1 - 27th Jul 2019[/b]\nMy bad, it didn't need to run on 4-cores. Disabling SMT is enough. This compatibility fix might be due to the latest Asus BIOS 5007 which incidentally has no option to disable cores.\n\n[b]Addendum to Update 1 - 3rd Aug 2019[/b]\nIncidentally disabling Simultaneous Multi-Thread processing increases performance thereby achieving consistently higher fps. This improvement can be also seen in many other older games  like FF XIII, FF XIII-2 and Ship Simulator Extreme and even in some newer games like The Crew 2, Gravel, Star Wars Battlefront and Doom. In Gravel and The Crew 2 for example, i was able to turn on more graphic options without sacrificing baseline 60 fps. Similarly in this game, i noticed steady 60 fps in the main menu whereas previously it was fluctuating.\n\nSMT seems to be more useful for desktop applications  like a video editor rather than in action games. Maybe in strategy genres like city simulation, base building or 4x games where increasing number of cities or bases requires scaling of multi-tasking operations is where SMT might shine. However disabling SMT prevents the PC from entering sleep mode. Re-enabling it disables hibernate mode; can't win them all i guess.\n\nTherefore based on performance improvement alone, this game deserves at least [b]6/10[/b] IMO. Which means to say, it's definitely playable.\n\n[b]Update 2 - 21st Dec 2020[/b]\nAfter the 1st update, i did not play the game; only saw that it worked and tweaked the performance. During that time i had a nominally functioning RX-470 GPU. I didn't remember what was the last graphics settings, namely light and shadow range. However when i started the game again today, it defaulted to 1600 x 900 (same as desktop resolution) and the light and shadow ranges were at maximum.\n\nHere's the thing; it was amazing! 60 fps steady! So i cranked up the resolution to 1920 x 1080 and it still was amazingly steady at 60 fps! Well this is because now i'm using RX-580 with twice the amount of GDDR5. Alas my elation was shortlived; as soon as i restarted the game at full HD and maxed out light and shadow ranges, the fps drops to below 40 fps. I was shocked! I tried everything, tweaking the CPU cores from 8 down to 4 then down to 2 using both combinations of SMT off or on. Nothing could restore the initial 60 fps that i got with the same GPU and CPU config. So now i'm a little disappointed because i have to settle for light and shadow ranges of 11 instead of the initial setting of 100.\n\nI dunno what went wrong and i'm not too happy about it. Certainly it isn't the RX-580 as it wasn't even overheating and it wasn't even at half power; it was running at less than 40W even in full HD. As this is only at the main menu, not even in the game yet so maybe in-game it might eat more power. Still i dun understand why the performance drop after a restart.\n\nWhile this doesn't change my recommendation to No, it does weaken it somewhat. I'll see what further things i can do to restore it back to 60 fps at max range but i'm not too hopeful about it.\n\n[b]Update 2a - 22nd Dec 2020[/b]\nMy bad, i understand now. The main menu background scene cycles between night and day. In the daytime, light ranges makes no difference to fps but at night it takes a huge performance hit.","timestamp_created":1559595603,"timestamp_updated":1608592854,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv+Hmw/YCf8bYwgE="}
