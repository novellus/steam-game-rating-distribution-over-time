    about_the_game: 'The Bleeding Hollow is a survival-horror themed sandbox style
      adventure for the Pathfinder RPG by Paizo. It is converted for Fantasy Grounds
      from over 100 pages of adrenaline pumping excitement for up to 6 players of
      4th to 6th levels.<br />

      <br />

      In this adventure, the players are drawn to the small wilderness town of Westden
      Falls to clear the surrounding environs of a particularly nasty group of harpies.
      Of course, nothing is as easy as it looks and the players soon find themselves
      embroiled in a plot between two ancient enemies.<br />

      <br />

      Everyone becomes collateral damage, and the players must use every ounce of
      wit, survival instinct and tactics they possess to simply survive -- let alone
      helping those in need... This is not an adventure for the faint of heart, or
      the foolishly good. Hard moral choices will have to be made that will make your
      players sweat.<br />

      <br />

      The adventure is written to follow the players, and not lead them. The choices
      they make will have great significance and possibly repercussions as the events
      unfold and the clock ticks down... Truly this is a fantastic sandbox style adventure.<br
      />

      <br />

      The adventure is designed to scale for parties with more or less players, and
      even higher levels. Everything you need to run the game is at your fingertips.<br
      />

      <br />

      The stunningly foreboding cover art is by Michael Fall. Our gruesome and frightening
      interior artwork is by Jason Lenox, the illustrator of ''Through the Eyes of
      Grizelda'' and the upcoming gamer fan film ''Zero Charisma.''<br />
