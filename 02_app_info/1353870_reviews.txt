This isn't helped by the issues with the upgrade system. Some of the upgrades don't seem to work quite right, and you lose them as soon as you die anyway. Overall, this feels like a jam game. \n\nThis would be inoffensive if it were hanging around on itch, but to charge money for it is more than a little arrogant.","timestamp_created":1599230894,"timestamp_updated":1599230894,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596170425415039063","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+9vlrPQCeoPfnwI="}
