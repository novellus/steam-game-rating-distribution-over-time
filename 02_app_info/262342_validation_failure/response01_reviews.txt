A Realm Reborn is a triumph for Naoki Yoshida and his team. \nThis time it makes it right, and shows love to the franchise, even though some players might not like the online experience. So far, they've done a great job bringing back Eorzea, and we really hope they continue to fight to keep it alive. \nWhat you will find is the most mechanically broad, content dense, and goddamned gorgeous MMO ever made. If you’ve enjoyed any MMO of the past decade, there’s something in Realm Reborn for you. And if you’ve enjoyed them all? Well… just remember to take a shower once in a while.","timestamp_created":1392858975,"timestamp_updated":1392858975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":441,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.761636078357696533","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sam3psQCdumFIw=="}
