That doesn't matter at all, of course, as the core gameplay is fun and challenging enough to justify itself a place in the library.”<br>NA – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.thedreamcastjunkyard.co.uk\/2020\/11\/flea-brand-new-release-for-dreamcast.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Dreamcast Junkyard<\/a><br><br>“Flea is a stunningly good independent game with a unique mechanic that is bound to make the retrogamer in us all smile and laugh our heads off whilst keeping the difficulty curve to make this game good for speed running. In my opinion, this game is good and addictive enough to be the next Super Meat Boy, and is also family friendly enough that both the dad and the kids in the family will want to play it. Also, it’s been the most fun I’ve had in reviewing a game for ages.”<br>NA – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/xblgamerhub.com\/flea-the-review\/?fbclid=IwAR1BhcKXMIuD-WCg-_ef3od_r5mLmeFV1LO-PSoQeNXZPt_BrBQxQCpe2LQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GamerHub<\/a><br><br>“In short, Flea! is a great example that many systems that some believe are obsolete have a lot to give, since in this case it has been possible to adapt a genre that is very dynamic and demanding such as precision platforms in a very well achieved and polished way, resulting in a very pleasant experience that leaves a good taste in the mouth.”<br>NA – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/retroorama.blogspot.com\/2020\/11\/indie-review-flea.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Retro -o- Rama<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1346330\/header.jpg?t=1605821421","website":null,"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> na<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 2 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> na<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 200 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"Copyright Lowtek Games 2020","developers":["Alastair Low"],"publishers":["Lowtek Games"],"price_overview":{"currency":"USD","initial":999,"final":999,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"$9.99"},"packages":[470791],"package_groups":[{"name":"default","title":"Buy Flea!","description":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","save_text":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","subs":[{"packageid":470791,"percent_savings_text":" ","percent_savings":0,"option_text":"Flea - $9.99","option_description":"","can_get_free_license":"0","is_free_license":false,"price_in_cents_with_discount":999}]}],"platforms":{"windows":true,"mac":false,"linux":false},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":18,"description":"Partial Controller Support"}],"genres":[{"id":"1","description":"Action"},{"id":"25","description":"Adventure"},{"id":"23","description":"Indie"}],"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1346330\/ss_ab9facf132af3f3cb83da7321526b60fc3c61944.600x338.jpg?t=1605821421","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1346330\/ss_ab9facf132af3f3cb83da7321526b60fc3c61944.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605821421"},{"id":1,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1346330\/ss_d54d92cb3b646065dbb379e39f6541a6da46d56e.600x338.jpg?t=1605821421","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1346330\/ss_d54d92cb3b646065dbb379e39f6541a6da46d56e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605821421"},{"id":2,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1346330\/ss_b068dfb2c0200d15baceda759c9ee9d9d893997c.600x338.jpg?t=1605821421","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1346330\/ss_b068dfb2c0200d15baceda759c9ee9d9d893997c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605821421"},{"id":3,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1346330\/ss_56c7fbe729d04ee739714a492a56e0a023f53e15.600x338.jpg?t=1605821421","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1346330\/ss_56c7fbe729d04ee739714a492a56e0a023f53e15.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605821421"},{"id":4,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1346330\/ss_6dd64082f5356066946c210f4ef66d6979fd874b.600x338.jpg?t=1605821421","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1346330\/ss_6dd64082f5356066946c210f4ef66d6979fd874b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605821421"},{"id":5,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1346330\/ss_6dce9acb7e4ff5931fff90d8bf726d9351c77ef0.600x338.jpg?t=1605821421","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1346330\/ss_6dce9acb7e4ff5931fff90d8bf726d9351c77ef0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605821421"}],"movies":[{"id":256800830,"name":"Flea Trailer 1","thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256800830\/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1600758875","webm":{"480":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256800830\/movie480_vp9.webm?t=1600758875","max":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256800830\/movie_max_vp9.webm?t=1600758875"},"mp4":{"480":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256800830\/movie480.mp4?t=1600758875","max":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256800830\/movie_max.mp4?t=1600758875"},"highlight":true}],"release_date":{"coming_soon":false,"date":"Oct 29, 2020"},"support_info":{"url":"","email":"info@lowtek.co.uk"},"background":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1346330\/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1605821421","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null}}}}
