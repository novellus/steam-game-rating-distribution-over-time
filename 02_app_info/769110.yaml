    about_the_game: "It\u2019s time to attack! The barbarians are invading different\
      \ parts of the world, and it\u2019s up to you to stop them. Leave no one alive.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nBarbarian Souls drew inspiration from the combat system of\
      \ Dark Souls. To survive, you must fight, defend yourself, or avoid enemy blows.\
      \ You are armed only with your sword (to beat your enemies) and your shield\
      \ (to block attacks). Be careful not to get injured too badly\u2014you don't\

      \ you must fight to survive, defend or avoid enemy blows and attack at the right\
      \ time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this game, you must defend and evade to be able\
      \ to successfully complete your missions. If you don't use your shield to defend\
      \ OR your legs to avoid enemy attacks, you will be no match for your enemies.<br\
