    review: 'Yeah, it''s good and definitely has great potential.

      I saw almost no difference between bhopping in Fragsurf and other Source games,
      it is definitely worth the money if you are into bhopping, surfing etc.

      This is the kind of game i''m willing to invest in.


      I only wish we had the ability to create local (LAN) servers, offline games
      (no network) and had the ability to mess around with tickrate.

      Backwards bhopping isn''t a thing yet, but i have faith in the devs, this game
      is of a gold value yet it''s dirt-cheap, which is definitely a healthy practice.'
