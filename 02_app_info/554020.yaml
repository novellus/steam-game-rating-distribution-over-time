    short_description: The Sailor Guardians go to the Dream Land amusement park, where
      visitors have reportedly gone missing. The team splits into two groups with
      Rei pairing up with Usagi. But much to Rei's frustration, Usagi is more focused
      on playing than finding the missing people.
