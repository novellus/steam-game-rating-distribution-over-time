In other words, regardless of how you plan to hit the notes, play this game in Punch Mode (which I played using slash motions with no issues, getting SS ranks and all that jazz).\n\nMost of the songs are not available initially and get unlocked by playing the game.\n\nThe majority of the music is J-Pop and J-Rock, and about half of the songs are Vocaloid based.\n\nThere's a good amount of visual variety. All songs take place on a stage setting that features flashy equalizers and lighting effects. The style of notes switches between solid colors and notes with lyrics written on them, which feature several different fonts depending on the song. There are also flame effects that trigger from time to time in certain songs, and some of the songs feature live action or animated music videos; the ones that don't feature a video have an art image on the main screen; the song lyrics running across the bottom in both cases.\n\nAll songs appear to have only one note chart, although you can change the speed at which the notes approach to four different speed settings. Personally, I'd recommend leaving the approach speed at Normal. The charts are not insanely difficult, but people looking for a serious challenge may be left wanting more, and people who struggle with rhythm games may find themselves getting frustrated (especially since this game takes cues from Vocaloid games, in that parts of the lyrics and audio cut out when the player is missing notes). In short, the difficulty is average.\n\nOne thing that's kind of lost in translation is what appears to be the karaoke element of this game. Tying into the reason there's only one note chart per song, the lyrics appear on the notes as they approach and go along with the melody, written in kanji/hiragana/katakana (the lyrics also being displayed on the screen in the back). Notes that are based on musical melody rather than the lyrics are solid-colored stars. I feel like if the developers added a romaji option some people might like that, so it would still be possible to sing along if you're not familiar with written Japanese; I suppose this might be a decent tool to practice speedy recognition of the characters if you're studying these alphabets.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a casual flashy rhythm game and enjoy Japanese music, this is an easy recommendation.","timestamp_created":1551647668,"timestamp_updated":1551647709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49KLaoukCfuSdvAE="}
