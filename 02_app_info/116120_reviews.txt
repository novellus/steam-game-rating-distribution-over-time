It's essentially the arcade game Qix. If you haven't played the original, you've likely played a port or flash game clone with similar gameplay before. What differentiates this one is that is has a lot of polish, and new gameplay mechanics to keep it interesting.\n\nAt the same time, I don't know if the price-point is for everybody. If you're really into arcadey games, it's probably worth 5 dollars, otherwise, wait for a sale. It frequently goes on sale for $0.99, even outside of the big Steam sale periods.","timestamp_created":1607208263,"timestamp_updated":1607208263,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523593485355377197","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41fvEmvYCf+fOtwI="}
