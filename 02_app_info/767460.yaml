    review: "Thirty minutes in, and I feel I can already write a review on this one.\n\
      Basic bare-bones TD game. It seems to work, with a few odd bugs (For example,\
      \ I have never gotten a score, even though I have beaten quite a few levels)\
      \ and from the look of it, no support. \nTo be fair, I am not returning this\
      \ game, and expect to play it thru to the end, TD games are too few and far\
      \ between.\nThat said, the look is nice, mimicking the vector graphics of some\
      \ arcade games from the eighties.  (Battle Zone comes to mind, easy to imagine\
      \ them being in the same universe.)  The techo-music is pretty cool as well.\n\
      There is pathing, though so far the options are pretty basic. There are flying\
      \ units, and I guess there will be cloaked ones as well, as there is a tower\
      \ that reveals them. \nOne interesting idea is that the blocks you use for pathing,\
      \ which are often simply cheap and do nothing, can be upgraded to do a few things,\
      \ see cloaked, zone of slow, zone of buffing other towers and one other that\
      \ slips my mind. \nTower upgrades are lackluster, up a time or two with no options\
      \ or choices. You don't get the option to decide how the towers targets the\
      \ enemies, none of the bells and whistles that should be standard by now. \n\
      That said, I am enjoying it, can't give it a thumbs down. Get it on sale if\
      \ you can, but worth a play."
