This 3D twist to the original game only improves the experience, and dramatically so. I'm not sure I can express how much I have enjoyed playing this game in only one review. It is very well executed, and has little to no bugs. In my experience playing, I have only encountered one bug, in which in extreme cubes, there is a chance that, in the 3D view, there are blocks that display both a ONE and a ZERO. Developers, for more information on this, feel free to email me at gusbres@gmail.com.\n\nThere are a couple improvements I would make to the game. First, I would increase customizability of the cube. There ARE 4 existing modes: Easy, Medium, Hard and Extreme, however, the cube can only be increased to a certain size, and there can only be between 5% and 20% mines throughout all 4 modes. One thing I would love to see is a time trials kind of setup, or even a battle mode, in which you could compete against friends, where 2 or more players are given the same cube, and it is a race to find all the mines. I think this game has so much potential, and I would love to see it grow. \n\n4.75 / 5.","timestamp_created":1595806788,"timestamp_updated":1595806788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmuXfxvMCcdvflwI="}
