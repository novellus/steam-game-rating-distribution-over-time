You get to see the best of each time period from the old times all the way up to the future.  Each vehicle and upgrades have its own benefits.  Interacting with the different environments is also fun and also unpredictable.  Do not see all of that in your typical video game.\n\nBut wait a moment here... WHATS ALL THIS? FLYING AND FLOATING CARS!?  within a decade the human race turns into some sort of unrealistic fantasy world, nor do they contribute many benefits over others.  ITS NOT TO LATE TO REMOVE THEM! UGH.  People in a few years from now is going to look back at this and die of laughter\n\nThis game has so much potential but it is in need of new content.  Small details like this can add to a already incredible game, if no one is going to say it then I will.  Additional improvements can be to add buildings that only appear in certain time periods.  For a example, in the future have futuristic buildings, in the past have past.  Second be to have different day and night time instead of it being nothing than daytime most of the time.  Finally all of the other citizens who appear in the background all are identical and have no traits specific to them and when you enter a vehicle you actually become them no one else exits.\n\nI hope the developers do not give up on this project and is well worth the price.","timestamp_created":1607799328,"timestamp_updated":1609254921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4sqzE1/YCcbfKuQI="}
