The game has mixed reception, understandably, it's not ground breaking or doesn't tell the most compelling story, but the 3d platforming and combat are excellent imo. The main character is very likable too, I think. Worth a buy if it's on sale.","timestamp_created":1609722310,"timestamp_updated":1610042176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoL7/7vYCcZKgwAI="}
