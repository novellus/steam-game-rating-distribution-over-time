It's broken down into intro drills (per key groupings), practice sessions and test. It gets the job done. What is sadly missing is the typing games from the version I had from 20 years ago. I remember enjoying them way back then.\n\nThere is nothing exciting about this, unless you enjoy grinding through the work and watching your speed and accuracy increase or drop. As someone who's typed most of my life (and I'm one of those Gen Xer's who took typing in high school with a manual typewriter) there is a good progression of groupings, sentences and paragraphs for each key grouping you will be working on.\n\nIf you do the work you will get faster. I've put in a few hours and I was able to bring back some speed and accuracy to my typing. My kids (who have to have higher scores each day to get access to playing fun stuff on Steam) have been improving. So the software gets the job done.","timestamp_created":1588681062,"timestamp_updated":1588681062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw56ax8vECfNTdhQI="}
