I like the completely destructible environments. I like the ability to quicksave in the middle of a fight to force the rng in my favor. I like that if I want, i can hang out near the very first town and max out my ship and a lot of my stats just by scavenging for resources in the islands nearby and/or stealing enemy ships and selling them for parts.\n\nI love games where I can be level 30 levels ahead before I do the first mission and feel like I'm on top of the world.\n\nI like how there are many boards out on the internet with passionate people like me that can tell me where important things are.\n\nThe reason why this game has mixed reviews, in my opinion, is not the game or the gameplay, but that it has a few bugs and the developer has decided to stop updating the game.\n\nThe biggest problem in my experience is that sometimes the game will crash when going from one zone/square/island to another. It seems to be at random, but when the only autosaves are changing of zones, you just spent half an hour grinding [spoiler] meteors for heartstone [/spoiler] or whatever other resource, it is disheartening to see all that go to waste when you try to leave, the game crashes, and your last save is the autosave of you entering the area. It happened to me only every couple of hours and, on my first couple playthroughs, I never encountered the problem.\n\nThe second biggest problem is when I try to go to one of the end-game areas before I'm supposed to know about it... but that's more on me, I guess.\n\nCan this problem mostly be solved by doing regular quicksaves? Yes. But it can still be annoying to know that you need to save before leaving somewhere when the game shouldn't force you to mistrust it.\n\nI still do recommend this game because the problems I have found have only caused major problems when I haven't saved recently and I do very much enjoy his game. I don't know if the bugs will ever be fixed, but I do hope so.\n\nIf you're willing to save after major works and don't mind rebooting the game every couple of hours (or however long it is), get the game.","timestamp_created":1609132412,"timestamp_updated":1609132412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxoHx0/YCfcX/vQI="}
