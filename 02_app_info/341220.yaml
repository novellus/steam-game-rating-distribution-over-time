    review: The lab feature where you make new creatures is quite limited. You get
      a few models from the game, such as humans or elves, and build your new monster
      around them. Many models, such as dragons and demons, aren't available. You
      can't import JPGs as creatures. Even though I liked the base game, this probably
      should've been released as a free update rather than separate premium content.
