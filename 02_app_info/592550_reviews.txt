The citizens have needs, as does the city (not the least of which is liquidity (pun intended).   You begin with a 'hub', and are required to balance the various aspects of your 'stead as you grow it towards passing the mission goals (or just making a humungous seaborne metropolis). \n\nThe game allows a sandbox mode where everything's unlocked, and you can just freely build your city, or campaign mode where you get 'missions' to achieve goals.   I think there are only about 15 campaign missions, and I've finished the first three, which are relatively easy once you understand the game mechanics.\n\nAs you can see from the graphics, the game focusses less on being pretty with lots of animations and stuff, and primarily on the economic aspects.  In this regard, Seasteader strikes a nice balance between clarity and functionality.  You won't get all the amazing effects of Anno2050, or the huge array of building types of Tropico, but all the basic building types are there:  Production chains, housing, entertainment, city upkeep, etc.   What you will get is a game which provides you the ability to build a city much the same as any other CitySim, but which allows to really tweak the economic and employment aspects which most other games won't.   This can be by price gouging for exports, making your citizens live in slums and pay huge rent, or forcing them to work every hour god sends...\n\nFor me, one of the interesting aspects is building a new building, and then sourcing the right people to 'staff' it.   You'll get an influx of immigrants, all of whom have their own skills.  You can rob the mediocre fishermen to staff your glassworks, but that'll impact your fishing quotas.. You may, later, choose to move them back, to continue their fishermen training as you don't need so much glassware...   Proper tweaking like this isn't needed in the first few levels, but I can see it coming into its own later. \n\n\nThe game is 'complete', insofar as it's not \"early access\".  However it's clear that there's a LOT of spare space in the UI and dropdowns for more options.  Some buildings only make one resource type, but are flexibly built to support more.  So what you see in the images above is a fraction of what's available, and only gives a wee flavour of the game itself.\n\nBecause it's an indie game, it can be a little 'raw'.  Like I said, don't expect the polish of a AAA game... There are some aspects you're just expected to play with yourself.   If you like just tweaking sliders to see what happens, then you'll enjoy this.  Some of the impact of changes to a few variables aren't laid out in simple terms, so you have to tweak them and see what happens.  Sometimes the effects aren't obvious for a while.\n\nHaving a team of \"0%\" skill level glassblowers will still produce you some glassware, whereas in real life they'd just suck up cash while they trained, and then you'd get a slowly increasing yield.. I think that realism needs to be tempered a bit with these things, so has taken a back-seat to allow clarity and simplicity to prevail.\n\nI'm giving it a 75% thumbs up:  It does need a little work to be more accessible to the general gamer, and a little tweaking.  There are a few unusual design choices which can give the learning curve a slightly steeper slope than you'd expect, but it's a solid core with some interesting challenge.\n\nUPDATE(Dec 2019) Unfortunately the game has been abandoned by the developer due to some very negative personal remarks by players.  Sadly, the game was released at full price while still under development, and a lot of people took exception to the issues still present, and the general indie-feel to the game, expecting something more polished.  It's a real shame because there are many different resource types, and the focus of the game is on people, rather than buildings, which is nice.\n\nUnfortunately, because the game has been abandoned, the later levels aren't quite as balanced as they need to be.    If the game is on sale for under a fiver it'd be worth it just to experiment with the economy, but at the moment it's still over Â£10.   If the developer ever comes back and implements all the features on the original roadmap, this'd be a fab game.","timestamp_created":1488105186,"timestamp_updated":1574643640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593440890312194824","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7OSE0O4Cep6Wcw=="}
