(the flash version, not the steam version)\nI just love the ambiance and the music is very good!\nEvery time you go down it is the question of will I be back before my fuel runs out? Every dive is a hunt for riches that you don't want to interrupt to get fuel, but you have to. And in time as well because else your haul will be lost forever!\nUpgrading this makes it easier to get huge hauls. Content wise I think the price is a bit steep but the game is very fun to play nontheless.","timestamp_created":1608621342,"timestamp_updated":1608621342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw07fTxPYCfvmOvAI="}
