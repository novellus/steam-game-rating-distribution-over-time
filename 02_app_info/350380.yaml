    review: "Too bad...  This is probably my favorite BOOK of all time.  The movie\
      \ was ok but poor casting and pacing made it underwhelming.  The book is just\
      \ a different animal - its a light hearted techno thriller vs the action movie\
      \ Hollywood tried to produce.  And this \"experience\"  is nothing but a 10\
      \ minute advertisement / summary of the movie.  Basically its a handful of key\
      \ moments of the story with 2D clips and 4 (give or take based on definition\
      \ of game) interactive mini games in between.   \n\nThat being said, you feel\
      \ mostly disappointed because of the potential this could have had.  The visuals\
      \ clearly had some effort go into them and, for a few seconds (literally), in\
      \ a few key spots it actually does enhance the overall book if you are a fan.\
      \  The opening walking to the door is neat, first mini game (sorting) is terrible\
      \ but the room itself was well done, crane mini game was ok, driving was actually\
      \ kind of fun, ship thing was ok and the space part was pretty fun.  All very\
      \ restricted and all very, very short.  But the designing of the rooms / environments\
      \ were good enough that i just wondered why bother when they really did nothing\
      \ with it.\n\nI typically don't mind spending a few dollars even if its for\
      \ a short experience but solely because i felt this was nothing more than an\
      \ advertisement for the movie i am refunding since i already paid for the movie.\
      \  They could take out the cut scenes and add a Steam Home environment size\
      \ camp with access to the different mini games (and even logs) and a few basic\
      \ things to explore and then i would have kept it as a short \"The Martian Experience\"\
      .  But in its current form..."
