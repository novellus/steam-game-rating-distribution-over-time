    review: '[h1]Don''t buy this, reasons below[/h1]


      [b]Summary:[/b]


      Some Australian dude attempts to communicate that tripping on vine fluid containing
      sizable amounts of DMT is a meaningful spiritual journey brought onto him by
      Mother nature. He does this, not with a movie, but an audio book with fractal
      animations and random shots of trees with limited speculation from other people
      who drink this stuff. Actual footage is scarce.


      [b]Talking Points:[/b]


      - The plant metaphorically puts you back into Mother Nature''s green womb.

      - The plant makes you see things.

      - The plant makes you sh*t and vomit.

      - "Spiritual" experiences

      - "Cosmic" visions and spirits

      - The Spanish invasion of the Incan Empire is interpreted as a breaking of celesital
      connections that should be restored.


      [b]Verdict:[/b]


      Last time I checked, documentaries were supposed to show, not just tell. This
      is simply an overblown personal experience with no journalistic intent. The
      scope is so small it''s superficial. Even people who are interested in the subject
      hate this, and will direct you to other sources on this topic. Stay far away
      from this 89 minute blog post. It was hilarious to see him exaggerate his DMT
      trips.
