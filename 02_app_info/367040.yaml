    review: "[h1]Respect.[/h1]\n\n\"InsanZ - \"Retro\" \"Survival\" \"Horror\"\" clearly\
      \ deserves the Game Of the Year Award it never got... \n\nNo, this is not a\
      \ good a game. In fact, it's the worst game ever and my words are wisely chosen.\
      \ It's really bad. Like really, really, really bad, just worse. The developers\
      \ failed at everything they coud poissibly have failed at and that's already\
      \ understatement. \nThe point of my review is: I would need to invent a bunch\
      \ of new words to review this \"game\", as none of the languages that currently\
      \ exist on this planet offers a phrase which could even closely be an appropriate\
      \ expression for the low quality of this waste and I am still polite calling\
      \ this software-trash \"waste\". \nAs I said, to the fact that I am limited\
      \ to nothing more than the human ability to paraphrase abstract conditions such\
      \ as for example the unimaginable amount of bad properties of InsanZ, what I\
      \ say as a nice and optimistic reviewer trying to see the best in every situation,\
      \ there is no chance I could ever be able to tell you how bad that game is.\
      \ \n\nI am honestly quite surprised that what I just said is a thing I would\
      \ ever need to say. This game impressed me in a way no other did and no other\
      \ will ever do. If the lack of anything possitive to say about it hadn't forced\
      \ me to give up, I would still be fascinated by exactly these things mentioned.\
      \ And that is honestly quite amazing. That's why this \"game\" needs to receive\
      \ a thumb up... \n\nInsanZ is so bad that it's almost becoming good again, but\
      \ it differs from all the other bad games by being even worse than the worst\
      \ games ever. \n\nLet me try something different to give this review a point...\n\
      \nI am pretty sure [strike]that it's more enjoyable to have a full minute slide\
      \ down a gigantic cheese grater leading into an acid bath while being naked\
      \ with your body lit on fire having your head stuck in an upside-down toilet\
      \ bowl stuffed to the top with one week old human excrementory than to play\
      \ this game[/strike] anyone would still refund InsanZ with the reason of beeing\
      \ disappointed how bad it is to play if you got the price that was to pay added\
      \ to your steam-wallet instead. During sale it was available for 2,19 $$, which\
      \ is quite a bad joke by the developers, who are at least kind enough to add\
      \ the DLCs for free when you purchase the \"Game of The Year (Edition)\" which\
      \ is a bad joke as well. \n\nThese DLCs don't even change anything, one doesn't\
      \ even have any files contained until you re-install them manually from your\
      \ file browser, but well, at least they were free.\n\nIf you want to hear anything\
      \ about the \"game\" itself, don't even bother. InsanZ offers nothing the store\
      \ oage tells you, instead you will be punished with the worst designed game\
      \ world ever, where no corridor can be determined as one. You will also get\
      \ to see the ugliest copy-pasted textures ever, get to hear the most cancerous\
      \ in-game \"soundeffects\" ever and you will witness the most random deaths\
      \ in any video-game, ever. Well, there's more... Useless doors, sceletons with\
      \ cakes as heads sitting on toilets, bugs without an ending, spelling mistakes,\
      \ a \"game\" where the frame glitch during the broken eternal loading screen\
      \ is the most entertaining feature and there is a glorious License Agreement\
      \ where the developers proudly confess to have used the worst free game creation\
      \ sotware they could possibly have used...\n\nNow please forget that InsanZ\
      \ exists.\n\n[b]You have been warned![/b]"
