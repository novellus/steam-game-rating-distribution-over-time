To my surprise, it was thoroughly enjoyable. Not like, 'great', but more than what you could expect from a game with this price. The story is entertaining, though a bit weak. The many different paths that one can take is one of the strengths of this visual novel.","timestamp_created":1571510256,"timestamp_updated":1571510256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmPDT8u0Cevaw1AE="}
