I originally purchased the game when it was still in beta on the iphone after first trying and enjoying the developers previous mobile game \"Rico\", I believe. The release of Nub's Adventure on Steam pleasantly caught me by surprise offering me another change to experience this wonderful game on a larger screen and with achievements too. The game may start off slow and if your not paying attention you can loose track of where to go, but if you give this game the chance it deserves you will be rewarded with a truly unique and beautiful experience.","timestamp_created":1587272135,"timestamp_updated":1587272135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ldayyPECeuzxgQI="}
