    about_the_game: 'Hailey is a casual, Traditional Japanese themed puzzle game.
      The goal is simple: place all tiles onto the board while still adhering to the
      laws of game. Each tile has a letter with a corresponding value. All tiles must
      be touching no more and no less than its value''s amount of other tiles. Combined
      with the law that all tiles must be connected, it makes for a unique and surprisingly
      difficult puzzle experience. Hailey includes 10, expertly designed, increasingly
      difficult levels. Somehow you managed to complete all of the levels? That''s
      OK, because there''s a custom level editor for endless hours of even more serene,
      blissful puzzle solving. You can even share it with your friends! I can''t wait
      to see what interesting combinations you create.'

    short_description: Hailey is a casual, Traditional Japanese themed puzzle game.
      The goal is to place all tiles onto the board while still adhering to the laws
      of game. Sounds simple, and it is, but the potential of depth that these mechanics
      allow is infinite.

    review: This game changed my life. Working long hours, bored out of my mind, all
      that is on my mind is coming home to play Hailey for countless hours. Slowly
      passing my endless hours of life, dragging the four most amazing letters onto
      a chess board an connecting them based on an unparalleled strategy that without
      the right attitude can induce raging anger. But if you blast the soothing Zen
      music your heartrate will slow and you will be back to the calm state that freezes
      time allowing you to play for hours on end. 10/10 - an amazing game with true
      originality.
