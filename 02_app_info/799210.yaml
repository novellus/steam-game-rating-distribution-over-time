    developer_response: 'Hallo rickgodsey, thank you for the feedback. We are re-working
      all the stages and adding a few more to better guide players and to clarify
      the systems behind the game.


      Our latest update we re-worked the animation system. I believe the 3d immersion
      is better now.  Please do not hesitate to make any suggestions as I want to
      improve player experience.'

    review: The story line is strange the play system is similar to chess and checkers.
      hard to get used to.I just bought the game and i am having buyers remorse instantly.
      I was fooled by the screen shots and video of game play. The game looks good  but
      when played it is  a  HUGE ! disapointment.
