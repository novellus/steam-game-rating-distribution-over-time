      Peggle Extreme delivers fast-paced puzzle action that combines elements of pinball\

      \ ricocheting off orange and blue &quot;pegs&quot;. The goal is to clear all\
      \ the orange pegs from the screen before running out of balls. A moving &quot;bucket&quot;\
      \ at the bottom of the screen offers free balls, while green power-up and purple\
      \ &quot;bonus multiplier&quot; pegs provide additional twists. Peggle Extreme\
      \ features one power-up in the form of Bjorn the Unicorn, whose special takes\
      \ the form of a &quot;super-guide&quot; sighting capability which enables players\
      \ to see where there next shot will go beyond one or two initial bounces.<br>\t\

    review: "Peggle Extreme pode ser considerado como uma demo de Peggle Deluxe. Por\xE9\
      m, ao inv\xE9s de apenas ser um conjunto de fases do jogo principal, esse jogo\
      \ mistura o universo de Peggle com o dos jogos da Valve. Assim que come\xE7\
      a o jogo, voc\xEA j\xE1 v\xEA um headcrab preso no rosto de Bjorn, o unic\xF3\
      rnio, te introduzindo ao humor do jogo na hora. Esse jogo fez eu comprar o Peggle\
      \ Deluxe completo pois me viciou completamente. Sendo gratuito, recomendo a\
      \ todos."
