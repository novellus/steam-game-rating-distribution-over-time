    review: 'Pros:

      - Decent graphics.

      - It offers some fun.

      - A bunch of weapons to try.


      Cons:

      - You start with a very low speed until you buy better parts.

      - Movement is kind of weird, like the collision isn''t perfect.

      - Most weapons are kind of useless.

      - Some bosses towards the end of the game take years to kill.

      - It has some bugs like not ending the level after defeating the boss, so I
      had to restart the level.

      - Bad visual effects. They feel too static.


      The game had potential but towards the end it''s not very good because of the
      problems. With more polish it could have been much much better.


      I also would have liked to see new unlockable weapons near the end of the game,
      because most weapons are weak to use against the last bosses.


      I give it a 5/10.


      By the way, I''ve beaten the game twice.'
