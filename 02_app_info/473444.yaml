    about_the_game: This scoped device launches a human-shaped balloon, delivered
      via a special bullet. Suggested uses include installing it on a vehicle as a
      decoy, using it to distract the enemy in an area being bombed, etc. Equipped
      with a scope to confirm its efficacy upon discharge. The balloon produces heat,
      makes a slight noise, and projects an overall air of purity and confidence,
      attracting nearby enemies with these human-like traits. After a set time or
      after taking enough damage, the balloon self-destructs so as not to fall into
      enemy hands. It is said that only the pure of heart can use this device properly.

    review: "pros : \n-you can fire this decoy\n-perfect for artilery strike because\
      \ you can keep your distance while rounding up enemies in 1 place\n-you can\
      \ take your waifu to the battlefield\n\ncons :\n-low level means low HP\n-you\
      \ will have to watch as the bugs tear your waifu apart. you can look away but\
      \ you're well aware that she's getting ganged by those bugs\n-she's not real\n\
      -son please come back. we don't care about your obsession with those cartoon\
      \ girls, you can have fantasize as much as you want, we just want you back."
