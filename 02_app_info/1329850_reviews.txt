I also like the setting, it feels good walking medieval Visby, especially when you have en interest in history. However, this game is poorly optimized. Even with a relatively powerful setup (an i7-9700k and a GeForce 2080) my computer struggles to reach even 30 fps (initially around 60 fps, but after you've slept and wake up the next day the performance goes down the well). So even though I really would like to recommend it because I like the idea and setting, I can't at the moment because of the technical issues. Hopefully they will be resolved in the near future and then I might change my review to a positive one.\n\nAlso, as others have said already, the game crashes when changing settings, and you walk really slow (even when \"running\"). I understand the idea behind this game is not to rush it but take your time and walk the city, however in my opinion you move a bit too slow in order for it to be enjoyable.","timestamp_created":1597591523,"timestamp_updated":1597591523,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535459041595458984","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ464H4+/MCfMXsmwI="}
