Extremely gimmicky similar spell cards to the point that they all kinda blend together and the new mechanics for collecting bombs/lives is a bit too punishing as it's more risk than reward since you have to hang out near the top of the screen more than you do any of the other games. \n\nThis has the unfortunate side effect of making death from collecting upgrades feel cheap which should never have happened. Not even UFO / WBaWC with their collection mechanic forces you top screen, or SA / LoLK with their brutal difficulty make collection feel cheap. That's not to say it's bad though, it's just not as good as touhou 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, etc...\n\nDon't start out with this one, play the other ones first. But do buy it; even the most \"mediocre\" touhou game (by touhou standards) are still leagues above other similar games.\n\nExtra stage is one of the best in the series though.","timestamp_created":1609545476,"timestamp_updated":1609732451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4q/3h5fYCdKzHvwI="}
