With this one, you actually get to build logistic networks to balance supply and demand across multiple regions, which is a nice change of pace.  There's also a great variety in how you progress your industry chain - with multiple options to win the game itself and many paths you can take along the way.  The game also includes the best loan system I've seen in an economic simulator, where you can manipulate the terms of the loan to get better interest rates or lower monthly payments, which works great on the harder difficulties when you're strapped for cash.\n\nThe one downside is the AI struggles to keep up once the player has built out two or three regions, so the last half of the game is a bit easy.  The player has the advantage in where they can choose to reject region purchase requests from the AI (because why would you give up your valuable terrain?) while the opposite isn't true, and you can eventually just buy out your competition with little downside.","timestamp_created":1610076235,"timestamp_updated":1610076235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z7SB8PYCffG4wQI="}
