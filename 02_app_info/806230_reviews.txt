It was only 6.99 but i use the oculus and it says it is VR supported. Well it is up until you have to pull the right trigger. Which you are left nowhere and with nothing to do but to think its you that is the issue. Nope its the game. Fix it please because it looks like a good idea. I was looking forward to coming home and playing this. Luckily i was disappointed right away early.  because i at least have a library of fully functioning games that arent half-assed into production. This is the definition of a bad EA title. dont be like these guys. OR at least take the compatibility off until you get your shit straight","timestamp_created":1560991776,"timestamp_updated":1560991776,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540069699287414551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0IeXuesCeNXlwwE="}
