It's not the worst game, but still horrible. The game didn't crash, it ran well, & as far as I know, no viruses were detected. However, the core game, if you can call it that, is just horrible. Low effort crap. \n\nThe gun doesn't even shoot bullets, just has a laser pointing out and a horrible sound when you press trigger. You are floating in space for some reason. Everything is blurry, especially the background. Your gun models look horrible, maybe it was on clearance at the Unity store. There are flashing lights and poor sounds / music. There is nothing artistic about this experience. \n\nI'm honestly hoping the dev turns out to be 15 years old, because at least then, there's some justification for this low effort crap. Maybe it's a high school project for an enterprising student who decided to turn his or her weekend learning Unity project for their Computer Science class into a money-making proposition on Steam. This probably earned a B on their final project grade, but definitely failed at turning a profit. \n\n[b]Rate 2/10.[/b]\n","timestamp_created":1610002200,"timestamp_updated":1610002200,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.618195891380310059","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3P7m7fYCdsWawQI="}
