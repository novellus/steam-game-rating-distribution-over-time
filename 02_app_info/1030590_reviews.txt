For the same $20 through the in-game store, all you get is the 2500 Mercury Points. Through THIS starter pack, you get the same MPs, XP boosters (Important btw), 25,000 gold, AND 4 weapons you can build for free for the most popular Raiders.\n\nIf you're thinking of putting any cash into this game, buy this pack. It's literally better than the in-game shop's version.\n\n- For those who don't know -\n\n- Mercury Points is MAINLY for cosmetic stuff. This is F2P, You should know how this works by now.\n\n- Gold is used for purchasing Raiders, buying weapons/upgrades and changing your guild emblem, etc,.\n\n- XP boosts help a ton cause you can only recruit a Raider or reach upgrade milestones once you're at a certain level in-game. XP boosts speed this up greatly. You're still gonna grind it baby, but why grind longer than you have to?\n\n- FOUR straight-up weapon blueprints! These are almost as valuable as cash since it means you don't need to grind for weapon parts, nor do you have to pay gold or even deal with build time. Just upgrade as you see fit, hit build, and it's yours. A blessing!\n\nNote: This game is always in a state of change and updates. Sometimes MASSIVE updates that change how weapons are built, or how talents are acquired. As of writing this \"review\", all of the above is true to the best of my current knowledge lol\n\nPeace out! Mika is life BTW!\n\n~Mystyx~","timestamp_created":1597274682,"timestamp_updated":1597274682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569343924522399902","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqa6/8vMCca+MmwI="}
