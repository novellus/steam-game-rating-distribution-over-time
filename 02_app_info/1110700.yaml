    review: "Okay I know I just recommended a $40 cosmetic, but here\u2019s some info\
      \ on why it\u2019s so much.\n\nThis is one of the treasury outfits, you get\
      \ them in game for free by having new players put in your referral code, getting\
      \ this done twice gives you a cicada coin. Each outfit costs 2 of these. The\
      \ reason why it costs $40 is the devs always intended for these to not be easy\
      \ to get. So I only recommend it if you really wanna support the devs. Like\
      \ me....cause I bought it like a lunatic."
