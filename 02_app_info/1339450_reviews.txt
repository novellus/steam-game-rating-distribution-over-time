From level 1 to 30, it is pretty straightforward, but then, some of the levels are very challenging. And as far as I am concerned, I really like this mix between easy and difficult levels, I enjoyed playing this game.\n\nOne of the main issues was that, sometimes, after working out a solution for a difficult part of a level, you have to be careful and think about how to get out of this part of the level. If you make a mistake, you will be stuck with no way of getting out, so you will have to restart the level, and try to remember how you solved the difficult part, which is not always easy ...\n\nStill, if you like puzzle games, I recommend this game !","timestamp_created":1604058606,"timestamp_updated":1604058606,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm/3VvPUCfbeFqwI="}
