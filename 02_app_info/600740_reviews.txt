It's a good idea, and one in the somehow unexplored genre of tank building (if you're a developer, that's a hint: get to work!).\n\nUnfortunately, it's unfinished and severely lacking in gameplay. The tank design is basic, and the battles consist of clicking a button and seeing either \"victory\" or \"defeat.\" There is no sense of an arms race, because there's no way to see what your opponents have; even in battle, your feedback is restricted to a few sentences along the lines of \"your tanks have better armour than the enemy.\"","timestamp_created":1602189624,"timestamp_updated":1602189624,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrLD8hPUCd+/XpgI="}
