    review: 'Played on Oculus Rift w/ Touch.


      A basic wave shooter but very inexpensive and with some decent mechanics.  Got
      it on sale for $2 and that wasn''t too bad for something a bit different, though
      barely so.  Somewhat similar to Regenesis Arcade.


      The biggest con is there is no state save of level or weapons upgrades so you
      have to start from scratch at level 1 each time you open the game.  And it crashed
      on me @ level 13 or 14.


      Unlike many wave shooters, this has some teleport free movement with rotation
      on teleport.  No free rotation though.  A 45 or 90 degree rotate on the right
      stick would have been helpful.


      5 weapons: pistol (forced starting purchase), shotgun, rifle, grenade launcher,
      and rocket launcher.  Each play differently and you can dual wield 2 different
      weapons (not the same one).  You don''t get damaged by your own explosions and
      the overall "VR presence" of the weapons is a bit weak.  The mechanics basically
      make the pistol a weak rifle and the shotgun and grenade a weak rocket.  So
      I played with rifle as my primary and rocket in my off-hand since it has pretty
      good area of effect.  Sometimes use the rifle to finish off enemies weakened
      by the rocket.


      You''re ammo limited in both current mag and total ammo.  But full ammo reload
      drops a couple times a wave.  Doesn''t refill the current mag though.  And there''s
      no manual reload.  "firing" when the mag runs out reloads which takes 1-2 seconds
      depending on upgrades.


      Killing enemies earns in game currency.  Good variety of weapon purchases and
      upgrades.  You can purchase during the 1 minute cooldown (which can be skipped
      if you want) and even during the waves though it''s tricky to drop gun, fiddle
      with armory, and pick gun back up during a fight.  Upgrades incl: damage, fire
      rate, reload rate, mag capacity and total ammo capacity, as well a "critical
      hit" chance and bonus, burst mode, might have forgotten a couple.'
