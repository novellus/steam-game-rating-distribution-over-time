    about_the_game: "You are an aspiring young boxer, battling it out among the best\
      \ for a shot at glory in this punch out thriller.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd a word\
      \ about these guys you're up against, they're the most ruthless bunch of fighters\
      \ you'll ever come across; they're rough, they're tough and they've got the\
      \ fastest set of reflexes you've ever seen. It's going to be tough even landing\
      \ a punch, not to talk of knocking them out, you'll have to be fast, quick and\
      \ intuitive. Show them no mercy because they'll show you none.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nStudy their weaknesses, learn to use them to your advantage. You're\
      \ going to need a whole lot of concentration in this one, monitor your strength\
      \ and stamina levels and avoid throwing haphazard punches or else you'll deplete\
      \ your strength up to the point where you can't throw any meaningful punches\
      \ and you'll make it easy for your opponent to knock you out cold.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nAnd the rules, there are no official rounds, no technical knockouts\
      \ here, just knock your opponent out till he can't get up again during the referee\
      \ count and vice versa. If you're knocked out, don't rush to get up. Try to\
      \ stay down for as long as possible as your strength levels only get replenished\
      \ when you're down, same for your opponent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTeck Boxing 3D\
      \ is a very light title built to be played on any PC, it's hardware requirements\
      \ are minimal and it can be played even on mini 10.5 inch laptops, it is ideal\
      \ for both home PCs or when you're on the road."
