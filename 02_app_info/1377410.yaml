    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>About Bountiful Life</strong></h2><br>Bountiful\
      \ Life is a farm life sim game in which you play as a character who's just moved\
      \ to Jubilee Village. Your time in Jubilee revolves around the three core aspects\
      \ of life; your work, your friends and family, and your faith. <br><br><strong>Work\
      \ </strong>- As the newest farmer, and member of Jubilee, you have a personal\
      \ obligation to rejuvenate the farmland back to its former glory. Utilize a\
      \ wide range of forms of labor such as the husbandry of farming crops and raising\
      \ livestock, foraging, fishing, mining, and other mechanics. <br><br><strong>Friends/Family</strong>\
      \ - Jubilee is home to over 30 unique villagers who all have their own personalities,\
      \ hopes, and dreams. Getting to know the villagers better can \u201Cgrow\u201D\
      \ into close friendships enjoyed over bonding activities and common interests.\
      \ Investing time in these relationships can lead to a fruitful outcome, such\
      \ as marriage. You then have the option to raise or adopt children. <br><br><strong>Faith\
      \ </strong>- An integral part of Bountiful Life\u2019s story is determining\
      \ your faith. You can choose between the two main factions, an old-world style\
      \ faith, and a traditional western-based faith. Alternatively, if you choose\
      \ to side with neither, you can follow a more agnostic approach to your time\
      \ in Jubilee or dedicate your life to scientific exploration. Each path of faith\
      \ on the road to life will have fully fleshed out events tailored to your playstyle\
      \ and choices.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Full Release Features:</strong> </h2><br><strong>Co-Op!\
      \ </strong>- Play with up to a group of four players, with full-platform support.\
      \ <br><br><strong>Farming, Fishing, and Foraging, Oh My! </strong>- Manage your\
      \ own farm and create a steady source of income. Grow crops, raise cattle, catch\

      \ efficient and have longer-lasting stamina throughout the day. <br><br><strong>Find\

      ><strong>What Makes Bountiful Life Unique?</strong></h2><br><strong>Co-Op</strong>\
      \ - Alcinous Studios is avoiding the pitfall of making their game single player\
      \ from the ground up and then being forced to redo the entire project just to\
      \ implement co-op gameplay mechanics. Bountiful Life is being developed with\
      \ the end-goal of a cross-platform co-op experience tailored to all mediums\
      \ gamers will utilize for the most enjoyable experience. <br><br><strong>Artstyle\
      \ </strong>- We have implemented a new standard in the creative direction of\
      \ Farming and Life Simulators. We\u2019ve noticed many AAA F&amp;L Sims, while\
      \ fun and creative, tend to be either pixel-based or low-quality 3D creations.\
      \ Our modern approachable artstyle allows our community to be fully immersed\
      \ in our creations. A vibrant stylized environment with stunning characters\
      \ and precise attention to atmosphere changes our project from just your typical\
      \ run-of-the-mill farming game to a unique and enjoyable experience. <br><br><strong>Best\
      \ Friend Mechanic</strong> - Romance is not the only reason to pursue relationships\
      \ with others. In Bountiful Life, players can also unlock special events and\
      \ dialogue that lead them to maintain a unique best friend relationship with\
      \ one villager. <br><br><strong>Mini-Games</strong> - Players will use engaging\
      \ mini-games to work jobs, win festivals, fish, and cook."
