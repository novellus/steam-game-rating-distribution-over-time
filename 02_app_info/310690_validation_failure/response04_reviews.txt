Worse yet, you have a load of useless live-action hazard clips that aren't even being used anymore, seeing as they've moved on to CG hazard clips. The video settings are abysmal and the notion that they filmed anything with a high-definition camera is ludicrous to say the least. Even the logic is poor; you spotted a hazard too early and got zero points? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of having a time-based scoring system - penalising people for finding a hazard \"too early\" and probably being \"too safe\". \n\nWorst of all, the value is shocking. There is a lack of content and functionality that staggers me and yet, they ask me to pay Â£9.99 upfront for the pseudo-privilege of being able to use this software.","timestamp_created":1454012232,"timestamp_updated":1454012232,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536256313323974609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlL74xNICcIuyTw=="}
