    review: "Just re-purchased this old favourite after the spectacular letdown from\
      \ EA and SW:Squadrons.\n\nMy only gripe is after the 2020 mega update, it will\
      \ not run through Steam, but this is currently being looked into. \nWhat is\
      \ mainly bugging me is I cannot switch my yaw/roll axis!\nHoping for a tweak\
      \ but until then I'll simply learn to fly all over again.\n"
