To reach the top, you'll have to go through many levels containing puzzles of varying difficulty, collect items to help you along the way, and surpass obstacles that will try to prevent you from making it to the end.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe world you are in isn't just a normal, euclidean, isometric world. It's a place built on illusion and visual tricks. In order to get past this and reach the end, you'll have to work with something special, perspective. More specifically, by rotating yourself 90 degrees at a time using a special item.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAn area or item that seems far away can actually be up close just by turning Cole 90 degrees in a certain direction.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBe warned!
