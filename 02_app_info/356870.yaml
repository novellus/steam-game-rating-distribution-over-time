    review: "I have seen this game go through about 4 maybe even 5 different phases.\
      \ The owner has a goal in mind just needs to find the perfect area that he likes\
      \ and sticks with it. Overall though it is fun, tons of bugs though with any\
      \ very new indie type games, I'd say don't buy it till a full release comes\
      \ out but if you want to watch it grow into something from basically the very\
      \ first steps then go for it. I left the comments open for the dev/owner. I\
      \ am willing to give you a list of bugs that I have encountered while playing\
      \ this game (or this most recent updated version as of 6/11/2020). \n\nIf you\
      \ are a achievement hunter like myself it is a easy game to grab and beat for\
      \ some game completions but with it changing three to five times that I can\
      \ recall the achievements reset I do believe so as long as the dev/owner sticks\
      \ with one build of the game then it should be good to go! If not you may have\
      \ to play this game many more times in the future to keep 100% done on it.\n\
      \nI may edit this in the future if things change while I finish this version."
