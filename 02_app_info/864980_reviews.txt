At least I figured out I could use comments if it got too long again.\n\nBeware of spoilers;\n\nWould like to point out that unlike previously this time it seems to suggest that some time has passed and we've had a chance to heal up, not surprising since both Skylla and Bronya was gonna let you stay to do just that.\n\nSo seventh friend Tagora, and all our good health goes flying into a bush as we don't look where we're going and get hit by a car. Yes trolls have a weird word for it there's a lot of troll words in this route, if anyone needs or just wants to have a look there's a Troll Terminology page up on the wiki with everything! Collide-and-scamper is a great substitute for hit-and-run. Man all the dialouge in this route is golden that includes all of MCs thoughts/talk. Did this guy just charge us 50 to show up? Yes, yes he did. I Suggest you keep an eye on that corner or scroll back and click forward again because sometimes some extra text shows up and it's all worth it to read. If you wanna know what the Alternian says it's on hi wiki page. Nice recover Gor-gor, not sure if I can count him amongst the trolls who figured we're an alien before we told him it kinda all happens at the same time. It's intresting to note that cluckbeast (Alternian chickens) eggs are refered to as either embryos or ovas, but Bronya refered to troll eggs as just eggs. It's also intresting that Alternia uses specific words like \"beast\" to always refer to an animal and \"grub\" show up in most food items even when the item itself wouldn't neccesarily use a larvae (see: grublette = omelette). A yes, all the riches we don't have. WIth some things we find out later I seriously doubt we've ever even been close to rich on Earth and we haven't gotten a single bit of coin since we got here. We're surviving on nothing but charity here.\n\nTagora unlike most trolls is not particularly strong but he both talks and walks fast. The background artist went all out on Tagora's hive, you can tell exactly what kind of place you've walked into before it gets described. I'm with MC this would be creepier than what we've seen before, maybe we're not that far from learning not to follow strangers home like a lost puppy? Who am I kindding, we'll never stop.. And here we have the second of our friends lusi pictured, Ferretdad! Love his little throne/play tower <3 Tagora uses the word \"home\" usually trolls would use hive so I guess Tagora uses more of the \"highblood lingo\" which in Homestuck usually meant English words. Fair enough he's a fancy guy. You can practically feel the tail wagging every time we get praised. Tagora mentions subjugglation and we immidiately question what a subjuggulator is, good question but not the time! Nice nod towards Equius saying highbloods shouldn't swear (Although Equius didn't know clowns are exempt). Oh hey another troll they don't get pictured here or even their own text boxes but it's a highblood. This troll figures we're just a mutant and not an alien. When Tagora gets pissed he charges more. Teals can  tell drones what to do without it hurting them. Also reverse pickpocketing.\n\nTagora does nothing to indicate talking with his lusus but Ferretdad is right there ready to lead you to the bathroom. Even though you're still worried about nonexistant traps. Still can't read Alternian. A bath, sparkly lotion and a wardrobe change later and we head back to Tagora. I have the sneaky suspicion that the torn remains of the clothes Cirava lent us got burned. Instead we borrow one of Tagoras bathrobes. Can't fool Ferretdad. Hey the blue guy is back, this time we manage to deal with him in a less disastrous way! From one good hustle into some truth time, on both sides and it doesn't turn bad!  Hurray for friendship!\n\nEighth friend Vikare. We find him by our crashed rocket, taking it apart. Note; Vikare is counted as a little guy but not one of the children we meet. And now we're confident enough to make up troll words, ground leaf covering, riveting. Wonder if any of the 3 perfectly servicable troll names are any of Vikares friends? Also is it an English thing or a reference to Gaston's song? It's hard to say if Vikare relizes we're an alien or not. I mean he seems to get the implication of this being our spaceship but he also doesn't seem to realize that we wouldn't ever be able to just continue living here like a troll or the fact that our planets might be (and are) very diffrent. I like that his hive is on stilts, it's cool. It's so sad that people can't enjoy what they want without risking death on Alternia. And our first look at 3 branching paths instead of the usual 2, very neat! It's intresting that Alternia went from boats to spaceships, I guess since all violet lusi apparently fly noone wanted to mess with that? Second troll to see our blood, at least this time turned out better. And we lose our chance at friendship because we've become to used to violence. Another lusi gets mentioned the Canary, except it's an Emu kind of bird. The white flowers with blue leaves is people food and the ones with red leaves is lusus chow, got it. And here we go the reason I first started thinking we made some trolls lifes worse by befriending them. We get Vikare throw off a cliff, he seriously breaks his leg and in a later volume it's said that he continues to jump of cliffs. What if he gets hurt really bad? He won't stand a chance then :( It's a very diffrent end but I still love this volume. Just made me think about how we kinda made things worse for him and playing through again that kinda happens a lot with the lowbloods.\n\nWell this is way less than I had before so I think I missed a bunch of stuff but oh well, what can you do? This volume did bring a LOT of things, mainly a whole bunch of troll vocabulary. Onwards to new volumes and more friends!","timestamp_created":1552207579,"timestamp_updated":1552207579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ494Cys+kCesPevAE="}
