The \"Key features\" haven't any new design beyond default features of RM engine. You can find them in every novice RM developer's game.\n\nPros:\n+ No program bug.\n\nCons:\n- Dev used default RTP materials to design all maps. So they all look the same.\n\n- The design of UI have no characteristics.\n\n- Very boring. You do the same thing as other simple RM games. Travel from one village to another, buy the best weapon and armor, kill the monster to get EXP and money, upgrade your level so you can defeat the BOSS.\n\n- All companions are level 1. They don't have any skill too. Normal attacks are your only fighting style at the early stage.\n\n- Very hard. My group is level 25, but they can't defeat normal scorpions at desert. Even they have the best equipment of this price class. If dev wants player to take more time for battles and level up instead of using various skills or tactical, then I must give up. Because I don't prepare for waste my time on this stupid game!\n\n- No new or interesting game system.\n\n- Many common mistakes. When I tried to call a canoe near the pond of village, game said \"You only can call canoe at shallow water\". But of course THIS IS shallow water!\n\n- The texts of villagers are fixed, they will not change. Maybe dev was too lazy to create more text pages and switches for them.","timestamp_created":1568997346,"timestamp_updated":1599289231,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46aDErvQCe8rJ0gE="}
