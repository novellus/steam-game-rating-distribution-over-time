A diamond in the rough.\nBeneath the rough graphics lies a short, yet quite fun puzzle game with 80 levels, some of which prove to be quite challenging once you get far enough. It's been a nice experience for me, and I'm glad I got to play it. It's the fruit of true, honest work, and I like it for what it is~","timestamp_created":1596711625,"timestamp_updated":1596711625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548387110233306885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4krzb4fMCesvfmQI="}
