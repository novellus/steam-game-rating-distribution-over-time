You deal with modern day situations that may arise in third word nations, looking to achieve some mission objective or another in a hostile environment, using modern day military equipment, and fighting modern types of enemies.\n\nTo say that the premise for this game is excellent is an understatement, but it is totally let down by getting players into the game.\n\nNot recommended.","timestamp_created":1605038697,"timestamp_updated":1605038697,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ot3w2fUCcOXOrQI="}
