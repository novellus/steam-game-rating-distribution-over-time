      for my English.</h2><h2 class="bb_tag">what Kind Of Game Is This?</h2>This is
      a casual game, the player has five fighters to choose, Each fighter has exclusive
      perk.<h2 class="bb_tag">what Are the Fighters?</h2>There are five fighters,
      Fire, Shield, Boom, Wingman, Bug. Unlocked by game currency.<h2 class="bb_tag">how
      to Play This Game?</h2>Players should try to stay as long as possible, You can

      class="bb_tag">Specific instructions</h2>The player controls the fighter aircraft,
      attacks the enemy aircraft in the level, and also avoids being hit by bullets.
      There are four types of enemy aircraft, no attack mode, autonomous attack mode,
      attacking player mode, and special attack mode. Each enemy plane is divided
      into several enemy planes. For example, there are three enemy planes in attack
      mode. They only fire one bullet and two bullets, and fire several bullets. The
      same is true of firing at players. Special attacking enemy bullets will not
      damage the fighter, but after the fighter is hit, it will have the attributes
      of rollover control and slowdown. There will also be agencies in the scene.
      The power grid, portal and missiles will appear in different periods. The portal
      will allow the fighter to teleport diagonally. The power grid will explode when
      it touches the war. The missile will have a laser warning before launch.

    review: 'The game is so much fun! It is challenging and rewarding at the same
      time, and could be played for hours and hours. By the way the difficulty scales,
      you can really see that there was a lot of effort put in the game to make you
      give your best and not just shoot around aimlessly. If you want a game that
      reminds you of the cool old arcade games, this game is great for you!

      The only minor thing I would suggest to be added in a future update is a button
      to quickly replay without needing to go back to the menu. But congrats anyway!
      Keep up the good work!'
