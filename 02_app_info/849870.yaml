    review: "This is my review for Vitual Pirate VR, what I type is what I experianced\
      \ with the game. Everybody will experiance things differently. Aslo no game\
      \ is protected from critizum weather it's early access or full game. Now onto\
      \ the review.\n\nVirtual Pirate VR is a Shooting & Slice Action Position Tracking\
      \ (Move / Evasion) battle game. The title and the description are two different\
      \ things. First off virtual pirate means you can play as a pirate, get to experiance\
      \ a taste of being a pirate to where the descrption is saying you just stand\
      \ around defending yourself agenst a certain number of enemies. \n\nThe graphics\
      \ are cartoon-ish style at best. I mean what do you expect from a $14.99 game\
      \ that is on sale for $10.47.\n\nThe music was so loud, louder then my own voive\
      \ and there is no option to turn it down or even turn it off.\n\nThe sword slicing\
      \ sound was okay more or less typical average sound.\n\nThe sword was litually\
      \ useless when blocking rarley works and the slicing only works after a reset\
      \ swing. Can't do quick counter hits or tiny slices.\n\nThe flint lock pistol\
      \ sound didn't sound at all what it should. Play this game and listen very carfully\
      \ then go to this link I provide to check a real sound https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjeYe7w7zxs.\n\
      \nThe flint lock pistol was also way to big, it was more of a blunder blast\
      \ gun but those required two hands to shoot. Also pirates didn't have laser\
      \ pointers on their guns. Another thing is the pistol/blunder required a reaload\
      \ after evry shot. In here you can litually keep firing and get nothing but\
      \ headshots making the sword usless.\n\nThe enemies were bumb and boring since\
      \ all you have are 2 regualr enemies and 1 boss enemy. The two regualr are other\
      \ pirates and skelotons in which there are veriaty. Some throw things and othere\
      \ are buff but in the end it's the same enemy that is reused. The boss is a\
      \ kraken which isn't much of a boss when the game tells you where it's weak\
      \ points are located.\n\nThe modes are actually not fun since it's the same\
      \ modes. Singleplayer has arcade & stage. Aracde is to see how long you can\
      \ survive for, collecting points for a leaderboard. I got 67,400 in total and\
      \ 1st on the leaderboad. Stage is the exact same mode but you pick the location\
      \ and diffculty but it just copies aracde. If you play arcade first and you\
      \ can simply unlock all the stages with out playing stage. So the singleplayer\
      \ is just a wave survival.\n\nOnline is funny because I couldn't find anyone\
      \ in fact the game told me how many were online which was 1 and that was me.\
      \ The has been out for 2 days but really a new game & no one is playing a virtual\
      \ pirate wave game, gee I wounder why.\n\nLook I know it's early access game\
      \ and it's not perfect or even the full game but there is something called beta\
      \ testing. Allow some gamers to play the game before release to get reactions\
      \ and feedback to make sure the game is fine it's currect state. There gamers\
      \ who love early access gmaes because they can watch it grow into something\
      \ wounderful but they can aslo watch it sink as well. \n\nSo the game for me\
      \ gets a 1/10 score.\n\nThats the Pony review for Virtual Pirate VR"
