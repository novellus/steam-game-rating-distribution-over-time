    review: 'While not  a masterpiece it is really fun to play. The main con for me
      is that it does not allow you to play in higher difficulty levels until you''ve
      cleared quite a lot of stages. Feels to me that it artificially increases the
      play time with that. In my first 10 missions I only had to repeat one so it
      seems a bit grindy to have to clear so many levels before being able to turn
      up the difficulty.


      Overall it was a positive experience.'
