You also have access to many recipes but not all of them.\n\nYou basically have to beat a boss monster and you're barely strong enough. The monsters don't give much experience so you don't really level up.\n\nSo to complete this side story, you need to gather materials, figure out which recipes you can do, gear up your team and kill the boss. At the end you get a nice scene and the island becomes accessible in your main save.\n\nIt is short, takes about an hour, but it is a fun dlc.","timestamp_created":1607470163,"timestamp_updated":1607470163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w4SsovYCdM2kuAI="}
