    review: "The game's geriatric in its graphics and some of its UI, but it still\
      \ looks and plays enjoyably enough. I try not to negatively judge something\
      \ because it's old. I'm in my mid-50's and I don't think myself less because\
      \ my body is aging. Actually quite the opposite, I'm a much better person now\
      \ than I ever was. Steel Fury Kharkov 1942 is like that. The youthful flesh\
      \ has wrinkled and aged but underneath is some solid gameplay. \n\nI own IL-2\
      \ Tank Crew (I love IL-2:GB) and Steel Fury should be the example of how to\
      \ make it more enjoyable. Tanks with infantry support, historical missions,\
      \ sounds of war all around. SF feels like you're in an important battle to fight\
      \ in the \"Meat Grinder\" in and around Kharkov. \n\nFrom the starting line\
      \ you've three choices of tanks, but if you take a few minutes to add the mod,\
      \ STA (Steel Tank Addon) it'll add many more tanks and missions, and give a\
      \ minor facelift to the graphics.\n\nThis's a simulation so you'll be able to\
      \ take whatever tank position you desire, give orders as the commander, or drive\
      \ it, or load the shells, or look down the sight searching for armor and infantry\
      \ as the gunner. This's a tough game and it'll require patience and strategy.\
      \ \n\nA few folks have complained of the resolution on newer computers, so be\
      \ aware of that. However there's a fix. I had that issue from the Gamersgate's\
      \ Steel Fury edition I bought ten years ago, and I found a fix. SF works just\
      \ fine for me on the Steam edition.\n\nIf you can step aside from wanting the\
      \ shiniest toy that doesn't have much substance, to the worn, but true, toy\
      \ that does, SF will give you many hours of difficult but very fun tank battles\
      \ in a unique setting."
