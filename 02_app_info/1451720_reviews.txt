The only 2 downsides I see is other minesweepers let you select the number and if you flag blocks around it once you select the number it clears the surrounding blocks if the flags match the number exposing the unmarked blocks/bombs, this one does not. The other being a quick play button that would just generate a classic square level with a difficulty option, from what ive seen this can only be achieved by going through custom level and changing the amount of bombs and cluster. Other than that it is one of the best minesweeper games out there better than the most recent microsoft version which is covered in ads.","timestamp_created":1609273053,"timestamp_updated":1609273053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609325469,"developer_response":"Thank you for the positive feedback! \nI would just like to clarify that it is possible to open all the boxes around a number, if you have flagged the correct number of mines around it: click both mouse buttons on the number (left + right mouse buttons) and it will work ;)"}],"cursor":"AoJ49MGJ2PYCdfXGvgI="}
