    about_the_game: "In this short demo, your agents are set loose on a procedurally\
      \ generated level to eliminate a band of enemy soldiers by clandestine means\
      \ such as setting traps. More features are to follow should the demo generate\
      \ enough support. These include: class-specific gear for agents, the ability\
      \ to assign upgradeable skills to your agents, the replacement of placeholders\
      \ by original art, a separate interdependent strategy layer to contextualise\
      \ missions, missions with different primary and secondary objectives, greater\
      \ distinctions between enemy units, and original scores and voice work<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nThe final product is intended as a tactical real-time-strategy game\
      \ set in a period similar to the reign and decline of the Roman Empire. You\
      \ will be able to guide your clan through a series of insurgent acts to gain\
      \ the support of other clans in a bid to amass a coalition great enough to rid\
      \ your lands of the great empire that now occupies them. With the aid of your\
      \ clan's finest assassins you will be required to conduct a series of varied\
      \ missions, the success of which would enable you to obtain new equipment, and\
      \ skills with which to outfit your agents, whose attributes could also be improved,\
      \ in preparation for the final showdown to decide the fate of your clan, and\
      \ entire nations"
