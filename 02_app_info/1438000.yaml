      the Gambler when a shiny object appeared: it was an artefact of astounding beauty,
      complexity and power that just stood there, on the street of the Clockwork Town!<br><br>Perhaps
      it dropped off someone''s train? Or slipped between someone''s careless hands?
      It''s hard to believe that something so precious would not be missed by its
      former owner, but hey, the Damned would be damned if they gave a damn! And thus
      the mystery ended up in their possession.<br><br>With the possession of the
      artefact came the changes. On the upside, with eyes burning like coals, there
      was no longer any need to have a light to read at night; and everyone in the
      Clockwork Town now recognised the prestige that came with the ownership of such
      an object. On the downside, with the prestige came everyone''s attention, closely
      followed by plans of stealing it for themselves...</i><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1438000/extras/5A_DLC_616.jpg?t=1603367184"
