However there's limited ammo (severely) and instead of having a function to roll yourself there are pillars that set you to a specific value (though you can roll if you fall off of something).\n\nThis game is not very good. However, if you want to get ideas for making your own game, being inspired by how you could probably make something better than this yourself is good.\n\nI jokingly nominated this game for 'best story' because Steam wanted me to nominate something but I haven't played a game with an amazing story in ages.","timestamp_created":1606353677,"timestamp_updated":1606353677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rP2IgfYCerG0sQI="}
