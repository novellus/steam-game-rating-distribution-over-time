For the most part, there are many convenient features like not having to grind (though the option is available) and gaining XP even for party members not in rotation. While the plot and characters are somewhat lacking when compared to many JRPG classics, they get the job done and help tie the package together.\n\nIf you're looking for a relatively short but solid JRPG quick-fix, you can do far worse than Cosmic Star Heroine.","timestamp_created":1609675646,"timestamp_updated":1609675646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww6SJ5PYCdp2GwAI="}
