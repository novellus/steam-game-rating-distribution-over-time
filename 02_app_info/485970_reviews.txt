You start with a cube (representing a hacking probe) that can move around a series of rooms like a maze (representing some sort of cyberspace architecture that you are trying to hack). You need to get the cube to move various locations in the maze (representing data file locations) to complete each level. However all movement is pre-programmed, and you have a limited way to get the cube to do what you want.\n\nYou write programs by putting \"nodes\" of one of five commands together (move Left, Right, Up, Down, and wait), and setting up different colored tiles within the maze. These colored tiles are branch points for your program, and how you get the cubes to change direction. For example, \"move left until land on blue tile, then move down\".\n\nThere are about 45 levels and the difficulty varies. It takes anywhere from a few minutes to solve most levels to a handful that I've had to put aside for a few days cause I just wasn't seeing how to solve it. Since you're not limited by the length of programs, you can \"brute-force\" levels by having lots of nodes and colored tiles (but where's the fun in that?)\n\nI should mention that the layout of chapter 2 level 6 is a bad idea by the design team IMHO. There are slight changes that they could have made to keep the challenge of the level without having the layout looking exactly like a \"good luck cross\" (google \"fylfot\" or play the game if you don't know what I'm talking about). I understand the various historical and non-offensive usages of this particular symbol (various religions, Finnish Air Force, etc) but I still think there there are enough people that might be offended that the designers will lose potential sales by having this level in the game. Again, there is no reason to have something controversial in such a good game.\n\nWhen you solve a level, you get between 1 and 3 \"multipasses\" depending on how well written your code is. So one challenge after you solve a level is to optimize your solution. Also the January update added a global stats board that tells you how well you did compared with everyone else.\n\nThere is a level editor and community mazes (I have yet to try these), so you're not going to run out of challenges. As far as I can tell, this game does not do Steam Sync, which is annoying (but alright for the relatively cheap price). \n\nThe graphics are somewhat flashy for a programming game, but still very functional. There's something very pleasing about sitting back and seeing your cube move through the maze. I'd recommend turning off the bloom effects and the TV-screen effect. Each chapter of the game starts with a brief graphic-novel narration setting up the backstory (another interesting bonus).\n\nOverall this game is an 8/10 (10/10 if the designers change Chapter 2, level 6). Ten bucks is maybe pushing the price to value ratio, but if you find it at even a slight discount then I'd definitely get it. 45 levels multiplied by about 5 minutes per level, plus community levels and you can figure out how much game value you are getting.","timestamp_created":1486076212,"timestamp_updated":1603290695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.6390267014503479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41dDkpfUCediRcQ=="}
