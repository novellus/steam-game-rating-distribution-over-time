It's ~70 minutes of Carl Cox and a few drugtaking dj's about the history of Dance and saying EDM DJ's today killed the music and has nothing but USB-playing DJ's. Only to bash on DJ's today like Martin and Afrojack. Only the last 10 minutes showing Martin's success story and what EDM is has become in a good way.\n\nThis wouldn't matter if all the promotions weren't saying it's a Docu about Martin and Carl Cox. It's more about how Dance came to life and evolved over the years. Not really about the success of the mentioned DJ's","timestamp_created":1521822965,"timestamp_updated":1553030235,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.650401294231414795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t5j0y+kCfoaynAE="}
