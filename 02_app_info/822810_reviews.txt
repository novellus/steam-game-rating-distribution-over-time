The music is nice, the modes are fun, and the combat is fluid and tight. The amount of stages is very diverse, which adds to the ability to keep you playing while not getting bored. A minor gripe is that some abilities are better than others. The teleport or portal abilities are way better than something like the sticky bomb. But for a game that allows 8 players to play simultaneously on a PC, it really doesn't matter that much. I definitely recommend it.","timestamp_created":1565314517,"timestamp_updated":1565314517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gIGBuuwCe5KA0AE="}
