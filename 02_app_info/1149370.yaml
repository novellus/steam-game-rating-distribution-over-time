    review: "The game looked and felt like a decent Chinese ghost story movie. \n\
      But let me tell you it is buggy as hell. Quite often your attacks do not hit\
      \ the target. It passes right through the villains without causing them any\
      \ damage. This will make your progress impossible after a few levels in the\
      \ game. You will simply give up after a couple of hundred re-tries. Also restarting\
      \ the game from the very beginning is just plain absurd.\nGame developer needs\
      \ to fix this with an update.\n\nI really wanted to like this game but.......\n\
      \ \nAnyhow, I am marking this as a recommend only for the aesthetic feel of\
      \ the game. It still needs a lot of polish especially in the terms of attack."
