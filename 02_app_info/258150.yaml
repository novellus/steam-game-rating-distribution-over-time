    about_the_game: "Arma Tactics is a turn-based close-combat strategy game, where\
      \ you take control of a four-member Special Forces team. There are no given\
      \ strategies, rails to move on, or paths to follow; it\u2018s up to you to decide\
      \ how you will play through both the story-driven missions and generated missions\
      \ with randomized objectives. Whether using stealth or a more direct approach,\
      \ you will need to use your strategic thinking and use both basic and advanced\
      \ weaponry while facing many different opponents - ranging from unorganized\
      \ local militia to smart and skilled mercenaries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith highly\
      \ replayable missions, achievements, weapons to unlock and two single-player\
      \ campaigns, Arma Tactics offers many hours of intense ever-changing action."
