Began this one and am enjoying it.\n\nPROS:  Good characters, good music that changes per area, \"has well involved story with drama\", original art (albeit not tons of it), simplicity, gameplay that moves forward at an even pace.   Music and art are unique to this series btw.  I like this kind of game at the very end of the day - it is \"not too busy\" and relaxing.\n\nCONS:  Cannot run, though there's not a big need to run in this game, no voice acting, no elaborate world map, it's not 100 hr. play (it's much shorter), it's not a highly evolved game technology-wise.","timestamp_created":1603612996,"timestamp_updated":1603612996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmo6yr/UCf9r/qQI="}
