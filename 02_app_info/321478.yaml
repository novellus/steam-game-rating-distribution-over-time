    about_the_game: Lilies is a 10 acre venue that is as beautiful as its residents
      and is named after the abundance of lilies on the surface of the lake. This
      venue is known for its big fish and provides a challenge with lots of weed present
      and the stock of fish being low. However, with every fish being of specimen
      size with Carp up to 50 lbs and Catfish to 100lbs the rewards are definitely
      there. <br><br>The highlights of this venue are:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Full
