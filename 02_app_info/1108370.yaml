    review: '"Ratropolis" is an ''Indie Hamtaro Roguelite Deck-Building Colony-Simulator''
      with elements from games such as "Slay the Spire" and "Kingdom" combined into
      one game.


      Each leader starts with a "starter deck", which you may add new cards to as
      the game progresses. Choosing from 1 of 6 leaders, try to create a ratropolis
      by surviving at least 30 rounds of ever more difficult enemies; after which
      you may choose to continue playing or end the game as a victory. After each
      game you are awarded points which unlock new cards, advisors and more, giving
      the next playthrough new content.


      Decide what kind of ruler you will be with the multiple choice event system,
      which help shape the kingdom you build, through new cards, disasters, opportunities
      and much more.


      It will be up to the player to decide how their kingdom is built. Proper planning
      and decision making is important to creating the ideal deck for long term survival.


      *personal thoughts*

      Ratropolis is still early access, so some things feel unfinished or missing;
      even so the game was worth its asking price.


      I feel as if the developers are passionate about this project.


      Plus the little hamtaro ratties are the cutest little babies and I love them
      so much cus they''re just the cutest little things.


      8.6/10


      The only thing I wish was different about this game is that the rats would be
      little sheeple instead but still, amazing game.'
