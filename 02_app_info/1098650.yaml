    review: "*UPDATE*\nThe Devs have filed a Copyright takedown strike against my\
      \ video, removing it from Youtube. Save your money and spend it on a game whose\
      \ devs aren't actively involved in censoring negative publicity. I was actually\
      \ fairly mild in my initial criticism of the game because I thought the devs\
      \ had tried to make something cool. \nI can safely say now (after reflecting)\
      \ that the game is awful and way too expensive. (Biased, I know.)\nThe UI is\
      \ shocking.\nThe gameplay is trash.\nThe devs are abusing the Youtube copyright\
      \ takedown system.\nAvoid this and any further games by this developer.\n\n\
      *Original Review*\nI really want to enjoy this game but it is essentially a\
      \ 3d hidden object fetch quest game with a lot of missing localization and placeholder\
      \ object names.\nThe UI is really really annoying.\nThe premise is pretty cool\
      \ but I think it got lost in the execution phase.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FnOhxv_cPAU"
