It is simple FPS mixed with space adventure of FTL-style (Parkan 2 is simple FPS mixed with 4X game). \nIf you are looking for game with fancy graphics and high production value, look elsewhere. If you look for original, fun indie game - the style a expect indie should be - do not hesitate. \n\nTO be honest, I feel it to be steal for a price. Definitely worth waiting for other projects author has in mind.","timestamp_created":1607861650,"timestamp_updated":1607861650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpbiBrvYCfObnuQI="}
