    review: 'The artbook consists of about 80 pages of artwork, illustrations and
      concept sketches for the game. The explanations are a little short, only scratching
      the surface. If you''re more interested in the mythology and history, you gotta
      google it on your own. At least you have been given the right keywords to be
      successful in your search.


      Most of the art made into the final game, only few of them were not included.
      Looking at it after completing the game, I think it would be wiser to do this
      beforehand. Makes me want to dive deeper into this world... ;-)


      Soundtrack is also somewhat short, not even 15 minutes in total. Which is a
      little sad, cause the melodies are very calming, relaxing and different in their
      theme. I like to play such instrumental music on headphones at work, cause it''s
      less distracting than vocal music, and when you just found your way into the
      song, captured the mood... it''s over. :-(


      My personal favorite is "Twardowski Theme", which is, albeit him being the evil
      magician, full of sadness, hope (that''s buried deep inside a man''s soul) and
      a strange kind of love. But in the end the evil forces (thoughts) take over...
      brilliant.'
