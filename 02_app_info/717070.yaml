    short_description: R-COIL is a multi-directional shooter with a unique single
      button control scheme. Use the stick to aim and a single button to fire and
      thrust. Tap to fire. Hold to thrust. Yeah, it's hard.

    review: "R-COIL is both deceptively simple and vexingly fun. When your firing\
      \ system gets its wires crossed with your thrusters, you're in for a bumpy ride!\
      \ Have I mentioned wave after wave of alien ships, all intent on your destruction?\
      \  \n\nI needed a game that I could play quickly, and I found this retro arcade\
      \ homage to Asteroids on a Steam sale. I've definitely been loving it!\n\nPros\n\
      * This game is hard - probably difficult enough to keep interest for those who\
      \ like a challenge.\n* \"No stress\" mode with infinite lives, if that floats\
      \ your boat.\n* Fun retro graphics and sounds.\n* Just what I wanted for a 10\
      \ minute shmup session.\n\nCons\n* This game is hard - maybe not the best for\
      \ those easily frustrated.\n* \"Stress free\" mode doesn't clear the screen\
      \ of enemies when you re-spawn, so you can be repeatedly killed by the same\
      \ evil ships. Keep firing, you can (eventually) get past it.\n* The thinnest\
      \ of plots - but that's not the point anyway.\n\nThere are Steam leader boards\
      \ for regular mode. I'm currently #16 in the world, which at my age and playing\
      \ with a mouse instead of a controller means that there aren't nearly enough\
      \ people who know about R-COIL."
