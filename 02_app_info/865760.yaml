      If you are the type of person who enjoys exploring surreal or dreamlike environments
      then I''d honestly recommend this game as it nails that which I did not expect.  Although
      if you are a person who is turned off by terrible graphics optimization, bottom
      of the barrel voice-acting, or having your ears destroyed by sounds in a main
      menu screen because the options can only be accessed once you are actually playing
      the game, then perhaps hold off until some fixes come through.


      The good of this game actually does almost outweigh the bad for me, yes it has
      terrible optimization (at low graphics quality with medium view distance I achieved
      a fluctuating 30-40fps on an overclocked GTX 980 Ti), yes the voice acting sounds
      like they are using a text-to-speech app (which they might be given that it''s
      fairly obvious English is not their first language), and yes both the graphics
      and sound options are only available when you are playing the game (I mean at
      least it has sound options, it''s truly amazing how many indie games lack them
      or only feature the ability to turn them on or off), and yet despite all that,
      this game is oddly compelling, it controls fine, nothing special there but certainly
      serviceable, it''s the environment and feeling that it nails.


      Very few games make me want to just walk around and explore and experience the
      environment, I''m one of those people who even in games constantly wants to
      be making progress towards some objective or goal, and yet the surreal and dreamlike
      environment they''ve created through their low-poly, simplistic, and stylistic
      geometry combined with the heavy Depth-of-Field (which I normally really dislike
      but certainly fits in this setting), and very fitting visual and particle effects,
      really evoke a unique sense of peace, unlike almost any other game I''ve played.  That
      certainly won''t be the case for everyone I don''t think, but, it''s certainly
      captivated me, unfortunately, Depth-of-Field and sub-60fps in the vast majority
      of games including this one gives me pretty bad headaches so I will have to
      leave the land of dreams for others to explore.  Should performance improve
      and the game be polished a bit, I certainly would not mind coming back to this
      game and seeing what more there is to experience.'
