Ironic, as it's undeniably one of the most important skills for action games.\n\nThankfully here is a game which focuses just on it, and it does this job well. Projectiles come at a speed, with new ones that behave differently coming as the challenges mount, and you have a box you can teleport about a grid. Teleport it out of the way in time.\n\nEven - and perhaps especially - with such a simple gameplay premise, the game is, at least for me, involving to play, and as it gets more intense, the frustrations of failure- and the gratifications of success - do as well.\n\nEven with the minimalism, the smoothness of projectile speed, the teleportation of the box you control, and visual effects add a cinematic aspect to the gameplay. Some pulse-pounding synth music comes along as an option as well. I don't have much opinion for or against these; I tried it with a couple and then just muted the music. However, for those who like synth music I can imagine it to compound the aesthetics to truly boost the intensity of the experience.\n\nWith how simple this game is, Murphy's law doesn't have a lot to go on; I can say I don't think of there being any major downsides. Even the one that comes to mind, the music, isn't that bad and can be muted. I suppose one \"downside\" is that this game isn't for practicing gamer dodging in general. Again, the box we control teleports when we move rather than moving with an apparent speed, so this is not the candid practice program for improving at platformers and Rogue-likes that I admit I had at one point hoped it would be.\n\nReplay value mostly comes from the gratification of dodging in each respective challenge. I haven't played in a while; when I eventually do, I already envision reintroducing myself to that sheer gratification of success.\n\nOn its own price, I can recommend this game, as if you like what it has to offer it can give you gratification outlasting the lifespan of a Kit Kat bar which costs roughly the same price.\n\nI do however think for what relatively little the game offers - no offense, Yokcos - it is more fair to wait until there is a sale.","timestamp_created":1606363366,"timestamp_updated":1606363366,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp/itgfYCdoPLsQI="}
