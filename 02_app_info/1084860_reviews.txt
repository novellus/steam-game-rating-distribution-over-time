Would LOVE for this to be figured out.\n\nthanks for the top notch game <3 loved every second.\n\nEDIT: after a couple days the extra content files appeared in the steam files so thats good despite the very janky way the game shows them too you.","timestamp_created":1593357074,"timestamp_updated":1593526271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wafkgvMCfYuHkQI="}
