      \ yet intriguing mechanics, and engaging level design are present to try to\
      \ remind one of browser games, while still doing its best to just plain be a\
      \ good shoot 'em up along the way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe demo version features\
      \ the first level of the game, allowing you to see if the game runs properly\
      \ on your system, and allowing you to gauge if you like the game before you\
      \ purchase it. We hope you enjoy it!"
