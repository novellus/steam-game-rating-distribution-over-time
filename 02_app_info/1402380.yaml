    review: I've been through about 7 floors so far. It starts off pretty simple to
      get you used to the game, but they get a little bit harder each time. The puzzles
      are well thought out and I'm actually a little afraid for them to get harder
      lol. The game runs extremely smooth, not glitchy at all and is actually a ton
      of fun. There's some minor jump scares when you die, but for the most part you
      are figuring out puzzles. It's so much fun I decided to do a YT series on this
      and I can't wait to finish it. Definitely worth trying out for the price.
