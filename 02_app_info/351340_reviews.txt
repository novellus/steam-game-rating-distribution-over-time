When I got to the point where the game requires you to kill a cat, though, that was game over. This is an absolute deal breaker for me, and the game isn't piquing enough interest to consider going against my instincts in order to proceed, so I won't be finishing. All in all I feel like there could've been a good game here, but it needed another round or two of editing on all fronts. This game feels premature, for lack of a better word. There are probably people out there who would enjoy it, but in the end I'm just simply not one of them.","timestamp_created":1609715249,"timestamp_updated":1609715249,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49q2g5fYCde+cwAI="}
