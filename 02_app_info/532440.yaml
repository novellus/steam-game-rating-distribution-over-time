      \ out from imagined threats in his new flat and intense therapy sessions aimed\

      \ intent on kidnapping his daughter\u2014begins terrorizing his life again,\
      \ he\u2019s torn between his paralyzing fear and protective parental instinct.\
      \ With the help of a vigilante priest who has uncovered the genesis of this\
      \ ruthless, potentially supernatural gang, Tommy must overcome his fears and\
      \ venture into the heart of the abandoned tower block known as the Citadel to\
      \ save his family."
