    about_the_game: "Bombshell is a modern take on the classic minesweeper puzzle\
      \ game. It features both the classic &quot;Puzzle Mode&quot; and a new &quot;Panic\
      \ Mode&quot; where opening empty squares starts a countdown fuse that will detonate\
      \ the bombs when it runs out unless you mark all the exposed bombs correctly.\
      \ Bombshell also allows you to choose between the classic game board with a\
      \ square grid or the new hex grid style board which can be easier for new players.\
      \ You may also choose from three difficulty levels in all the modes and styles\
      \ for a total of twelve different game types to choose from.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nOne of the great improvements in Bombshell is the innovative touch/mouse interface.\
      \ You can still touch quickly or click to open a grid location or long press\
      \ or right click to mark it as a bomb or with a question mark, but clicking\
      \ on the numbers can often be much faster and easier. When you touch or click\
      \ a number next to the proper number of marked bombs it will open the surrounding\
      \ spaces. More importantly, touching or clicking a number that matches the number\
      \ of unmarked grid locations surrounding it will mark those spaces as bombs\
      \ for you all at once. Don't worry, the interface is smart and will prevent\
      \ you from making mistakes and let's you know when you are attempting to do\
      \ something that won't work. All of this leads to an improved user experience\
      \ and much faster game play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpeaking of faster game play,\
      \ each of the twelve modes supports three different types of leader boards:\
      \ World Records, Daily Records, and Local Records. World Records are kept on\
      \ our server and track the three best times ever for that particular combination\
      \ of play mode, grid type, and difficulty. Daily Records are the top three times\
      \ each day from around the world. Local Records are the three best times ever\
      \ on your individual device. And the records are shared among all device types,\
      \ so, you will be competing with the best minesweepers from around the world\
      \ on PC's and mobile devices of all kinds. And your score is recorded anonymously,\
      \ so there is no need to register with any kind of player service to participate.\
      \ Reading the global records and writing you new best time when you beat one\
      \ is the only information we pass to and from our server. Your privacy is assured\
      \ and the leader boards are anonymous and family-friendly!<br />\r\n(Daily Records\
      \ are reset each day at approximately midnight Eastern Standard Time.)<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nAnother great feature in Bombshell is our animated 3D board. The\
      \ numbers that still need bombs identified next to them will slowly bounce up\
      \ and down. Numbers with the correct number of bombs marked will stop moving.\
      \ If you mark too many bombs, the numbers with the incorrect number of bombs\
      \ marked next to them will jiggle wildly to show you your error before you make\
      \ a fatal mistake! And if you accidentally click a bomb, when it explodes it\
      \ will trigger the surrounding bombs in an outward cascade. Each of these animated\
      \ features can be individually turned on or off from the options panel. The\
      \ options panel also lets you choose which types of sounds you would like to\
      \ hear so you can customize your experience to be perfect for you.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nBombshell is great on desktops, laptops, and tablets! It supports\
      \ both mouse and touch screen play. Devices with smaller screens will enjoy\
      \ the ability to zoom and pan on the levels with larger grids.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nOur goal was to create the best minesweeper game ever, and we are pretty\
      \ proud of how Bombshell turned out. Let us know what you think in the comments\
      \ or forums, and feel free to contact our support team if you encounter any\
      \ difficulties. We want you to love our games!"
