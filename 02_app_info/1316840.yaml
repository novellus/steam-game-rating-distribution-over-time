      \ come seeking a different kind of trophy - to hunt their favourite animals.\
      \ Whether you are tracking turkeys through the valley or lining up to shoot\

      \ /><br>Silver Ridge Peaks prides itself in the range of animals available to\
      \ visiting hunters. Whether you are stalking through the boundless grassy plains\
      \ in pursuit of Pronghorn, keeping an eye out for stalking Mountain Lions or\
      \ observing Rocky Mountain Elk traverse the dense forests, the reserve has something\
      \ for every hunter. The ferocious Black Bear is a popular attraction, as are\
      \ the Mule Deer, Plains Bison, Mountain Goat and Bighorn Sheep. But the real\
      \ attraction is a little more feathery; hunters are known to flock to the reserve\

      \ /><br>Through the use of contemporary bow-making techniques and flexible but\
      \ sturdy materials, this Longbow is a stunning take on an ancient self bow,\
      \ making it effective even for modern hunters. Compatible with the arrows used\
      \ for the recurve bow as well as introducing two new types, the Alexander Longbow\
      \ allows you to hunt animals of all sizes. A single stave of hickory and bowstring\
