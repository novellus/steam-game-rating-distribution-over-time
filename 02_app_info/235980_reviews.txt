Each block material, like wood or stone, interacts in different ways with the various traps and gizmos that are introduced throughout the game. While the main level objectives have some neat ideas in them, the truly great puzzles come from collecting the three golden memory blocks found in each level. In fact, if you like challenging puzzles, I'd suggest pretending they're mandatory.\n\nNot every puzzle is a hit, sadly â€” towards the end of the game, just as everything is ramping up, some gimmicky puzzles are thrown in that are a little disappointing. Not only that but the game seems to get buggier towards the end, particularly with some of the real-time elements, so be prepared to undo a puzzle into an uncheesed state out of upstanding puzzle solver principle. Nonetheless, many of the complex multi-room memory block puzzles are wonderful to wrap your head around and are still worth the time.","timestamp_created":1609084207,"timestamp_updated":1609084207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+Y+50vYCe8vlvQI="}
