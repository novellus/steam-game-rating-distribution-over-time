After a period of peace, Gail Pilgrim now lives the good life as an Ambassador of the Galactic Union and Chancellor of the Gail Pilgrim Space Academy who simply cannot overcome her adventuresome spirit as the game starts with Gail and the new crew of the starship Quicksilver investigating an attack on Latona Station in which the only survivor is a young girl named Maggie Dale whom Gail takes custody of until Maggie's mother can be located.  Continuing the [i]Space Pilgrim Academy[/i] tradition of splitting time between Gail Pilgrim and somebody else, this time the adventure is divided between Gail and her personal quest to investigate the attack on Latona Station while trying to locate Maggie's mother, and Maggie Dale as she attends classes and spends time between classes by socializing with fellow first year cadets.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]\n\nAnyone who has played any of the first four [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] games can expect similar graphics that are simple yet aesthetically pleasing.  Only the graphics have improved somewhat despite the series still being made with RPGMaker.  (For some odd reason, no AAA publisher or developer has purchased [i]Pilgrim Adventures[/i] despite the ultra high quality of story writing and dialogue.)\n\nTaking place eight years in the future from the previous installment in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i], the returning characters in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] do look older than before.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1435715630\n\nThe sound, however, remains unchanged, but this may be good for players who would rather mute the game sounds and music so that they can either play their own brand of music or have their TV playing in the background.\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n\nEverything players loved about the first four games in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] is back.  The story has surprisingly gotten even better, the new (and even returning) cast of characters are more interesting than before, and there's still plenty of laughs to be had.\n\nFeaturing a story line that spends some time in the life of a girl in her early teens, Maggie's story features the sort of trouble making that occurs naturally in youth culture involving prank-pulling, snooping, and going into places where the people in question do not have permission to be, and this makes for a fun experience for people who enjoy teenage characters.\n\nUnlike the first four games of the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i], [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Year 1[/i] now allows for conversation choices.  Only instead of the choices affecting the story line, the choices are answers to questions from agents and professors teaching at the academy in Maggie's story line.  (Although providing the incorrect answer can have an effect. [spoiler]This effect is on Maggie's grades at the end of the game.[/spoiler])  Every possible response to professors also contain at least one silly response which adds to the replay value of the games in the [i]Space Pilgrim Academy[/i] series.\n\nWith classes to be had in Maggie's story line, the classes are very fascinating.  Cadets receive a liberal arts education that involves history, culture, science, art, philosophy, engineering, and military instruction, and players are likely to enjoy at least one course more than another.\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n\nIt is really lame that trading cards were not continued for the [i]Space Pilgrim Academy [/i] series.  But who can blame the developer?  The trading cards in the four [i]Space Pilgrim Episodes[/i] hardly commanded any demand, but this is good for card collectors to not only get themselves an easy Level 5 badge, but also even a foil badge for really cheap!  (Aspiring Steam card collectors should know that a user does not have to own a game in order to buy trading cards to a game.)\n\nLike all of the other games in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i], [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Year 1[/i] does not support the Steam overlay, so unless the player is one of the chosen few people on Steam that were granted magical powers to do so, the player won't be able to show off all of the silly quotes and bad puns to their friends.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nFirst the author finds himself writing a review for a game in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] for the fun of writing a review.  Then the author writes a review to help satisfy Steam's algorithm so that achievements earned in-game will be counted on the player's profile.  Then the author writes a review because a friend wanted to read the review.  (Sadly, that person unfriended the author.  The friend must not have liked being accused of \"blasphemy\" for not yet owning every game in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i].)  Now the author finds himself writing a review for a game in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] because [i]Pilgrim Adventures[/i] specifically asked the fans to write reviews. (As much as it peeves the author to write reviews for games that he didn't receive for free.)\n\nIndie gold?  Try indie platinum!  The author is a lifelong lover of management games and has an ooey-gooey soft spot for trashy visual novels with anime girls, so it should speak volumes that the author considers himself a huge fan of a game that isn't in either of the two aforementioned genres.\n\nThis review has been provided independently by an admin at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/25150682/]REXCurse (REXnetwork)[/url].\n(Five copies of this game were gifted after the writing of this review.)\n\nEmail contact@dnbmedia.co for requests & promotions.","timestamp_created":1555122854,"timestamp_updated":1609886480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537037849426269531","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6Mat6vYCcJuQvwE="}
