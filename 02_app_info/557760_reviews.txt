Now I have found it. This game is very hard and the story is very confusing. I've still not got passed the first level. The controls are very annoying since it only uses your mouse, but if you want a very weird game from the 90's and you have the time and patience to play it. I reccomend it.","timestamp_created":1514662946,"timestamp_updated":1514662946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.739947795867919922","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzcy81OACdpGllAE="}
