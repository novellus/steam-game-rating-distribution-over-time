    about_the_game: "<strong> Rising Constellation </strong> is a massively multiplayer,\
      \ real-time 4X strategy and management game set in a sci-fi universe in which\
      \ several factions compete for dominance over the galaxy. <br>Immerse yourself\
      \ in a fundamentally cooperative gaming experience by choosing your faction\
      \ based on its political regime, playstyle and history.<br>Gain power within\
      \ your faction and become its charismatic leader or elect the member of your\
      \ faction who will rule your empire, defining the broad lines of a military,\
      \ diplomatic and economic strategy and leading your faction to victory. <br><br><strong>\
      \ Strategy and role play at the heart of the experience </strong><br>The game\
      \ places traditional 4X game mechanics (exploration, expansion, exploitation\
      \ and extermination) within a setting that is ideal for all role-playing (RP)\
      \ enthusiasts to write the Rising Constellation Story together. <br>Several\
      \ different experiences are available to you:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> &quot;<strong>\
      \ Flash </strong>&quot; sessions of around <strong> 1h30 </strong> that take\

      \ over 3-4 factions.<br></li><li> &quot;<strong> Tactical </strong>&quot; sessions\
      \ that take place over multiple days and allow for slower pace of play, a greater\

      \ through their actions. At the end each server session and in consultation\
      \ with the session\u2019s most influential players, the history of the Rising\
