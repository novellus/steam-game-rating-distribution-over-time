However, it's already been done, and you don't need to take my research for it.\n\nOverall, these games are great, and if you want to run them on older systems, the gamefiles are there. If you want to run them on a more modern system, maybe with enhancements, there are endless forums, and again, the gamefiles are there. If you are nostalgic for ROTT or Blake Stone in the slightest, this is an adequate way to get them legally.","timestamp_created":1609747504,"timestamp_updated":1609747504,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuLOb5vYCcMupwAI="}
