    about_the_game: "&quot;Mutated Muter's Invasion&quot; is a fun and humorous 2D\
      \ platformer/action adventure game about a music note fighting an evil monster\
      \ from the outer space, the Mutated Muter (pun intended), who &quot;invades&quot;\
      \ the Solar System to mute all the music on the Earth. The nasty Mutated Muter\
      \ wants to destroy our Solar System's cosmic harmony (also often loosely called\
      \ &quot;the harmony of the spheres&quot;) and mute music in the souls of all\
      \ humans forever.<br><br>Imagine a world without something that is everywhere\
      \ in our everyday lives... Not only does music sound at concerts, parties, and\
      \ other events, but it also follows you while you are watching TV or a video\
      \ on the Internet, driving, or maybe even jogging or on your way somewhere with\
      \ earbuds on. Although there do exist games that are based on music as a video\
      \ game genre, there seems to be a lack of (if any at all) games that are NOT\
      \ music-based genre-wise yet are wholly ABOUT music, especially <i>saving</i>\
      \ music, as a subject. So, the idea of &quot;Mutated Muter's Invasion&quot;\
      \ was born.<br><br>This game's idea is to provide a mostly 2D platforming action\
      \ experience, often loosely described as &quot;Mario-esque&quot;, while focusing\
      \ on music as the main subject. A couple side-scrolling shooter levels are also\
      \ present. Fight the Mutated Muter's agents at different locations/levels stylized\
      \ as music scores with some fancy mechanics and collect sharps, flats, naturals,\
      \ and other power-ups and useful items in the fancy universe of &quot;Mutated\
      \ Muter's Invasion&quot;! Shoot &quot;un-muting&quot; sonic bullets and super\
