    about_the_game: <img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/489080/extras/App_Icon_64.png?t=1475644873"
      /><br>Your goal is to conquer each realm by defeating the inhabited creatures,
      including the guardian of the realm. To do this, you must complete the campaign
      missions, defeating the waves of creatures by casting elemental spells and destroying
      them.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/489080/extras/ice_snowball_64.png?t=1475644873"
      /><br>You begin with a simple ice spell, and as you defeat more and more creatures,
      your mastery over the elements increases, allowing you to unlock more powerful
      spells. Each element has a recovery time, and the more powerful a spell, the
      more focus is requires. You'll need to balance which element, and how powerful
      a spell to cast, to maximize your potential, against multiple targets.<br><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/489080/extras/fire_incinerate_64.png?t=1475644873"
      /><br>There are many creatures to engage with different behaviors, strengths
      and weaknesses. Some are resistant to certain elements, and some have specific
      reactions that will require strategy to defeat. They all have one thing in common
      - they're out to destroy you, and once they reach you, your shield won't protect
      you for long.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/489080/extras/fire_blast_64.png?t=1475644873"
      /><br>Each realm is progressively more difficult, and you'll need to grow in
      power to dominate its inhabitants. As your mastery increases and you learn more
      effective spells, you'll also be able to amplify each spell by acquiring upgrades
      such as critical strike, knock back, stun, ...<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/489080/extras/menu_crystals_64.png?t=1475644873"
      /><br>There is one additional source of magic - the Crystal Chamber. Here, you'll
      acquire the ability to release the essence of a crystal into an incredible surge
      of power. For a short period of time, you'll have virtually unlimited focus,
      project a mirror image, or release a shock wave that will knock back all attacking
      enemies.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/489080/extras/crystal_haste_64.png?t=1475644873"
      /><br>Crystals are an incredible source of power, and are very valuable. For
      defeating realm guardians, your reward is paid in crystals instead of etherium.
      You'll need them for the crystal spells during difficult missions, and they're
      used to purchase the highest level of upgrades, so use them wisely. There's
      no shortage of guardians, and at least one can be found every day. You can also
      earn crystals through your achievements, which are tracked in the Conquest room.<br><img

      /><br>Your journey mastering the elements and conquering the realms, eventually
      to face the legendary guardian of the Obsidian Lair is about to begin.<br><br>Are
      you prepared?<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/489080/extras/App_Icon_64.png?t=1475644873"

    review: "Very underrated game imo. It's very unique and definitely not for everyone\
      \ but I love it. I haven't played much yet on my PC, but play it on Android.\
      \ It's very solid and smooth. It's a magic spell upgrade game with stationary\
      \ battles. The spell skill trees go pretty deep and higher level spells look\
      \ awesome.  The swipe controls are awesome on the Android version and though\
      \ I have to use mouse/keyboard here, it's fine with me. I will still play the\
      \ Android version a ot more since I have time invested in it, but more than\
      \ happy to support the devs for their hard work. \n\nAll I've done so far with\
      \ this version is load it up, check out the controls, and kill a few monsters\
      \ to make a comparison to the Android version and it's acceptable to me.\n"
