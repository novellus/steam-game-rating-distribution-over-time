    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2><br>Gladiator Manager is a\
      \ sports management and tactical text-based battle simulation game.<br><br>The\
      \ player takes on the role of manager of a team of gladiators, trying to win\
      \ a league and a cup. The back end managerial part of the game has similarities\
      \ to games like Football Manager and Out of the Park and involves hiring new\
      \ fighters by judging their potential and skills, training them, and then selecting\
      \ the right combination to gain tactical advantages over opposing teams.<br><br>Fighters\
      \ can be veterans, citizens, criminals or slaves, each with their own unique\
      \ game mechanisms and characteristics, and come in six classes: gladiator, rogue,\
      \ barbarian, defender, retarius and leader. Each class can hybridize by selecting\
      \ perks from other trees.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"\
      bb_ul\"><li>Simultaneous turn based combat<br></li><li>Class advantage and RPS\
      \ decisions<br></li><li>Armour and blood mechanics<br></li><li>6 different fighter\

      \ concussion, unconsciousness and severed limbs<br></li><li>Detailed injury\
      \ recovery system with realistic temporary and permanent consequences<br></li><li>Economic\

      \ txt and sql files to allow changes to name generation and save game files</li></ul><h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Tactical Battles</h2><br>The battles are turn-based, tactical,\
      \ and deeply simulated. A key feature is that all orders are issued to all fighters\
      \ simultaneously by the player and the AI resulting in a rock, paper, scissors\
      \ outcome that depends on whether the fighters are trying to attack, defend,\
      \ move or pull off a special strategy. The chances of success depend largely\
      \ on the relative control of the fighters, and that in turn depends on whether\
      \ they have managed to defend successfully in previous turns.<br><br>Fighters\
      \ can gain access to over 30 special moves by levelling up, and another 60+\
      \ passive perks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fantastic Artwork</h2><br>Fighters are\
      \ rendered beautifully by a powerful random portrait generator that can create\
      \ a whopping 310,810,500 combinations from different parts lovingly crafted\
      \ by the amazing French artist Mesrile. We are really proud of the result which\
      \ in our view tops the portraits put out by many triple A games like CK2.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Transparent and Player-Controlled Randomness</h2><br>Another\
      \ key feature to the game is total transparency of battle mechanics. As a simulation\
      \ game there is naturally a lot of random number generation on the default settings,\
      \ but by clicking on the \u2018detailed battle report\u2019 tab on the battle\
      \ screen the player can see every single roll that the game makes, and can determine\
      \ exactly why any particular outcome has occurred. This also allows the player\
      \ to work out what fighter attributes are especially important in any given\
      \ situation.<br><br>Don't like RNG? Just turn it off! The game has three modes:\
      \ simulation (default); low RNG (akin to the D&amp;D D20 system); and fixed\
      \ - with no RNG at all!<br><br>In line with the battle mechanic transparency\
      \ the game is also completely transparent about the effectiveness of training\
      \ and fighter development. A fighter\u2019s ability to improve attributes is\
      \ determined by a focus set by the player and their innate potential for a given\
      \ skill \u2013 something the player can begin to work out by watching how well\
      \ they develop. The game always lets the player know when training succeeds.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Deep Simulation</h2><br>The game keeps a wide selection of\
      \ statistical records of the fighters for all the sports fan stat geeks out\
      \ there, and displays them at the end of the fight.<br><br>All other enemy v\
      \ enemy battles are fully simulated with no shortcuts, to ensure that the league\
      \ is always an accurate representation of the ability of the teams. The AI gets\
      \ no advantages and fights with the same options as the player. There are five\
      \ leagues, with ten teams in each, and a cup competition that spans the leagues\
      \ each season.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Detailed and Realistic Injuries</h2><br>Whether\
      \ they succeed or fail, a fighter can be injured, maimed or killed in the arena,\
      \ and the game has a detailed injury mechanism whereby a fighter can suffer\
      \ from over 100 different specific injuries that have varying effect on their\
      \ ability to fight. Some injuries can result in blindness, concussion or loss\
      \ of a limb, with corresponding consequences in battle. In the end a fighter\
      \ will either be killed or will succumb to fear and yield.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Customisation</h2><br>The game can be considerably customised, with selectable\
      \ themes for the world (team names, division names) and for the fighters, with\
      \ randomly generated names from Rome, Gaul, Britannia or modern-day Europe (England,\
      \ Spain, France, Italy, Russia). The player can even choose total randomness,\
      \ giving a mixture of names from all themes.<br><br>Not enough customisation?\
      \ Go into the game files and edit the txt files at will, changing name generation,\
      \ or download any free SQLite editor and change any aspect of your save game.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Present Build</h2><br>The game is currently fully functional\
      \ and can be played successfully over multiple seasons. There are bound to be\
      \ some remaining bugs but there are no known game breakers. The game is pre-alpha\
      \ and has not yet been released.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plans for Release</h2><br>The\
      \ road map to release in late 2020 / early 2021 includes adding:<br><br><ul\
