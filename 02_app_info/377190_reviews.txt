I just completed the game at 95%. I'm a bit sad I was playing offline, because I got almost every single achievement. I guess it just means that I'll replay the game some time later this summer. It's well worth my time and efforts.\n\nWho this is for:\n1. People that want a slow pace puzzle in terms of exploration and turn based combat, with little consequences.\n2. People with no time but want to indulge in a nice heart felt story. I finished pretty quickly,\n3. Y'all just feel pleasant man.\n\n\nPros:\n1. Interesting combat. I usually do not like turn based games but it was very fun to collect memories and fiddle with the order of using them.\n2. Little consequences, so it's really refreshing to play after a difficult run in WoL, or something with a heavier plot like Transistor.\n3. Cheap, and worth more than the price.\n4. Short length promotes replayability. I WILL get my achievements back.\n\nCons:\nI honestly don't have any unless I'm being nitpicky.\n1. Music isn't anything special. But like, who cares.\n2. Sometimes the animation is too slow and you can't skip.\n3. Makes you too invested.\n4. Perhaps some people would like a heavier plot or longer length. But buy it anyway. It's nice.\n\nHave fun!","timestamp_created":1478101489,"timestamp_updated":1560608991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.450041979551315308","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48eziresCeLLOZA=="}
