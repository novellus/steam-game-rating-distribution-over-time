It does have some type of glitch that doesn't let me use a longer name as my player name but that's not a real problem, certainly not a game breaker problem. So yeah, really enjoy this game, it's really a game I use when I get overly frustrated with my more complicated and headache inducing games - that while fun do get too much at times so it's really nice to have a more mind relaxing/calming game as the repetition of gameplay is definitely a plus!","timestamp_created":1603371790,"timestamp_updated":1603371790,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6/2ZqPUCcMu1qQI="}
