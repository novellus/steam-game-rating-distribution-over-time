At first I thought it was just islands and a few new bits and bobs, but they've added new items and a few new options to manage your prisoners such as transfers. \n\nThe reason I don't recommend this is purely how buggy and unpolished it is. This is 6 months after initial release I am playing this too, plenty of time to fix the bugs. I have janitors unable to find and clean rooms without me manually putting them there, I have doors that do not close automatically, the yard thinks that it isn't secured with walls and doors when it is... \n\nThey've added nothing that makes it feel remotely like you're building on an island, you still have the default ambient noises of roads and a city in the background it's absolutely ridiculous. They've added floor tiles that don't bend when you make a corner such as the new cliffside floor tiles, it's really unpolished and it breaks my heart a bit.\n","timestamp_created":1610054802,"timestamp_updated":1610054802,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpdOv7/YCeOKwwQI="}
