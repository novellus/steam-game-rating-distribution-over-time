That, for me, is the operative word when talking about the 90s. I lived my adolescence in that period and, amongst a plethora of cultural landmarks, computer games such as Noctropolis had a strong impact in how I saw and experienced gaming in general.\n\nJust going back to those times, with this excellent Steam version, was worth the price of admission. If we factor in the art direction of Shaun Mitchell and the work of Owen Richardson on background art (Noctropolis’ strongest suit), well, then this title truly shines as a gem from the past. Not only that, but from costume design to the art of the graphic novel, this game visual style is a true representative of what 90s gaming did well. A quick nod to Ron Saltmarsh’s musical score is also in order.\n\nOn the other hand, since this is a review and not a memoir, we must try and go beyond the effects of nostalgia and call a spade a spade. The downside of Noctropolis lies with the writing, from the dialogues and character motivations all the way up to story flow and plot twists. Not only does it come off as excessively cheesy and juvenile, but also bland and sometimes even borderline insulting to one’s intelligence.\n\nEven giving a lot of leeway to the superhero genre, Noctropolis reminded me of all the things 90s gaming did wrong. It felt like watching an old photo album of oneself, cringing and laughing as you flip through it.\n\nFun fact, though: the writing is not bad per se. It may sound strange but clicking through all screens to find the descriptive texts of items, locations and characters, is actually quite a treat. The prose is stylish, and with great sense of humor. It just falls flat when applied to the other areas I mentioned above.\n\nIn the end, as with most of the adventure games from that Era, I’d still recommend Noctropolis with a full heart. Even for younger generations. Yet another title where I’ll contend that you must experience it, even if just once, to better understand computer gaming history.","timestamp_created":1609752665,"timestamp_updated":1609752798,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws8yv5vYCeL2rwAI="}
