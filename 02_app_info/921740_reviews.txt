There are maybe 10 levels if I'm recalling correctly.  Each level has 6 modes of play.  Once you've played through each mode the next level is unlocked.  The first mode is always a standard HO mode where it tells you what to find and you find it in the image.  The second mode involves descriptions of the object the game asks you to find.  The third mode requires you to find 25 of the same object (for example you find 25 cups).  The fourth mode is to find the difference between the two pictures.  The fifth mode is a jigsaw puzzle.  The sixth mode is to find the two matching objects, like there are 8 keys and 2 are identical.  In order to move on, you need to gain both a star and a gem. \n\nPassing each mode/level is sort of related to time but, essentially you want to make sure all your clicks happen as close to each other as possible.  In the standard modes, this just means finding everything as fast as you can (I believe you need to be around 30 seconds to get the star and gem).  In the spot the different mode though it doesn't matter how long you take as long as you find all of the differences immediately.\n\nThe game's interface isn't great and parts of the game seem to freeze or stall with no way to move forward.  Sometimes you can bypass this by escaping back out to the main menu and playing again but other times that doesn't work well.  There aren't very obvious methods to navigate and that can be a little frustrating at first.  I think one of my biggest pet peeves with this game is the lack of direction.  So for example, it doesn't tell you how much time you need to complete something in to get the gem or star.  It doesn't tell you how many differences you need to spot (it's 5 by the way) and when it comes to descriptions some of them are terrible!  I literally had to waste a round every now and then just randomly clicking objects in the image to figure out what it was describing.  Other times, the description was obvious but, humorously wrong, like the \"Stoned Lion\" as opposed to the \"Stone Lion\".  I had quite a fun time picturing what a lion would look like when stoned.  I found I had to play the first and second mode several times in order to figure out where everything it asks you to find is and then be able to get quick enough to meet the speed requirement.  The bonuses fade too quickly in my opinion and to be honest this made me frustrated and I enjoyed the game less.  I think I prefer other HOG's that have a timer per object as opposed to the whole level so if there's one item giving you trouble you don't lose the bonus/speed benefits of having found previous items.  I also don't care for their hint system.  It doesn't work on a timer system and refill slowly on its own.  Instead, you are given a set number of hints to start and then can purchase additional ones with in-game gems.\n\nThere are also coins awarded which you can use to buy some upgrades to your home but, I don't understand the point as it doesn't really tie into the story.  Of course, I guess that fits in here since the whole thing has a really tenuous tie-in with the story.  The trailer for the game looks pretty interesting and intriguing but, you don't actually see any of that in the game at all.  They use Shahrzad and the Arabian Nights theme but, they are telling a completely unrelated story of their own.  Shahrzad doesn't tell the king stories to calm him down over his daughter wanting to marry someone she tells him stories to psychologically manipulate him into self-healing and trusting women again after being cheated on by his wife.  It's actually a masterpiece exemplifying the intelligence and cunning of the Arab and Persian woman.  This game instead tells a bastardization of the story but fails to give any real meaningful elements to make it it's own or engage you.  It's a basic plot only there to serve as a means of moving you to the next scene and tells very little actual story and doesn't really link well to its trailer or anything.  I still don't know what my role as the player is in this game.  I seem to have been sucked into the story but for what purpose?  To find some stuff for people?  Don't I care about getting home?  Why do I have a house here in this storybook fiction?  Why would I waste time upgrading it?  What's up with the end scene?  Is there supposed to be a sequel?  Something seems like it didn't quite get told to bring you from level ten to the end scene.  It just didn't make much sense.\n\nThe graphics are really nice looking, very evocative of Middle Eastern and Persian elements.  There is some occasional Middle Eastern and Persian -esque music but much of the background music isn't very authentic to Persian, Arabic, or Turkish music so feels out of place to me in this setting.\n\nI'll also note that I initially had problems getting this game to play at all.  I had to completely turn off every aspect of my antivirus/antimalware/antispyware software in order to get it to run.  I know that some games have problems in this same way but I had to do more than just pause my software to get it to run and that's a little worrisome and odd to me.\n\nI've decided to give it a recommendation but, it only just barely passes because I still enjoyed it when it was working well.  If I were giving this stars, I'd probably rate it a 3.  I only recommend this if you love HOGs and if you can get this on sale.  I don't believe it's worth the full price at about $10.  I played for nearly 6 hours (some of that was actually it sitting there frozen or stalled) which at full price makes this game about $1.70/hr of gameplay which I think is too much.","timestamp_created":1607709633,"timestamp_updated":1607709633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nsW9qfYCfNGVuQI="}
