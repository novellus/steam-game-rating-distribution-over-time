    review: 'I had an interesting experience with Zombie Exodus, I really enjoyed
      some parts and other parts felt very slow or uninteresting. I finished my game
      as a "Soldier Survivor" so I will base this review on that ending.


      Romance: One of my biggest complaints was the introduction into romances. I
      felt that I did not know the characters enough to romance them so soon but if
      I decide not to pursue the characters at that early point it means I am unable
      to romance them in a later part of the story. And its really long!


      Dialogue: I kinda felt that I could not engage in deep conversation with characters
      especially characters I liked. Many times I want to help and get close with
      my sister but I am sent off to do some long ass mission to get food.


      Pacing: The pacing was weird for me, I truly enjoyed the beginning a lot and
      it only became a chore during chapter 2 I think where I was basically doing
      mission work and It was very unfun, I just wanted to interact with everyone.
      I understand that we gotta survive. The final chapters got way better and more
      intense and while the ending part with the cathedral decision was really frustrating
      I felt content with the outcome of my decision.


      In all honesty with the little grips I have with this game and sometimes feeling
      like I wanted to stop mid way, I still think this game deserves a positive rating,
      hell I know someone will enjoy this far more than me and I can promise that
      most people will find this game great!'
