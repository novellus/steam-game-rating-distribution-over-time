There are not enough around in my opinion and this one is worth the investment of money and time. I adore the characters and the hugely complex world of this game, it pulls on the heart-strings and leaves you wanting more.\n\nShou, my beautiful ray of sunshine. He is so precious. These epilogues are so much fun, giving the reader a chance to relax and enjoy spending time with their Love Interest after all the drama of the route.","timestamp_created":1534781202,"timestamp_updated":1534781202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5dOFrOUCeNrzqAE="}
