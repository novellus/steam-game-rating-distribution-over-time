It's not overloaded with storylines (almost casual), and it keeps track of your progress so you don't have to keep starting levels over when you mess up. Interesting obstacles that gradually get harder. Plays well on an internal Intel HD Graphics 4600, and has a really cool tron-like look to it.","timestamp_created":1471390115,"timestamp_updated":1471390115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48582574725151062","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y+zrytYCeqCdXw=="}
