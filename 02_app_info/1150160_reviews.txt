But here it is your own Greed that drives you to the death. \nIt Is a fun game where only the hosts need it and all others can join in - Just like jack box games. \n\nThe Feeling \"There is 52% chance I will get gold and 4% change I will meet the same trap again and die. I NEED GOOOLD\" and then the trap....\n\nRunning 5 Games in a row to see what player wins and so is just so fun - Had a game here the other day, The AFK Dude that fled on round one all rounds got on the 3 places. we were 6 players ;) \nSo even if you don’t make any dictions or can’t make yourself to do anything there is still a chance for the podium.\n\nthe game is a nice addition to the Castle Explorer series and is a good alternative if only you have 30 minutes to play and don’t want to wait on all the other players and so.\n","timestamp_created":1591643139,"timestamp_updated":1591643139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578813016414642334","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u93UyvICev34jAI="}
