    review: "Extremely short at half to one hour, and I'd as such recommend cutting\
      \ the already low price of \u20AC1,99 in half, but do otherwise feel the current\
      \ low review score to not accurately reflect this being otherwise fairly enjoyable.\
      \ If you buy a small old-school point & click adventure by a first/one-off developer\
      \ you sort of know what you are getting, and as far as I'm concerned it provides\
      \ for precisely that. For a game this small nothing wrong with the voice acting\
      \ either as some others are commenting. If you are an old-school point & click\
      \ fan who enjoys short, easy, casual and firsts/one-offs,  and if you grab this\
      \ at currently 50% or less, I'd say you'd get your money's worth."
