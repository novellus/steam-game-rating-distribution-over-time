Power-ups appearing in each arena can create some pretty hilarious situations (dynamite?!) so you'll probably want to grab these before your opponents do.\n\nRounds quite are short and perfect for pass-the-controller couch gameplay. Best played locally with friends.","timestamp_created":1574510804,"timestamp_updated":1574510804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548387110233306885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwwoeKzO4CdYqL3AE="}
