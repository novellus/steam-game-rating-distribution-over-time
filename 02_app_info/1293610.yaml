      /><br>In Escape Planet 17, you are under the skin of Natan, a detective from
      the Narcotics Department. While investigating a new drug circulating on the
      streets, Nathan sees his partner being killed and both are framed for involvement
      in trafficking among others crimes. Nathan is unjustly accused, convicted, sent
      to a prison planet and removed from his family. During his stay on planet 17,
      Nathan devises a plan to escape, but a series of macabre crimes initiates a
      security protocol and prevents his plans. Get involved in an obscure plot involving
      violent gangs, synthetic drugs and a symbiotic experiment company. Giving up
      is not an option, escaping the planet is your mission, even if you have to get
      your hands dirty with blood.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1293610/extras/Heading_GameFeatures.png?t=1608596473"
