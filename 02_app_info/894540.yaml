    review: 'Surprisingly well written and a bit of a difficult puzzler (hint use
      graph paper to make your life easier). I also love the art style and the play
      on Shy Guys from the Mario games. For the price this is a must buy for puzzle
      fans. The only think that I didn''t particularly care for was the music. It
      sort of fits, but it''s pretty bland and a bit grating if you are listening
      to it long term. Oh and the full screen mechanic kept messing with my computer
      when I would try and exit it.


      Overall it''s a short and sweet with a story and characters that left me wanting
      more, which is always a good sign for an up and coming indie developer. Awesome
      job!'
