      /><br>Rise to Ruins is at heart a <strong>godlike village simulator</strong>,
      but it also throws in plenty of familiar game play mechanics from classic real-time
      strategy and resource management games like Black and White, Settlers, ActRaiser
      and many others. It also throws in some twists by melding in some tower defense
      and survival elements in an attempt to create a new kind of godlike village
      simulator. The goal is to try to bridge the gap between the depth and complexity
      of traditional village simulators, the fun of godlikes and tower defense, with
      the simplicity of real-time strategy games.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/328080/extras/keyFeatures.png?t=1588368697"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Build A Village, and Die Trying!</h2>A major part of the
      game is village management, and trying to discover new and creative ways to
      use the tools at your disposal to keep yourself alive as long as possible while
      you defend your village at night from the raging hoard of monsters, and try
      to expand in the day time. In this game, you will lose frequently, but with
      every failure you learn a little bit more about how to survive and apply that
      knowledge to your next attempt.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/328080/extras/spacer.png?t=1588368697"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Frequent 100% Free Content Patches!</h2>Like getting new
      content and not having to pay for it? Well, this is the game for you. For years
      Rise to Ruins had gotten frequent and completely free content patches, expanding
      the base game regularly!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/328080/extras/spacer.png?t=1588368697"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Several Game Modes</h2><br><strong>Survival</strong> is
      the game the way it was meant to be played, as a brutal survival style village
      sim, you will probably die often trying to figure out the best way to survive,
      but that's half the fun right?!<br><br><strong>Traditional</strong> is very
      similar to Survival, but it's balanced much like a traditional village simulator
      with some godlike and RTS elements sprinkled on top. The monster spawn rates
      are much lower, and the main focus is keeping your village happy and fed. It's
      a very easy mode, designed for casual players, or players just wanting to experiment.<br><br><strong>Nightmare</strong>
      makes survival mode look like it's for carebears. Mostly, it's just like survival
      mode, but difficulty levels are ramped up through the roof. This is the masochist's
      mode.<br><br><strong>Peaceful</strong> is the mode for you if you want to play
      a more laid back, classic village management game. There are no monsters what
      so ever, and no need to defend people. Just chill out and try to keep your villagers
      alive.<br><br><strong>Sandbox</strong>, like the name implies, is a mode where
      you can play around with the game mechanics. Change the time of day, weather,
      spawn monsters or villagers, or even edit the map while you're playing on it.
      This is the ultimate &quot;Screw around&quot; mode for players wanting to play
      with the game mechanics.<br><br><strong>Custom</strong> allows you to make up
      your own mode. You can adjust day length, how many days in a season, how many
      monsters spawn, and all sorts of other things. If you don't like the game's
      default settings, make your own up!.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/328080/extras/spacer.png?t=1588368697"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Godlike Elements</h2>Not only can you manage your village,
      but you also have many godlike abilities at your disposal. You can alter the
      terrain, blast enemies from afar, pick up objects or creatures, heal your villagers,
      speed up resource growth and all sorts of other fun godly stuff. You're part
      of this world just as much as your villagers are.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/328080/extras/spacer.png?t=1588368697"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Tower Defense Elements</h2>This isn't a tower defense game,
      but you'll still be getting some tower defense vibes from it! Use classic tower
      defense mechanics to defend your village at night, creating walls of towers
      behind maze walls to help keep your little villagers alive as long as possible,
      and if tower defense isn't your thing. That's ok! You can also raise an army
      of golems and recruit guards to defend the village.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/328080/extras/spacer.png?t=1588368697"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">World Maps and Regions!</h2>The game has tons of hand made
      maps for you to select from (You can also make your own if you like!) Every
      biome follows a certain theme (Forest, Desert, Drylands, etc). Start your village
      anywhere you like, and slowly conquer the whole world! (Well, try to anyway,
      you'll probably just die.)<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/328080/extras/spacer.png?t=1588368697"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">The Soundtrack!</h2>A full original soundtrack, made by
      <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://bibikigl.bandcamp.com/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"  >Bibiki Garcia</a> that blends orchestral instruments
      in a way fans of old 1990s era PC gaming will love and remember!<br><br><img

      /><br>SixtyGig Games is a DRM free independent game developer! Rise to Ruins
      will not now or ever in the future have any sort of DRM! Piracy protection only
      hurts you guys, the loyal paying players. So you rest assured knowing that once
      you buy yourself a copy of Rise to Ruins you'll never again have to concern
      yourself with nagging questions about if you can continue playing the game down
      the road due to something like always-online logins, lost registration codes
      or because you bought a new computer and you're only licensed to put the game
      on one. All I ask from you is to be reasonable and responsible, you can buy
      the game and play it as much as you like, wherever you like. Just tell your
      friends to support my DRM-Free philosophy and buy their own copy! Free Content
      Patches, no paid-DLC<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/328080/extras/freeContent.png?t=1588368697"
      /><br>I don't believe in paying for Downloaded Content. If you buy Rise to Ruins
      you will have access to the entire game and all the content I'll ever create
      for it, forever! I believe DLC is greedy, and you deserve to have the full gaming
      experience from day 1, right out of the (figurative) box!

    short_description: A regularly updated, brutal godlike village sim that melds
      the god game, management, and tower defense genres! Fight off hoards of monsters
      at night, and expand your village in the day time. Inspired by games like Black
      and White, Rimworld, and Dwarf Fortress but not quite like any of them.
