But despite the games limitations, it's easy gameplay and simplicity are actually addicting. Tried it for the first time today and when I'd stopped it was 3 hours later! LOL Only three downfalls I see are that you can't save maps, can't create a map from scratch, and there needs to be a gamma control as the game is predominently dark and its difficult to see the landscape clearly. Hopefully the developer will add some updates. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a relaxing experience that only costs pennies.","timestamp_created":1603335880,"timestamp_updated":1603335880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1P+Qp/UCdMqtqQI="}
