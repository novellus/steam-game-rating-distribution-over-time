    reviews: "\u201CYour individual screens in Horizons are a lot more advanced than\
      \ the more simplistic fare in Bridge Crew, and while the primary screen shows\
      \ a 3D model of your ship and nearby enemies and planets, most of the action\
      \ will come from real life dialogue between the players. As the Captain frantically\
      \ gives orders, Engineering nervously warns when shields are down, Sciences\
      \ notes something unusual about an unidentified ship while Comms reports that\
      \ this very ship just threatened them.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.outerplaces.com/science-fiction/item/16699-starship-horizons-bridge-simulator-officer-aboard\"\
