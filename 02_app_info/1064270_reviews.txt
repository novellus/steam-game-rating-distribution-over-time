When playing through \"Halo: Combat Evolved\", it feels like a game that, while a bit messy and dated, held its own after twenty years past the initial release. The remastered elements of the game, mainly graphical, opened it up to being more accessible to wider audiences because, even if the visuals can be nostalgic, the title isn't very pretty in its vanilla form. I feel as though the remaster worked the best it could with a lot of the drab environments of the original \"Halo: Combat Evolved\" and made each crevice of the map at least pleasing to look at instead of like a grey blemish in one's eyes. This is not to say the world envisioned did not translate well enough with such dated graphics, some places still retained that beauty nonetheless, it's just that the remaster pushed them to their maximum potential, leaving one stunned by the revamped visual and audio enhancements implemented within.\n\n\"Halo 2: Anniversary\" takes the initial formula of its predecessor and tightens every single aspect. The environments are much more diverse and enthralling to traverse, the set pieces and theatrical moments are more compelling and well planned, and the difficulty feels more balanced than before. Once again, I played through this game on Heroic and, even if there were some moments of tedium, I never felt as though there was an excessive amount of dated barriers that frustrated me as much as in \"Halo: Combat Evolved\". Even though this game has more levels than the original, it has an overall more staggering amount creativity, leading to more interesting objectives, demanding situations, and memorable moments. Sure, \"Halo: Combat Evolved\" should be remembered for the standard it set, but \"Halo 2: Anniversary\" should be remembered for how it improved it to a nearly perfect model of what this series was and could be. \n\nOne of the most shocking aspects of this game was when I got past the first few levels and switched from the stalwart knight of humanity, Master Chief, to the imprisoned and \"disgraceful\" elite commander, The Arbiter. Sure, I had been taken into his side of the story as it played out in cutscenes during the game's progression, but when I was given the reigns of what was perceived previously as a towering enemy force in \"Halo: Combat Evolved\", it made me think more about the politics, humanity, and history going on within the walls of the game itself. Sure, plenty of forms of media went through this sort of realizing that \"any enemy could be your friend if you took the time to understand one another\" and that \"there are greater forces of evil than those we initially perceive\" way beforehand, yet it wasn't something I expected from a \"Halo\" game. In the original, I just felt as though I was blasting through one alien force to the next in order to save my people from the looming threat of annihilation, but as you are made to see, The Arbiter is doing the same exact thing for his own people, sharing similar principles, codes, and ethics to the opposite protagonist, Master Chief.\n\nIt's in these moments of critical dialogue and a lack of clear-cut black-and-white ideology that make someone think and come to a place of better understanding of others, not just those that support their predetermined biases. Sure, \"Halo 2: Anniversary\" is an exciting and adrenaline-pumping treat when the time comes to mow down those in your path in many fun and interesting ways as you fight for your beliefs, but taking those beliefs into consideration and understanding the many sides these forces are working on are what truly elevate this game beyond what came before. The great thing about it is, however, is that despite any political discussion within this game, it doesn't have to be taken into consideration at all. Its morality isn't ham-fisted or pseudo-intellectual babble handed down by some character through exposition, rather you get the messaging through your personal experience with it inside of the game. These basic moral principles are smartly worked in, leaving many walking away from a video game contemplating life a little bit more, understanding that not everyone with a different opinion is \"evil\", and that there is inherent goodness and well intentions in even those one opposes the most (or at least believes they do). Therefore, whether you are  contemplating the ideas being discussed here or just eager to fight otherworldly creatures and have fun with friends, \"Halo 2: Anniversary\" is where the series took a turn for the more ambitious, creative, and overall thrilling route.\n\n[RATING: 9.2/10]","timestamp_created":1609998168,"timestamp_updated":1609999226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwydLb7fYCcLCZwQI="}
