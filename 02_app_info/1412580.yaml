    review: An attempt was made but it does not feel like a finished game. It is a
      super easy game in a bad manner. You can find health potions and coins (that
      allows you to respawn) everywhere in the game which makes you basically not
      care about dying. Dying is also almost impossible. I found out that skeletons
      can actually hit you at the last level. It is also incredibly easy to bypass
      the opponents simply by jumping over their head. At one point I was so bored
      that I was intentionally fighting and not running away from the opponents. These
      two points really hurts the gameplay. Other than these, I really liked the game.
      The atmosphere, the music, the artsytle was very sweet. Everyone seems to complain
      about the boss being too hard but it was the only proper fight I had in the
      whole game and I enjoyed it (it is actually really hard tho I just enjoyed that).  It
      is also really short (I finished it in 51 mins). As a result, I believe the
      game needs some upgrades but for such a cheap price it is worth getting it.
