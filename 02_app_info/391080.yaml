    review: "This is an immensely underrated soundtrack. The whole game is a moody,\
      \ atmospheric experience, and the music just brings it home so utterly perfectly.\
      \ It's a mark of an amazing game soundtrack when just hearing it can bring back\
      \ some of the experiences you had with playing it...and this delivers. My favorite\
      \ - Anger Gameplay 2 - still instills the feeling of creeping claustrophobia\
      \ I felt while playing...It's awesome. \n\nWholly reccomended."
