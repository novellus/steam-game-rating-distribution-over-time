The Store page doesn't really mention it other than imply it somewhat through screenshots. I ended up having to buy Pack B too which gives the same weapon but for the Air Raider instead.\n\nThe weapon itself like other reviews say is probably the only useful DLC weapon as being a utility item it stays useful on higher difficulties. It dies easily but can be shot long distance, and attach to any surface.","timestamp_created":1530568743,"timestamp_updated":1530568820,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.741082668304443359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0tjAruQCdtaApQE="}
