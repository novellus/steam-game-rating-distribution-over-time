If you're undecided, there are better stories with reasonable twists and characterization to them.\n\nThe content warnings are vanilla sexual situations, exhibitionism, and threat of public exposure.\n\nI'd have to summarize this game as \"subtlety of a bull in a fine china shop\". Its potential is there, but it's almost-immediately scattered by the heavy-handed writing style that makes every single character not so much a character as a collection of unstable or outright psychotic traits. There are also endings, swings in the narrative progression, and decisions made by the cast that lead me to believe first the conclusion was written, and [i]then[/i] the characters were squeezed into that pathway in order to fit the roll needed of them. It'd be harder to explain without breaking into spoilers, but I have to say on a technical level it makes it hard to believe actions taken in the story routes in the game's own logic.\n\nIt was a trip to read, but I can't see myself taking a second visit to it. School Days is over there if you have a hankering for almost-absurd twists in story & plot.","timestamp_created":1606451590,"timestamp_updated":1606451590,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt77+g/YCdIeYswI="}
