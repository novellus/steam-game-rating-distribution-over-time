Graphics are decent, though the units movement doesn't match the distance traveled for the ones with feet. All in all, a piece of jump. Getting my money back.","timestamp_created":1606953459,"timestamp_updated":1606953459,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.631786704063415527","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40/v4kvYCdqDwtgI="}
