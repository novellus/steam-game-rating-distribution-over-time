Character is sliding all over the place, there is no sensivity setting or deadzone for joypad. Sometimes you will catch wall, sometimes not. Another stupid thing is that you cant push buttons when moving or jumping. I really dont mind dying literally hundreds times because of this, but level on the airplane requires insane amount of precision. Levels 1-8 are OK, last two are really hardcore, I've spent two hours of playing each one of them. And of course there is no save option in level itself. A shame, because art and music are very good for an oldschool platformer. I bet that this whole joypad problem is caused by used game engine, but broken controls take out most of the fun in such a game.","timestamp_created":1560189532,"timestamp_updated":1604486247,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4paa1yfUCfNWUwwE="}
