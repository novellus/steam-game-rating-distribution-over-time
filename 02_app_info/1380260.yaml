    review: I enjoyed this game years back, and now with 64bit I can still play using
      32bit graphics.  I remember a tip on the game to ease you in by doing some trading
      between Sol & the system next door so to speak using the warp.  The idea is
      to gain as much as possible in upgrading your initial ship before doing the
      main quest, that is the first of the 3 Campaigns you can choose from.  This
      made it easier at the beginning of the game.  I even went as far as purchasing
      the biggest ship, a Carrier.  The trouble with the Carrier is its very slow
      speed.  Makes it impossible to make the destination on time, so be careful on
      that score as the bigger the ship the slower you get even with enhancements.  I
      would also like to point out, when purchasing a new ship size put all enhanced
      engines, weapons, shields, armour, and any other pieces into storage.  Only
      leave the 3 Command deck equipment on the old ship before purchasing the new
      ship, then transfer all stored equipment to the new ship.  If you don,t, you
      will loose all of your best equipment & only have level 1 equipment on your
      new ship.  Lastly, Always save your games to cover mistakes you forgot about
      or chances you took & lost everything - experience is talking here and don't
      forget ... enjoy yourself.  While the equipment is the same as Space Empires
      V the game play is on 2d space, and you only get one ship to use, whatever ship
      you started with or purchased.
