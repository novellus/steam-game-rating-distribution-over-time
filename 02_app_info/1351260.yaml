    review: 'SCW was a shaky start. But the Axis Operations (Grand Campaign) is now
      up and running.


      Excellent mission variety, challenge, factions etc.


      Fighting the French in the Saar offensive was an absolute blast, I''ll definitely
      be going back to play through that again.'
