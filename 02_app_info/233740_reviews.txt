The game has been out for the better part of a decade with no fix, and the likelihood of a fix happening now is unfortunately very very small. It's a real shame because the game would be 10/10 if the developers just fixed the achievements.","timestamp_created":1609959350,"timestamp_updated":1609959350,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw78PD7PYCcZ+KwQI="}
