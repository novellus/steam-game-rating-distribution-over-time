I'm not sure if my sanity will continue if I keep playing this. It's hard, but is fun. I can scream, cry, and break things but still, I keep playing the game. For the price is a \"Yes!\" I couldn't say the same for maybe $10 or $15 but this price is perfect, I still have to trythe multiplayer mode, but I don't have friends, lol.\n\nI still don't see glitches or bugs but if I see something bad I will update my review.\n\nIf you like the challenges buy it, you will not regret for doing this ^^ Congrats developers!","timestamp_created":1522948182,"timestamp_updated":1522948182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/6Gyy+ICf6fHnQE="}
