You have to fit every single block shapes into a cube formation, sounds easy? WRONG! Though, it can be simple and easy to start off but it will increase as time goes on. There is charming and chill music whilst playing this. \n\nI have enjoyed playing this. Plus its a nice bonus of getting achievements on the level stamps for progress.
