    review: '[b]File Format:[/b] MP3, ranging from 278kbps to 298kbps.


      As stated in other reviews, the Merkfolk songs aren''t the full-length versions
      of the tracks, because they have been edited for length and to remove bits that
      didn''t sound thematically appropriate with the game. I''m in two minds about
      this, on one hand it doesn''t matter that much since you''ll still hear what
      you get in the game, but part of me wishes that the tracks were the full versions.


      This isn''t really a big deal-breaker though, but it does contribute to me knocking
      a few more arbitrary points off the score. The full length versions of the songs
      can be heard on Spotify (or bought [url=https://www.wyczarovane.com/merch-merkfolk-c-34.html]here[/url])
      anyway.


      Otherwise, this collection is a predominantly melancholic, and at times rousing
      (especially the Merkfolk tracks) collection that thematically fits the setting
      and mood of the game at any given time VERY well.


      Track picks:

      Merkfolk (Merkfolk)

      We''re in it Together (Carlos-Filipe Alves)

      The Burden of The Crown (Carlos-Filipe Alves)

      Poludnica (Merkfolk)
