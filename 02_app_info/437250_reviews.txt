I mildly enjoyed it for quite a few hours.  The game has essentially 3 phases and there are problems with each.  When not travelling, you spend a lot of time ploughing through text, some of which is funny and clever, but much of which is just silly.  When you go travelling, you go into the graphic / navigation mode, which is very primitive and unfortunately takes a horrendously tedious amount of time.  That is the main reason I got fed up with the game and quit.  The third phase is battle, which is not properly developed and consequently feeble.  I won all my battles without using the tiniest amount of thought or strategy and it was just boring.  Sadly I have to give it a thumbs down overall.","timestamp_created":1607561802,"timestamp_updated":1607561802,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkc6JpfYCdLHAuAI="}
