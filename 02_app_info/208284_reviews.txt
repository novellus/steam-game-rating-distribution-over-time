Here, you get a reskin, its own custom train with 5 special cars (no interior), and free 1000 points in a minimalistic, but fine little scenario. The default consist can be used in place of an HST.\nThe design & quality matches the early TS era.\nTolerable, not realistic engine sounds, something like the Settle-Carlisle 66.\nVery easy to drive, no fancy controls. You can take that as a positive or negative; it's beginner / casual quick drive friendly.\nIf you like it, you can consider either of the other 67 packs.","timestamp_created":1606556813,"timestamp_updated":1606556813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47PCPh/YCcIKotAI="}
