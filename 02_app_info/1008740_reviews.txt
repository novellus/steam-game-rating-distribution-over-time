For its sub-genre, it's alright but rather short.\n\nIsometric cube rolling game, cube is controlled by arrows / WASD (rebindable) or mouse using controls on the window. Like other isometric games with diagonal movement, it was a bit awkward, since if I forget that 'left' was for north-west instead of south-west, I might fall off the level. Since some levels require some speed maneuvers, so I felt it was necessary to play with keyboard instead of clicks - it can be learned / got used to.\n\n[h1]Level features[/h1]\n\nLevels are 3-dimensional. There are elevators, cranes, and jumping off to lower platforms. There are moving platforms, timed tile-based spike traps and line-based flame traps, and lasers to be blocked by boxes, sokoban-style but very simple. Simple spiked AI boxes might come after you in certain places, needing some speedy movement to avoid.\n\nNaturally, goal is always to reach the shiny end tile. Death or getting stuck sends you to back to the level's start.\n\nInteresting feature are what I call \"companion cubes\", if you will. Green cubes will follow you around. Purple cubes stick to your cube and have to be rotated around to avoid obstacles. Both special cubes may activate certain switches to open path forward.\n\nThe companion cubes and blocking lasers present some of the more interesting puzzles, while there are many timed obstacle courses of precision and patience as well. None of the levels are particularly difficult or challenging though - [b]this is a casual puzzler.[/b]\n\n[h1]A short casual puzzler[/h1]\n\nIn the free version, there are 24 levels. Steam version adds 12 more to the total of 36 levels, but it is still not a long experience. My total playtime to completion amounted to about 30 minutes.\n\nThat's quite short. While it's enjoyable, I recommend getting it on sale.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9997062/]~Twistorian Curator~[/url]","timestamp_created":1595120126,"timestamp_updated":1595120126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.601285576820373535","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg7GksvMCdPGWlgI="}
