    short_description: Experience the biggest expansion to This War of Mine, where
      you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive
      in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger
      from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war
      seen from an entirely new angle.

    review: I bought this a long time ago, but I am not able to access the contents
      of the dlc. I think I might've gotten another one in the past but that would've
      been years ago with similar issues which just made me give up on the game. I
      like the game that I can play it's really great, it's just unfortunate that
      whenever I try to play or download it, it just prompts me to another screen
      trying to get me to buy it again. Even though it says it's in my library. I'd
      recommend this if I could play it because I'm sure it's just as good as the
      original.
