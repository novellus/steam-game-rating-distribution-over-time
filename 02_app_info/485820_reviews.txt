And it will give u some quota on fast forward every day(real time). Of course u can only wait, when the quota is used up.\nIt seems that the temperature in the game is the true temperature of Alaska.\nSo the easiest time to start playing this game is summer, and play it in winter is also interesting.\nThe biggest problem is that it has many BUG which made the game crash 3 times in 2 days(it made me feel bad :<, and i dont know how to trigger the BUGs). PLZ fix them(actually i dont know whether the developers are still updating the game :P).\nIn a word, i actually like this game very much because of the hard-core.\nHappy Chinese New Year and wish everything goes well with u","timestamp_created":1581063337,"timestamp_updated":1581063553,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/ueuj/ACebHX8AE="}
