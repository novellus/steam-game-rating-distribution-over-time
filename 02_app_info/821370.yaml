    review: 'At it''s current 50% off, yeah I think it''s a reasonable buy for a casual
      bating game.

      Not a sim buy any stretch, but a fun way to kill half an hour or so.


      The cons would be:

      1) having to fiddle with re-centering your view to get a reasonable batting
      position. It''d be nice to have a more direct, in game method to move yourself
      in relation to the plate. Like a number of other people, the default position
      has me standing almost on the plate it feels and I wind up fouling to the left
      - long hits, but fouls no less.

      2) Pitches seem to come in quite low. at 6ft tall I feel i''m swinging at knee
      height. I''ve never played or even really watched baseball though, perhaps that''s
      normal?


      Those two little niggles aside, overall it is a fun game.'
