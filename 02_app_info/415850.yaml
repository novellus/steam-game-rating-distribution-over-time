    review: I don't like to post negative reviews but this game was really on the
      fence for me. I finished it and got all of the achievements but... I don't know.
      It's short, which is fine. I finished the game in a morning. I don't even really
      dislike the story so much as the writing and how flat the ending felt. For a
      dollar on sale it's fine, i'm not saying don't get it. The thing that I took
      issue with is how you are graded at the end for how many wrong choices you make
      when the choices very rarely give any context to what would be the correct decision.
      The writing towards the end is very strange too, the "misunderstanding" makes
      no sense to me. Maybe I just don't get it but like... i'd misunderstand too.
      Or did maybe. Who knows. It is kinda diet horror, if you want creepy get Corpse
      Party, not this. It had me in the middle of the game while I was pretty into
      it but both the beginning and the end are really meh. All of that being said
      i'd check out their other games if I saw them, there needs to be an "eh"  options
      for reviews lol.
