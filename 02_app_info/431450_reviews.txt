I can only really say I recommend this game if the developers continue to work on it, as in its current state it leaves a lot to be desired. The building mechanic is unique in its own way, but leaves me wanting more to create. There are creatures, but none that really stand out. All I can really say about it in its current state is I hope more comes of it, and it can help cure an hour or so of boredom.","timestamp_created":1609859868,"timestamp_updated":1609859868,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1oTI6fYCfIXdwAI="}
