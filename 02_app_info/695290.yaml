    review: "Just bought and already played 13hrs. Not a game you can just pick up\
      \ and play. You gotta go practice your shots, especially putting. Very frustrating\
      \ at first but once i learned the nuance of putting with a mouse, it is very\
      \ rewarding, You must putt out everything, so pratice. Just like real life.\
      \ Anyone complaining about putting, they havent spent time going to putting\
      \ green. \nFor me, its very addicting and man, I love the announcer, sounds\
      \ like an actual person reacting to your shots, along with ambient nature sounds,\
      \ totally recommended!"
