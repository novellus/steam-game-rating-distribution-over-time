If you like this kind of thing, you will probably love this game too.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1606415345,"timestamp_updated":1606415345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565183579921722412","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41pz0gvYCdPLdsgI="}
