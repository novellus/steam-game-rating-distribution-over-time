    review: 'I cannot believe that they continue to have this up on Steam and actually
      mention BDH package, as though that even matters anymore. If the main game is
      dead, this should be pulled. Skin the horse already.


      Cortex app is non-functional so lost all access to the digital card collection,
      which at least had some value since we paid to access it. Must be nice to take
      money and then take away what was sold....I hate EA.'
