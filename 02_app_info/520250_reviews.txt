Last played in 2016 for only 8 minutes. Yikes.\n\nI reinstalled and started it up because I honestly couldn't remember anything about it. \n\nThis is basically a $5 game that should be $0.99 or less. It's not very polished and there is very little to the actual game itself. \n\nAliens have invaded and you run in circles searching the small handful of buildings on a farm to try and find dynamite so you can blow up these big weird rocks(eggs?). Once you do that, the level is complete and it starts you all over again but on a different game. I almost fell asleep while playing. \n\nSkip this game, imho. You won't really be missing anything at all. \n\nIf you must buy it, I recommend that you do so on a big sale or you run the risk of feeling bad for being overcharged. There are a gajillion better $5 games out there.","timestamp_created":1579435072,"timestamp_updated":1579440188,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwppX+3u8Cdbnp7AE="}
