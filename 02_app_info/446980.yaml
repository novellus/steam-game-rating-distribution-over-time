      \ Scythe</h2><br>It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the\

      \ as \u201CThe Factory,\u201D which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs,\
      \ has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.<br><br>In\
      \ Scythe, each player represents a fallen leader attempting to restore their\
      \ honor and lead their faction to power in Eastern Europa. Players conquer territory,\
      \ enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and\
      \ activate monstrous mechs.<br><br>Each player begins the game with different\
      \ resources (strength, victory points, movement capabilities, and popularity),\
      \ their choice of several faction-specific abilities, and a hidden goal. Starting\
      \ positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction\u2019s uniqueness\
      \ and the asymmetrical nature of the game.<br><br>Scythe gives players almost\
      \ complete control over their fate. Other than each player\u2019s individual\
      \ hidden objective card, the only elements of luck are encounter cards that\
      \ players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands\
      \ and combat cards that give you a temporary boost in combat. Combat is also\
      \ driven by choices, not luck or randomness.<br><br>Scythe uses a streamlined\
      \ action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at\
      \ a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct\
      \ conflict, there is no player elimination, nor can units be killed or destroyed.<br><br>Every\
      \ part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade\
      \ actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position\
      \ on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs\
      \ to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater\
      \ types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a\
      \ sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players\
      \ improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing\
      \ one faction multiple times.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About Invaders from Afar</h2><br>While\
      \ empires rise and fall in Eastern Europa, the rest of the world takes notice.\
      \ Two distant factions, Albion and Togawa, send emissaries to scout the land\
      \ and employ their own distinct styles of conquering.<br><br>This expansion\
      \ for Scythe adds 2 news factions (Albion and Togawa) and the ability to play\
