The closest games I would compare it to are the Bomberman series and Killer Queen Black.  \n\nYour character avatar has no impact on your move set, which consists of punching, grabbing/activating an item, and throwing an item. Your associated Ancient One cult (Cthulhu, Dagon, and Nyarlathotep right now) does have a slightly altered move set, which are fitting for the time-limited avatar transformations (similar to a Smash Bros. Smash Ball). The game moves at such a frantic, hilariously fast and fun pace that it doesn't need more than this.  \n\nThe maps are small king/queen-of-the-hill arenas, and your goal is to knock everyone off the map arena. The strategy element comes in from the weapon/item variety, which makes great use of rock-paper-scissors for the 5-second showdown fight. \n\nThe single-player and cooperative content is there, but is still being worked on for a longer experience. What is there now is amazing and immersive. My only \"complaint\" as of July 9, '20 is that the story is short (note, this is early access). For Overcooked gamers, think of it as only having worlds 1-x and 2-x finalized for playing for the story campaign (there are more \"worlds\" being worked on). A solo gamer would enjoy this game as a fully released product. A solo gamer that likes the Cthulhu mythos would very likely enjoy the game now. There is no online cooperative element; it is currently local-coop only.\n\nCompetitive multiplayer matches are short and sweet. They're not quite as short as Mario Party or WarioWare games, and are closer to a Bomberman or Invisigun Heroes game experience. Each map is out to kill the players in a uniquely different way, so it's hard for a match to have a single person taking a huge lead. Regarding my earlier reference to Killer Queen Black, the Ancient One that your avatar worships and transforms into is very similar to the Soldier Bee mechanic. You have a limited experience in the \"evolved state\", and each transformation will alter your strategy.","timestamp_created":1594345857,"timestamp_updated":1594345857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4/uOam/MCfsiZlAI="}
