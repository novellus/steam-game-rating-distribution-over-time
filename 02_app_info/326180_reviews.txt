Very old graphics and the puzzles are just weird. If you put it on advanced mode you will just be clicking randomly all over the place. \nI also hate how you have to walk your character around. \nIf you are using windows 10 you will also need to put it into compatibility mode to get it to open. There are some instructions in support.","timestamp_created":1609465785,"timestamp_updated":1609465785,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qt3o3fYCf6OivwI="}
