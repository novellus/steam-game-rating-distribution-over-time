      /><br><br><strong>A New Kind of Roguelite Shooter.</strong> It''s time to bring
      roguelites to the next level! Rogue Star Rescue is a unique mix of bullet hell
      roguelite and tower defense games. We''ve added strong strategy elements to
      the all-out insanity of bullet hell shooters. The action is smooth, the gameplay
      is challenging, the story is complex and nonlinear. It''s a game you''ll get
      sucked into and will end up spending months exploring the multiple intricacies
      and outcomes. Keeping the game fun well past the 50-hour mark is our core design
      focus.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1410190/extras/online-couch-coop.gif?t=1600450527"
      /><br><strong>Online Co-op! </strong>Games like this are better with friends.
      Connect with our community online to explore the RSR galaxy with up to 4 people
      simultaneously! You won''t find this feature in the other popular roguelite
      shooters. Progress with your friends and unlock the secrets of the galaxy as
      a team. Along with exclusive multiplayer content, there will always be something
      new to discover.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1410190/extras/secret_room_toxic.gif?t=1600450527"
      /><br><br><strong>Couch Co-op!</strong><br>Having a friend over? Team up with
      them the old fashioned way! Share a screen and blast your way through the RSR
      universe. No internet connection required.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1410190/extras/airstrike_punky_opt.gif?t=1600450527"
      /><br><br><strong>Fight with your Team! </strong>You won''t be able to stop
      the Rogue Star alone. Rescue your teammates along the way and they''ll fight
      beside you against the evil aliens. Even in single-player mode, your quest is
      interactive and full of hilarious dialogue, not just another lonely solo-mission.<br><br><img

      /><br><strong>The Rogue Star. </strong>A massive Rogue Star has formed from
      the cosmos and is on a direct collision path with us! It threatens to vaporize
      everything. Leaders from planets around the galaxy have assembled a top team
      of fighters to stop the Rogue Star at all costs. Choose your own non-linear
      path through the galaxy and explore each of the 10+ planets carefully.<br><br><img

      /><br><br><strong>Your Choices, Your Ending. </strong>Choose which planets to
      travel to and make important decisions that decide the fate of the galaxy! Depending
      on the path you take, there are dozens of different outcomes. The Rogue Star
      can destroy the entire galaxy, be reflected to the enemy''s galaxy, swallowed
      by a black hole, sent far away through a galactic wormhole, and dozens of other
      hilarious possibilities in between. It''s really up to you to make the right
      decisions based on the outcome you want to see, and who you want to rescue.<br><img

      /><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1410190/extras/trap_setup_office.gif?t=1600450527"
      /><br><strong>Traps and Defense.</strong> While exploring each planet you must
      gather traps and resources to face an epic mini-boss and his waves of minions
      at the end of each level. Strategically placed traps slow, block, push, spike,
      burn, freeze, and shoot at enemies. Traps can be upgraded to make themselves
      stronger. Managing trap inventory and usage intelligently is critical to your
      success in the game, especially during the later levels.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1410190/extras/fire_denese_opt.gif?t=1600450527"
      /><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1410190/extras/heroes.gif?t=1600450527"
      /><br><strong>Heroes.</strong> Choose from one of the elite team members with
      a unique set of special abilities, each with a personal drive to save their
      home planet from annihilation. Unlock new players by achieving specific outcomes.<br><br><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1410190/extras/heroes_select.gif?t=1600450527"
      /><br><br><strong>Level Up! </strong>Unlike traditional roguelikes, we''ve added
      a persistent leveling up system. With each level you earn attribute points that
      can improve strength, speed, health, traps, and luck. The more you fight, the
      more experience points you earn, the stronger you get. Build your player wisely.<br><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1410190/extras/banner-steam-weapon-right__1_.gif?t=1600450527"
      /><br><strong>Guns and Items.</strong> Discover and unlock hundreds of unique
      items! We''re thrilled to present a wide variety of guns from advanced space
      weaponry, to historical weapons, and everything in between. On top of carrying
      your main gun, you''ll have an arsenal of powerful grenades ready at the tap
      of a button. You''ll also be accompanied by upgradeable buddies, each with their
      own unique fighting abilities (Did you know there are dragons in space?).<br><br><img

      or a seasoned dungeon explorer, we''ve got you covered! Choose Wimpy, Normal,
      or Insane mode to challenge your skills and to keep the fun going. Note for
      the avid bullet-hell gamers: even the developers have a hard time beating the
      game on Insane mode ;)<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1410190/extras/difficuly_modes_alienhip_bh.gif?t=1600450527"
