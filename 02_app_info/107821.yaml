    review: "Wer von Rochard nicht genug bekommen kann erh\xE4lt hier noch einmal\
      \ vier Level mit unterschiedlichen Mechaniken, die sich anspruchsvoller als\
      \ das Hauptspiel gestalten. Insgesamt ben\xF6tigt man sicherlich nur eine knappe\
      \ halbe Stunde zum L\xF6sen, deshalb auch nur eine Empfehlung f\xFCr absolute\
      \ Fans."
