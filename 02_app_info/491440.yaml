      /><br><br><strong><i>Why did I make this game?</i></strong><br>Well... I really
      wanted a game where I could be a dragon. Most dragon games aren''t really about
      the dragons at all. They''re about ... people ... that''s right. And people
      aren''t dragons, are they? It''s time to have a new dragon game that''s about,
      you know: DRAGONS!<br><br><strong><i>What are real dragons like?</i></strong><br>They''re
      not your pets... or your animal friends. They''re wild, majestic, ferocious
      forces of nature. But, they''re not mindless. No - they''re very smart... and
      clever... (well... sometimes.) Real dragons have character, personality, depth.
      You could even say there''s a little human in every dragon. ( ... or maybe that
      depends on their diet.)<br><br><strong><i>Why should you get this game?</i></strong><br>Well...
      if you want to be a dragon - you should totally get it!<br><br>Please, don''t
      lose this chance to eat absolutely everyone!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/491440/extras/grossed-face.png?t=1491839770"
