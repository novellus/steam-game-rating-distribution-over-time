    review: 'Episodes are replayable, gives you extra materials (also obtain some
      materials that are harder to get than others), experience, and friendship.

      I''ve also found that all but two of them so far take more time than normal
      scout missions, so you''ll get more than you expect.

      It''s worth it, especially since you save three dollars.'
