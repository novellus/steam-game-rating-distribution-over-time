      \ Full 3D visualization will give you the inside view of your units\u2019 actions.\

      \ may lead to cataclysms and natural disasters. Try to tame big wildfires spreading\

      \ CPR, or keep your nerves while encountering an annoying prankster.<h2 class=\"\

      \ of or those who need your help. Sometimes your mistakes will only be followed\
      \ by a reprimanding e-mail, sometimes they\u2019ll influence your own life.<br>You\
