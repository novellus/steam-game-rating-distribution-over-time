Even some royalty free sound effects alongside a basic ambient background track could go a long way in setting an atmosphere.\nI found a few spelling errors, “defense” was spelled “defence” on a particular item.\nThere’s some additional minor critiques I had, but beyond aesthetics, the game functions as it should; and controller support is a plus.\nI hope you can fix these things and add some more stuff in the future; If you do I could easily reccomend the game to others. You’re headed in the right direction and with a few refinements, I think this could be a really additive rouge-like.\n","timestamp_created":1530168733,"timestamp_updated":1530168733,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557046949863433838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41L3KouQCepq/pAE="}
