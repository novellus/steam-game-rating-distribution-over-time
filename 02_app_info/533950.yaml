    review: Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad game at all by any means. However,
      I think it could go for just a tiny little bit more polish than how it is at
      this very moment. Bee stings are hard to avoid, controller support seems a bit
      unfinished, and while the game does look good on its own I kinda feel as if
      the game itself is locked at 30fps despite my Steam layout showing 60fps on-screen.
      But nitpicks aside, this game is actually kinda fun, it's almost like a Zelda-type
      game where you can do whatever the hell you want. If you like those kinda games,
      go ahead and give this one a try.
