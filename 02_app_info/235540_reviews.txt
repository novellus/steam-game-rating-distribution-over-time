The game is just as pristine and unique as when it came out, shedding the skin of \"Left 4 Dead ripoff' right out of the gate with some really meaty melee combat and some really wonderful visuals. A little short, but I guess that's why there are like 6 DLC packs for it that are definitely worth it. 4-stacking in this game is fun as hell and when the samey source-engine gunplay of L4D2 starts to wear thin, this is a much different but equally satisfying co-op experience. Definitely a recommend, much simpler and easier to get into than its sequel. Big hopes for the upcoming 40K version, as fatshark are very faithful to the world and the hilarious characters fit perfectly into the overzealous and grandiose tapestry of warhammer.\n\nGet it for your mates!","timestamp_created":1610011031,"timestamp_updated":1610011031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43daI7vYCf5idwQI="}
