    review: "i recommend this game for players who have experience with other RPG-type\
      \ games, as there's no instructions for basic play. There are only two play\
      \ modes:  timid or gangbusters. Since i have some experience, i chose the latter.\
      \ \n\nWhen the game first opened, i had to use the arrow keys and space bar,\
      \ but then the mouse control kicked in. It took me a while to understand most\
      \ of the damage symbols used during fights, so that was a challenge in itself.\n\
      \ni enjoyed the dystopian sci-fi theme. There is colorful, profuse bleeding\
      \ during fights and dead bodies, esp in the first location, but the curse words\
      \ are not prolific. Pristine's attributes are unveiled in a teeny bikini at\
      \ times.\n\nThe game held my interest, and I got stuck only in one area, probably\
      \ because I decided not to draw a map for it. Being methodical in looking for\
      \ exits got me thru.\n\nThe dialog is very easy to read and graphics are good.\
      \ If there are secret rooms, I didn't find any."
