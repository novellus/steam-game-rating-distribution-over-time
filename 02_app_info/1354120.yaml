    review: Same review I gave Mythical Monsters.  The base game needs polish, but
      the expansions are out-right game breaking.   My gaming group has played the
      base version to completion a number of times, but tonight with the expansions
      we didn't make it past the first age.  Seems to have the hardest time during
      battles when figures are moving into the territory at stake.  It locked up and
      timed us out 3 times, unacceptable really.
