    developer_response: 'Hello,


      thanks for your nice review ! :-)


      Here a few things :

      1) Most women players gave their weight when they have turned pro, so around
      16 years old, if not earlier ; so it''s hard to gather data about their real
      weight.

      I boosted Serena''s weight for the next update, though, but she''ll still be
      slim enough compared to her real counterpart... :-)

      You can easily change that in the player base from the Modding SDK, though :
      https://www.managames.com/Forum/topic11-31376.php


      2) The strike animation assignation was still the one I did when there were
      very few animations in the game... >_<

      I just tuned that to improve the variety for the next update, thanks to your
      report ! :-)


      3) For the junior phase, normally you should need to win some matches to get
      enough XP to train efficiency your mental skills ; maybe you play in a very
      easy difficulty level ? If not, could you send me a Bug Report the next time
      you have finished to build up a Junior player without playing any match ? (right
      before turning Pro)


      4) Top Junior players should be indeed relatively close to Pros. In the lower-level
      tournaments, it''s more of a mixed bag, though. They start at 14 yo, and at
      this age, not all Juniors are near Pro level ; and the 16 or 17 yo ones who
      didn''t make it to the top Junior level aren''t that good either... The game
      might exacerbate the differences, though... :-)


      5) Forms are explained here : https://www.managames.com/tennismanager/doc/TeManager-Tennis_Game.html#tiredness

      I consider there are 4 types of energy :

      - the breath, which is the one used when you sprint ; you can recover it in
      a matter of seconds or minutes at worst

      - the energy, which is the one used over a match ; you can recover it in less
      than a couple of hours

      - the short term form, which is the one used from match to match ; you can recover
      it in a few days

      - the long term form, which is the one used over the months ; you need a long
      time to recover it

      I agree it''s complex, but I think it paints a decently realistic picture of
      how it works in real. :-)


      6) Some things aren''t in a tooltip because it''s just way easier for me to
      manage only the documentation (and it''s still not too easy), plus it helps
      to keep the in-game text not too long, so people can translate the game without
      too much hassle.


      7) 0% vs 100% topspin skill on clay brings a 20% relative bonus for most other
      skills ; so, on clay, a 100% topspin player with 50% in all his skills will
      be equivalent to a 0% topspin player with 60% in all his skills.

      I think it''s fair enough. The issue is that right now in the 3D match the bonus
      is likely closer to 5 or 10% and thus it creates a discrepancy between the results
      of the 3D matches and the text matches. (I hope to tune that in the coming months)


      8) Skills go down (and up) a bit more slowly in the higher difficulty levels.
      In easier levels, it allows the user to make mistakes and correct them more
      quickly.


      9) Serve speed records are very seldomly reached (ie: less than once per match)
      and thus are hard to integrate into the simulation except by pure raw chance.

      Thus said, the maximal woman serve speed should be 120mph, which isn''t too
      far from the records.


      10) It''s true that at some point you''ll make a ton of money and you won''t
      have anything to do with it, but the top trainers are very expensive so it takes
      a little while to reach that state. :-)


      11) There''s a penalty to be in debt : you can''t hire trainers. And you pay
      interest to the bank, so the longer you''re in debt, the longer before you''ll
      be able to hire a trainer, which is mandatory to reach the top rankings (except
      maybe in the easiest difficulty level).


      12) When you create a player with no other player from that country, the game
      should switch a low ranked player to that country. If it''s not the case, please
      send me a Bug Report.

      Note: in that case, your country will be in the Country Cup qualies, not the
      main draw, which starts on the main draw''s 2nd round.

    review: 'This is going to be a very long review. The TL;DR is buy this game. Now!


      I really enjoy playing this game. There are so many routes to take when approaching
      matches, such as controlling your own created player and molding them into a
      superstar player, recruiting AI players and reviving their careers, recruiting
      juniors, being an omnipotent coach and adjusting your player''s tactics during
      a live match, using the text match feature to sim through matches quickly, or
      sitting back and watching the AIs battle each other in a live 3D match. I like
      the variety this provides, as playing through hundreds of matches with a roster
      of three or more players gets tiring over time. The controls in game are intuitive
      and easy to get used to, and the difficulty is very adjustable to suit your
      playing needs. With a full roster of real life players as well as many generated
      players combined with a long, two decade-long season, you will be able to enjoy
      rising through the ranks until you reach number 1. To top it off, this game
      has modding support and a very active developer that responds to community questions
      and feedback! I highly recommend this game to tennis fans and sports management
      fans.


      That said, with all its positives, there are quite a few cons that I hope get
      fixed in future updates.


      Player

      -Player models are very basic. The weight statistic doesn''t account properly
      for different body sizes. For example, Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka look
      like twigs in game. The height stat doesn''t do much justice to real human body
      shapes either.

      -You can''t adjust faces, only eye color. This means everyone looks the same
      up close.

      -You can select your stroke animations, but only when creating your player initially.
      There is no "legitimate" way to choose a different backhand animation, switch
      between two-handed or one-handed backhand/forehand, etc. (There is a roundabout
      way to do it by exporting your character, editing them in the quick play mode,
      and then exporting that character''s outfit code, using that new code for your
      career player, but it really should be possible within the career mode.)

      -There are quite a few animations derived from real players, but your AI opponents
      will almost always use the generic animations that don''t look nearly as good.


      Junior Career

      -There doesn''t seem to be a point in playing junior tournaments when starting
      with a junior player. You have to juggle between training stats and training
      potentials, ideally with getting the potentials for all skills as close to maxed
      out as possible. If you focus on stats mostly and try to win junior tourneys,
      you''ll sacrifice potentials and end up with a weak pro player when they age
      up. I''ve found that it''s not even worth playing any junior tournaments and
      instead, I only train my junior''s potentials up to max and then go pro as quickly
      as possible to train the stats themselves. This is obviously backwards.

      -Junior opponents are either hilariously weak or way too strong. Watch real
      life footage of juniors playing tennis and you''ll swear they''re pros already.
      They have excellent control, power, and awareness. In game, juniors are very
      mediocre and reminiscent of recreational amateurs at the local park, or they
      are impossible to defeat.


      Player Training and Stats

      -Some of the stats are rather ambiguous. For example, what does short term form
      do? What does long term form do? The in-game tooltips say  "short term form
      is limited by long term form," but what does that mean? After trial and error,
      you find out that you can''t train without short term form, and if you run out
      of it during a match, you get some kind of injury and automatically forfeit.
      If so, why do you have a separate energy stat in matches?

      -What''s the difference between precision and consistency? You have to read
      the documentation to find out what those stats do, but an in-game tooltip would
      be much easier than having to find it in the game manual.

      -Many of the mind stats are confusing and require reading the manual to understand.
      Some of them don''t seem to affect you when you play manually vs. coaching the
      AI, so you can avoid spending time training them. But then all of a sudden your
      player suddenly flops in a match and you''re left wondering why they played
      so poorly even though you have maxed out skills. All of it comes down to mental
      training skills, another set of skills that you have to constantly babysit or
      otherwise lose matches constantly.

      -Text sim places far too much importance on the topspin stat. Players with near
      maxed out stats lose to much worse ranked players with horrible stats almost
      solely due to topspin. I get it, mastering topspin is very important. But being
      an objectively mediocre player with average 50 stats but maxed out topspin will
      near consistently dominate anyone on clay in the text sim, which is just strange.

      -Skills deteriorate way too quickly. You''re often juggling between which stats
      you want to fall and which ones you want to maintain, yet you will face several
      AI opponents with 100% stats in multiple categories.


      Serves

      -I''ve addressed this in the Steam forums before, but female player services
      are way too weak in game. I have a female player with maxed out height, strength,
      service power, accuracy, and precision, but without modding, I can''t serve
      faster than 113 MPH with her. Real life serves are based on innate strength,
      swing technique, ball toss, body rotation, and importantly, player height. Essentially,
      being taller means you can hit the ball "down" into the court instead of "up",
      giving you access to much more devastating angles for your opponents to deal
      with and greater overall speeds. Consistently, taller players serve faster and
      deadlier than shorter players, but in game, everyone seems to serve the same.
      With real-life records of female serves going up to 130 MPH, I don''t see why
      my player can never hit that without modding the game.

      -Return of serve is lacking. Due to missing animations, players do normal groundstrokes
      and sometimes unrealistically slide across the ground to return a serve. I''d
      like to see some diving animations as well as any other "uncomfortable position"
      strikes.


      Career Mode

      -Money is quickly becomes very useless. There is no penalty for going into debt,
      and once you become a consistent champion, there is nothing to spend it on.
      No new outfits, no homes or cars, no ability to donate to charity, etc.

      -The "reputation" system doesn''t have much effect on the career mode. What
      it does is give you access to better sponsorships. There is no in game social
      media, no fans, no ability to partner with a racket brand or shoe brand and
      create your own custom merchandise, etc.

      -The country cups will never work if you select an obscure country. For example,
      a player I created from Jamaica will never be able to participate in the women''s
      tour Gibson Cup because she''s the only Jamaican on tour. All selectable nations
      should be represented in the ranking boards for the tour, not just North America,
      Western Europe, the Slavic nations, and East Asia.


      With all that said, TEM2 is still a fantastic game and one which I will continuously
      support through playing and giving positive feedback. The SOLE developer is
      still going strong after all these years, creating an excellent tennis franchise
      that rivals some studio developed tennis games! This is easily a 9.5/10 game
      for me! BUY IT!'
