Next combo the undead poison immunity with a (separate DLC) globadier hero for some punishing AoE damage that stacks up quickly on enemies who like to gang up. Then use your vampires and globadier to attack with ranged weapons to provide support for your zombies or to take advantage of chokepoints.\n\nI'm particularly enjoying this warband and finding it easier to discover synergies between units. Haven't played through more than the first story mission, but it was fairly interesting. Quite different from the usual maps.","timestamp_created":1477896839,"timestamp_updated":1597993647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.66460806131362915","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uf/1h/QCd/W4ZA=="}
