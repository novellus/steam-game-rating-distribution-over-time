And we also like to play visual novels especially the ones with erotic and lesbian content.<br><br>When we finished our last virtual reality game, we asked ourselves:  What if we could combine<br> the elements we love most about anime and visual novels in a full interactive VR experience.  <br>And that is exactly what Iragon is about.<br><br>You play the game as Darick, a poor kid from a small village.  Everything for him changes when <br>he meets Erika, a bisexual girl who gets ambushed by soldiers of the Empire. <br>To help her, you must learn to use your magic, but on your quest to bring her home <br>safe you will have to journey into a dangerous frozen world.  Along the way, you will <br>battle enemy soldiers, undead skeletons, and perhaps cross paths with seductive creatures <br>of the frozen land while you unlock new erotic adventures with the beautiful Erika.<br><br>So this is ultimately a game about living out a high fantasy adventure, with a strong emphasis <br>on putting the player in control.  The game is meant to be experienced in VR, but we dedicated <br>an equal amount of care in delivering a standard version that will work for players who do not <br>have a VR headset.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features<\/h2>Weather you play in VR or not, you can expect of us to deliver:<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> A beautiful love interest<br><\/li><li> Interactive experiences with your love interest<br><\/li><li> Different outfits for the love interest<br><\/li><li> Voice acting<br><\/li><li> Motion captured animations<br><\/li><li> A dynamic combat system that features both magic and melee;<br><\/li><li> Destructible environments;<br><\/li><li> A dialogue choice system that influences the response you get.<\/li><\/ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STORY:<\/h2>Be the hero, live the story, and go on an adventure of a lifetime while you immerse yourself fully <br>in the world of Iragon, with a complete animated story and full voice acted cast.
