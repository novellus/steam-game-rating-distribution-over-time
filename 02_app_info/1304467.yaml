    review: 'the 1938 stock/class 483 is nice, but there are some problems

      1. buttons at the guard panel are hard to aim and press

      2. the door close beeping sound is too loud

      3. only 1 car has guard panels

      4. the door closes too fast

      the map...the water doesnt look good

      and the price is too expensive'
