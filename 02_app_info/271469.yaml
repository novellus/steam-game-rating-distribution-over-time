    review: "Very great DLC! All five songs came in as soon as I logged off and updated\
      \ Rocksmith. For those, like me, who don't know, when you buy the DLC, make\
      \ sure Rocksmith has a chance to update. I was so excited that I bought them\
      \ and logged in the game and wondered where they were at. Simple mistake and\
      \ update took ten seconds. Love this band and always have been a fan since the\
      \ 90's! \n\n\"3AM\" DOES need a Capo. The only downside I can think of is that\
      \ Rocksmith 2014 isn't really optimized for Capo use. I tune it correctly using\
      \ the precision tuner and the second after I put the capo in the right spot,\
      \ it doesn't recognize the half-step tuning difference. Sometimes I had to loosen\
      \ the Capo a bit for some strings, other strings were tuned fine already. Even\
      \ during the song, some strings were fine while others were having trouble.\
      \ \n\nBottom line is that I would certainly recommend this DLC to any post-grunge\
      \ fan looking to get their fix on a great band! Remember to update Rocksmith\
      \ 2014 after the purchase to see your songs if it's not already on auto-updates.\
      \ Make sure you have a capo and make sure you're ready to log hours into this\
      \ game after getting this DLC!"
