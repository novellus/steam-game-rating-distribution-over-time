Essentially Vegas is about a team of specialists like Delta Force, SAS, GSG-9. The player controls two other A.I to breach rooms and other areas of bad guys, in this case, terrorists who have taken over Las Vegas. The game is split into three sections. The first, is a city in Mexico, the second is Las Vegas (Majority of the game) and the third is Hoover dam. The player can early on in the game choose a sniper rifle, and can use it for 95 percent of the game. \n\nThe load out of gear for the sniper. Early on in the game and during the game, the player will find a green box, which is where the player can choose their load out. Equally important, after nearly every mission, the rest of your team will pick the player up in a Black Hawk helicopter, this is the other opportunity where the player can get their gear. \n\nSniper rifles and scopes and other gear. In the game there is a total of four sniper rifles. My favourite being the M40A1 (a classic USMC sniper rifle). This sniper rifle is the most accurate with one shot kills. However, it is not realistic, having a magazine (in reality it did not). It can come with a variety of scopes. However, they are the same scopes for all the sniper rifles. The best scope is the 12x scope (Which is not realistic, the cross hairs sort of resemble the cross hairs of a Dragunov). The real M40A1 had a Unertl 10x. For a sniper, a sidearm and grenades are essential, there are a variety of both. For example for sidearms, the M9 Beretta or the Glock 18 and for grenades, the incendiary, smoke and stun. \n\nSo if you are a gamer who loves to be a sniper, specifically in a hostage rescue single player campaign, then this is the game for you.","timestamp_created":1609978446,"timestamp_updated":1609978446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi7CM7fYCc+aSwQI="}
