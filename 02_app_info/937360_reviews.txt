There is more to this combat, but I have not found a way to access this. Objective is a library in the south, but going directly south led me to two new towns containing no library, or anything interesting. \nBoss-appearances are not telegraphed, and so you'll just be fucked at the end of exploring something. The bosses I encountered are regular mobs with higher health and the same mechanics. There is also this fun thing called curse, that procs rarely, but lets you hit yourself, which might take a third of your life of just kill you from full. \nLost gold on death cannot be recovered as far as I can discern. Escaping enemies who will kill you given 20 turns (because your stats aren't high engough) doesn't seem to work, even with allegedly 25x higher chance to escape from an item/move. \nThe game was clearly made without an artist, and looks the part, including pixelated images displayed at the wrong resolution. I can empathize, but nothing of the atmosphere makes me look past this. \nNothing here besides a failed attempt at combat mechanics and atmosphere says soulslike. The two crashes I encountered are a known issue, but nevertheless amazing for the otherwise stable RPGMaker-Engine. \n\nI won't refund this, because I like the idea, but it's shit and this idea has been done much better elsewhere.","timestamp_created":1597420244,"timestamp_updated":1597424838,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw15T89vMCdZO3mwI="}
