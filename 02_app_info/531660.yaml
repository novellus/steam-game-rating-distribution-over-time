    review: "This is only relevant for the beta.\n\nThe new version is well worth\
      \ a look and is a definite improvement over the first iteration although I was\
      \ pretty happy with the existing game on the whole so please don't take that\
      \ as a huge negative for the original.\n\nI enjoyed the new area even with the\
      \ few minor technical issues. Asset flaws/missing, animal AI is still not improved\
      \ yet and jumping can be tricky so getting stuck in terrain going places maybe\
      \ you shouldn't is easy to do. Not much different from the original in that\
      \ at the moment but I am assured those are being worked on. EA. 'Nuff said.\n\
      \nI recommend trying it out. If you enjoyed the original you will really like\
      \ the new one. It's definitely missing features from the original but not so\
      \ much that you will miss them. They have said for a long time they were not\
      \ happy with the way the original game started and I sort of see what they mean\
      \ but I was never that unhappy with it. \nIf they redo the original as well\
      \ as the beta then it's going to be awesome.\n\nHopefully more content will\
      \ come out for it soon. I am a bit tired of the whole EA thing and how many\
      \ unfinished games are still for sale after years and years in EA (My games\
      \ library is full of them) but this is one I will still follow even after almost\
      \ 4 years. (3yrs 11m 7d)\n\nSo it's a thumbs up for the beta version and also\
      \ a thumbs up for the original even with it's flaws. I enjoy them both.\n\n\n\
      \n"
