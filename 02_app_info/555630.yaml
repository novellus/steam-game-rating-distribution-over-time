    review: "Ate a Godly Potato to try and save myself from dying and only recovered\
      \ 30 MP.\nAte Tasty Crisps to heal a little bit of MP and recovered 60 MP.\n\
      Ate a Hot Potato and got poisoned.\nAte a Premium Potato and recovered 999 MP\n\
      \nThis game is cute, and I only played one run up to the first boss, but it\
      \ definitely feels more straight out about the grinding than playing off your\
      \ knowledge from previous runs.\n\nNormally, dying and retrying is part of the\
      \ dungeon crawler experience, but you're also normally able to make do with\
      \ what you get/have (to a point).  In this game, you're punished for not having\
      \ used an item before, and for simply not having enough MP to survive fights.\
      \  I took all the fights I could on my way to the boss in an effort to stay\
      \ leveled properly, but around the last few levels leading up to it, there were\
      \ more and more enemies together that just got tougher to beat without kiting\
      \ them out 1 by 1 despite my effort to keep up in levels.  \n\nAdd to this what\
      \ is possibly translation issues, or simply lack of any meaningful dialogue,\
      \ that makes any advice a bit confusing.  At the start of the game, I used some\
      \ items to find out what they do, ate some Onion chips or whatever and got \"\
      Stinky\" ailment.  The game told me that I can check my status/afflictions by\
      \ going to the menu. ... So I checked the menu, and my status just said \"Stinky.\"\
      \ Nothing else.  Very helpful.\nRunning into the boss, my first spell was Mist\
      \ Potion, which blinded the boss, but the witch came back in to tell me that\
      \ I should use Blind to blind the boss because spells can't hit it when it sees,\
      \ or something like that.  Used Blind, still was getting hit by its spells,\
      \ and still was better off using Mist Potion to damage it than wasting turns\
      \ on Blind.\n\nIt was during this fight that I used the Godly and Hot potatoes\
      \ I mentioned at the start, which highlights another issue: the lack of item\
      \ description before use, and the wanton item names.  You would think that a\
      \ Godly Potato would do something... Godly.  But no, instead Tasty Crisps were\
      \ the item I should have used, and had much, much more of than what I thought\
      \ to be a rare Godly Potato.  Totally understandable to leave descriptions in\
      \ the dark for items such as the colored Magicite, but for literally [i]every[/i]\
      \ item?  The fact that crosses (that I've found) have no downside to equipping\
      \ just to find out their description [i]have[/i] their descriptions hidden is\
      \ the worst.  In a game that relies on resource management, forcing you to use\
      \ your resources to know what they are is puzzlingly counter intuitive.  (The\
      \ worst example of this is a Perfume I used to find out what it does, and I\
      \ only got text on the screen that said something like \"the air is thick.\"\
      \ Guess I won't find out until I get the item again and check its description.)\n\
      \nAnother gripe I have is controller support.  Used a controller because there's\
      \ no key rebind option (and I'm not a fan of the arrow key for movement with\
      \ ZXC for actions Japanese default), but despite setting up my controller at\
      \ the start, I'm only able to move diagonally.  (Using a brand new 1st party\
      \ Xbox Series X controller that I've never changed the configs for on Steam.)\
      \  Buttons do work properly though.  Just strange that there would be any issues\
      \ using a controller considering this has a Switch release.\n\nOverall, I don't\
      \ have a strong disapproval for this game, but I simply don't have the patience\
      \ to grind out the game.  If the game were a bit more compelling with a stronger\
      \ story or more interesting levels and fights, I could give it another shot.\
      \  Instead, you're lazily dropped into the world and expected to make the most\
      \ out of the bare minimum."
