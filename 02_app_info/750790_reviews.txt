Unfortunately, this game is all about high scores and the leaderboard is broken, otherwise this review would be marginally positive. The game can be beaten in about 30 minutes, but it could take you a few hours of practice to do so. There are a several interesting artifacts that can customize your gameplay experience, that could add a lot of replay value if the leaderboard was working. Some people have a very hard time in the beginning, it's actually not that bad as long as you upgrading your health on the first level-up; if you really suck just get the burger item and it will give you massive HP. The environment has 4 stages that show up in any order, but they are not randomly generated.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ good variety of artifacts\n+ it is fun to level up and grind stats\n+ 2 playable characters\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- some glitches\n- broken leaderboard\n- no infinite mode\n- poor soundtrack\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts 5/10 [/b]\n\nThis developer is obviously not very experienced , but I think that Hollow Throne had some potential. It could really use an infinite mode and more achievements for extra replay value. I would only recommend it for die-hard fans of the genre, be prepared to deal with some technical problems. \n\n[code]If the game shows some improvements, I will consider removing this review.
