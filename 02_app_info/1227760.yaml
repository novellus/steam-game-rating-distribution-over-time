    review: 'Ok, the game is short, overpriced (similar games that are triple the
      lenght are the same price) AND is a paid version with bonus of a game you can
      actually play freely on the net. And honestly : it is well written, fast paced
      and enjoyable for what it''s worth.


      Yes, it ends a little abruptly and yes, there are a lot of things I would have
      like to see developped (romance, secondary villains, sidekick, the other hero...
      all which are presented quite nicely but barely developped) The fact that you
      can''t expect much from a CYOA with only 48, 000 words remains unchanged.


      Taking into account it''s an Eric Moser (author of community college hero, a
      quality serie of CYOA) work it''s still interesting to read it to see how he
      does in those circumstances. And if you accept the flaws of a short story then
      it is actually not bad at all. Overall I would say it should have been a novel,
      not a short story. It is well written but as a novel that''s too short, not
      as a short story in itself in my opinion. Read it if you''re curiosity is picked.'
