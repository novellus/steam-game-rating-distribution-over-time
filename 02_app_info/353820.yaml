    review: 'It is a nice game. It looks nice and giving  the ball a good whack is
      absolutly satisfying. What it does not do is realism. I do not miss a put at
      2 or 4 feet. I don''t. Nor have I ever putted a  ball at 20 feet. Here I miss
      at 2 or 4ft and I put straight in from the rough. And I am not that good in
      real life, no matter how I try. Will I still play. ABSOLUTLY I have never been
      such a good golfer in real life as I am here. Is it a good game? well if you
      have the basic game you have nothing, so that is a NO. If you get the upgrade
      you can have some fun. And remember: you are not playing the other guy/gal you
      are always playing yourself for that is the game of golf.'
