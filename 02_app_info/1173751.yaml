    review: I like the 'Little City' branch of this series specifically because of
      the pixel town aesthetic, but sadly I can't recommend this particular DLC. I
      found it to be full of repetition, with most of the images being compilations
      of the same or very similar graphics, and/or outright repeats of previous pieces.
      It even breaks out of the aesthetic by bringing in a more realistically styled
      painting for the large final piece, which is made worse because by that point
      you've painted that same image with less detail twice already in previous pieces.
      A boring grind, skip this one.
