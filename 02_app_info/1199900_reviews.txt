Do you like farming games?  Well then \"Hope's Farm\" is a match made in heaven for you!  This game combines the normal match 3 gameplay and adds lite farming that you have to do before you can go onto the next match 3 round.  The items that you are matching are part of an \"order\" the farm has received.  Like person A wants 45 tomatoes, person B wants 50 cucumbers, person C wants 4 cartons of milk.  In the beginning you have only a couple crops and a fruit tree.  Click on the tomato patch and a water bucket appears, drag that over the field to water it.  In a few seconds the crop will grow.  To harvest it, just hover your mouse over the crop and a sickle appears, drag that over it to harvest the crop.  Harvested crops go into Storage and you only have so much room so don't get carried away stocking up on corn.  Once your \"order\" match 3 game has been successfully played you get star points.  Once you have enough star points you get an upgrade such as more crops and eventually chickens, cows, pigs, and sheep.  \n\nWhen you run out of water from watering your crops you play the water game.  In one corner of the board is a icon with water beneath it, similar to the game The Four Elements.  The rest of the board has got a dirt background that you dig away by matching over it. At the bottom of the screen is a Well.  Make a path from the water to the well to finish.\n\nThe match 3 game part has the typical bonus items that you get from matching four in a row or five in a row.  In this game you get a firecracker that eliminates things in a cross (up, down, left, right) around the firecracker.  Match 5 to get a bomb that eliminates a square 3x3 blocks.  In addition to those are three bonus items you can use at any time: a shovel that will remove one square, (I'm having brain fog and can't remember the second one), and thirdly a Lightning Bolt that will remove all of the same item like all the corn disappears.   You can use those any time but they are limited in number initially and can be purchased by some form of currency (blue stars?) that you only have so much of and get more by completing levels.\n\nThe graphics are cutesy and bright.  The background music sound like old time folk music with banjos and harmonicas.  It's pleasant and has a down home feel to it.\n\nPrice seems reasonable for this genre.  I bought it on sale.\n\nI'd say this is one of the good ones in the genre, as long as you like the farming aspect because you will be doing a lot of it.  If you don't care for farming you might find that part tedious.  I have not completed the game yet and wonder what happens at the end once you have all the crops and animals.  I can see the urge to play the game again from the beginning once one has finished, so there may be replay value.  Total time to finish all 100 order (levels) is about 11 hours.  Not bad.","timestamp_created":1587064812,"timestamp_updated":1592267055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.742431163787841797","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+eOg3fICfOmmgQI="}
