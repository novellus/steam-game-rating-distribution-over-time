    about_the_game: Hello Professor Watts here and I have some research to do on memory
      skills. I have assembled a wide variety of puppies to put our memory to the
      test. We can see how we're doing by completing matches in a specific amount
      of time and earning points to track our overall progress. It would really help
      having someone sharp like yourself on my team to complete this research. Complete
      80 challenging randomized memory match puzzles and aim for a new top score each
      time you play.
