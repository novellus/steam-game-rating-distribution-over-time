    about_the_game: The Red Forest is one of the most unique spots in the Chernobyl
      area, with various mutations still taking place here. It is visited by tourists
      wishing to see something extraordinary. Both plant and animal mutants can be
      seen here. However, this time scientists found a creature of a new kind that
      they have never seen before. Now they are ready to pay a lot of money for catching
      it so they could study it, for it may turn out to be Rake. People from different
      corners of the world start coming to this place, hoping to catch the creature
      and earn money. Now there is even a local dealer here who is ready to sell weapons
      to everyone interested. Rake was last seen two years ago, but all the attempts
      to catch him failed then, and the scientist who had made those attempts was
      found dead in his trailer among the woods.
