Be sure to think up your own backstory if you want to run this. I wouldn't complain if it was free, but it wasn't... so you'll still need to work on this a bit even if you're paying for the convenience. I would also have liked the riddles to be a little more obscure than using several from The Hobbit. I've had to make some adjustments in that department as well. \n\nThat said, the design of it is okay, even though there really doesn't seem to be much explanation or reason for some of the magical items being there an accessed in the way they are.","timestamp_created":1585078060,"timestamp_updated":1585078060,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvviAh/ECeO7e+gE="}
