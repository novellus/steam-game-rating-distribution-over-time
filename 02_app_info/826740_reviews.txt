The first run took me over an hour, just because there was so much content. It became really tedious.\n- Difficulty. I maybe had to use the rest site once? But I probably would have lived without it. Most of the combats were not very challenging, especially if you are experienced in the genre at all.","timestamp_created":1608690257,"timestamp_updated":1608690257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4xqnaxvYCc6mqvAI="}
