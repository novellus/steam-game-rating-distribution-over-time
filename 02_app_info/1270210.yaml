    review: "First off, I very rarely write reviews, maybe because most games don't\
      \ connect with me on an emotional level. This game did just that, so here I\
      \ am...    and it's a somewhat long one with personal opinions, so try to bear\
      \ with me or at least be warned. :)\n\nAt first glance this game may seem like\
      \ just another story driven visual novel with erotic contents, so not really\
      \ sure why I took another look. Reading the other reviews got me really interested\
      \ though, since I used to be a frequent reader of alternative literature and\
      \ most of the comments gave a positive story reaction. It was on sale and I\
      \ thought, \"why the hell not, I have the time atm!\" and got it. Didn't start\
      \ the game for a week or so, but when I did it had me hooked! Good thing indeed\
      \ that I had time off work...\n\nLike many of these type of games, the decisions\
      \ allowed by the main character aren't always what you want to do or say, but\
      \ for me they kind of resonated with the story well enough to keep me interested\
      \ and go along with the turn of events. The character building and spell management\
      \ as well as the combat system isn't really the best, but it does what it's\
      \ meant to do. The only times I really got frustrated or considered taking a\
      \ break from the game was when you are left to your own devices, since the mission\
      \ system and feedback for development of the character are somewhat lacking.\
      \ The erotic events are well made when they occur, although for me they are\
      \ perhaps not what makes the game most enticing. \n\nThe following part may\
      \ contain some slight spoilers, so again, be warned...    as I talk about what\
      \ really had me going all day and night with this game. \n\nThe story being\
      \ of an Arthurian legend type aside, the references to well known (for me) entities\
      \ of history, myth or fiction that tickled the mind, having you guessing and\
      \ giving the satisfactory feeling of 'I knew it!'-moments is a really nice and\
      \ not an obstructive part of the storytelling. The characters have their own\
      \ sense and, if perhaps a bit stereotypical at times, they really got me invested.\
      \ Some twisting mind games of hidden allegiances, turning the story and path\
      \ of the character on end, keeping me wondering what's what and who's really\
      \ involved. The bodies of text are of fair length, the conversations had me\
      \ at least following along and interested, though as some times could've been\
      \ better timed. \n\nWhat really struck me at many points where how excited I\
      \ actually got at pivital moments in the story. Even though the music and visuals\
      \ do help with the effect, it was the weight of the relationship the main character\
      \ had developed with the group and connected individuals. It may be my current\
      \ emotional state or times we live in that makes me more susceptible to such\
      \ emotional bounding, but judging from the other players reactions I think there\
      \ is something special here. And I'm not talking about the erotic encounters,\
      \ although of course they had their part in building the emotional bonds, but\
      \ it was the times that the characters were at risk or had important decisions\
      \ to make or were unaccounted for that had my heart pounding. \n\nAll in all,\
      \ I'd say that the game is really worth playing at least ones for the content\
      \ available and story alone. It has some serious flaws in the user experience\
      \ department which would have made the game so much more enjoyable, but with\
      \ some patience and the will to experiment it's good enough. I will eagerly\
      \ await for the next part of this trilogy and really hope the magic is still\
      \ there! I would not at all mind a modified release of this first game or perhaps\
      \ dlc with other things to do along the way up to the moment that...  well,\
      \ do find out yourself what I almost revealed. ;)"
