    reviews: "\u201CRobbotto captures that retro feel in an extremely effective way.\
      \ This might not appeal to all, but if you grew up with any love for Bubble\

      \ Robbotto is a crisp game that\u2019s easy to pick up whenever and where ever\
      \ you want. It\u2019s always fun to have a friend with you but it\u2019s challenging\
      \ enough with just yourself. It\u2019s certainly a game to go back to again\

    review: 'When writing this review, I''ve played about 25 levels. The principle
      of the game is pretty simple - electrify an enemy robot, spray water on it so
      it short circuits, do this with all robots per level. If you touch an enemy
      or a shot, you die instantly.

      3 lives, infinite continues. If you lose all 3 lives, the current level and
      enemies will be reset.


      Is it fun?

      Yes, levels are short and varied enough to make it fun to play. Level difficulty
      varies a bit, but after defeating a boss (they are a bit tricky, as they should
      be), getting a slightly easier level is a treat.


      Worth noting about movement etc, the game has a pixel graphics aesthetic but
      you can move "sub pixel".'
