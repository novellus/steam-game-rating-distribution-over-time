    about_the_game: 'BioShock is a shooter unlike any you''ve ever played, loaded
      with weapons and tactics never seen. You''ll have a complete arsenal at your
      disposal from simple revolvers to grenade launchers and chemical throwers, but
      you''ll also be forced to genetically modify your DNA to create an even more
      deadly weapon: you. Injectable plasmids give you super human powers: blast electrical
      currents into water to electrocute multiple enemies, or freeze them solid and
      obliterate them with the swing of a wrench.  <br>No encounter ever plays out
      the same, and no two gamers will play the game the same way.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Biologically
