This game does something like that, except from top down view it actually \"yaw\"s (rotates about vertical (or in this case, the camera view) axis) - kind of wonky feeling.\n\n\nImprovement suggestions for Dev:\n• Add a melee weapon to destroy the boxes without consuming ammo/energy, and would also act as a backup when out of ammo/energy for weapons.\n• Maybe change weapons to use ammo that has to be found\n• Or a buy an airdrop of ammo as something to use  thsoe skulls for (and just make them coins, they look like enemies coming after me)\n• Grenades\n• Boss enemy and actual end game","timestamp_created":1584768037,"timestamp_updated":1584768126,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.594533026218414307","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww9Hi/fACe6/V+QE="}
