Honestly I haven't played Cthulhu Saves the World or Breath of Death VII but I did enjoy some of the interactions between the NPCs during story events. Probably gonna have to play the other games at some point.\n\nPros:\n- Cthulhu\n- Christmas puns\n- Chickens\n- A unique battle system that challenges the player to think strategically.\n- Fourth wall breaks\n- References to other RPGs\n- Awesome soundtrack, especially on the boss battles\n\nCons:\n- Battles can tend to drag if you don't prepare and equip your party properly.\n- It's short, only like 10-12 hours, probably less if you don't grind.\n- You probably won't get the references to other games unless you've played them. (It doesn't detract from the game but you guys should be aware.)\n\nIt's a great little game and definitely worth a look, highly recommend this one if you need a laugh or if you're looking for a bit of a shorter RPG experience.","timestamp_created":1609563494,"timestamp_updated":1609563494,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw57rd4PYCcavPvwI="}
