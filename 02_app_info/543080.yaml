    review: I've played only demo version of the game but I think that it is something
      special. Gameplay looks simple at first glance, but  as the story unfolds, the
      game becomes more and more absorbing. Basically, in the demo, you investigate
      a bombing case and build a psychologica portrait of a suspect based on different
      kinds of media and other evidences.  The game has interesting graphics and music
      which change when you find new important information about the suspect. But
      the main value of the game is that it provokes thoughts.  It is not science
      fiction like Orwell's book. It is set here and now. Look at all little details
      which point at the real world. Even the date is significant, it's ery near future.
      The game reminds us that we are in a potsprivate world surrounded by technology
      which collects data about us, online but also on the streets. Will we trade
      liberty for security?
