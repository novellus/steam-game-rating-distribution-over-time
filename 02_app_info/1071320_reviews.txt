It was very informative and interesting to learn more of this painting. the visuals and the sound were more than great. Some FPS hickups were there too (RTX 3090), but aren't that disturbing while the trip overall. I really like to see more of this kind of VR Experience.","timestamp_created":1607869457,"timestamp_updated":1607869457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ppyfrvYCfYTsuQI="}
