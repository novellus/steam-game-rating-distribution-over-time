I love multiplayer strategy games, but its such a chore to get some friends to sit down and play them for a few hours at a time. This game satisfies the itch to play a strategy game, and plays on your nostalgia for the olden days of couch co-op, all while being bite sized and easy to consume.\n\nAll in all this is a great first release for No Sleep, and I wholeheartedly can't wait to see more from them, and recommend this to anyone who wants to just sit down play a quick strategic game with some friends.","timestamp_created":1560811211,"timestamp_updated":1560811211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j6Hms+sCfKrPwwE="}
