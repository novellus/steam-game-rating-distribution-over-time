    review: "Really easy to pick up and learn, my son was hooked after one game. Each\
      \ round throws in so many changes, that it is always a new experience. \n\n\
      I can't wait to play with a full squad of human players. Move over Monopoly,\
      \ there is a new game on the block that is ready to destroy civility on family\
      \ game night."
