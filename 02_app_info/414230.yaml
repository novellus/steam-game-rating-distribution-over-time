      worker placement game with dice rolling in which players are leaders of Viking
      clans who have traveled to an embattled Viking harbor town to help defend it
      against the threat of trolls, draugr, and other mythological Norse beasts. By
      defeating these epic creatures, players gain glory and the favor of the gods.

      allows for the collection of resources and warriors, which players may then
      send on journeys to neighboring villages or across the sea to defeat monsters
      and gain the glory they need for victory. Resources are used to to carve runes,
      build ships, and feed your followers. Viking warriors (custom dice) do battle
      with the myriad enemies the town faces.
