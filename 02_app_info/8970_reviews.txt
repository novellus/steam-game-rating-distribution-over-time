The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and the puzzles are medium/easy in difficulty, making it generally smooth to progress. It has a good story and in overall I found this to be very enjoyable to play! Absolutely one of my favourite indie games. I have re-played it several times over the years. With that said, if you don't like odd, artsy and whimsical indie games, then this might not be for you.","timestamp_created":1607761131,"timestamp_updated":1607761131,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43/6Bq/YCf5izuQI="}
