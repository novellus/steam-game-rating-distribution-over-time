This game has so much potential and I love playing it  - when it’s working - that is. Constant crashes have ended my playing it, I’m hoping some fixes come out and soon. The manual could also use some work. Half the time I have no idea what’s going on. \nIf the improvements are made I would purchase the add ons in a minute.","timestamp_created":1582472168,"timestamp_updated":1582472168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548087120056152344","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpKCsufACfryR9AE="}
