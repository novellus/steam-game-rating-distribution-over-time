The game's style is a neat retro computer game look with a lot more polish and far more responsive controls that makes both playing it and looking at it a very crisp experience. The game is rather short though, and really is about an afternoon worth of adventure. Still with the time allotted there is plenty of challenge and substance to Ultionus levels and should be checked out by anyone that wants some shooter based arcade fun.","timestamp_created":1609397488,"timestamp_updated":1609397488,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmJnk2/YCd5GDvwI="}
