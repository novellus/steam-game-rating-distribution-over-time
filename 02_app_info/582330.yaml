      \ You play as a fierce warrior, fighting in the arena to become the most feared\
      \ gladiator in the world to find freedom \u2013 and revenge against those who\
      \ butchered your ancestors! Create a dynasty of (un)honorable warriors and customize\
      \ their looks, names, honorary titles, and even banners. Fight in duels and\
      \ tournaments, and please the crowds, so they help you defeating your adversaries.\
      \ With each victory, you gain XP to improve your stats and acquire new skills\
      \ \u2013 tailored to your unique fighting style. Use your hard-earned money\
      \ to buy all kinds of weapons and armor \u2013 from just a wooden barrel to\
      \ the mighty armor of a dark elf! When you win, you will have to decide your\
      \ opponent\u2019s fate which will also affect your path. \u2013 you can send\

      \ The mad emperor Ayziz reigns over the realm of Indiekingdom with an iron fist\
      \ because, well\u2026 that\u2019s what mad emperors do! Ayziz uses his dark\
      \ powers to open a portal to different timelines and places across the multiverse\
      \ and teleport thousands of warriors to fight against each other in his pits\
      \ and arenas for his sick and wicked amusement (did we mention he is mad?).\
      \ You are one of these warriors \u2013 after arriving near naked, leaving behind\
      \ your home and family, you were told that only the fiercest warriors get their\
      \ freedom back. You entered the fighting pits knowing that you won\u2019t make\

    review: "Pra quem curtiu Swords And Sandals, esse jogo \xE9 muito similar, exceto\
      \ que... Melhor, diferentes finaliza\xE7\xF5es, melhores anima\xE7\xF5es, boss\
      \ com diferentes mecanicas e mais.\n\nO humor  do jogo \xE9 suportado por referencias\
      \ (bem feitas, por sinal) e besteirol, com uma gameplay que foca no fortalecimento\
      \ das gera\xE7\xF5es de seus gladiadores atrav\xE9s de Soul Points (agrade\xE7\
      o a Deus pela mecanica), faz com  que o efeito  replay tenha muita for\xE7a,\
      \ tanta que me fez gastar quase 12 h no game em apenas 4 dias.\n\nOque falta\
      \ para Warriors alcan\xE7ar a perfei\xE7\xE3o, \xE9 mais conteudo,  mais finaliza\xE7\
      \xF5es, mais bosses, customiza\xE7\xF5es, itens, e se Deus quiser adicionem\
      \ spells no game, o jogo tamb\xE9m peca um pouco na repeti\xE7\xE3o, n\xE3o\
      \ existe RNG nenhum no grind, \xE9  exatamente o mesmo,  voc\xEA upa exatamente\
      \ da  mesma forma todas  as vezes (cada inimigo a cada reset, concede sempre\
      \ a mesma xp), mas me parece que isso foi feito para ajudar no balanceamento,\
      \ ao contr\xE1rio de S&S que voc\xEA podia repetir a procura por adv, na arena,\
      \ at\xE9 encontrar algum que goste.\n\nEnfim o jogo \xE9 top, vale muito o pre\xE7\
      o bem razoavel que ele tem, e \xE9 bom suportar alguns games indies interessantes\
      \ de vez em quando"
