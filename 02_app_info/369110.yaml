    review: 'It''s a nice rougelite that Mark from Game Maker''s Toolkit explains
      best in his video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUbyNJKsi7E

      The only gripe I have with the game is sometimes it has some quite big bugs.
      I have glitched through the wall on multiple occasions (though this was to my
      advantage) and sometimes I could not move at all which meant I had to kill the
      character. Sadly the developer hasn''t updated the game since 2015, but I still
      highly recommend the game.'
