    review: 'tl:dr DO NOT PUT ANY MONEY INTO THIS GAME AND JUST PLAY IT FOR FREE,
      FALSE ADVERTISING ON CARDS, SIDE STEPPING STEAM TAXES BY LINKING TO A PERSONAL
      ARTIST ACCOUNT PATREON SUBSCRIPTION


      DO NOT BUY DLC FOR THIS GAME

      DO NOT BUY CARDS FOR THIS GAME UNTIL BOOSTERS ARE FREED FROM THIS HOSTAGE SITUATION


      The Steam DLC doesn''t count towards booster unlock.


      In game only to unlock, no in game shop, only in game purchase option goes to
      a patreon and all discussions end with "just buy off the market" or they''ll
      even say, "gems", but once again, this is ignoring the very glaring problem
      of not being able to get the booster unlock.


      The discussion page even has a sticky post that says cards are coming...half
      a year ago with a n/t = no text. Clearly, people have booster capability and
      the devolper is ignoring questions on how others may also obtain it.


      Not being able to unlock booster while others obviously have seals the deal,
      I know a racket when I see one, but just when you thought broken and discontinued
      items on steam were bad enough, this is clearly misadvertised as having "trading
      cards" when the low amount and high prices for the cards AND BOOSTERS clearly
      screams some of somebodies buddies were given the feature so they can sell the
      cards while others weren''t. At a ransom price for cards in general. ...30 cents
      for one reg card.


      Is this a f2p that I can spend 40 dollars with my steam wallet or a hostage
      situation?


      I''m going to look around for someone to make this right, but for all intents
      and purposes, DO NOT BUY DLC IF YOU''RE LOOKING TO UNLOCK BOOSTER, SOMETHING
      IS TERRIBLY WRONG HERE AND IT STINKS.


      What the actual F


      Does Gabe know you''re side stepping steam sales and are technically mislabeling
      your product?'
