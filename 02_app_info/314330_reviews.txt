Since it first came out, the game is basically sold on the basis that the game is free, but the forum with hints for the levels isn't in that you can't view images or I think even post there without owning the game.\n\nAs a package, this game is a little strange. Gunthro and the Epic Blunder is actually something like the 5th DROD game and is a prequel to the original DROD, which on Steam is called 'King Dugan's Dungeon' and is sold only as DLC for Gunthro. King Dugan's Dungeon lacks a lot of the features that the later games had, and is probably the one you should try first if only to see how much better the later ones are.\n\nMy problem with the re-release of the first DROD game is that the original had a lot of annoying moments where if you didn't clear the puzzles in a certain order, you'd have to backtrack. In the original game, backtracking meant solving entire puzzles a second time. To combat that, the developers added a button that's supposed to automatically solve puzzles you've already completed.. but it doesn't always work. \n\nThere's also the issue of the \"undo\" system only undoing a single move. DROD is a lot like Sokoban in that you can render puzzles unwinnable by making wrong moves, and you can only take back your last move without resetting to a checkpoint. The problem is that especially in the first game, there are puzzles that can be fairly long to complete that don't have checkpoints, meaning you'll have to redo the entire thing if you make a wrong move and don't immediately realize it's wrong.\n\nWhat I'd recommend doing is checking out Architect's Edition first and only buying the game if you like that. DROD's not a bad game, it's just very archaic at times. I had fun with it for what I played of it.","timestamp_created":1608737134,"timestamp_updated":1608737134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520958065986633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw25KNyPYCcdjAvAI="}
