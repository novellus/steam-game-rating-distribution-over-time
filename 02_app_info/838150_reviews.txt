Will re-review if this ever gets an actual update.\n\n\nFrom what I've seen so far, sadly I can't really suggest this as an upstanding game at the time of writing this. Though I only have .4 hours in the game (again at time of review) but in that time I have this to say\n\nPositive:\n*Cute, simple graphics.\n*Functional sandbox to test interactions\n*Equally cute little bestiary telling little stories of each slimes personality\n*Endless play works smoothly\n\nNegatives:\n*Graphics might come off as too simple, and some in game graphics drop out during repeat game sessions\n*Arcade seems broken, and AI is too aggressive.\n*Options are super bare bones, and no options screen mid game to check/change.\n*Currently lacking updates, as last one was in 2018, listing potential exit of early access in 2019\n\nTo Elaborate, Graphics on the front page are functional, but lack luster. The interaction with all the menu options also feel inconsistent and clunky due to the controls responding to mouse position AND keyboard, causing options to occasionally snap or glitch out due to the \"sliding\" tile main menu system. I will give credit, as the sand system works alright, but there's very little suggestion, guidance, or anything.\n\nNext big plot point, the Arcade VS AI. I watched in arcade and noticed that after searching the handful of menu's the game has, including the \"Custom\" game mode, there is no AI difficulty option. Upon starting up the game in Arcade vs AI The CPU player seems to erratically zig zag slimes back and forth, constantly spinning the pieces at top speed (aka holding down \"DROP\" button constantly) and racking up huge point totals before you even know what's going on\n\nThe game also has ZERO tutorial on how to play, no guide telling you how to play, and no tips giving any information on how the slimes interact with eachother. On one hand it gives an organic learning experience, and there is a \"Sandbox\" you can test interactions in, but unfortunately the game also has no details or summary on what any of the game modes are. A brilliant point to this is Sandbox I would figure might be a \"zen mode\" that would give you the game field from Arcade or Endless and let you play with the physics, test how the slimes bounce, and see how they pop and play off eachother in the \"mixing\" area below, but nope...it's literally just a browser worthy, Literal \"Sand Box\" using the curser as a stylus to spawn in the sands.\n\nMost Notable gripe I have though is the Arcade mode (at least against AI as I haven't tested local Vs.) Always considers the game mode High score wins. I played and kept losing to the CPU and never knew why, as I never \"lost\" as far as the store page described (aka sand peaking above the \"fill line\" or having slimes exceed the upper chamber) and yet always lost, because the CPU despite having overfilled it's sand box, had an astounding point score on my gameplay. With it having no adjustments and the rules for Arcade being such, what should be a fun puzzle game boils down to who can spam the slimes the fastest to get high score.","timestamp_created":1575090336,"timestamp_updated":1575090336,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwkOas3e4CcJrs3wE="}
