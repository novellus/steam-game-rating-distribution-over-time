    review: "If your idea of fun is performing maintenance on sewage pipes and searching\
      \ through dimly lit storage rooms for spare parts, you might like this game.\
      \ Otherwise, skip it. I don't understand the high ratings. There's very little\
      \ story, no characters to interact with, visually dull, and most of the time\
      \ you are clueless trying to figure out what the next step is in fixing this\
      \ broken down place. I played for three hours and gave up, not a bit interested\
      \ in what happens next. \n"
