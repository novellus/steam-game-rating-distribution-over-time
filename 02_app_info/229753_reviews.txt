Note that this game is like Pokemon style, in which is in 2D and the battle scene isn't a hand-on combat, but a option-type combat. It took me a while to really understand the concept of this software but now I got the grasp of it. Highly recommended!\n\nGood job to the developer.","timestamp_created":1609864233,"timestamp_updated":1609864233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gtjY6fYCf8jfwAI="}
