Beached had more potential than what came to see the light of day. The game showed some real promise. It even had a community of players helping each other figure it out. I'd say this game had a lifespan of about 3 years or so. The first year didn't have much going for it. The only thing the game could really do was run, and the only thing the player could do was move. The developer promised that more was to come in the future. Year two. This was where things really started to take off for Beached. The developer added an inventory and a crafting system. He also started a community discussion for people to share their discoveries about the game; crafting recipes and whatnot. This was around the time I started playing the game. I even made some contributions to the crafting community. It seemed that more and more people were being drawn to this game. People were figuring things out, and helping others go in the right direction. This was Beached's most promising times. Things were looking good! But at some point, it all inexplicably stopped. Year three. I'm not too sure what happened that year, but that's probably because nothing really did. A few more people made contributions to the community discussions, but that's really it. Toward the end of last year, a new discussion was created by the user \"The Great Papyrus\". To start this discussion, they said that the game was pretty much dead, and that it was fairly obvious. They also said that they thought that Beached had so much potential, and I think [i][b]most[/b][/i] of the players thought this. That pretty much covers the game's history. In its current state, Beached is fine. There isn't much to it. You can move around, harvest things, and craft things, all while trying to survive on a deserted island. It's fun for a while, until you run out of things to do. But like I said before, it isn't bad. My thoughts are that if we as a community work together to bring this game back into the light, we can save Beached from being beached.","timestamp_created":1585515263,"timestamp_updated":1585515263,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4wd6ElPECeaqb/AE="}
