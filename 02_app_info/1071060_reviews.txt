You know, with excellent music, attractive graphics, interesting bosses, normal gameplay... When I played MegaMan 11, I couldn't find any of these things. It came out years ago and to this day I'm just left wondering where the appeal is...\n\nKumacure has answered me on all of these things, it looks really cute and polished, it's the kinda game that I just see 1 screenshot of it and Im already in love! Its music is good and catchy as heck! It's a very small game, but fitting of the price. I see this as a game that should become a series, and it already is a favorite for me!!\n\nPLEASE!!\n\nI would LOVE sequels, I'd play 10 or more games like this!\nI'd pay more if the games were bigger!","timestamp_created":1605076482,"timestamp_updated":1605076511,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kf2A2/UCeoDZrQI="}
