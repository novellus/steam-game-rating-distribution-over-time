      Gel so good, that noone could resist you after you had applied it. All was good
      for them, the girls loved them, the men admired, and they were on track to conquer
      the whole world, however a terrible sickness once struck them, and wiped out
      all, but one man.. With his last breath, the last living man of the ancient
      civilization, managed to climb the highest flying mountain and hide the last
      remaining Moustache Gel there.. </strong><br><br>Now many years later, You,
      a Young Moustache Enthusiast, have heard of this legend and want to go on an
      adventure, to climb this mountain and find the magical Moustache Gel! But it
