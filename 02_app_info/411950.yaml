    about_the_game: "Our Hornet is the culmination of more than 40 man years of intense\
      \ research, technology development, art creation, and ground-breaking coding.\
      \ The Hornet brings the first, true, multi-role fighter to the skies of DCS\
      \ World with equally impressive air-to-surface and air-to-air capabilities.\
      \ <br><br>DCS: F/A-18C Hornet is initially being released as an Open Beta, with\
      \ several features to be added during the Open Beta period. This includes several\
      \ sensors, weapons, and sub-systems.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the DCS: F/A-18C\
      \ Hornet</h2><br>The F/A-18C Hornet is twin engine, supersonic fighter that\
      \ is flown by a single pilot in a \u201Cglass cockpit\u201D. It combines extreme\
      \ maneuverability , a deadly arsenal of weapons, and the ability to operate\
      \ from an aircraft carrier. Operated by several nations, this multi-role fighter\
      \ has been instrumental in conflicts from 1986 to today.<br><br>The Hornet is\
      \ equipped with a large suite of sensors that includes a radar, targeting pod,\
      \ and a helmet mounted sight. In addition to its internal 20mm cannon, the Hornet\
      \ can be armed with a large assortment of unguided bombs and rockets, laser\
      \ and GPS-guided bombs, air-to-surface missiles of all sorts, and both radar\
      \ and infrared-guided air-to-air missiles. This results in amazing gameplay\
      \ potential with this single aircraft.<br><br>The Hornet is also known for its\
      \ extreme, slow-speed maneuverability in a dogfight. We have gone to great lengths\
      \ to model the flight aerodynamics and fly-by-wire flight control system of\
      \ the Hornet to allow you to experience the real feeling of power and extreme\
      \ capabilities this aircraft has to offer. Although incredibly deadly, the Hornet\
      \ is also a very easy aircraft to fly.<br><br>Being an aircraft carrier capable\
      \ aircraft, our Hornet also comes with the most detailed aircraft carrier ever\
      \ created for a PC game. Catapult from the \u201Cboat\u201D, strike a large\
      \ assortment of targets that only DCS World can offer, then \u201Ccall the ball\u201D\
      \ and land on the carrier. DCS: F/A-18C Hornet in DCS World provides the most\
      \ rich and authentic digital combat aviation you will ever experience!<h2 class=\"\

    review: " Of all the modules I've tried and flown in DCS this is the most intelligible\
      \ and straightforward module. The aircraft UX actually makes sense and the modeling\
      \ makes it fun to flight. A specific special mention goes to the Training missions\
      \ which are the least convoluted and least nonsensical of all the modules listed.\
      \ There's no doubt that's why is the most popular module right now.\nThe only\
      \ thing that comes close in the fun factor to flying this thing is the acrobatic\
      \ plane but it is not a single area that makes this aircraft alluring, is the\
      \ combination and balance of many areas that makes it work.\n Finally, a module\
      \ that works.!!\n \nA-10C\nF-16\nF-14\nFlaming Cliffs simplified modules\nM-2000\n"
