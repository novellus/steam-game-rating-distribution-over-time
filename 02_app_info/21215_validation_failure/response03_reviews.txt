It hangs out with you while you play, you can't see it but others can see it while you are fighting. It doesn't talk to you it really does nothing but sit there and look cute and like you want to pet it. This pet shows up at the end of the game so you can show off your pet to the world when you get in the top 3 of the match. They are not really worth it to buy on there own because you can unlock this in the game as you play. You can use in-game money or get it now and use real money. I found it kind of nice to not be alone on the battle field but paying for it before you earn it is kind of lame and is a waste of money. Get it for looks, get it for glory, but don't get it to gain an advantage on the battle grounds because it wont help you at all.","timestamp_created":1333324552,"timestamp_updated":1333324552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9MKVuLYCc8WxCg=="}
