    review: '[h1]TL;DR Go to puzzle area, think it was impossible, put game aside,
      tried again a few days later, put aside, resisted looking at walkthrough, tried
      once more, had ''eureka'' moment, solved puzzle, repeat.[/h1]

      Rhem II is a game for visual puzzles and the occasional audio puzzle. There''s
      no real dialog, just puzzles and pictograms (which might be a clue to another
      puzzle). Most of the fun is figuring out just what the puzzles are in the first
      place. Each puzzle brings you a little bit closer to re-starting the systems
      in this strange, deserted complex and finding a way to get out. The Rhem series
      was released over the past decade and a half. There is a loose plot that links
      the four Rhem games together, but you don''t have to play them in order. I''d
      recommend skipping Rhem I and trying any of II-through-IV first (the game play
      of Rhem I is not nearly as smooth as the others, if you like the series you
      can always go back). Although Rhem II is as good a place to start as any to
      see if you really like the series. The general thread is that you are searching
      for some items in a mysterious, hidden complex (and have to find your way out!)
      This game doesn''t support SteamSynch. The graphics are simple and in a limited
      color palette (Rhem II dates to 2005). The colors are muted (it is an abandoned,
      dilapidated complex) and there is limited animation but this doesn''t detract
      from the game.


      This is a game for puzzles. There''s very little hand holding here -- you really
      need to walk around and explore the game world. Taking screenshots, notes and
      mapping are essential (I use a smart phone). The puzzles [b]do not[/b] have
      directions spelled out -- most of the fun is figuring out just what the objective
      of puzzle is , or even if something is a puzzle. I recommend taking screenshots
      of the puzzles because sometimes you will find a clue and realize that it relates
      to a puzzle all the way back on the other end of the complex. Other times a
      puzzle needs a clue that you just haven''t reached yet. Even the slightest detail
      in a scene might be a clue. Look everywhere for clues -- up, down, behind doors...
      [b]nothing[/b] is off limits.


      I spent several weeks stumped on a particular puzzle. There were three parts
      to it, and even though two were staring me in the face it didn''t click for
      a long time. This is why it''s best to resist the urge to go to the walkthrough.
      This is a game to be savored, for puzzle fans everywhere.


      Just when you solve a puzzle and open what you think is the final door... you
      see a whole new wing of the complex with puzzles waiting to be solved. By the
      time you are done, you''ll know the layout of the complex better than that of
      your neighborhood. By the time you''ve solve everything, the achievement will
      leave you full of relief and excitement like you won the Stanley Cup. This is
      again why I recommend avoiding the gameboomers.com walkthrough until you have
      been puzzling as much as you can. Highly recommended and a few dozen hours of
      enjoyment for a decent price.


      [b]I played this on Win 10 and had no issues.[/b]


      Edit for the Steam Special Edition (Rhem II SE): There''s an additional area
      that wasn''t part of the original Rhem II but has been added for the SE. Towards
      the end of the game it may not be entirely clear if you are getting clues that
      you need to solve the game, or ones for the optional SE area. There''s a "Gameplay
      Hints" discussion thread that might be useful.'
