      \ to carry out a duty bestowed upon her by the sun goddess. Choose from 4 different\
      \ classes, each with their own play style. Form your own strategy and defeat\
      \ any enemies that stand between you and the villainous Koroime. Craft your\
      \ own weapons and armour to become an over powered champion of the gods.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nArcher: With a boost in critical hit rate and evade chance,\
      \ the archer can quickly knock down anyone that steps up to the plate. However,\
      \ the downfall is the lack of abilities especially early game, this can make\
      \ your start a struggle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMage: A variety of Margias (Spells)\
      \ with secondary effects, can make Zana a terrifying foe to battle, with a wide\
      \ array of attacks, Zana can make battling her frustrating for all enemies involved.\
      \ Though it's greatest downfall is the lack of defence, mages can dish it out\
      \ but they can't take it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKnight: A great boost in health\
      \ and defence, Zana as a knight can take any damage given to her, with great\
      \ health regeneration, the only challenge she'll face is who is to hit first.\
      \ Although the knight version of Zana has great health and regen, she doesn't\
      \ do as much damage as other classes, so her battles tend to take longer.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nBrawler: Fast and ruthless the base damage output is the highest,\
      \ great abilities and powerful attacks, not much needs to be said about the\
      \ brawler only one question, Who wants these hands first? While the brawler\
      \ Zana has the highest base damage output, she can't take many reprisals, low\
      \ health and defences, but once you start laying in hits, it's over for the\
      \ enemy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce you have selected your\
      \ class you are thrown into the world of Skettaria, where you'll meet new faces\
      \ and will have the urge to help anyone that asks you for it. The question is\
      \ though, why were you really brought back? Is it truly to stop one villain?\
      \ Or is there something greater at hand here?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeet with Lunny,\
      \ a beautiful hero from one of the world's most powerful guild, The Heroes Guild.\
      \ She turned down a job she seemed unfitting for her. It's up to you to pick\
      \ up the pieces. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCrafting: Through your adventures\
      \ you'll pick up items which you can use for crafting for weapons and armour,\

    review: I've thoroughly enjoyed this game. I love that it gives you a preview
      fight against a dummy with the classes at the start to allow you to be more
      informed in your choice of which class to be. I found the game fun and relaxing
      to play, and I will play again as other classes.
