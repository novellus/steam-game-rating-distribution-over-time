I am playing on a keyboard. And the first thing I see is \"PUSH START\" Well it actually means Q... And you can only use the number pad to navigate the menu, so if you have a TKL keyboard, then you literally cannot play the game without a controller. Also, there is no way to rebind any of these awful menu controls, only in-game controls (and it will inexplicably change from menu controls to in-game controls while selecting your loadout). Unfortunately beyond that point, I can speak nothing of the game itself because 10 seconds into the game, it froze on a black screen that would not close and would not even let me view my task manager or any other windows, so I had to sign out. Then on subsequent boots, it would just instantly go to this black screen before I could even access the menu. This is a completely unacceptable hack job of a port, and no one should give these incompetent developers their money.","timestamp_created":1609742322,"timestamp_updated":1609742322,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwldGH5vYCdeunwAI="}
