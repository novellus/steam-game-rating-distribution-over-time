It's fairly easy, got all the achievements by the end without trying, and the art is nicely drawn. It starts off with the same girls then later on it's the same girls with less clothes and then again naked. It's an alright game, nothing challenging. Recommend for the easy achievements and the art.","timestamp_created":1609415358,"timestamp_updated":1609415358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw466o3PYCdpCKvwI="}
