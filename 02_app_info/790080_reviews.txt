This game has the BEST HANDLING MODEL I'VE EVER SEEN IN ANY RACING GAME.\nSeriously, just the driving feels amaaaaaaaazing. The cars have the perfect balance of weight and agility you want in a futuristic racing game.\nUnfortunately those great physics don't apply to the collisions. If you ever even scratch a wall you're liable to go exploding into the air and lose it all. This COULD have been fixed and this game could have been the best on the market, but the dev has abandoned the game.\nRIP","timestamp_created":1608823738,"timestamp_updated":1608823738,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw6cHXyvYCdcbmvAI="}
