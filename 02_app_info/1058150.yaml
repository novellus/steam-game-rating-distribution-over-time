    review: "Long story short, this is just rip-off of both Beat Saber and Osu!. \
      \ Actually, who am I kidding, there is no long story, the whole game is just\
      \ few minutes long. \n\nThe whole content of this game (this term is used generously)\
      \ is an idol group consisting of anime girls standing in front of you and singing\
      \ one song (that's the good part) and you playing a wannabe rhythm game (that's\
      \ the worse part). Actually, I'd prefer this without having to play the clunky\
      \ game and instead just watch the performance in peace.\n\nOveral, this would\
      \ be okay as a tech demo or a free game, but as something you have to pay for\
      \ it just doesn't hold up. It's not offensively bad, but it's just not good.\
      \ 4/10"
