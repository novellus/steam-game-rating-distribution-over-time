      \ Your team ages: at 30 their stats start dropping, at 40 their skills follow.\
      \ You'll give them nicknames, train them, get attached to them, maybe even unlock\
      \ specialities such as Engine Tuner or Negotiator, and then they'll die.\u201D\

      \ is phenomenal. If you like the sound of turn based tactical car combat this\
      \ is your new holy grail. The physics of car movement, drifting, changing how\
      \ a car performs offroad and on tarmac, a variety of physics related to each\
      \ individual car ... I mean, it's all here.\u201D<br>90% \u2013 Game Tunnel<br><br>\u201C\
      MMORPGs get repetitive to me ... Grinding drives me crazy with rage. How many\
      \ rat-equivalents do you need to smack around before you get to go beat up something\
      \ else? I think this is a natural state, though, as the game has to appeal to\
      \ all levels, from the beginner to the seasoned veteran ... With the addition\
      \ of scouting between cities, and frequent content injections, Darkwind has\
      \ a lot to do and see in-game no matter the skill level of the player or the\
      \ composition of the gang. This is a breath of fresh air in what I consider\
      \ a very stale and one-sided genre of gameplay, where even the behemoth in the\
      \ market seems destined for repetition.\u201D<br>7.5/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/reviews/view.php?ID=964\"\
