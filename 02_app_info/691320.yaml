    review: 'It''s a fun time for a while, but unfortunately you''ll want to use everything
      1 handed because its just easier. Lets say you have a tommy gun, just 1 handing
      it and spraying is your best bet rather than grabbing it with your second hand.
      The reason behind this is that the way you hold your gun with your controllers
      is not what is being portrayed on screen. To line up your sights you will have
      to hold your left hand significantly farther left than the barrel of your gun
      is, making this super awkward system, which is very non linear and very immersion
      breaking.


      Pistols and one handed weapons are ok. Most guns can be used one handed, but
      again its just silly and immersion breaking that you actually do better without
      having both hands on your weapon.


      Overall i give it a 6/10, it has fun enough gameplay and a good enough amount
      of content, but sadly most of it is just brought down by the one handed thing.
      I''m gonna have to say no i do not recommend.'
