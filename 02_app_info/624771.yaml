    short_description: Creator of Reigns Francois Alliot (Nerial) takes us on a tour
      of medieval hot spots in his adopted home town of London. Cheese, trumpets,
      Tinder, procedural French billiards, and bad jokes at the expense of England's
      Queen - it's all here. Plus an exclusive insight into life after Reigns.
