      \ demo that will see you testing every component of the final game.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nBeing an EARLY ACCESS title, VRZ  is still developing core gameplay\
      \ mechanics. However you will be able to playtest nearly all the realistic weaponry,\
      \ participate in zombie-kill leaderboards, play several mini-games, and even\
      \ undertake a \u201Cduck hunt\u201D. Players can also look forward to future\
      \ updates that will be adding features and story to their overall experience\
      \ well in advance of this years November release! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPurchasing\
      \ VRZ Alpha will not only unlock the full game in November, but will offer it\
      \ at a significant discount from the retail price! With just over 40+ hours\
      \ of gameplay at release, we intend to deliver one hell of a ride to those who\
      \ support us. Players will find Purgatory Island to be plagued with impossible\
      \ unlife, with a variety of zombie skags roaming its rancid paradise and posing\
      \ an unyielding threat. Some of these zombies will grow more Toxic (and intelligent),\
      \ having been driven beyond their primal urges to hunt and destroy you! Survive\
      \ long enough, and you may just discover the path to salvation. You the player\
      \ are the secret experiment, the rat in the maze, and you\u2019ll need both\
      \ wit and brawn to overcome the challenges ahead!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe can\u2019\
      t wait to share more soon, but till then, keep on fragging!"
