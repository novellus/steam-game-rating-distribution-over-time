    review: 'Honestly this is the kind of DLC RPG Maker needs most. Not hundreds of
      battlers, but rather only a few, but with matching busts and sprites. Definitely
      worth a buy.


      To the creator: Why limit busts to square images that cut out most of the monsters?
      With the rat and a few others it''s fine, but with larger ones like the chimera
      and the cerberus it just looks silly. You clearly already have made the art
      at full size, since the battlers are just the unzoomed version of this, so why
      not include the full monster bust?'
