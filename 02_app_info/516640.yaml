    review: "I really wish we would leave neutral reviews. Unlike the coasters by\
      \ the same dev, Raw Lion Workshop, this game is, well, underwhelming. It didn\u2019\
      t even feel like the same creator of the coasters I love, which are fairly polished\
      \ at this point made this one. Imagine walking around Artraal, but with no real\
      \ objective except to try and open a box for a pass key for a train. You explore\
      \ darkly lit areas, often not sure which way you can go and you need to find\
      \ the symbol for each colored petal.\nI stumbled on purple right away, but after\
      \ visiting each of the other worlds for the keys the darn box won't open. This\
      \ game lacks the logic of the rides, that, while surreal, have progression.\
      \ It feels like it was an attempt to get away from coasters, though there are\
      \ coaster elements in each world.\nAll I wanted was my train pass and the young\
      \ lady was no help whatsoever. Very buggy at this point, not everything works\
      \ and the in-game note says it isn't finished. The graphics need some love,\
      \ and maybe just make the darn thing into four trippy coasters. That way the\
      \ pitch black areas will not be an issue."
