    review: "My friend and I played this for several hours today, we unfortunately\
      \ cannot recommend this game... There were some things we liked...I've put together\
      \ a bullet pointed list outlining specific areas about the game\n\nTitle screen/initial\
      \ thoughts:\nBeautiful art style that gives insight to game\nMusic is mystical\
      \ and calming good fit for art shown. \nUnique cursor. \n\nGame Art:\nBeautiful\
      \ tileset\nUnique character sprite\nPicture gallery was a nice touch\nInitial\
      \ character busts are beautiful\nGame mechanics\nUnique and interesting battle\
      \ system\nClear key items\nAltar system good\nDetailed clear menu\nConfusing\
      \ controls\nCannot escape battles\nSpike dying glitch\nDelays in action\nUnbalanced\
      \ leveling and item prices, too easy to lose HP\nOverpowered enemies. \nPoorly\
      \ designed levels, floating items on screen, ice too difficult to see, lava\
      \ level causes too much damage \nOverly complicated mini games, sliding puzzle\
      \ and coffin controls\n\nGameplay and story:\n\nIntro scrolling text not a good\
      \ fit. \nPoor taste in dialogue\nBlackout scene very confusing\nForced side\
      \ quests\nPoor character development\nLack of connection to characters\nToo\
      \ many mini games\nForced fishing minigame\n\nOur game crashed at the ice level\
      \ with the ice queen boss... at this point we were so angry with the game we\
      \ refused to touch it after that. our eyes hurt from the overuse of flashy visuals\
      \ and we felt very uncomfortable by the unfitting unneeded comments by jen to\
      \ the main character... after doing some further research it seems as though\
      \ this game was part of a game jam... it unfortunately shows. It felt rushed\
      \ and sloppy, we love the idea of it but feel it deserves more.  \n"
