    review: 'Don''t let Orblitz simplicity put you off - it''s actually quite engaging
      and it shows potential to be a fun game - a bit like a mashup of Nibbles and
      Pong. But it would be nice if it had a little progression, starting with a slightly
      simpler scenario or variables and getting harder over time. It really is just
      pot luck a lot of the time as you are launched into the thick of it from the
      off. But with just a few tweaks so that it''s not a "return to main menu" fest
      and MacDuff could consider this a nice little game concept well executed. For
      now, it''s a bit relentless, but worth checking out. You might actually be good
      at it! I wasn''t.
