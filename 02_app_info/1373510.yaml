    review: '[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review
      [/h1]


      BloodRayne: Terminal Cut is a game developed by Terminal Reality and published
      by Ziggurat


      The game offers some aesthetic graphics and environments, although some ugly
      glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same


      BloodRayne: Terminal Cut overall, however, is an okay to fun game to play, and
      it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a very good action
      adventure game and to play in short bursts


      [h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]
