It personally gave me 2 good hours of gameplay.\nOverall recommended.\n \nUpdate: Well i played the game some few more hours and i got to say it has much more depth than i thought it had. Again, i recommend it, especially if you are into card games.","timestamp_created":1486671486,"timestamp_updated":1511787678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk6nk/t8CcrDbcQ=="}
