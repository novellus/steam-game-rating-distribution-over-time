It just stays as the alphabetical order which is just not cool because anyone whose played this would want the soundtrack to be in the same order as the levels in the game because THATS HOW IT SHOULD BE!","timestamp_created":1606789113,"timestamp_updated":1606789113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yoSGjvYCe7iWtgI="}
