The design makes you feel like your character is really part of the world, in order to complete the levels you are required to interact with your surroundings which brings the level to life. In addition you can choose to take on a variety of challenges that aren't required to move forward with your adventure but if completed you will be rewarded for your persistence. Do yourself a favor and give this gem a try, whether your a platformer fan or just wish to enjoy some light heart-ed fun with just the right amount of challenge <3","timestamp_created":1605728559,"timestamp_updated":1605728559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+au47vUCdsSWrwI="}
