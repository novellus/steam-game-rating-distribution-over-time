You may think you only have to click each mole until they reach their untimely demise at the end of your hammer. However, this is not the case\n\nThe moles still spawn after the screen goes black. Meaning you can obtain a higher score than normally achieved by mortal hands.\n\nThe moles have no pattern. They appear like the beautiful sunrise, elegant and graceful. You then strike them down with your weapon as fast as you can. The moles do not die, they simply return to whence they came.\n\nTo win, you must bap the moles over the head, they are not harmed, merely surprised. The moles are immortal.","timestamp_created":1609388525,"timestamp_updated":1609388525,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43IDC2/YCc8n/vgI="}
