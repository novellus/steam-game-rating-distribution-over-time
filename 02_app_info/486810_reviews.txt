I found the first Snark game I played interesting (liked the puzzles) but did not enjoy the protagonist at all. (Escaping daughter one). The other Snark games began to get annoying.  Though the graphics were beautiful, the story was thin and ended up in an endless string of next room needed until I completely lost track of where I needed to go for what.  One would get about half wrapped up on a room and then be in the next for something a dozen times. I enjoyed the 1000 door games more for their stories and graphics, but found the snake cult one (?) a bit annoying due to intrusive music.  Good casual gameplay.","timestamp_created":1609803515,"timestamp_updated":1609803515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x4jx5/YCcNrFwAI="}
