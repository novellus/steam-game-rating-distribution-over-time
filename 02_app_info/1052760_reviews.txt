Steam version has double the number of levels, with bigger, more complex ones in the mix.[/b]\n\n[i]Hexa Path[/i] re-visits a basic puzzle idea: visit every tile in the grid once.\n\n[h1]Puzzle features[/h1]\n\nTo spin the idea, [i]Hexa Path[/i] adds teleporters, tiles requiring more than one visits, tiles that need to be visited in certain order, and perhaps as the most interesting one drones that follow or escape from you painting a blocking path while doing so.\n\nPuzzles start out as small and introduce the features mentioned above organically, with tiny tutorial-style levels. It feels very easy, and the first few levels were a breeze.\n\nThen, the levels start to become bigger and more complex. Some levels are quite brain teasers, taking a bit of thinking (though often trial-and-error will suffice) to find the right solution.\n\n[h1]Controls and sometimes the lack of them[/h1]\n\nYou can operate with keyboard or gamepad but for me, mouse felt the most natural control scheme.\n\nMy only gripe was the lack of undo button. If you get stuck, you have to restart the whole level. It's a bummer, though the levels are fairly short.\n\n[h1]Conclusions[/h1]\n\nFree version has 30 levels, easily completed in about 15 minutes. The Steam version doubles the number of levels, adding some bigger and more complex puzzles, though it does not add any new puzzle features. Completing the Steam version took me about 1 hour without guides (dev provides a video walkthrough in the guides section though).\n\nIt's a decent pathing puzzler. It could be longer still for the price, so I suggest you get it on sale.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9997062/]~Twistorian Curator~[/url]","timestamp_created":1595376864,"timestamp_updated":1595412037,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57720339298248291","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42Pf9uvMCeM/mlgI="}
