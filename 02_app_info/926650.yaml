    review: I do want to give it a positive rating but I cannot. It has a good amount
      of content but two glaring flaws that have never been addressed. First is it
      does not allow you to transfer resources between the SS and Army factions, even
      when it is clear your army needs to resources far more than 2 SS units since
      you will spend almost all the points in some levels. The second major issue
      is what seems to be a glitch or bug that has never been fixed where your air
      units never seem to follow you from scenario to scenario, meaning I have to
      waste precious resources purchasing new air units in almost every level. Without
      these glaring issues fixed I would have to give it a No Buy!
