    review: A very simple game, kept me busy for a few minutes but ultimately I found
      it to be so arbitrarily random, limiting, and difficult that I lost interest
      pretty quickly. It's exceedingly easy to make one little mistake and then winning
      becomes impossible. Can't see any potential replay value, and I most certainly
      don't enjoy the game enough to want to actually try for level 3. The game is
      a very low price, so there's that. Is it worth the money? Well, I played it
      for about 25 minutes or so, and people have paid a lot more before to be relatively
      entertained for that amount of time. All depends on perspective I guess, but
      from my perspective the game is uninstalled and will remain such. I wouldn't
      recommend it, but I'll end on a high note. I have no damn clue how to make games,
      and this might be someone's first crack at it. Well done. I wouldn't say it's
      necessarily 'bad', if that means anything. It's still a game, and SOMETIMES
      winning is possible though I suspect that there's occasions when the game screen
      loads and from the get-go it's impossible, but I just can't be arsed to experiment
      with the game to see if that's true. Like I said, it seems as though randomness
      has a big role to play, I suspect TOO big.
