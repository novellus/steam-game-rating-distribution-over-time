The music doesn't sound good, just crappy and lazily written, The whole tone of the story is so painfully tongue-in-cheek that it loses any comedic effect. It's ugly to look at. Idk I got it for $0.08 and I still don't see it as worth the money.\n\nIt's turn-based, idk if it said that in the description of the game. So, ultra boring with cheesy battle music on top of everything else.","timestamp_created":1609907635,"timestamp_updated":1609907635,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s6D+6vYCe4b0wAI="}
