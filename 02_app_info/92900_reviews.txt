The issues I saw were mainly equipment tumbling in the garage when the garage door was opened.   You ignore it and it will correct itself when the garage door closes.   There was also a noticeable delay in the game starting after launch.  Just wait, it will start (at least it did for me). There were physic issues where a tractor or combine would occasionally fall apart piece by piece and float into the air, which seemed to happen at the edge of fields or a bump.    In spite of these issues, I just saved often and continued on.\n\nI figured out how to generate the most money to help me quickly buy more land, upgrade buildings, as well as equipment purchases and upgrades.   I also started to hire farmhands as I grew in size.\n\nI later discovered that if you play for awhile without saving, the game will lockup and crash.   Therefore, I am reminded to save the game often.   So far, seemed OK with the saving often work around, but,  i started having major issues after I had purchased the third farm.  The game did not seem to be able to handle such a large operation.  It started to crash shortly after I started to do some farming activity.    I don't know if the game intended for me to sell off the earlier farms as I progressed to bigger farms.   I was trying to run all three farms at the same time with two farmhands operating at each one.  Apparently, it was too much for the game to handle.  I had also noticed that the game will lock up if you try to use equipment bought for one farm to do something on another.   For example, I was hauling a trailer of barely from one farm to the silos of the other...CRASH.  Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that each farm is independent of the other.\n\nI got this game in a simulations bundle and should be the only way you end up with the game in your library.   There are probably less buggy farm games out there so I do NOT recommend this game as an outright purchase.","timestamp_created":1582928047,"timestamp_updated":1607400434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlYWioPYCd5ST9QE="}
