You're never explicitly told what things do, but it's easy to figure out with a bit of experimentation. The platforming itself is good, but feels a little slippery at times. You are a blob-thing, though, so I guess that fits.\nThe difficulty is a bit uneven. Most rooms are easy to solve, but you'll run across a few that require excellent timing and reflexes.","timestamp_created":1609623074,"timestamp_updated":1609623074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzd7A4vYCdpfuvwI="}
