It is completely unique in that way and unlike most games I have played before. \n\nPositives: \n- The Bosses are difficult to beat and all require a unique offensive approach to defeat them.\n- Weapon selection; there are a lot of weapons to pick up that are fun to play with, that work well against certain enemies, and that match your specific play style.\n- Levels; A variety of different environments processed with rng.\n- Gameplay; unique as stated above and fun to figure out (though it isn't for the feint of hear).\n- Enemies; you can see a trend here, a lot of variety. Many enemies to kill in various ways.\n- Graphics; depending on what you like, but the 2D top down style is well thought out and works nicely with the dual character mechanics\n\nNegatives:\n-Although I think the game is worth what it costs, it is a short game depending on your abilities. It took me an hour, but I played it for a few minutes during the development stage and have thousands of hours logged in video games across the board.\n- The final boss battle, although difficult, is fairly short once you figure out the level.\n\nAll in all it is a wonderfully unique game with fun mechanics you should try if you are looking to challenge yourself.","timestamp_created":1568693977,"timestamp_updated":1568693977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+s/cnu0CfKmw0gE="}
