    about_the_game: The Republic F-105 Thunderchief, first flown in 1955 and often
      known as &quot;Thud&quot; by its pilots, was a rugged and reliable multi-role
      fighter with an emphasis on low-altitude, high-speed penetration strikes with
      a single nuclear bomb. At the time of its construction it was the largest fighter
      in the world and set several world speed records. The F-105D was the definitive
      variation, featuring an all-weather capability and modern avionics (for the
      time) with 610 units of this type being built.<br><br>In Vietnam, the F-105s
      were used as bombers, the usual load exceeded by fifty percent the amount carried
      by a World War II B-17. An extra fuel tank was fitted into the spacious bomb
      bay while up to 12,000 lbs of bombs were suspended from five hardpoints. Though
      primarily used as a bomber, the Thunderchief still scored its share of downed
      Migs, 29 of which felt the bite of the Thud. The F-105D's wing measures 34 feet
      11 inches, tip to tip. Length is 64 feet 3 inches and height is 19 feet 8 inches.
      <br><br>Wing area is 385 square feet. With its afterburning J75-P-9V, the F-105D
      has a maximum speed of 1,390 mph at 50,000 feet. Empty weight is 27,500 pounds,
      normal weight is 38,034 pounds, gross weight is 52,546 pounds. The built-in
      armament of the F-105D consists of one 20 mm M61 Vulcan cannon with 1,029 rounds.
      A great variety of missiles can be suspended from the Thunderchief's hardpoints,
      the actual distribution being determined by the particular mission at hand.<h2

    review: "Fun aircraft to fly around in the game. Historical, so would please people\
      \ who like vintage military aircraft. In the information it states that development\
      \ was assisted by a real world former F-105 pilot. I've never flown one so I\
      \ will defer on performance authenticity to the creator. I'm a former crew chief\
      \ aka glorified aircraft mechanic, so I like looking at planes for detailing,\
      \ wear n tear, systems modeling, etc. Unfortunately there's not a lot of bonus\
      \ for me with this model in that respect. \n\nVisually the aircraft looks good.\
      \ Exterior is not super-detailed but it is enough to give some authenticity\
      \ and realism to the exterior looks of the aircraft. Has both green camo and\
      \ bare metal versions of the aircraft. It certainly looks the part which helps\
      \ with the immersion factor. Has working speed brakes, tail hook and refuel\
      \ probe extends and retracts. I will say that the plane does feel heavy (it\
      \ is large for a single-seat fighter, after all, especially when carrying external\
      \ items) and so be prepared as it loses altitude in the turns. That is actually\
      \ pretty realistic. \n\nInterior has both 3D and 2D cockpits, which is nice.\
      \ However, with both, they look rather dated. Perhaps the aircraft was made\
      \ for an older flight simulator, such as FS2004 and ported over to FSX it seems.\
      \ Still, what you get is good enough. After all, it's a warbird and not s showroom\
      \ condition civilian aircraft. So maybe the rough look fits the character of\
      \ the aircraft? Regardless, there are some 3D switches and elements to the virtual\
      \ cockpit to give you stuff to do and look at. 2D looks very good, though a\
      \ bit stretched wide in HD resolutions as this is a pre-HD aircraft, and most\
      \ things on it are switchable. Both have plenty of tooltips throughout. There\
      \ are also popup mini panels to use as well as a modern day GPS. General systems\
      \ seemed to be modeled ok though they are very basic and limited to just fuel\
      \ states and engine performance. Nothing extra or advanced like oxygen systems,\
      \ fuel flow, hydraulic systems, etc.\n\nCONS:\n\nThe virtual cockpit has its\
      \ share of bugs. You'll find a lot of warning lights that illuminate and stay\
      \ on for the entire flight when flying in virtual cockpit view. For example,\
      \ Low Fuel warning light stays illuminated from crank to shutdown in virtual\
      \ cockpit flying. In 2D panel flying it works as expected, as do the other warning\
      \ lights. \n\nSpeaking of shutdown, I could not find a way to shut the aircraft\
      \ down when parked at the destination airport. A random bug? A permanent bug?\
      \ I clicked all around in the virtual and 2D cockpits to no avail, using the\
      \ 2D panel fuel cutoff as well as the CTRL-SHIFT-F1 method of fuel shutoff.\
      \ Also shutdown battery, generators, the works. The engine refused to shutdown.\n\
      \nCONCLUSION: \n\nOverall a pretty decent product though I'd recommend you get\
      \ it on sale as the standard price seems a bit much for an aircraft ported from\
      \ a prior sim and only somewhere better than a freeware. Also, be aware there\
      \ are some bugs you may likely find that I didn't. It's not a perfect aircraft,\
      \ but for general fun flying the plane is good. Avionics all seem to work as\
      \ does the ILS though a bit buggy sometimes as this is a  high-performance aircraft\
      \ and you have to be on your game to prepare it for landing else the ILS autopilot\
      \ will leave you feeling like you are in a rodeo as it tries to correct, then\
      \ over-corrects, tries to over-correct the over-correct, and that's not good.\
      \ Otherwise, the autopilot and most all the systems I used appear to work pretty\
      \ well. Recommended if you like historical aircraft like this and just want\
      \ to do some fun flying in it. If you're looking for a maximum simulation aircraft\
      \ full of all the bells and whistles you may wanna steer clear."
