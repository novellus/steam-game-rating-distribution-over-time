    review: "Excellent addon for the base game that allows you to play the Soviets,\
      \ starting with the Japanese conflict in 1937 up to 1945.\nRight now I'm playing\
      \ Smolensk and I think the maps are well done and immersive. \nDefinite buy\
      \ recommendation, especially when the Soviet pack is on sale."
