      \ is a turn-based roguelike game with simultaneous orders, where you can play\
      \ not only against AI but also against other players. Destroy opponents\u2019\
      \ ships, choose various options for the development of your ship, take your\
      \ place among the best.<br> <br>You control a ship and its crew - a team of\
      \ battle mages armed with both sorcery and cannons. Going into the uncharted\
      \ depths of the magic ocean in search of the mysterious treasure, you fight\
      \ others who wish to find it. That way, what treasure you are looking for becomes\
      \ not that important. Destroy opponents\u2019 ships, choose various options\
      \ for the development of your ship, take your place among the best.<br> <br>One\
      \ battle in the game lasts about 10 minutes, and the complete playthrough from\
      \ start to finish and getting a place in the TOP list can take a few hours.\
      \ Also, every next playthrough will differ from the previous one.<br><br><img\

      \ any other roguelike, it requires a player to have psychological resilience\
      \ - most likely you will end up losing your ship with its entire crew. But you\
      \ can experiment with various development options and move up in rating each\
      \ time. The game also has an escape mechanic that, in most cases, allows you\
      \ to leave the battle when things don't move in your favor.<br><br>In developing\
      \ the game, we were inspired by well-known roguelike games such as Faster Than\
      \ Light and (in the context of the game progress) Slay the Spire, but we were\
      \ building a game for multiplayer fans so that you play not only against AI\
      \ but also other players. It implies the need to create new mechanics. It also\
      \ strongly affects the game flow, emotions that players get, and, finally, replayability.<br><br><br><img\

      \ game has a system of simultaneous orders (We Go), which implied that players\
      \ simultaneously plan their actions and then observe the results. Because of\
      \ this, the game is turn-based but isn't forcing you to wait for opponents for\
      \ a long time, also, it encourages &quot;mind games&quot;. For example, if you\
      \ can guess where several of your opponent's characters move, you'll be able\
      \ to &quot;greet&quot; them with a cannon shot at this cell. But your opponent\

      \ you can also play against AI (under special conditions) and develop your ship\
      \ by defeating a bot. This option may be useful for learning the game as well\
      \ as for a more relaxed gaming experience. But don't relax too much - bonuses\
      \ received by AI opponents increase on high ratings. Thus, even if you play\
      \ against AI, you will have to fight to get high on the TOP list!<h2 class=\"\

    review: Its a fun game and can be played in spurts.  Right now I can see a lot
      of potential for various strategies to work to defeat others / the computer
      so that is exciting.  You gotta die a few times to understand exactly how it
      works (at least I do because I dont absorb directions as well as others till
      I put them to use).  Overall I really enjoyed it and am excited about future
      changes as they develope the game!
