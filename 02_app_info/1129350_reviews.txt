It was very short, but neat.  There were aspects of pokemon, but it had dps/heal/tank classes and the potential for much more in-depth mechanics.  With a lot more work and some polish, it could turn out to be pretty solid one day.  I sincerely hope the dev continues work on this, but either way I don't regret supporting indie devs who put love into making their games.\n\nAs a sidenote, I would put a disclaimer that the game is unfinished (regardless of intent to finish or not).\n\nAs for finishing it up, depending on the level of trust for others and effort willing to be put in, I would recommend a kickstarter-ish program to fund additional development so that more people could get involved in helping to make the game.  Having another programmer or two can make a huge difference if you get someone competent and have a reasonable direction for your project.","timestamp_created":1579213728,"timestamp_updated":1579213728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1586539861,"developer_response":"Hi Sherwoodlunatic,\n\nI think that's a very fair comment regarding the disclaimer. \n\nI've added a development disclaimer to the game description:\n\nPlease note: Murgles is only about 3-4 hours of game play, and the game's full 20-30 hours vision was never completed. While fans of monster catching RPG's will hopefully get an evening or two of enjoyment from this title, please keep the scope of this game in mind when making your purchase decision. As of March 2020, the solo developer of Murgles has since expanded Jumping Pound Games and started on a MOBA project with several new teammates.\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\n- Murg"}],"cursor":"AoJwkKWe2O8Cff6p7AE="}
