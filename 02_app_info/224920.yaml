    review: "If I can sum up the game in one word, it is CLUNKY, incredibly so.\n\n\
      I'm not sure how anyone can remember this game fondly when the game actively\
      \ works against you to not enjoy the game.\n\nThe camera is way too close to\
      \ the character where an unseen hit from an enemy off-screen instantly makes\
      \ you lose your soul-reaver. This is frustrating because there is almost no\
      \ weapons to be found nearby to fight enemies without soul-reaver, and even\
      \ if there was, how can I see them when the camera is zoomed so close. The most\
      \ common thing to do is switch to Astral, regen health, switch to Material plane\
      \ and pray that an enemy doesn't get a cheap shot off you.\n\nCombat is the\
      \ very definition of clunky where some controls are subject to input delay,\
      \ making combat encounters more troublesome than its worth. I would skip the\
      \ combat entirely, but this is not the case where they repeatedly spawn cheap\
      \ enemies inside rooms where you have to solve puzzles.\n\nMe: Stop spawning\
      \ enemies man, I'm trying to solve this convoluted block puzzle...\n\nThere\
      \ is no mini-map or navigation hints to highlight where to go next, leaving\
      \ you scratching \n your head trying to make heads or tails of the in-game map\
      \ from the start menu or look up a guide. I was forced to look at online guides\
      \ on how to proceed to the next room or look up where to go next however guides\
      \ can only do so much.\n\nYeah I get it, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, but\
      \ it doesn't cover for badly aged game design, I would not recommend this game\
      \ unless you are part of the nostalgia crowd."
