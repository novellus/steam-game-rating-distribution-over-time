    review: This game satisfies all the cravings of any oldschool RTS fans who are
      fans of Mobile Suit Gundam and Battletech/Mechwarrior/Mechassault. This game
      is perfect for those who like commanding armies of customizable giant robots
      alongside more conventional armor and aircraft. The single player campaigns
      are awesome narrative gameplay that illustrates the nuances in the lore and
      personality of each playable corponation through the perspective of a trio of
      brothers. The narrative campaigns are unique in the sense that you can upgrade
      your pilots and forces between missions to improve their performance. Gameplay
      provides extra nuance in the ability to engage in orbital and subterranean warfare
      while fighting on a terrestrial battlefield. The playable corponations all have
      their strategic and tactical strengths and weaknesses that are best suited to
      most people's specific gameplay styles. Each corponation also has a unique personality
      and character that is best illustrated in the single player narrative campaigns
      from the perspective of the Angelus brothers, with Rimtech being the archetypical,
      self-righteous(if not outright obnoxious), liberal-democratic crusaders very
      much analogous to the cultural mentality and self-image of postwar America,
      The British Empire under the supremacy of the house of commons, and Revolutionary/Napoleonic
      France. MilAgro, by contrast, is the ultra-authoritarian, autocratic, brutal,
      heartless, absolutist regime, with the Cobb family being a proverbial absolute
      monarchy with extreme practices of nepotism. Milagro is very much analogous
      to Tsarist/Imperial Russia under the late Rurikovitch and Romanov dynasties,
      with the campaign ending with the youngest Angelus brother leading a bolshevik,
      marxist-style republican revolution of emancipation for the corponation. Neuropa
      on the other hand, is the puritan, evangelical, fundamentalist, firebrand religious
      xenotheocracy very much analogous to Jewish Zionism, Islamic Extremism, or the
      popular conceptions surrounding the scientologist community. The cultural, social,
      and political constitutions of each corponation are reflective in their gameplay
      style. With rimtech favouring a strong balance of ranged, close combat, and
      defensive abilities, MilAgro favouring attrition, numbers, expendability, and
      close combat capabilities, and Neuropa favouring ranged warfare, speed, stealth,
      and unconventional tactics. If you are a nostalgic pining for the old Mobile
      Suit Gundam strategy games for Dreamcast and Playstation 2 like Blood of Zeon
      and Gihrens Greed, or the old Battletech/Mechwarrior/Mechassault tabletop miniatures
      game, this game is perfect for you.
