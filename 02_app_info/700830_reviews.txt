And I could, on some levels like Yellowstone, the cabin and island levels. But on some levels, the game wanted to be an action game. Which I didn't much care for, but at least the dev tried building a game around poetry.\n\nMy two cents: put the journal entries before the levels. It's a lot better than letting players wander around helplessly and it makes sense of the levels. Levels in order please. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be alive, dead or neither on some levels. Again, giving the journal entry before the level would help, so would a logical progression in the game.\n\nOverall, it's pretty enough in a throwback graphics kind of way. There's nice enough music (though it is grating if you are stuck on a level searching for an object) and you get to do a bit of photography. But there is poor execution and the rules change form level to level. Stay on the path, go off the path. It tried to mix a nature walking sim with an action game and feels unbalanced as a result. \n\nBut at least the dev tried something different and you can go back to roam around a level once you've finished it. I'd say it's OK for .99 cents USD, but better on sale.","timestamp_created":1597454399,"timestamp_updated":1597454399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44fbs9/MCdp7CmwI="}
