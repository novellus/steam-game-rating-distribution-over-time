    review: 'I like this game. It''s a little more hectic than I expected but it''s
      unlikely to make you sweat. I particularly like that I got it at 67% off, it''s
      definitely a bargain at that price!


      I completed the 8 levels of the main game in about 2hrs but haven''t managed
      to clear the bonus time stage. I also had a little teleport around. I haven''t
      tried SINGLE SHIFT yet.


      The world you are in is well made and gives some grandeur to what is otherwise
      a quite simplistic game i.e. throw coloured ball in hole. However it does that
      very well. The colour blending (light not paint) works nicely, but they have
      clearly spent quite some time getting the throw of the ball just right.


      I think they could have padded the game out a bit more. The level progression
      is all at once. The balls come faster to you, the extra balls come faster from
      the reactor and more and more floor sections are removed. They could easily
      do baby reactor i.e. higher walls, full floor & slow balls. Normal reactor i.e.
      what you have now from level 3+. Super reactor i.e. weird chunks of floor missing,
      higher ball rate with irregular ball releases, reactor balls coming from all
      angles. And have 8 levels in each. Or go the whole hog and have a full set of
      rainbow coloured reactors from red though to magenta. I''m not expecting much
      different, maybe just change colour of the lights. At least then grandma could
      play the first reactor, rather than just the first level. Perhaps the single
      shift will answer some of that.


      The only thing I found a little annoying was the lack of feedback for why you
      just got another strike. I think when you fail to catch a ball it should explode
      and spray that side of your vision in paint (a bit like blood splatter in FPS
      games) and when they fall off the reactor should explode in a column of light.
      Also the robot should prioritise strikes rather than cutting off and saying
      the last thing that happened.


      Overall though I really like this game and will be playing it again. It is also
      on the list of games I will bring out to show VR virgins, it''s at least as
      good as the games in The Lab.'
