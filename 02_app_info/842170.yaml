    short_description: Hyperspace Dogfights is a juicy jet-combat roguelite in which
      you blast, dodge and slice your way through masses of technologically inferior
      enemies. Your jet-craft evolves differently on each mission and becomes stronger
      and weirder by gathering some of the 300+ items available ingame.

    review: 'I''m not typically a fan of bullet hell but the movement in this game
      is very tight, the attack tells system is very good (and has options to enable/disable!),
      screen shake and distortion is configurable :)


      The itemization is pretty interesting, you end up with some funky builds sometimes.
      It''s challenging but so far has never felt totally unfair. Mostly I just wish
      there was an in-game codex for items you''ve seen/unlocked/used, enemies you''ve
      slain and a tracker for objectives that unlock stuff in game (you see a very
      brief popup only, I''ve missed about half of them from being busy playing).'
