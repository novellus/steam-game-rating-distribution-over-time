And also at first, I was right about me not liking it. I thought the levels were too big, I thought it was dumb that you ate food the second you walked over it. But at the same time 90% of the songs I love now I hated the first few times I heard them. So as you could probably tell this game grew on me very quickly. It's a really good game!","timestamp_created":1609000948,"timestamp_updated":1609000948,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwksL7z/YCdKG4vQI="}
