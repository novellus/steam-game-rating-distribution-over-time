It's simple family fun. Just time your dropped monster with the power gauge to make sure you make a big impact! One thing I really like about this game is the option for an AI so you can play on your own if you can't find someone to play with you. I hate buying a game only to find out you have to wait for someone to join your game.  The graphics are super cute and it's fairly fast to learn. Even without instructions, I was able to figure the game out after playing a few times. This game makes a nice break after doing some chores! Perfect for friends or family! My honest opinion: Buy the game! It's only $4! Perfect for value! I didn't get a discount or money for this review.\n\nPROS;\nCute graphics\nFun for family and friends\nOption for AI player or play with family/friends\nGOOD VALUE for money\n\nCONS:\nNeeds explanation for CONTROLS and HOW TO PLAY\nNo Hard difficulty?\n\nCONTROLS\nS gives you the option of a special character (on bottom left-usually a whale or a yellow monster)\nuse your arrow keys on keyboard to move your monster (use the shadow to see where it will fall)\nPress Space to drop your character\nPay attention to the power gauge on bottom right\nDropping your monster on barrel bombs helps knock other monsters out\nGoal:Knock the other monsters out of the ring!\nMake sure not to knock your own character out of the ring if you want points!\n\nFUTURE IMPROVEMENTS \nDeveloper needs to add controls and how to play.\nI would like the option for less rounds (5 as a minimum instead of 10).\nAdd a hard difficulty (honestly just by adjusting the bounciness of the creatures to 10 would do the trick).\nIt is confusing who is who at the top of the page because the numbers change according to your points so one moment I was player 1 then suddenly player 3 before I realized those were points not the player. I think there should be a player image up there (you could have player 1 be a cat for example, player 2 whale, player 3 the yellow monster, player 4 a barrel bomb) or give players the option to choose.\n\nIDEAS\nIn the future, I would love to see more places added to play like a pirate ship or rainforest for example so maybe 5 options total.  And new challenges like bombs dropping and floors falling out. Or mini-games like playing tic tac toe by dropping monsters. or paint a room by dropping monsters who splatter paint ect. It'd be cool if you could choose your character at the top of the screen to make it easier to tell which player you are. And there could be a few more types of monsters or getting to choose what color your monsters are. I think with just a few more features added (like 3 mini-games) this game price could easily go up in value by a few dollars. I would say with a few improvements $7 would be good. You could have DLCs for things like 5 mini-games for $5 or extra characters DLC for $4 if you want to keep the base game the same price but still want people willing to pay extra for mini-games and extra features happy.\n\nOVERALL: FOR SUCH A LOW PRICE, I WOULD BUY THIS GAME AGAIN!","timestamp_created":1547869838,"timestamp_updated":1547912028,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9uOvs+gCcfvWuAE="}
