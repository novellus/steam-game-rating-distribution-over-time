    review: "Is this game good!!!! Is this game Great!!! Is this DLC worth the $1.19\
      \ (who even came up with $1.19??)\n\nThe answers to your quests are a resounding.\n\
      \nNo\nNo\nNo\nAnd still wondering\u2026.\n\nSo why might you ask did I bother\
      \ donating to a free game? Simple it looks like some guy/kid is going it alone\
      \ trying to make a game and letting us have a crack at it for free. While the\
      \ game needs a tone of work to be even half decent it is far better than half\
      \ the stuff out there listed for $10 bucks.\nSo I donated the $1.19 to see where\
      \ it goes after all who know maybe this person will make other games in the\
      \ future that are great. After all we all have to start somewhere.\n"
