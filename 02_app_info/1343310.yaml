    review: 'An accessible racing game for the visually impaired. Full audible menu
      scheme and an impressive tutorial.

      The simple graphics are easy on the eye and sound is acceptable.

      The core racing game is fun with the challenge to win each race the options
      for a single race or championship mode.

      The controls are simple using keyboard only.

      It is a shame there is no real integration with Steam in relation to acheivements,
      Cards or Leaderboards all of which would add to the fun.

      Happy to see more games coming to Steam with the Visually Impaired in mind'
