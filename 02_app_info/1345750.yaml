      \n<br />\r\nDream is a mysterious and dramatic puzzle game where the players\
      \ play  the protagonist that has woken up in an unfamiliar hospital. Throughout\
      \ the exploration to discover how everything started, there are many unexplainable\
      \ and weird occurrences. Players need to use their intelligence to solve puzzles\

      \ the players\u2019 logic and processing capabilities. Players will have to\
      \ carefully search every corner of the scene and solve various puzzles to move\
      \ onto the next segment of the story.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers will get to\
      \ choose from various options from time to time and players will have to consider\
      \ their current situation to select the most appropriate option. Some choices\
      \ won\u2019t affect the progress of the game, while others may lead to death\
      \ and the end of the game. In addition, players will also find many important\
      \ items when they aren\u2019t solving puzzles, which can provide additional\
      \ clues towards uncovering the mysteries in the plot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDream\
      \ will start with players waking up in the morgue and then they will come into\
      \ contact with all kinds of people, occurrences and items. In addition, the\
      \ players will encounter figures and scenes that should not appear in a hospital,\
      \ making the story even more confusing. If you are a person who loves a mystery\
      \ and the supernatural, this is a game you can\u2019t miss out on."
