    review: "1. Does not do BT audio well.  \n--  keeps cutting in & out so bad it's\
      \ insane.\n2. lack of any skip to the 'start' of the actual tutorial/game.\n\
      -- No one wants to wait 20-30 seconds.. while a 'cutscene' plays out in engine,\
      \ just to load the play area.\n3. Slow to trigger respawn  when falling.\n\n\
      Honestly, those 3 things genuinely make this a no buy from me.\n-- Refunded\
      \ even when I got it for 70% off.\n\nI would suggest if the developers are still\
      \ trying.. to stop attempting to take full control of the audio source & allow\
      \ windows to mix it (as it does for any other program), so that it doesn't ruin\
      \ Low latency BT connections.\nI would also suggest, not making intros manditory\
      \ every time."
