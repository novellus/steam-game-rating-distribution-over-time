    review: 'I gave it a thumbs down before and I think it''s getting to the point
      of being worthy of a thumbs up as some of the things I had issues with have
      been fixed.


      It''s getting a lot better, making the racing line visible through the buildings
      (or a lot more visible perhaps?) makes it a lot easier to see where you need
      to go.


      The wall crashing''s a lot better, you do still get stuck a bit though if you
      throttle up to try to go forward, the wing hits the wall and steers you into
      it again...an easy solution would prob. be to just add a front wing as it''d
      make the nose stay in a straighter direction. (reversing takes longer than simply
      floring it to bounce out so it''s not really an option either


      It feels like you increased the difficulty too as I did grab a bronze before
      and now my closest time is about 1 sec. off on one of the easiest tracks, that
      I never did play a lot of the similar games way back when doesn''t help of course.
      (I am also a hood view type of gamer which also handicaps me a bit)


      Overall it''s been improved quite a lot and I''ll keep it installed and see
      how things move along occassionally.'
