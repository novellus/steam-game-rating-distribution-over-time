However,  it is very difficult to increase conservative membership and happiness without harming your country extensively. A couple more policies should be added in that increase conservative membership. Another thing is that when i tried to play a conservative Canada play-through, there were no cabinet officials that were sympathetic to conservatives and the majority were for liberals. This ended up killing my PP as i was forced to take officials that were unsympathetic to my play-through. This has also probably been stated before, but imigration needs to be nerfed drastically. It rises too fast and doesnt give any warning until the point you realize that you are at 80% unemployment. However, other than those small problems, the game is amazing! I love playing it and i love the progressive form of increasing and decreasing policies. I also love that it shows exactly what \"Urgent Events\" effects are after you click on them. The game has seen much improvements and i cant wait to see what else is added further on","timestamp_created":1610083580,"timestamp_updated":1610083580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwhred8PYCd5S7wQI="}
