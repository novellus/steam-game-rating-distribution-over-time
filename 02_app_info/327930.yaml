    about_the_game: <strong>Heroic Adventures in Medieval Germany</strong><br>Deep
      in the twilight of the Black Forest, you and your companions crouch before the
      robber-knight's tower. Hans, the alchemist, places his mysterious potion by
      the door. Ebhard the friar implores Saint Dunstan to bless your weapons and
      armor. And you and Gretchen grip naked long swords, praying your plate mail
      won't squeak.<br><br>With a thundery crash, the door explodes into fragments!
      You charge inside, swords and maces swinging. One guard falls beneath the power
      of your blade... then two more! You storm upstairs to the second floor, but
      there to greet you is Erhard the Red Wolf, the infamous robber-knight, surrounded
      by his henchmen. Hans tosses a choking potion into their faces and you quickly
      charge into the fray. The room echoes with the clash of steel on steel... it's
      a battle to the death in the Black Forest!<br><br>Prepare yourself to enter
      Darklands... the first <strong>realistic</strong> fantasy role-playing adventure
      for computers!<br><br>Leading a band of four adventurers across the sinister
      landscape of 15th Century Germany, you'll face the Middle Ages as people believed

      city streets and dank mine shafts, or from a robber-knight's tower to the terrifying
