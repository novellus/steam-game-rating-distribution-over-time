My GF and I really enjoyed taking turns playing. You can play two player if you have two controllers. I couldn't test that out. I just used Keyboard and Mouse. For two 'ol foggies who havn't gamed on PC since some time in the early 00's.. This is a great relaxing game before playing heavier stuffs. Just a nice lil chill game. Well worth a few cash creds.","timestamp_created":1591520209,"timestamp_updated":1591520209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4huX/xvICcu/VjAI="}
