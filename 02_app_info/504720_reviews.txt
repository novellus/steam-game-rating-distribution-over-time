If you use this app, you're going to miss all buzz/notifications from other apps like Discord, Facebook. So make sure to change this.\n-4/4 beat only, no options to do 3/4 songs. Then again, all loops are 4/4 so you can't do anything about this.\n-Grid lines just for show - while you can zoom in and see grid lines, nothing actually snaps to them aside from the 4/4 beat as stated above. Good luck manually nudging the loops to match with the line.\n-No mixing song maker, the function is strictly to generate songs from one sound pool at a time. BPM is locked and can't be changed.\n-No license for generated songs from this app, so unless you plant to make some tracks to listen by yourself, forget about upload, share, monetize. Making backing tracks to jam guitar, play piano, drums over? Don't bother.\n\nConclusion: NOT RECOMMENDED. This app might be fun to mess around and generate some simple sounds, but it's very limited and there aren't much you're allowed to do with your creative tracks.","timestamp_created":1499012790,"timestamp_updated":1609986337,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510428726673126221","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jr2q7fYCfZW1fg=="}
