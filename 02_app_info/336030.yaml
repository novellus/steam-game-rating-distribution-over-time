    review: 'Gameplay: Simple to use, But Hard to master precision steer tapping (if
      you know how to steer tapping). It''s you vs the clock or a faster PB or ever
      others'' PB.


      Graphics: It''s self-explanatory. mix it up some 8-bit and 16-bit looks. ever
      see a top down car zooming around in a Mario Bros. Level?



      Controls: Simple pick-up-and-pay. But hard to master the "Tap Steer" move.



      Soundtrack: Alright. Nothing to listen outside the game. it''s good neither
      or less.'
