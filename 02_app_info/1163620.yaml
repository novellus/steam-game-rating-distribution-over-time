    review: 'In short, this game is less a proper game and more a project from a beginning
      game-making class.


      The assets don''t all work together, and they''re different enough that I think
      some of them were purchased off of an asset store. They all fit the same theme,
      but the assets all have art styles just different enough to throw me off.


      The game drops you in with little to no explanation of what''s going on, in
      the "customizeable hub world" that''s really just one area with a few unlockable
      decorations.


      The gameplay is extremely simple, more of a minigame than a proper game. It
      is, admittedly, somewhat challenging, but it''s certainly not something you''ll
      feel inclined to come back to.


      I''d say this game isn''t worth your time when taken at face value, but there
      may be some value in it for a beginning game developer who wishes to learn from
      it.


      And to the devs of this game specifically... Don''t let my review get you down.
      You''ve successfully published a working game to steam, so that''s a big milestone.
      For your next game, however, you should take a lot more time thinking of an
      idea, and polishing it. I''d say a good game will take a couple years to make.
      You''ll probably have to get a day job to support yourself during the process.'
