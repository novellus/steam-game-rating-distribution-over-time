    about_the_game: When winter came, a deadly storm covered your village in a thick
      layer of snow and dismantled the infrastructure as you used to know it. Climate
      change heated the world, but also caused extremely cold storms in the north.
      Northern Storm is a build-strategy game set in a little village in Sweden, at
      a nice little river between the mountains. As the spirit of the village, your
      job is to manage the people and their resources. The simple goal of survival
      is increasingly harder to achieve as the storm becomes more and more deadly.
      Remember that I am just one developer, so don't expect a large scale game. Although
      it is not in early access, I plan to add features to the game if players ask
      for it. The reason it's not in early access is that I don't want to make large
      changes to the mechanics that are already in place.

    short_description: Northern Storm is a build strategy game where a blizzard comes
      along and destroys your builds. After climate change caused a deadly cold storm,
      survival can only be achieved through strict management of resources. Remember
      that I am only one developer without a team, so don't expect a large game.

    review: 'I really wish I could give this game a neutral setting. This game has
      great potential and I love the potential it could have. It takes everything
      to boil water. I feel that should be a basic building as every time I played
      they would die of thirst. There was a help screen when you play but its rare
      that you can even get passed it.
