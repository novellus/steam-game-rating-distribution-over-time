    review: I'm surprised there are no reviews for this yet. I thought the BGM for
      the game was pretty grand. I bought this for one song in particular, which the
      OST didn't actually have, but I did get 27 other well done scores. The price
      is a little steep, but you can often find it on sale, as I did, which makes
      it more manageable. Most tracks are decent length at around 2 minutes, with
      good fading in and out, so it doesn't just start and get cut off at the end
      abruptly. Several tracks have made it onto my regular playlists.
