    about_the_game: Time to hop into a dirt-thumping dune buggy or tricked-out truck
      and race your way to victory in TNN MOTORSPORTS HARDCORE HEAT. The world of
      off-road driving action is yours for the taking as you compete in varied modes
      like Championship, Time Attack, and an invaluable Practice mode in cars you've
      modified down to their brakes, suspension, and even stylish decals. You begin
      the game with four challenging tracks and have the ability to open two more
      as the maneuvering continues. What kind of terrain will you be steering your
      shock-blasting machines across? Slippery snow, crunching dirt, splashing mud,
      hot sand, and even the relative safety of pavement will put your driving skills
      to the test. Your opponents utilize clever artificial intelligence so you'll
      have to be cunning as well as quick to win. A hard guitar rock soundtrack and
      quips and taunts from competing drivers round out the Nashville Network-licensed
      madness. TNN MOTORSPORTS HARDCORE HEAT is a downshifting, rump-bumping ride
      of rally racing gameplay glory

    review: I love how the graphics are the same as the original Playstation, big
      ups on the PS1 Port.
