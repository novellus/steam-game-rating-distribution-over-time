      \ of somebody in a crisis situation. Unlike some games, your decisions have\
      \ a serious impact on the story and the events that follow. It is meant to resemble\
      \ real time meaning that a no decision counts as an action, and can result in\
      \ lost time or negative consequences. Put in the middle of a crisis, what would\
      \ you do? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe concept came to me about a year ago after\
      \ being inspired by Scott Cawthon's Five Night's at Freddy's games after seeing\
      \ Markiplier's videos of his reactions during gameplay, and decided to make\
      \ a game of my own. <br />\r\nI thought about the other simulators that other\
      \ people have submitted, and came up with my own version and idea. I finished\
      \ my first Alpha Version last year, and though the animation and sounds were\
      \ not the best, I have made improvements in the backgrounds and artwork since\
      \ then and now I am confident, this the best version an amateur like me could\
      \ come up with for my first game creation on  zero budget. With the help of\
      \ two of my good friend's lending their voice talents, royalty free sound effects,\
      \ and music/animation that I created myself, I made this game in its entirety\
      \ using an old copy of flash. <br />\r\nThe whole project was started with absolutely\
      \ no budget, and took me initially two months to make during my free time on\
      \ my days off, as well as before and after work, and six months afterward improving\
      \ the backgrounds and artwork. My wife and my two little black lab pups were\
      \ sometimes not too pleased with me... <br />\r\nI am very pleased with the\
      \ support of the steam community to have everything greenlit and ready to go\
      \ before my targeted upcoming October release date. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis\
      \ is my very first title which is part of a movement I'm trying to start up,\
      \ &quot;Making Games for Charity&quot;. (Check out my facebook group)<br />\r\
      \nAfter finishing my first title, with absolutely no budget, I soon after decided\
      \ that, if I could get my first game Greenlit, I would be donating half of the\
      \ proceeds to the Toronto Humane Society and the Humane Society of Durham Region.\
      \ I plan on using the other half of the proceeds to have an actual working budget\
      \ to create at least two new titles, (much better quality games) in which I\
      \ already have the concepts in mind, in which half their proceeds will also\
      \ be donated to various other charities upon their completion.<br />\r\nSteam\

      \ has a HUGE potential market for generating money for good causes."

    review: 'A (very) small choose your own adventure type of game about "What would
      you do" if there was a home invader situation.


      After a few play-throughs (which only take a minute or so) you''ve seen as there
      is to see.


      Recommended if on sale & you like weird indie games.'
