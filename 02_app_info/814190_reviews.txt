Why not make a game to make that as fun and exciting as possible, dedicated to just that?\n\nNow let's make every bad decision you can aside from the visuals;\n\n[h1][b][u]The Bad[/u][/b][/h1]\n\n[b][u]Atrocious controls:[/u][/b]\nSorry man, not EVERYONE wants space as their jump. I actually despise it. At least you can adjust mouse sensitivity.\n\nKeeping in mind you cannot remap at all, you want to build (and maintain) speed so you're expected to hold shift. But you can't use right-shift because you need your right hand for the mouse to move.\n\nNow, if you release space, you immediately fall quickly to the ground. You should anchor that too, most of the time--unless you like sudden Jupiter gravity when you're bouncing on the moon.\n\nDo you see the issue here? You're expected to anchor 2 keys on your movement hand and STILL use WASD. Movement is not like Source engine, so you press a key and you move in that direction. If you release all movement keys, you only descend downward.\n\nYou'll probably just end up anchoring W to keep consistent movement. Now you're anchoring 3 keys, with brief releases of space every second or two to initiate a jump.\n\nNow, while you're doing all this with just your left hand and changing directions with your mouse, you're expected to hit left click or right click and hold those for periods of time to shift your color to green or blue because if you're not the right color when you hit colored platforms, you die too.\n\nThere's too much crap going on here.\n\n[b][u]God-Awful Pacing:[/u][/b]\nPacing is horrible in this game. You need to maintain max speed no matter what.\n\nIf you lose max speed, you're bouncing around on small platforms over and over while you continuously move in a circle and try your best not to miss or fall off. You also only gain speed running, so it's gonna take a while because most of your time is in the air. Sometimes just because of how things generate, it'll be nearly impossible to continue without ever slowing down and losing tons of speed.\n\nIf you're wondering \"why not just gain speed on straight-aways?\"... well you don't get those. Just small platforms and walls. You're always jumping.\n\nOh, by the way, that while it'll take you to build speed? You can't afford it since every section is timed and will collapse below you if you stop for a few seconds.\n\n[b][u]Poor Procedural Generation:[/u][/b]\nYou're forced to stay moving quick, but you only get to see the stage in sections. Once you hit each checkpoint, the next section right in front of you shows up, giving you no time to react and often meaning blindly running off the ledge or just jumping and hoping to correct your bearings in time.\n\nSometimes the random gen just decides to give you a nearly impossible section with no time to think and/or requiring nearly perfect play. Sometimes I don't even see the next section show up and it basically causes me to lose instantly. When they say broken, they meant it.\n\n[h1][b][u]The Good[/u][/b][/h1]\nThe game doesn't have much going for it... sometimes it's visually appealing, but sometimes it's just meh. The simple style makes understanding what you're looking at easy though.\n\n[h1][b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b][/h1]\nThis game as it stands isn't worth the 99 cents I spent on it. It's gruelingly difficult, somewhat unintuitive, and has some of the worst controls I've seen in a movement-based game. I'd make the following changes:\n\n[b][u]Revamp controls:[/u][/b]\nAdd momentum so you can keep moving and adjust more comfortably. This also means airstrafing becomes more of a thing, which people tend to like from Source engine bhopping/jumping. It doesn't need to be as strict or difficult as Source though, where holding W ruins everything or where A/D have gradual effects.\n\nStop forcing me to anchor shit: max speed always; momentum as explained above; releasing shift not ruining your jump and throwing you downward.\n\nREMAPABLE CONTROLS, please. This should be expected of any game where controls are so damn important.\n\n[b][u]Level Design:[/u][/b]\nMany more platforms, possibly larger on easier difficulties (add difficulties, man), and some straight-aways to give you a rest and/or add variety.\n\n[b][u]Game Mechanics:[/u][/b]\nColor shifting is a bit meh and boring of a mechanic, but just makes things more difficult. At least a switch to turn it off would be nice.\n\nRemove time limits for sections: that ain't fun.\n\nLastly, let me see the next section at all times, and hitting a new checkpoint lets me see the second section forward. This means I don't have to react blind and always see what's coming.","timestamp_created":1523089517,"timestamp_updated":1523089517,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563661158084869385","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nLXNz+ICeZ7XnQE="}
