    review: 'If you''re familiar with Frogdice''s other match game title, ReignMaker,
      then Dungeon of Elements and its concept won''t be entirely unfamiliar to you.
      The goal is quite simple, which is to use the magical ''pills'' you create as
      an alchemist to destroy various opponents on the board. The pills descend and
      can be flipped about in a Dr. Mario-like fashion. When they make contact with
      something and explode, they leave behind similarly colored smoke times which
      you can match up with later pills. Match enough tiles of smoke and they explode,
      hopefully taking a few of your opponents down with them!


      As with all Frogdice games, this one attempts to inject some story into the
      match-3 type experience. The tale is told, in writing paired with quality illustrations,
      of the rise and fall of alchemists throughout the events of history on Primordiax.
      As an era of prosperity returns to the world, alchemists are rebuilding anew
      and your character is within their ranks. You get to choose your character''s
      appearance from a variety of choices, as well as their starting attire. As the
      game goes along and you defeat enemies in the matching battles, you''ll collect
      equipment. These items might have useful effects during matching fights, such
      as immediately killing an enemy, or slowing down the game''s pace to give you
      more thinking time. Adding further to the atmosphere, in addition to the unfolding
      story, is that the above mentioned items change your character''s attire whether
      the pieces have game effects or are simply cosmetic.


      There are various other aspects of the game to play around with. A crafting
      system helps you to learn new pill recipes for the matching game, or to create
      new items. On occasion, in my experience, random events would also pop up;.
      I received a visit from a merchant who offered to expand the capacity of my
      item belt for a sum of Triads.


      This is a great game for those of you who like the matching genre and want to
      spice it up with some story and side elements. For those who may have found
      ReignMaker too challenging, I also thought that Dungeon of Elements moved at
      more of a beginner''s pace. The speed of the matches was certainly toned down
      and had fewer elements to pay attention to, giving me time to think about how
      I wanted to flip the alchemic pills and place them to best effect. Another great
      outing by FrogDice which tries to mix up the matching concept with some story
      and side goals.'
