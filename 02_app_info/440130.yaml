    review: "This game is one of the best I've found in a while and I wholeheartedly\
      \ recommend it to anyone who enjoys visual novels and otome games. There are\
      \ not enough around in my opinion and this one is worth the investment of money\
      \ and time. I adore the characters and the hugely complex world of this game,\
      \ it pulls on the heart-strings and leaves you wanting more.\n\nPROS:\n- The\
      \ routes are all separate with completely different stories~!\n- You don't have\
      \ to play all of the routes if you don't want to.\n- The sprites, BGs and CGs\
      \ are GORGEOUS\n- The music is really really lovely!\n- World is expansive and\
      \ so much world building\n- Characters are well thought out and interesting\n\
      - 3 Good Ends and 3 Bad Ends.\n- QUALITY\n\nCONS:\n- The format is a little\
      \ unusual and potentially confusing for buyers (which is why so many reviews\
      \ are complaints that the game isn't free). The demo is free but you need to\
      \ buy the guy's route separately and it downloads into the same game giving\
      \ you access to it, Hikaru's route is in two parts, and for all the routes you\
      \ also need to separately buy the epilogues. \n- May feel pricey because you're\
      \ buying the bits separately but really isn't."
