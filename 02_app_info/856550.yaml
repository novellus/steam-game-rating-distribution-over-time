      /><br><br>Most games trick you! They make you believe you''re improving at the
      game, when really you''re unlocking things that make your in-game character
      more powerful. Stabby Machine does not lie like this. When you do better than
      you were before, it''s because <strong>you really are doing better!</strong>
      <br><br>Because of this, Stabby Machine is a very difficult game. <br><br><img
      src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/856550/extras/sword_(4).png?t=1533029724"
      /><br><br>Survive for <strong>as long as possible</strong> by collecting batteries,
      which are dropped by enemies! <br><br>Watch out! Your battery power drains <strong>faster
      and faster</strong> the longer you''ve been playing. <br><br>You must <strong>choose
      wisely</strong> how many enemies to spawn. Too few and you''ll run out of batteries,
      but too many and you''ll be overrun! <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/856550/extras/sword_(1).png?t=1533029724"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Controls: </h2>Stabby follows the mouse (alternatively
      you can use W A S D). <br>You <strong>MUST GO CLOSE TO</strong> enemies to make
      them charge, then react quickly to dodge them! <br>If you succeed, the enemy
      becomes vulnerable and you can run up to it to <strong>stab it</strong>. <br><br><img

      /><br><br><strong>If you want a difficult open-ended challenge to overcome,
      then this game is certainly for you!</strong> <br><br>If you want to casually
      enjoy a new experience, this game can give you that too. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/856550/extras/Stabby_King.png?t=1533029724"
      /><br><br><strong> <h2 class="bb_tag">Enjoy!</h2> </strong> <br>No micro-transactions
      or in-game purchases. <br>None of that silly <i>come-back-in-two-hours-or-pay-me-money</i>

      how many enemies to spawn, and you choose when they charge at you. Different

    review: 'I am having great fun making tactical decisions as skill improves! Good
      instructions and desciptions of the enemies, all easy to understand. Fun graphics
      and music while you play. As you level up you unlock different gamemodes with
      new enemies to defeat and new skins for Stabby (and bigger swords).

      There is a practice mode well worth trying to get the hang of the game or just
      to relax. You want to have your battleplan ready to become king Stabby. I am
      still working on that one, it''s very hard!

      Unique game I am enjoying immensely. Well worth the price for an already polished
      game in development. Impressive! Well done to the developers!

      New enemies?  New strategies? New abilities? Can''t wait for updates!'
