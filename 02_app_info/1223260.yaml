    review: 'At first, I wasn''t sure if I was going to enjoy the game. This game
      feels like a blast to the past. The game is similar to a classic dungeon crawler,
      with gameplay that reminds me of Morrowind or Oblivion. The controls are pretty
      easy to pick up and learn, and the combat is pretty straightforward. I thought
      it was a good game.


      Then when I figured out that the game is comedic, it made my playing more enjoyable.
      I wasn''t extremely impressed at first, but after learning that the game parodies
      classic tropes and that it realizes that it''s doing it, it made playing the
      game more fun. I found myself attacking random objects for the funny and random
      comments that the character would make about the action.


      The only downside to me is the combat music. It isn''t bad by any means, but
      it gets a little repetitive and doesn''t exactly fit with the rest of the game''s
      music or aesthetic. But that isn''t much different to the older games that this
      is based off of and parodying.


      Overall the game is fun and I recommend it to anyone that wants to enjoy a simple
      classic dungeon crawler with a comedic element.'
