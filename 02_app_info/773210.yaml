    review: I'm having an error where having my 3dConnexion software installed makes
      the controller inputs in various games do wonky things (the character only spins
      around; The menu selection is always at the top; etc.). With this program, I
      made a new profile, and set the Space Mouse's axes to zero; that cleaned up
      that issue. I really wish I didn't need the program for something so basic,
      but, oh well, it works, and that's all that counts.
