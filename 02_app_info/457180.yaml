    review: "Disgusting game and poor designer...\n\nFirst thing you notice is the\
      \ table itself is too simple, but i ignored the fact, since many TTS have simple\
      \ designer, so i really wanted to learn how the game works and then i go to\
      \ the rules book to see it.\n\nThe first thing i noticed is about the text,\
      \ it looks the text book was printed with a low ink into it and when you try\
      \ to read it, you can't see very clearly because it's completly erased the word,\
      \ and it has some important words on it that you can't say for sure because\
      \ the damn word is almost transparent on the \"paper\" \n\nPoor decisions: The\
      \ rules i didn't quite understand because it looks simple, but i can say it's\
      \ not organized one of the first pages should contain The Setup of the game\
      \ and not useless information like i can read in the description on the steam\
      \ store.\n\nIt's a shame, because i found the game interesting in the gameplay,\
      \ but that's no excuse to charge people money, with a poor quality like this\
      \ one... I requested a refund immediately."
