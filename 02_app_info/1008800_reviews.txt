Temple games did the wonderful digital ports of Race for the Galaxy and Roll for the Galaxy all using an advanced AI that is something special.\n\nIf you have ever played Ascension, Dominions, and even Star Realms you already know the basics of how to play this.\nThe boardgame port is great and works. The real shining star in this game is the AI. It is a neural net trained AI that evaluates the best decisions based on learning from thousands of games. It will give you a challenge.\n\nTwo ways to win, attack, and destroy the opponent. Or collect enough mastery points to obliterate the opponent and win instantly.\n\nThe game is aggressive, fast, and fun.\n\nAsynchronous multiplayer. Games are 15 minutes or so. Can handle up to 3 other players AI or Human.\n\nThis is a solid addition to your digital board game library. I look forward to the expansions being released and converted.","timestamp_created":1609502989,"timestamp_updated":1609583981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547445237636566162","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nM6r4fYCc82wvwI="}
