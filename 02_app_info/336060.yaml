    review: "Amazing and fun game, buggy port - Which is a shame, since I fully support\
      \ keeping old games playable on newer systems. I bought it for under \xA31 on\
      \ sale, even though I already have the DOS version from years ago - 'cause,\
      \ hey, achievements are cool, right? The DOS version is still being sold though,\
      \ and works with DOSBox. Go get that instead. :)\n\nThis 2015 port doesn't add\
      \ much to the DOS version, other than a couple of graphical extras to the HUD\
      \ and explosions which you probably won't notice, and an ugly (in my opinion)\
      \ but optional \"HD filter\" which smears out the pixels. Saves are buggy -\
      \ It'll create new \"profiles\" instead of overwriting, and you can't tell which\
      \ is which other than how much money you had.\n\nYou can play it with the keyboard,\
      \ but I prefer using the mouse. However, mouse controls (in my experience) are\
      \ buggy, with sticky X axis in menus and in game, and you can't move your plane\
      \ all the way to the right of the screen. Maybe some sort of DPI issue? \n\n\
      Maximum resolution doesn't go very high in fullscreen - Though with old pixelated\
      \ graphics, that may not matter so much. It can be played in windowed mode instead,\
      \ but if trying to play using the mouse, it won't stay within the game borders\
      \ without third-party fixes. \n\nPeople were complaining on the forums about\
      \ these issues back when this was released in 2015, and the dev was aware of\
      \ them, but didn't get around to releasing a patch. I could've lived with the\
      \ other bugs, but not the mouse issue. I was hoping it wouldn't be as bad as\
      \ people were saying.\n\nAs I said, it's a shame - I think a game as a good\
      \ as Raptor deserves better than this, but I also hear that the original programmer\
      \ is apparently making a proper remake, so good luck to him. :)"
