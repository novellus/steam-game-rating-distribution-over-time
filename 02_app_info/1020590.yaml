    review: "[h1]Overview[/h1]\n\n[i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Reunion[/i] is the fourth[spoiler]and\
      \ likely final[/spoiler] installment of the [i]Space Pilgrim Academy[/i] series\
      \ and eighth overall in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i].  Anyone who has seen\
      \ the store page already knows that Maggie Dale arrived in the Sun Systems and\
      \ the title infers there's some sort of \"reunion\" that occurs.  This particular\
      \ installment in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] also features a class reunion!\n\
      \n[h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]\n\nNothing has changed from [i]Space Pilgrim Academy:\
      \ Year 3[/i], so this category does not apply to this review.\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n\
      \nEverything that fans of the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] love about the series\
      \ is back so everyone can expect a great story with memorable quotes and funny\
      \ moments with the occasional bad pun.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1702174058\n\
      \nOnly in this particular installment, this is the most emotional game ever\
      \ in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i], and that's not to mean \"sad,\" because\
      \ while there is that, [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Reunion[/i] invokes many more\
      \ extreme feelings. (Some good, some bad.) What the player feels (and the extremes\
      \ to which they feel it) really has to make the player wonder why the [i]Space\
      \ Pilgrim Saga[/i] is still an indie game made by a handful of people when it\
      \ should be made by a AAA publisher with millions of dollars poured into it's\
      \ development.\n\nGiven some of the scenes, [spoiler]particularly in Maggie's\
      \ visions[/spoiler] [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Reunion[/i] is probably an amazing\
      \ experience if the player happens to be watching those scenes while the player\
      \ is under the influence of certain substances known to amplify visions.  (Particularly\
      \ some leafy substances, or even the inspiration for the song [b]L[/b]ucy in\
      \ the [b]S[/b]ky with [b]D[/b]iamonds.)\n\nFor the first time in the history\
      \ of the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i], quotes are used at the beginning of every\
      \ chapter, and the quotes recited are excellent mood-setters, and will hopefully\
      \ be a feature in future games in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i].\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n\
      \nIt's easy to just say that this category does not apply to [i]Space Pilgrim\
      \ Academy: Reunion[/i], but the author must try and grasp for straws to find\
      \ faults anyway...  For starters, trading cards aren't making a comeback, which\
      \ is obvious given the lack of demand for cards from the [i]Space Pilgrim Episodes[/i].\
      \  (If someone wants to get a level five badge for four different games for\
      \ really cheap, the player can do that.  The player should also remember that\
      \ Steam users do not have to own a game just to collect cards for those games!)\n\
      \nLike all games in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i], the player needs to be one\
      \ of the chosen few that was granted the magical powers to upload screenshots\
      \ to games that do not support the Steam overlay.  (Or are these powers not\
      \ magical, and were instead planted into the brains of Steam users by Marion\
      \ Dale?)\n\nGiven how nobody sought to ask [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/25150682/]REXCurse[/url]\
      \ to conduct an official review, that really sucks.  (Although it may be that\
      \ this author is known to be a loyal fan of the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] and\
      \ was going to buy the game anyway!)\n\n[spoiler]Being the apparent end of the\
      \ [i]Space Pilgrim Academy[/i] series, it doesn't appear that the player will\
      \ be able to play Maggie through year four of her days as a cadet, which means\
      \ no interesting classes, and the player doesn't get to experience Maggie's\
      \ learning of marksmanship and solo starship piloting first hand.[/spoiler]\n\
      \n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis author swears on his four level five [i]Space\
      \ Pilgrim Episodes[/i] badges and four corresponding foil badges that the ulterior\
      \ motive of this review was not to satisfy Steam's algorithm so that the achievements\
      \ earned in the game officially count towards the player's profile for achievements!\
      \  Instead, a friend of the author wanted a review, so the friend gets a review.\
      \  Only it seems like blasphemy that the friend hasn't played a game in the\
      \ [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] since [i]Space Pilgrim Episode IV[/i]!\n\nNominated\
      \ by ol' Il Pallino for The Outstanding Story-Rich Game Award in 2019, this\
      \ is anything but a biased decision. No better story in a game was experienced\
      \ on Steam.  Once the player finishes this game, they'll be desperately waiting\
      \ for the newest story arc. (Which will most likely be 2021.)\n\n[h1]The honest\
      \ word of Il Pallino... OR ELSE![/h1]\n\nThis game was reviewed independently\
      \ by an administrator of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/25150682/]REXCurse\
      \ (REXnetwork)[/url]. \nNo compensation was provided.  \n\nEmail contact@dnbmedia.co\
      \ for requests & promotions."
