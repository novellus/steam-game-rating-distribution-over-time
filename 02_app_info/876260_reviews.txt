You can find blueprints or buy them with earned in-game money to craft additional things such helmets, vest, medikits, etc.. This can give you an advantage over other players.\n\nI'm really excitet how the developement of this game will go on.\n","timestamp_created":1556389853,"timestamp_updated":1556389853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497041434049606323","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ49I6EsOoCeI+MwAE="}
