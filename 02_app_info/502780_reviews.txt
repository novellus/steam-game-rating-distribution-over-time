I loved Starflight on the Sega Genesis and so far, this has come the closest to recreating the magic and wonder of that experience. The graphics and layout take me to a time when computers were new and exciting! The developer is still very dedicated and new updates are still being added. Highly recommended, with the caveat that the tutorial videos are a must, and the in-game link to these doesn't work. They are easy to find however. Overall, Avalon is the great retro experience I was always looking for and gave up finding long ago. What a pleasant surprise!","timestamp_created":1607484447,"timestamp_updated":1607484447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kcPiovYCc7iouAI="}
