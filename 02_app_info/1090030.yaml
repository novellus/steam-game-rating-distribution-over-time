    review: You are a captain of a cargo ship. Your current mission forces you to
      take a half-year long journey to a faraway station, and bring with you a mysterious
      cargo, while maneuvering between cultists, anarchists, men in blue, and corporats.
      It's a nice story about an uneasy task, full of dangers and intrigues. Amazing
      cast of characters, well-written fractions, and lots of opportunities to shape
      the exact captain you want to see.
