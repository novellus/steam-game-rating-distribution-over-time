    about_the_game: '''Keysight'' is an Unreal Engine powered real-time midi visualization
      platform aimed at piano/keyboard-focused streamers and video creators. Its purpose
      is to provide the most comprehensive, configurable and feature-rich set of visualization
      options in a single piece of software.<br><br><strong>This program is intended
      to integrate with an external midi controller (such as a digital piano or keyboard).
      Midi files can only be used by playing them back in an external piece of software
      linked to a virtual midi device.</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Notable features</h2><br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Randomizer</strong><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1325730/extras/randomizer_v1_compressed.gif?t=1608331056"
      /><br><br>Overwhelmed by options, or just in need of some inspiration? Randomize
      it! Keysight can generate infinite new presets at the click of a button. Preset
      elements can be &quot;re-rolled&quot; individually, to further fine-tune a preset
      without having to ever dig into the options! Randomization can be performed
      in a few different ways:<br><br>- &quot;Safe&quot;: randomized presets have
      a cohesive colour scheme, and won''t contain anything too crazy.<br><br>- &quot;Full&quot;:
      the full power of the randomizer is brought to bear, for better or worse! Presets
      are weighted towards staying cohesive, but have a chance to contain some wilder
      elements.<br><br>- &quot;Seed&quot;: the randomizer generates a preset using
      full randomization but using the given text, guaranteeing a specific (albeit
      random) preset.<br><br>Not happy with how the randomizer is generating presets?
      Configure it! The randomizer has 111 editable chance branches to tune exactly
      how presets are generated.<br><br></li><li><strong>Midi hotkeys, websockets,
      and automation</strong><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1325730/extras/websockets_v1_compressed.gif?t=1608331056"
      /><br><br>Various actions, such as preset switching / randomizing / undoing,
      can be automated through a few different methods.<br><br>- Midi hotkeys: specific
      note combinations can be recorded to trigger a linked action, providing a way
      to change up the visuals from directly in front of the piano, no PC inputs needed!<br><br>-
      Websockets: Keysight can connect to an external Socket.IO server to both receive
      commands, and output light color and brightness data. This allows for functionality
      like stream-chat controlled Keysight, or Keysight-controlled physical lights!
      <i>(Requires server implementation on the part of the user for these things
      to happen though.)</i><br><br>- Randomize looping: Keysight can automatically
      randomize after a set amount of time. This can be used to randomize colours
      between pieces / movements, or (using a short interval) to give every note its
      own preset. Unleash the kaleidoscope!<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Configurable
      note direction</strong><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1325730/extras/realtime_v1_compressed.gif?t=1608331056"
      /><br><br>Notes go up. Notes go down! When in bottom-up note mode, Keysight
      behaves as you would expect of a real-time visualizer. However, top-down mode
      is where things get very interesting, as the midi inputs are still &quot;live&quot;.
      Not only can top-down mode be used to record tutorial-style videos, but it can
      also be used for live streaming by delaying audio (and cameras) by the time
      delay amount. This allows for live, time-wizardry-esque &quot;Keysight knows
      what is being played before it''s played&quot; streams!<br><br></li><li><strong>3D

      /><br><br>Keysight is 3D! And internally consistent with its dimensions. The
      first-person free-cam, field-of-view slider and coordinate fine-tuning controls
      allow for exact placement of the camera within the scene. There is also a dedicated
      image overlay mode, for ease of matching Keysight to a real-life camera angle!<br><br></li><li><strong>Semi-transparency</strong><br><br><img

      /><br><br>Speaking of integrating Keysight into a physical scene, why not remove
      the background of Keysight while at it? For simple semi-transparency, the backdrop
      color can be manually specified to be chroma-keyed out. However, Keysight also
      supports a more advanced form of dynamic masking to achieve artefact-free perfect
      semi-transparency without losing any color range!<br><br></li><li><strong>Custom

      reading? Thank you for making it this far! Keysight is a one-man labor of love

      considered to be in its final form, and new features will be added as time goes
