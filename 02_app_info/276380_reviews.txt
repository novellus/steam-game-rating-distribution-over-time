Sometimes, I need something like this to help me relax and it can be effective as a means of slowing down my higher brain function. However, if you're looking for a decent pet game or actual boarding simulator THIS IS NOT IT! This is not a simulator, it has more in common with a tap-based mobile game to be honest. If you're going to get this game, and I don't recommend that you do, then just buy it with the rest of the familyplay bundle during the summer or winter sale for $14. You can get eleven games, some of which are decent, for about $1.50 each when you break it down. That, in my opinion, is the most this game is worth.\n\nPros:\n1. Animal Models - Some people might find some of the animals cute (I think the rabbits are okay)\n2. Cheap - As stated above, when purchased with the familyplay bundle, the price of this game was about $1.50 for me. The normal price of $15 is BEYOND absurd.\n\nCons:\n1. Store page flat out LIES - There are no mini-games whatsoever. You do not mix feeds, lunge foals, give medicine, or teach tricks. Also, there are no side missions to speak of, and calling the gameplay a \"main mission\" is undue flattery of the actual product.\n2. NO WAY to speed up the gameplay - Gameplay drags, especially in the first 3 scenarios or so. Once you have 3+ types of animals in residence it gets a little more involved, but there's still a lot of dead space. You also cannot end the days early.\n3. No sandbox mode - You play only in 7 set scenarios, all but the last one would basically count as tutorials in any other game. The last scenario is the only one where you can have all six different types of animals, and you MUST play them through to completion in order to unlock them one by one. It's not hard, it's just tedious.\n4. Weird voice acting - Grandpa guest sounds like an animated Tim Curry villain wannabe (might be a pro?)\n5. Unclear instructions - There is NOTHING to indicate to you what the different care symbols for the animals mean. Some are obvious, like health, food, and cleanliness, but others, such as the diamond, the person and the tree, and the face with the plus symbol are very unclear on what they mean and how you fulfill them. Also, the values in this game are backwards. Usually, in this type of game, having hunger at 100 is a good thing, it means the animal is satisfied, but the values in this game are reversed (hunger = 100 is very bad).\n6. Difficulty settings are a joke - Goes along with unclear instructions, but the game is stupidly easy in any setting\n7. No customization of character - You are a blond, very pale, teen for the whole game whether you like it or not. I didn't expect this to bother me as much as it did, but I'm a brunette and always make my character in sim games like this brunettes as well.\n8. You cannot run - Because doing so would just give you MORE dead time to fill.\n9. Some animal models come in only one color - Cats, to my knowledge, only come in orange, and most rabbits are pure white.\n10. Bad script - Guests will say the same lines to you whether you accept their pet or not, which can be kind of funny. Also, you say some awkward things to the animals you care for (\"Good PET\" is one of them, I mean was it really THAT hard to just assign a sex to the animals so you could say good boy/girl? Who says GOOD PET?!?!?!?!?!?!)\n11. No point to the separate days - You will start a new day (called \"rounds\" in the game for some godforsaken reason) in the exact same location you ended it in and the animals stats will not change at all.\n12. Out of place sound effects - I can hear random dogs barking in scenarios where dogs have NOT been unlocked yet.\n13. You can't move the camera diagonally down right","timestamp_created":1561904101,"timestamp_updated":1561909624,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzK/E1OsCfvaHyAE="}
