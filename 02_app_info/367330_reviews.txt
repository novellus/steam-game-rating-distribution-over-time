Minus a somewhat cluttered playspace with lots of players and the rules being on a card that you have to examine very closely (just as a head's up, the website that's listed as an alternative manual on that card just leads to an Amazon page where you can buy Superfight), it's still a perfectly playable game. The inclusion of other decks (even if the Orange and Red ones have to be paid for in a sort of DLC-for-DLC kind of way) is pretty cool, also.\n\nWhat I will say is this, though: while being on a call with friends is recommended for Tabletop Simulator but not required, it's damn-near necessary to have a good game with Superfight. Superfight is, to put it bluntly, a game about silly arguments. Its main crux is talking a lot, which will leave you with diminished returns if you're stuck in the text chat.","timestamp_created":1607233197,"timestamp_updated":1607233210,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6ZCkm/YCf/TWtwI="}
