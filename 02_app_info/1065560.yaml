    about_the_game: "<strong>Malcom's Day</strong>\xAE is a platformer whose development\
      \ was influenced by a strong passion for videogames of the '80s and '90s and\
      \ by the beautiful experiences lived in the daily life of those years.<br>Developed\
      \ by a guy from the '90s.<br><br><strong>BEFORE YOU START READING THE GAME DESCRIPTION</strong><br>What\
      \ follows is a brief summary that describes some details of this adventure such\
      \ as the presentation of the main character and some features related to the\
      \ gameplay.<br>The truth is that a video game is difficult to explain and the\
      \ best way to understand it is to play!<br><br><strong>THE MAIN CHARACTER</strong><br>Who\
      \ is Malcom?<br>He is a middle school kid whose main passion is make a mess!<br>Mocking\
      \ the professors and pranking them fill his school mornings.<br>One day after\
      \ coming back from the physical education lesson with his classmates, the teacher\
      \ of the next hour was sitting at her desk waiting for him.<br>Without even\
      \ giving him the time to set his backpack down, she blamed him for hiding the\
      \ items contained in her pencil case.<br>Given his history he was immediately\
      \ put in the worst of punishments...The desk to the front of the class where\
      \ it was impossible to copy during the tests, at least until the items will\
      \ be returned.<br>But what if it wasn't him the guilty one this time?<br>Malcom\
      \ wants to prove his innocence, a strange journey awaits him!<br><br><strong>COMBAT\
      \ SYSTEM</strong><br>At the start of the game only one physical attack at close\
      \ range is available but it will not be long before you can get hold of curious\
      \ instruments for long-range attacks.<br>At this point fighting against enemies\
      \ will be much more fun!<br><br><strong>ENEMIES AND OUTFITS</strong><br>Each\
      \ area in which there is a fundamental item to solve the case is protected by\
      \ a strong enemy, but after defeating him you will be rewarded with a new outfit!<br>After\
      \ being collected, the new outfit can be worn by selecting it from the menu.<br>The\
      \ new outfits, as well as changing the look of Malcom, allow the use of more\
      \ powerful attacks or the creation of objects useful for energy recovery or\
      \ the recovery of points that allow special attacks to be carried out, such\
      \ as (funny) attacks that cause continuous damage to enemies.<br><br><strong>OTHER\
      \ CHARACTERS</strong><br>Malcom will not be alone in this adventure.<br>Many\
      \ will be the allies able to provide valuable advice and suggestions such as\
      \ where to find a hidden object, how to complete a secondary mission or even\
      \ suggest a secret password to be inserted in a strange device located inside\
      \ an abandoned submarine that can only be reached after finding and wearing\
      \ a wetsuit...<br>There will be bizarre characters and creatures whose existence\
      \ is considered a legend.<br><br><strong>SIDE QUESTS</strong><br>It will be\
      \ possible to face many missions besides the main one, each of which will have\
      \ a precise goal.<br>Some involve the discovery of hidden objects, others the\
      \ destruction of many cars, still others searching for people...or growing a\
      \ plant, increasing the level of some skills, collecting medicines, etc etc\
      \ ect...<br><br><strong>ONE HUNDRED PERCENT COMPLETION</strong><br>The main\
      \ story offers a series of challenging adventures, but ending the story does\
      \ not mean having finished the whole game!<br>In fact in the menu there is a\
      \ section dedicated exclusively to the percentage of completion in which the\
      \ requests to be met are shown and next to each of them the relative percentage\
      \ obtained after completing that particular request.<br>You can complete the\
      \ whole game at any time, even after completing the main story!<br><br><strong>CRAFTING\
      \ HEALING OBJECTS</strong><br>As mentioned earlier some outfits give Malcom\
      \ the ability to craft objects that allow the recovery of energy or the recovery\
      \ of other points necessary to carry out special attacks.<br>It is good to keep\
      \ in mind, however, that these skills will be usable only if Malcolm has the\
      \ basic materials necessary for the preparation, as well as having the correct\
      \ outfit.<br><br><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br>It's up to you to discover the\
