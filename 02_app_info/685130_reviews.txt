Yes, it is a mobile port, but it's a port done correctly. You get free credits and gold from the ingame shop every 45 minutes, and a pack of support cards once a day. The rest of the upgrading you do in the game is completed with credits and gold that you earn during missions. There are NO microtransactions in this game! I just completed the last survival level, and I consider the game completed at this point even though there are a few more achievements that I didn't get. All in all, if the game catches your eye, give it a try!","timestamp_created":1517632887,"timestamp_updated":1517632929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571699380874633789","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zpf+rOECePPslwE="}
