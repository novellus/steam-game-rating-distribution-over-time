    about_the_game: "Welcome to the lost age of chivalry, where magic and myth is\

      \ of Uther Pendragon, the Once and Future King of the prophecies.<br>\t\t\t\t\
      \t\tFulfill your destiny and claim your rightful place on the throne of Britannia.\
      \ Recruit fabled knights to your Round Table: send them to adventures or battles,\
      \ let them gather knowledge and artifacts, see how they become the most powerful\
      \ heroes of the realm. Build the majestic Camelot, but beware: there will be\
      \ enemies, both mortal and otherworldly that will try to destroy you. Send your\
      \ heroes and their followers to battle with legendary warriors and monsters\
      \ and see how the folk of the faeries and the saints set against wizards and\
      \ evil knights.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Real-time fantasy\
      \ battles:</strong> spectacular fight scenarios on grandiose battlefields, featuring\
      \ thousands of soldiers and powerful heroes such as Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad\

    reviews: "\u201CYou will love playing King Arthur, in fact, you will love the\
      \ whole game. And it's really easy to get hooked on it.\u201D<br />\r\n92/100\
      \ \u2013 GameStar Hu<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201CKing Arthur is, without doubt,\
      \ the most fun I've had with a strategy game this year.\u201D<br />\r\n90/100\
      \ \u2013 IncGamers<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201CA supreme strategy game, rich\
      \ with incident and detail. Finally some worthy competition for the Total War\
      \ series.\u201D<br />\r\n86/100 \u2013 PC Gamer<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201C\
      ...King Arthur is an easy title to recommend. All of the various elements come\
      \ together nicely with a gorgeous and stylish presentation.\u201D<br />\r\n\
      86/100 \u2013 Cheat Code Central<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201CIf you like to\
      \ enable more and more things in a game instead of being shown everything at\
      \ once, this is a game for you.\u201D<br />\r\n82/100 \u2013 GameStar<br />\r\
      \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201CAll in all, King Arthur is the kind of title big game companies\
      \ just don\u2019t make anymore. Challenging, ambitious and quirky, this is certainly\
      \ a game that deserves a look.\u201D<br />\r\n81/100 \u2013 HellBored"
