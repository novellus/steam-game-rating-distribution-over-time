      \ plagued the Land of Ehb, and now\u2026a new menace has awakened. In Dungeon\
      \ Siege II, the sequel to the best-selling RPG from Gas Powered Games, you will\
      \ be called on to again wield sword and spell to save the world from a growing\
      \ abomination many years in the making.<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t A thousand years\
      \ ago, the crusaders of Azunai crossed swords with the legions of Zaramoth in\
      \ the final battle of a century-long rebellion. As the tyrannical god Zaramoth\
      \ struck the final blow through Azunai\u2019s trembling shield, the earth shook.\
      \ In that moment, the forces of magic were unchained, and both armies were consumed\
      \ in a brilliant cataclysm that stretched for leagues across the Plain of Tears.\
      \ Only a scarred wasteland remained as final testament to the First Age of Man.<br\
      \ />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t And for a millennium, magic has continued to spread to\

      \ it. But the tide of magic has begun to wane, heeding instead the call of an\
      \ ancient legacy. From the Plain of Tears a new heir beckons, and with each\
      \ day his strength grows. Consuming those who submit, eradicating those who\
      \ resist. With none to oppose his ascendance, the circle will be complete, and\
      \ an ancient age will begin anew.<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t What fate will befall\
      \ the Second Age of Man? The time for judgment is nigh."
