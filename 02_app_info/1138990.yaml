    about_the_game: <i>B.i.t.Lock</i> is a 2D puzzle game that revolves around different
      blocks that move in a grid-based system. These blocks can be shifted and shaped
      to create certain patterns, which are required to solve the puzzle. All blocks
      move at the same time in the same direction and interact with their environment.

      a certain pattern.<br>You navigate through six different worlds with their own
      themes and mechanics and free the world bit by bit with each level solved. Each
      world has its own style of gameplay and requires different ways of thinking
      to solve the puzzles.
