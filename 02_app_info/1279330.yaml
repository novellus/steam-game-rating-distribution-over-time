    about_the_game: 'Under Lock is a survival horror game that will immerse you into
      the grim ambience of damnation. The players can take one of the two opposing
      roles: monster or survivor. The game is designed for 5 players. One of the players
      takes the role of the monster, whose goal is to mercilessly murder all the survivors.<br>The
      other 4 players, in an attempt to survive, have to search for keys, which will
      eventually unlock an exit from the building.<br><br>Since the keys and other
      items appear in random locations, each round on the same level will be unique
      what will keep you entertained for many hours.<br><br>Moreover, the diversity
      of gameplay is achieved not only with random placement of items on the map,
      but also by completely different monsters, each of which has a unique hunting
      style and a separate set of skills.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1279330/extras/Spooky.gif?t=1610029657"
