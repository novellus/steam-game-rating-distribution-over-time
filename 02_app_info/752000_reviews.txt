Four words of praise:\n\n[list]\n[*]No bugs. (in technical sense)\n[*]The realistic bugs (in the literal sense) look cool.\n[*]Music choices are okay.\n[*]The boss battle is an alright concept.\n[/list]\n\nI think this game could be a decent, albeit repetitive, fun for little children.\n\n[h1]But...[/h1]\n\nIt is a very simple game. There's no story, just shooting bugs for its sake. Except butteflies and ladybugs because they're cute (you lose points for that).\n\nThere are three weapons: a close-range flamethrower, and two long-range shooty reskins/guns with a different sound effect and slight difference in damage.\n\nAll 30 levels have different backgrounds and bugs. That's cool. However, there's a problem:\n\n[h1]Every level plays the exact same way[/h1]\n\nUnfortunately, I was bored after 5 minutes of playing, realizing it would not change or get more challenging, only more tedious. I would have quit early, were it not for wanting to beat it for all achievements.\n\nIn each level a boss bug spawns downward zig-zagging little bugs. Killing them nets points, and their touch reduces your life (but it regenerates fast).\n\n[h1]Always the same boss battle[/h1]\n\nThe boss is initially indestructible but once you've killed enough of its spawn, it becomes vulnerable.\n\nThe boss AI walks back and forth and seems to have a rudimentary survival sense, as it sometimes turns around avoid your gun shots. So you have to chase or ambush it. Fine, but another problem:\n\nBoss health and the # of killed spawn required to make them vulnerable scales by level.\n\nIt's the ultimate boring choice of game design: instead of introducing new tactics, more attack patterns, unlocks, or other interesting stuff to keep things fresh, the boss just becomes tankier.\n\n[h1]Several other qualms[/h1]\n\nNote that you can't remap keys. There's no controller support.\n\nAlso, when you kill a butterfly (accidentally or not), there's this panicked or condescending voice telling \"don't kill the butterflies/ladybugs\". I mean, it's effective but heck is it annoying. And those cute bugs are always in the way, the bullet-to-bug hit boxes being very generous.\n\nSome of the backgrounds are rather obnoxious - while they fit the environment of the insect in question, they just aren't nice to look at.\n\nAs the final issue, if you wish to beat the game you have to do it in one session - there seems to be no saving and it always restarts from level 1.\n\n[h1]End note: Simply tedious[/h1]\n\nThrough sheer willpower (powered by my will to 100% the game) I persisted through and beat the game. It took 75 long minutes.\n\nThe game basics are fine: I didn't manage to crash the game once during the play, and the boss mechanic would be okay were it not the sole one. Game just needs more varied boss fights. I mean, the attack pattern that fits a black ant doesn't necessarily fit a beetle.\n\n[h1]Due to its repetitive content, I'd recommend getting it on sale. I feel it's worth less than $1.[/h1]\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9997062/]~Twistorian Curator~[/url]","timestamp_created":1521838863,"timestamp_updated":1521838907,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571344316005706787","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ459uqquICf6a0nAE="}
