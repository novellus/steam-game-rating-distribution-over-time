      \ Rainswept. From my own history detailing my shift from Architecture to game\

      \ making Rainswept a reality, this art book goes behind the scenes of the complete\
      \ development process. <br><br>Note that due to my unusual method of work, this\
      \ book doesn't contain concept art you might be used to seeing in most art books.\
