    review: 'I wanted to like this game, because it looked like an indy medieval fighting
      game. The environments are decent, I like the music, and there are enough characters
      to play.


      HOWEVER, it is currently unplayable. The character weapons are floating outside
      their hands, the camera has no lock-on feature, the controls are janky, and
      all character movements/actions are clunky. The hitboxes make no sense. After
      12 minutes, I was ready to write a review saying this game isn''t ready yet
      and needs more development time.


      I then checked and saw this is an actual release, not Early Access. This game
      isn''t ready. I won''t say it''s terrible, because I still want to like it,
      but it is completely unplayable.


      I''d almost recommend trying it, if only to see how unfinished it is. I wish
      the developers well, and hopefully next time they''ll be allowed more development
      time.'
