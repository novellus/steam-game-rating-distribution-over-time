The game offers a variety on Hidden Object levels.  \"How?\"  Well, how about a few levels where you have to mix and match things for a dress of a specific color? (It is shown above, so I am not spoiling).  That one took me some time... Also, there are puzzles and puzzles with documents... so you aren't only looking for items all the time!\n\nIs there a story line?  OF COURSE!  It is a murder mystery... which you \"help\" solve.  You get to go on an adventure with characters and visit the Amazon jungle!  Oh and yes, at some points the character models look a bit... strange, but when you play the game, they tend to look different.  (This isn't a complaint, just pointing out to those who notice).\n\nThe ONLY problem (yes... only) I had was with the boxes and keys puzzle, as the keys refused to go in, unless you are in incredibly specific spot!  Imagine failing 20+ times, to only realize that you had the right idea the entire time?  That and some items are so well hidden, that if you miss just a tiny bit... you don't get the item.  Well... there is no penalty for failing... except your mouse pretends to be an airplane for a few seconds when you click incorrectly too much.\n\nOh and the story works out.  I didn't try to guess what they are ever going to do... because that's the fun of it.\n\nHave fun, if you like these type of games!  Just don't get mad at the \"berry/mushroom\" level... they are so tiny XD... Thank you for an enjoyable game, that did an interesting \"questions\" game at the end!  :D :> :)","timestamp_created":1602182055,"timestamp_updated":1602182055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xcDfhPUCfI/VpgI="}
