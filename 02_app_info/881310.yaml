    about_the_game: BearHammer will make you feel strong, like <strong>BEAR</strong>.  In
      BearHammer you can absolutely smash enemies with giant hammers, sending them
      flying throughout Bearonia with powerful ragdoll physics.  You can also <strong>THROW</strong>
      these hammers and return them, simply by holding the trigger.  <br><br><img

      /><br><br>BearHammer is an action RPG arcade game, a unique mix between a wave
      based arcade game and a story-based RPG.  <br><br>For fans of quick action &amp;
      <strong>difficult</strong> challenges, there are 20 waves featuring different
      varieties of monsters and different objectives, ranging from taking down powerful
      bosses, surviving onslaughts of enemies with unique attacks, to defending the
      village of Bearonia itself.  We hope this arcade style gameplay appeals to people
      looking for quick satisfying and especially <strong>challenging</strong> gameplay,
      making it a fun game to show off to friends.  <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/881310/extras/trimmedDragonGif.gif?t=1578411916"
      /><br><br>For fans of story, immersion, and exploration, BearHammer features
      the beautiful island of Bearonia to explore with a variety of new weapons to
      unlock and special challenges hidden around the island.  You'll get the opportunity
      to ride a bear, fly on a dragon, use a mushroom drum set, and discover some
      of the hidden story elements behind the Toad King's invasion.   <br><br>You
      are tasked with defending Bearonia and its inhabitants of bears, turtles, and
      rabbits from the invasion of the evil armies of the Toad King, who summons evil
      StabRats, Crabbos, Dragon Beasts, Battle Toads, and more to spread his Power
      of the Frossst.  <br><br>This isn't another wave based game where you don't
      move and everything just comes at you--to win at BearHammer you must plan your
      attack and move throughout the level to stop different boss monsters and close
      portals from spawning more enemies.  <br><br>The game features teleport controls
      and free motion controls, which have given very few players dizziness due to
      the game's level design that features mostly flat ground and far views of the
      horizon.  <br><br>In the coming months, we plan to add online multiplayer to
      the game, to support both co-op modes and a 4-player domination mode where you'll
      have the ability to summon monsters to attack your opponents in addition to
      swinging the game's namesake BearHammers.  Further out on our road map, we'll
      also be adding additional maps and single player challenges.<br><br>For more

    review: "Watch my video here https://youtu.be/lj3TaarZj7A\nI used the Valve Index\
      \ to play this game. \nSadly this is another wave type of game. The NPC are\
      \ cool. Toad, giants Rats and stuff. They look really good. They come at you\
      \ hell bent on killing you. Graphics shimmer in areas and they look low textures\
      \ even on high. Blurry draw distance even on the Index. My frame rate was reprojecting,\
      \ but I was recording at 4K at the same time. So upping the SS would be worse\
      \ on the frame rate. Game Play is fun minus the grip on the Index changing the\
      \ movement option every time I gripped accidentally. \nI have alot of wave games\
      \ and I don't think this is the best. It is early access so it can improve alot.\
      \ Other wave games have level ups, power ups and perks!"
