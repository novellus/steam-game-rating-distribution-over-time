      \ almost as long as she can remember, but it\u2019s slowly been getting worse.<br\
      \ />\r\nShe thought Lillian was her friend, her best friend. Perhaps she even\
      \ thought of her as more than that.<br />\r\nWhy, then, did their relationship\

      \ At least, she didn\u2019t intend to.<br />\r\nNow, three months later, Samantha\
      \ finally has her chance. Forced together on their geography field trip to the\
      \ Lake District, will she finally be able to repair her relationship with Lillian\
