    review: "[b]\u201CFear is the main source of superstition, and one of the main\
      \ sources of cruelty. To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom.\u201D\u2014\
      \ Bertrand Russell[/b]\n\nIt came to the third part of [i]East Tower[/i] series\
      \ already? Wow, with each new one, the mystery has been kept well-fed, I must\
      \ say. At this point, we all know the drill, we all know what we will encounter...\
      \ or do we? This third chapter deviates from the routine a bit, by introducing\
      \ the unique condition of Kuon's story. He is a bit different from the other\
      \ participants. For once, he is the youngest, and he may not be declared as\
      \ the boldest, for good enough reason. He is the cautious one, with some heavy\
      \ trust issues. Want to find out more? Well, keep reading.\n\nSakuya, our protagonist\
      \ with a gender complex, arising from a past trauma, participates the demonstration\
      \ for the newest VR game by posing as a boy \u2013 that part doesn\u2019t change\
      \ since it always serves to be our prologue for the series. She joins the game\
      \ alongside four other young men and gets partnered up with Kuon this time,\
      \ a bit unwillingly. He is a cool looking young man with a stone-cold attitude.\
      \ As he somewhat halfheartedly treads around, we soon realize that he seems\
      \ distressingly familiar with the content and the rules of this game. May he\
      \ be the hacker? Or what lies under his uncanny knowledge and control over the\
      \ game? Spoiler alert: [spoiler]poor guy played this game more times than he\
      \ would care for![/spoiler]\n\nOur partnership with Kuon is deep layered, and\
      \ his character may be considered the best written in the game, so far. [spoiler]His\
      \ narrative is a great example of a well-established psychological coping mechanism.\
      \ Since he\u2019s been in the game for a long while, compared to everyone else,\
      \ he grew up in many senses; yet some parts of his psyche remained juvenile\
      \ and frightful. This dissociation also gets reflected upon his personality.\
      \ His demeanor instantly changes according to the visage he dons. His character\
      \ immediately changes, according to his form and the condition \u2013 which\
      \ makes him really hard to communicate with. Kuon's story - however sad and\
      \ somewhat disturbing - has been a joy to read about. At some point, Sakuya\
      \ describes him as a wolf under a bunny guise - which is a really fitting depiction.\
      \ [/spoiler]\n\nChallenges in Kuon's route differ from previous ones again.\
      \ They are not only psychologically unique to this pairing, yet they also contain\
      \ a philosophical aspect this time, about the very element of courage and wishful\
      \ thinking. In terms of artwork or atmosphere, the series are not one of the\
      \ best examples in the genre as I have noted in my previous reviews, yet I have\
      \ played the series enough to decide that the narrative and character build\
      \ don't disappoint at this point. We have 2-3 hours of game time, some achievements\
      \ and our last set of clues concerning the character of the mystery hacker.\
      \ Ready for the last part? I know, I am curious - which makes the series a success\
      \ by its own, in my book. See you for the last chapter in the [i]East Tower[/i]\
      \ series!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/11672469/]here[/url]\
