    review: "Part 2 plays a little different than the first part because you have\
      \ to worry about a larger group. Depending on which people survived or you rescued\
      \ or you killed, you have completely different events. Those who write that\
      \ Part 2 is too short didn't understand that there can be many different subplots\
      \ depending on who survives and who doesn't. Not surprisingly, there is only\
      \ one main plot strand. Different main plot strands can only appear in the last\
      \ part at the earliest, otherwise the story would be too branched. \nI would\
      \ buy this game also for 15 Euro, since it offers much more freedom of action\
      \ and depth than for example \"The walking Dead\". \nMaybe it's also due to\
      \ my perfectionism, but to play through part 1 and 2 once(!) (with several attempts)\
      \ I needed 50 hours and I enjoyed each of them. \nI am curious about part 3."
