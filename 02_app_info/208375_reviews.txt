In short, if you have the money and want some fun, get this. If you are after a realistic simulation of a class 50, get the new Armstrong Powerhouse class 50 pack- more expensive but miles better.","timestamp_created":1573025761,"timestamp_updated":1573025761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47ojpn+4CfbT61wE="}
