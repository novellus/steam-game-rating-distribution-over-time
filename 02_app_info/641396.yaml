    short_description: Miss Kobayashi and the others go to the beach. But Lucoa's
      immediately dragged off by one of the lifeguards for her overly skimpy swimsuit.
      After regrouping, they put sunscreen on each other, split a watermelon, go swimming
      together, and enjoy summer to the fullest. After the beach, it's comiket!
