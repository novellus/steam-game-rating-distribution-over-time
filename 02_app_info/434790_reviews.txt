The best you can hope for is an even trade, which means you lose since the AI's drones are also more powerful than yours.  The only strategy that works is to avoid the enemy and try to take outposts faster than he can, which gets boring fast.  The game starts out fun but quickly turns into a grind.","timestamp_created":1594098179,"timestamp_updated":1594098179,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u/vpk/MCcfe5kwI="}
