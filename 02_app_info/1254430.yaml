      \ everyone. I am a teacher and a fan of independent games. I have always wanted\
      \ to develop independent games through my own efforts and integrate education\
      \ into the games. <br>It took me more than a year to create more than 200 logical\
      \ puzzles. At the same time, I used the basic RM game development technology\
      \ to develop this pure puzzle game in my spare time outside of education. <br>The\
      \ function of this game is extremely simple, and it doesn't even have a multilingual\
      \ function, because I haven't learned it yet, but I will continue to work hard\
      \ to learn the game development technology, and what I hope more is that you\
      \ can experience the joy of logical thinking in solving problems through this\
      \ game. I also hope to bring the fun of parent-child education to families with\
      \ children. <br>Through the YATB series of games, we can combine games with\
      \ education, teach for fun, and exercise the logical thinking skills of game\
      \ enthusiasts and children who solve puzzles. <br>I hope this simple and challenging\
      \ game can get your love and support, which will inspire me to continue to adhere\
      \ to my concept and continue to develop independent games that integrate education\
      \ into the game. Thank you again for your support! <br>Thank you!"
