    review: Its... absolutely ridiculous to have a laggy maze game be mandatory to
      play even in replays of the main story to progress the game. My computer can
      handle a lot, but the maze's lagginess and the time limits both kill any enjoyment.
      If you absolutely must have the mazes every negative review addresses, then
      one of the first things done in the game post release should have been making
      them less laggy, or longer times, in addition to not mandating their replay.
