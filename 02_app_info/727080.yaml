    review: As a note, this package is split into two modules. If you find yourself
      scratching your head wondering where the racial data is for player characters,
      it's in a module by itself. Otherwise, you get you pay for with this. It's pretty
      painful that I had to buy all this stuff again, but FGs is just such a useful
      tool that it's hard not to.
