The owner has a goal in mind just needs to find the perfect area that he likes and sticks with it. Overall though it is fun, tons of bugs though with any very new indie type games, I'd say don't buy it till a full release comes out but if you want to watch it grow into something from basically the very first steps then go for it. I left the comments open for the dev/owner. I am willing to give you a list of bugs that I have encountered while playing this game (or this most recent updated version as of 6/11/2020). \n\nIf you are a achievement hunter like myself it is a easy game to grab and beat for some game completions but with it changing three to five times that I can recall the achievements reset I do believe so as long as the dev/owner sticks with one build of the game then it should be good to go! If not you may have to play this game many more times in the future to keep 100% done on it.\n\nI may edit this in the future if things change while I finish this version.","timestamp_created":1591914286,"timestamp_updated":1591914588,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9pzg0vICcuHAjQI="}
