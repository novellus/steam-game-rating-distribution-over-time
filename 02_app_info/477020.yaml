    review: "[b] I\u2019ll show them [/b]\n\nIn Silence, we followed Wilma as she\
      \ composed a new violin piece for possibly the most important concert in her\
      \ career. Then in Anthology, we meet the up-and-coming painter Franz and got\
      \ to see how he built his paintings by seeing the layers of his subjects. So\
      \ who is next before we get to the finale?\n\nWell in Episode 3 - Derivation,\
      \ we move away from music and painting to get into mathematics. We play as Emma\
      \ Recniczek, a mathematician working on a theory about change. Finding herself\
      \ stuck, she seeks out a group of mathematicians called The Radius in hopes\
      \ that they will help. However, no one takes her seriously. Finding it hilarious\
      \ that a woman is calling herself a mathematician, Zahler (The Radius\u2019\
      \ leader) mocks and shoos her away without letting Emma prove herself. Without\
      \ letting Emma show him what she\u2019s been working on. On top of this, Emma\u2019\
      s father recently passed away and she is given his personal effects per his\
      \ request.\n\nAfter working at the library and trying to get some progress on\
      \ her theory, a wrong turn to the market sparks an idea. Using her father\u2019\
      s clothes, Emma becomes Emil. If Emma, a woman, can\u2019t get into The Radius\
      \ and be taken seriously, then perhaps disguising herself as a man would. As\
      \ Emma\u2019s story continues, you\u2019ll get to see their journey towards\
      \ solving her change theory, how joining The Radius turns out, and the struggle\
      \ with determining their identity as Emma changes into Emil and vice versa.\n\
      \nIt\u2019s also good to note that Emma/Emil\u2019s thought process with solving\
      \ math problems is also shown. Appearing right beside or right in front of them,\
      \ you\u2019ll use your mouse to find the solution. \n\nDerivation continues\
      \ the trend of having the episodes connected in some way. Of course, you\u2019\
      ll run into Franz when he asks Emil to model for him and you can run into Klimt\
      \ in the market. Wilma makes a quick appearance as well as Grete. Nikol, the\
      \ little girl Emma talks to, was also briefly mentioned in Silence and depending\
      \ on your choices regarding Leos, you\u2019ll also get a small section with\
      \ him here.\n\nWhile The Lion\u2019s Song Episode 3 - Derivation deals with\
      \ someone in the mathematics field, the story of Emma/Emil is still compelling.\
      \ It also made me want to punch Zahler throughout the whole thing. After playing\
      \ through most of the episodes, I still recommend picking up The Lion\u2019\
      s Song Season Pass.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/RipWitch/recommended/437160]\
