Your main characters are a ripped guy in swim trunks named Gary, a nudist girl named Laura (who's butt naked throughout the whole game) and a group of women all clad in bikinis. You'll build up love/obedience points as you interact with your female companions, you can give them human body parts to lower the cost of interaction, at the end you'll choose one girl to be your wife, girlfriend or slave. You'll see your enemies on the screen, run into them and a battle will commence, however not all monsters will start a fight when you touch them, have Gary walk into simple zombies and he'll just punch them then they'll explode. The game isn't that long, you'll travel through 7 places, pool, Sandy's house, apartment complex, hospital, restaurant, school and military bunker. if you love zombies or nude women you'll love this.","timestamp_created":1556771237,"timestamp_updated":1603855877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uNDQtvUCc4KuwAE="}
