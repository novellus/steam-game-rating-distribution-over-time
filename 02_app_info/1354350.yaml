      few words on the composers</h2><br>We believe that game music is something more
      than just an effect incorporated into the game. And therefore this is something
      that we would like to show that is true. With that objective in mind, we asked
      Mr. Grant Kirkhope to compose the main theme of the game. Soundtracks Grant
      Kirkhope (GoldenEye 007, Civilization: Beyond Earth, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom
      Battle).<br><br>Attachment with a game is mostly done by music and we believe
      that musicality and feeling are key factors for that. Mr. Ryan McQuinn is incredible
      delivering those feelings in his compositions. Soundtracks Ryan McQuinn (Lotia,
      Dungeons &amp; Doritos, Call of Cthulhu Mystery Program, Liberty: Vigilance,
      Dark Dice).'
