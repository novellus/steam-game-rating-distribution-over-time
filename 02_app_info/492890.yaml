    review: Well considering i bought this when it was on sale today for 75% off this
      is basically a good start for beginners if they wait for it's on sale.  For
      the start two rare items and a golden legendary that will be used for a very
      long time. For me playing this game for about 6,650 hours it's a good start
      for the dlc items, Even old crusaders over event ones are still useful depending
      on the stage.
