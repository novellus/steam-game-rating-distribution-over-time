Its (relatively) low poly world make it a fast running game, even on my lower end gaming laptop. (which isn't really meant for VR). But even if you are playing on a higher end computer and are all about that *Detail* don't let the low poly-count dissuade you from getting this, as the vibrant colours make it a whole experience on its own.\n\nThis is by far one of the better if not best VR bird games I have tried. Even at only 14 minutes of gameplay I found it very easy to get a handle of. The weight of your flaps really propel you high into the air, making this a great game for just soaring rather than trying to get a workout. Landing took a pass or two to get the hand of, but even that wasn't too hard after a minute of attempts.\n\nThere are some minor terrain bugs(as of my playing) but since this is a relatively new game that is reasonable to expect. But this minor inconvenience is quite insignificant compared to the near professional quality of the rest of what the game has to offer.\n\nOther nitpicks I have is that flapping your wings backwards (back to chest) don't slow you down nearly as much as it seems they should(given how much power flapping up and down yields) making stopping from a fast glide to a landing somewhat problematic.\nI would hope that there becomes an option to adjust how fast you pitch/roll setting in the future as tilting and moving your wings to roll makes you yaw more than actually rolling (which I guess for some would be preferred because of motion sickness) I find this hinders your ability to preform aerial maneuvers.\nand a slight suggestion would be to increase the max speed for gliding/diving\n\nAll in all this game exceeded my expectations and even in it's current state I would say is still worth the $22.79 CAD that it is priced at. Great work Othercrow, I look forward to future updates.","timestamp_created":1592591886,"timestamp_updated":1592593601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4nrr+5vICe67/jgI="}
