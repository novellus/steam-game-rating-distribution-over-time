The Gripping Conclusion to the Snail Trek Series.\n\nPhil phenomenally delivers! There are a bunch of fun secret things in this one, some interesting and challenging parts, and the potential for some escargot.\n\nIf you are on the fence about this series, just get it, it's short, sweet, but carries a full universe in a couple hours of game play.\n\nA note on the developer:\n\nPhil is incredibly responsive. At almost 11PM PST I sent him a twitter message for help with one part that I thought I got. At the same time as I finally found a steam discussion where he answers my question (to my embarrassment, I could have saved him the time) he responded on twitter and was friendly and helped me out.\n\nWhat more could a fan ask for?!\n\nI give Snail Trek Chapter 4 a HELL YES!\n\nBuy it.\n\nDon't be salty.","timestamp_created":1594964746,"timestamp_updated":1594964746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8dPTrfMCfIDnlQI="}
