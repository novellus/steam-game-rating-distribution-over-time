The community just consists of disappointed VRChat refugees, you can always hear them complaining about \"how things will get better with time\". Save yourself some time and just make an empty VR Unity project with a mirror, it would be the same experience.Their website and description is hyping up this project as if it is the next big social VR game. There is absolutely nothing original about this. This is a pure cashgrab.The controls:What utter shite to play this with Vive wands. A simple touch on the trackpad sends you flying across the room. Vive trackers also seem not to work and there is no description on how to make them work.The UI:As soon as you start the game, you get greeted with the default Unity message and get thrown into a green scenery and a mirror. From there on, you're on your own. You are also not allowed to log in unless you link your steam account.The SDK:It is just barebones. You make a unity project, you set an avatar component on your model, define the visemes, viewpoint, click a button and take the exported file to their website and upload it.Simple enough, though again, no working full body tracking, no eye tracking and it also tends to break certain models for some reason and there is absolutely no option to debug. Everything about it is bugged.The pricetag on this junk is just the biggest middle finger and insult.","timestamp_created":1576177446,"timestamp_updated":1600329955,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":72,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.664516925811767578","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ466bGzfQCft3r4wE="}
