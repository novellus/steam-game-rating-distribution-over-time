You have zero control over your character in mid-air. Despite many people complaining about this, the dev remained stubborn and decided to keep it that way. If that were changed, it might be a fun game, but that won't ever happen. Just play Vagante or Catacomb Kids instead.","timestamp_created":1591849093,"timestamp_updated":1591865427,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w9ik0fICe/GujQI="}
