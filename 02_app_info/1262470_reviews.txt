The controls feel a bit fiddly on oculus, but once you figure it out its ok. I'm bad at trap and don't get to practice much, so have been enjoying the ability to get some practice and learn my holds. Overall I'd recommend for the price if your interested in real life shooting sports.","timestamp_created":1609486928,"timestamp_updated":1609486928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609619846,"developer_response":"Hi Warlord_Zap. Thank you for your feedback, would you mind going into more detail about the control issues you experienced on the Oculus so that I might be able to make some adjustments. Feel free to DM me, or post on the twitter account. Thank you again"}],"cursor":"AoJwiLG53vYCdauqvwI="}
