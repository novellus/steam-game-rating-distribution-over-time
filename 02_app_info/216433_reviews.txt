It gives you 2 new support items to defeat your online enemies with. The boomerang confuses your enemy and can hit multiple enemies which is a nice side gadget to use. The  Trap-in-the-Box explodes when enemies walk in its radius, its not very powerful but still can mess you up if there is an enemy near by to shoot you right after it explodes. This content just speed things up for customizing things with your character. You can skip buying this and buy these items with in-game money. This just gives it to you early, I recommend it if you want to speed things up.","timestamp_created":1346487714,"timestamp_updated":1346487714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.650883615016937256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjYC7wLkCcNWxCg=="}
