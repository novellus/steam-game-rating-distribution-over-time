      IT?</h2>A wildlife simulation game about wolf ecology.<h2 class="bb_tag">EMBARK
      ON A QUEST FOR SURVIVAL!</h2>When the game begins, you are a two-year-old gray
      wolf born in the Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park. You learned the
      ways of the wolf in your birth pack. Now it''s time for you to learn how to
      live on your own.Your quest begins on the slopes of Amethyst Mountain and eventually
      takes you across the Lamar Valley to Slough Creek. There, you and your mate
      will establish a territory and raise a litter of pups: training them, feeding
      them, defending them against predators, and finally taking them on a cross-country
      journey to a summer home. Ultimately, your success will depend on your ability
      to ensure the survival of your pack.<h2 class="bb_tag">PLAY ALONE OR WITH FRIENDS!!</h2>In
      single-player games, learn how to hunt elk, communicate with other wolves, find
      a mate, establish a den and territory, raise pups, and embark on a perilous
      journey to a summering site. <br><br>In multiplayer games, explore the wilderness
      and hunt elk together, and now raise pups together! This new version features
      the entire Slough Creek mission arc, from choosing a den to raising pups and
      traveling to the rendezvous site. There are two types of multiplayer games:<br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Private games: Invite-only, featuring voice, text, and phrase
      chat.<br></li><li>Public games: Anyone can join, phrase chat or (for players
      age 13 and up) text chat.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">WHAT''S NEW?</h2>This
      new version improves and expands upon the original game, a grant-funded project
      that has been downloaded by over five million players around the world since
      its original release in 2008. Now, for this version 2.7, we''ve refined gameplay
      and graphics, added a new player account system with achievements, friends lists,
      and more, and completely rewrote the animal AI system. We''ve also added more
      wolf howls, over two dozen wolf customizations, and emotes -- accurate wolf
      behaviors to communicate with your packmates. And we created a mysterious new
      map to explore in single and multiplayer games. As always, there''s also an
      active online community where you can discuss the game with other players and
      share artwork and stories about wolves.  Visit <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.wolfquest.org"

      NEW STUFF! We''ve added cougars, moose, foxes, ravens, and a plethora of bird
      and insect life to the game, along with much richer and varied vegetation. <br>
