    review: "I have mixed feelings about Glo after completing the game. First the\
      \ things I liked about Glo.\n\nGlo is a hardcore platformer with a nice twist\
      \ \u2013 the whole world is pitch dark with only your avatar and the end goal\
      \ glowing faintly. You can shoot some glowing projectiles to explore your surroundings\
      \ a bit. The darkness that doesn\u2019t allow you to see very far ahead, the\
      \ nasty writings on the wall, the disturbing sounds, the flying enemies that\
      \ try to get you, the one-hit-instant-death mechanic, and the lack of save points,\
      \ these all add up to a tense atmosphere. Fortunately, you respawn extremely\
      \ quickly. Your avatar moves pretty well, with the exception of how slippery\
      \ it sometimes is, especially when you land on the red sliding-disk-enemies.\
      \ The level design is mostly good, but sometimes overly sadistic, especially\
      \ when the hardest part of a level is put at the end (remember, no save points\
      \ - die and you go back to the start of the level). Because of the darkness,\
      \ players need to rely heavily on trial and error and memorization to make it\
      \ to the end. However, Glo is certainly no puzzle game, without platforming\
      \ skill you won\u2019t get very far.\nSome of the jumps and tricks you need\
      \ to perform in certain levels at first seem totally impossible to pull off,\
      \ but obviously all of them are possible, and when you finally master them this\
      \ feels very rewarding.\n\nEven though the basic gameplay mechanisms are well\
      \ implemented, the game really suffers from a couple of (in my honest opinion)\
      \ mistaken design decisions.\nThere are 100 levels and 4 bosses. After every\
      \ 25 levels you get a boss fight. The boss fights are totally different from\
      \ the level design of the rest of the game and feel a bit out of place - in\
      \ the boss fights the player needs to rely completely on memorization, and much\
      \ less on skill.\nMy major complaint is about the weird and erratic difficulty\
      \ curve. In each set of 25 levels a new game mechanic is introduced. The levels\
      \ in each set of 25 progressively get more complicated and challenging. However,\
      \ the final levels of the first set of 25 levels are just as hard as the final\
      \ levels of each of the following 3 sets of 25 levels - there is not a gradual\
      \ difficulty curve in this game, but instead the difficulty curve resembles\
      \ a saw blade. This means that you will encounter some of most difficult levels\
      \ already early in the game. If you can make it past the first boss, you basically\
      \ have proven you can make it until the very end of the game \u2013 just look\
      \ at the proportion of players that has beaten boss number 1 (14.7%), 2 (9.8%),\
      \ 3 (8.8%) or all 4 (8.8%) bosses \u2013 nearly everyone that beat boss 2 has\
      \ completed the game! The huge difficulty spikes early on in the game apparently\
      \ lock out many players from experiencing a large part of the game because there\
      \ is no way you can skip a level. I understand that Glo wants to be a hardcore\
      \ platformer, but I think the game has done itself a disservice by preventing\
      \ a very large part of the people who bought the game from progressing very\
      \ far into the game, even when many of the early levels in each set of 25 levels\
      \ are pretty easy.\n\nAlthough your avatar generally controls very well, there\
      \ are a few annoying exceptions. In level 72 for instance, you have to traverse\
      \ a simple little maze dropping through 1-block wide holes in the floor, but\
      \ doing this is actually very difficult because your character needs to be lined\
      \ out exactly above the hole to be able to fall through. Unfortunately you can't\
      \ position yourself that precisely and I got unfairly killed by moving blocks\
      \ because of this issue very often in this level.\n\nIn all, I did have a good\
      \ time playing Glo, but this game truly is not suitable for casual players:\
      \ if you did not get 106% in Super Meat Boy, Glo might not be for you. Glo is\
      \ mostly like the Cotton Alley dark world levels from SMB."
