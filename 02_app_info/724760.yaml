      /><br>I'm a self taught game developer and this is my first commercial release.
      In the game you pilot a helicopter across four levels. Expect a stright forward
      shooter, with some simple resource management. I would appreciate any feedback
      and will do my best to be of help if you have issues with the game. Contact
      me on twitter, my website or on the forums and I will do my best to get back
      to you. <br><br>Thank you for taking the time to check out this game, and I
      hope you find it enjoyable.<br>Francisco Arias - CETVE LLC<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/724760/extras/gameplay.gif.png?t=1530900095"
      /><br>Each of the four levels are composed of series of individual objectives
      that must be completed to clear the level. You pilot a helicopter with limited
      ammunition, health and fuel, each of which will need to be replenished as you
      play by finding pickups scattered across the level. Accessing your map and mission
      objective screen will help you navigate between points on the map. The camera
      can either rotate with the helicopter or stay fixed in its orientation. Movement
      can be swapped between either a fluid gliding feel or a more rigid feel.  Their
      is no saving mid level, instead the game automatically unlocks the next level
      upon the completion of the current level and saves your progress. At any time
      you can pull up the game options menu and customize the difficulty level.<br><br><br><img
