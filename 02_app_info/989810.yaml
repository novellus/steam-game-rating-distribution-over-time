    review: "Ok first the good. You are going to get several high quality models,\
      \ they are mostly well textured also, the textures even look a little bit worn\
      \ (I like that personally). It looks like a little thought went into them also\
      \ as they cover a lot of basics (at least for a kitchen mostly). A couple are\
      \ even really cool (like the pull out bed couch, WOW! or even the dirty dishes,\
      \ very useful). \n\nNow for the bad. About half this collection (at lest 30+\
      \ models) are again made up of things we just don't need (and definitely not\
      \ something you need 12 of) these are the trash bags and boxes (3 or 4 of each\
      \ would have been more then enough for this collection but no they give you\
      \ 12+ each????). (BTW there is a minor error on at least one of the trash bags\
      \ maybe 2 where you can only see the top texture on one side of it). This makes\
      \ me think they just made a lot of these models because they are easy to make\
      \ which does not mean a quality pack.    \n\nWhats odd is that you don't get\
      \ a kitchen table you don't get any chairs there's no TV or stereo system no\
      \ rugs no bathtubs or toilets (again prolly not really needed, but still, have\
      \ these people actually lived in an apartment???). IDK what The Game Creators\
      \ are doing with these new sets of models, so far they are really missing the\
      \ mark (imo). The older sets usually included things you needed  and a few of\
      \ them were must haves (like the sci-fi one) the new ones just seem kinda thrown\
      \ togather for no real purpose?? Again I just have to shake my head. Overall\
      \ at this point it is not worth the money (I bought it on sale even). Honestly\
      \ you can find larger user made collections/packs on their store that are almost\
      \ as good as what you will find here and they are almost always more useful."
