    review: "This DLC is an improvement over the first DLC of season 2 (\"Resurrection\"\
      ). The story comes together in this much better. The \"Ghost Fleet\" mechanic\
      \ is a welcome change of pace in you typical fleet planning strategy. The new\
      \ ships did not really have an impact for me, but they offer cool new features.\
      \ \n\nThis DLC is worth picking up, especially on sale."
