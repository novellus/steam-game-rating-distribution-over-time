Personally, I really enjoy this series; there's drama, comedy, suspense, action, romance, more comedy - all rolled into a generic fantasy setting. The series bucks some of the fantasy trends, whilst sticking to others doggedly. Given this, some of the scenes that would otherwise be predictably trite turn out to be very entertaining when they completely counter your expectations. JourneyQuest keeps you guessing, and in so doing, it holds your attention quite effectively.\n\nThis is a very easy series to like. It doesn't pretend to be anything it \"isn't\". That said, I suppose it really doesn't need to. It is quite unique and strangely endearing in its writing and execution. I would say it's quite incomparable to anything else out there. Absolutely worth a watch. Nice one Zombie Orpheus. You done good.","timestamp_created":1555382252,"timestamp_updated":1555382252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnraAkuoCcZupvwE="}
