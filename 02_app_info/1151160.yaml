    review: 'TL;DR: At the moment it is far from being a game that doesn''t frustrate
      you more than it brings joy.


      Let''s face it: It''s a tech demo. Not really a game, and far from being playable.
      Although the setting is promising, there''s a long way to go.


      Features:

      - item rarity system

      - levelup system (by working the field)

      - Job assignments to crew, with what to harvest and not (e. g. only mine stone
      and iron, not copper and gold)

      - manual trade system

      - Building works (but feels like dragging the plans through pudding and the
      next moment through vacuum and reverse, so quite a fiddly issue)

      - Fights work, but are in no way difficult

      - Crewmates may die of starvation or dehydration

      - interactions with different buildings/members/parts work, but the process
      is unnecessarily complicated (scroll through menu, press E for a second to select
      action)

      - No way to increase your crew as of now


      Bugs encountered in about 5 hours of gameplay:

      - Random inventories/storages get emptied or lose items when saving and loading,
      which may break your game

      - your mates don''t occupy buildings until you restart the game

      - your gatherers do gather like hell, but don''t push their stuff to inventories
      (which starves your crew to death)

      - your builders can stuck, trying to get items from storage but never getting
      them

      - some buildings you can''t build yourself as their inventory is too small to
      fit all necessary items

      - a lot of items have no purpose (yet), but occupy valuable storage space

      - storages can be overbooked, either by picking stuff up (your own) or by getting
      something pushed to by your crew

      - No way of telling the AI which storage to use for what

      - Wells can''t store more than 2 helpings of water; you need at least 3 to have
      you and your crew hydrated

      - Wells only fill during rain

      - Drinking from wells only fills 10% of your hydration level per helping

      - The windmill orientation is all wrong, with it lying flat on the ground, blades
      rotating like a ceiling fan

      - Can''t tell your crew how much to produce of any item, you feel a bit like
      the sourcerers apprentice


      All in all: In the current state (v0.07) it''s not worth any money.'
