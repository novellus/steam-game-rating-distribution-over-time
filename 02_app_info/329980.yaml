    review: '[h1]TL;DR: Problems with interface and puzzles keep this from being recommended[/h1]

      Maybe spend a buck or two on it if you really like the genre (but there are
      other short game that you can get for the same cost that are less annoying).

      I got this cause I saw Catyph released, and was curious about this earlier game
      (ASA) before I tried Catyph. Pros and Cons:

      + Science Fiction point-and-click with a somewhat interesting story

      + Some of the puzzles in the later parts of the game are nice (but getting there
      is a problem, see below)

      +/- Myst/Rhem-like movement, where you click on an arrow at the edge of the
      screen to turn or move. Suffers from the "Railroading" problems of similar games
      (i.e. "Why can''t I move *there*?") and the panning is non-intuitive.

      +/- One music puzzle about halfway in (I had already turned off the sound by
      then because of the dismal voice acting)

      - Game window showed up as tiny area at top of screen regardless of my resolution,
      I had to use the Windows magnifier to play the game.

      - Voice acting sounded bored [EDIT: I''ve assumed the voice-over is the protagonist''s
      voice, but could it be the AI in your space suit? It''s not clear at all. If
      so, then I might excuse this as an artistic choice, but it should be made clear]

      - Inventory tab that mysteriously disappears (click the right mouse button to
      recover, had to search online for this)

      - Trouble implementing puzzle solutions with the interface

      (mild spoilers ahead)






      [spoiler]There''s a puzzle with wires that you have to arrange correctly. I
      figured out the solution, but I couldn''t figure out how to move the wires so
      they were in the right location. Frustrated, I re-checked my solution, and tried
      again several times. Finally got past the puzzle probably due to random chance.
      Checked an on-line walkthrough and I had the right solution in the first place.


      There''s a puzzle with decimal coordinates on a grid. The grid is divided by
      several major lines, and 4 minor divisions between each of them. One would think
      that the divisions would go, for example, 0.0 then 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0.
      But they actually go from 0.0 to 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and then 1.0.  There''s
      nothing in the puzzle that implies this, the number system isn''t base-5 or
      anything unusual. Again, the puzzle was easy, but inputting the correct solution
      was annoying.


      Some of the other puzzles are sufficiently obtuse that even with the walkthrough,
      I had no idea what the objective was (i.e. the 2 rows of 6 buttons). Too bad,
      since there are a few good puzzles towards the end.[/spoiler]'
