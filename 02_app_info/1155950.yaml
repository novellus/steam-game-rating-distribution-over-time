    about_the_game: You are an adventurer who has spent many years tracking down clues
      to the whereabouts of a fabulous treasure lost to civilization for many, many
      years. Your travels have taken you to a Tavern by a Castle where, rumour has
      it, the entrance to the lost tomb can be found.<br><br>Your choice is whether
      to embark on this adventure alone or gather your Steam friends and explore together
      through the challenges posed by this game. Play with up to four friends in this
      team game or pit your wits and skills alone. The choice is yours, select your
      character, choose your team and begin.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1155950/extras/AboutPageImage1-1.jpg?t=1602835737"
      /><br><strong><i>Treasure Tomb VR</i></strong> takes you through multiple levels
      in your quest to finding and escaping with the treasure. From the start you
      interact with objects in your environment looking for clues or items that can
      help you navigate obstacles and unlock magical artifacts on your way through
      to your goal. From the start, make your way to the tavern and pick up the tankard
      on the bar, from here the adventure unfolds. As each level is completed a new
      key appears on the bar saving your progress. When you need to take a break,
      you can start the next level using the object as a shortcut. <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1155950/extras/AboutPageImage2.jpg?t=1602835737"
      /><br>The challenge begins with unlocking the Library, finding and decoding
      clues to open the entrance to the catacombs. From there your journey goes deeper
      into the heart of the Castle and the Mountain on which it stand until, when
      you finally break into the Tomb, you can win the treasure and plan your escape
      back to the outside world.<br><br>Treasure Tomb VR takes the concept of an escape
      room and builds it into a world adventure. The paces you will visit in the game
      are expansive, atmospheric and deeply engaging. As with any escape, you can
      play alone but the game really comes to life when you take on the challenge
      with friends to play cooperatively.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1155950/extras/TTVRSmallGIF.gif?t=1602835737"

    review: Games options/settings Does not work. If you do it in VR just puts a really
      zoomed in 2d image in your face. Went in game with a friend and we didn't know
      the basics for how to interact, how to not bob up and down through the floor
      etc. looks like it could be good with updates but isn't now.  I'm returning
      it.
