    review: "A chaotic stealth game where guards are random and unpredictable. In\
      \ theory this means the player must think and react quickly, but getting caught\
      \ immediately results in a loss, which forces the player to restart and hope\
      \ the guard positions are more favorable next time.  While most levels are relatively\
      \ short and provide checkpoints, the repeated restarts can be time-consuming.\
      \  Overall not terrible, but not good enough to recommend.\nPros:\n+ Levels\
      \ have some replay value because there are multiple characters with distinct\
      \ stealth mechanics.\nCons:\n- The randomized guard behavior makes success seem\
      \ luck-dependent, and leaves little room for strategy or planning in advance.\
      \ Being forced to repeatedly restart a level can quickly become frustrating.\
      \ \n- Character movement is imprecise because multiple different controls (walk,\
      \ run, open, move camera, etc) are mapped to the same context-based click input.\n\
      - The fixed isometric camera can make movement unreliable when trying to navigate\
      \ behind objects or walls, and the inability to zoom out often means getting\
      \ caught by off-screen guards."
