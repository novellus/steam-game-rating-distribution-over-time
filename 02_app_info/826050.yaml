    about_the_game: <strong>Chime Sharp</strong> is a music puzzle game. Place pieces
      to beat the levels and simultaneously create your own unique music in the spirit
      of the composer's original score.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/826050/extras/stage2standard-min.png?t=1584641903"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Game Composer Edition</h2>The same gameplay as 2017's Chime
      Sharp game but with 5 tracks from some of the most talented composers working
      in video games today. They're our unsung heroes - although they sing a lot themselves
      - and we wanted to make a version of Chime Sharp just for them. We're hugely
      grateful to Gareth Coker, Penka Kouneva, Wilbert Roget, Kenneth Young and Inon
      Zur for their support in making this game.<br><br>The original Chime was an
      Xbox Live Arcade game that went on to be a much loved favourite of the era.
      The game play and graphics were updated in 2017 with Chime Sharp. It's still
      an incredibly simple game to play, but one that you will lose hours to.
