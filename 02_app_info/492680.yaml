      \ to Craft the World that features new characters, special items, weapons, and\
      \ decor, as well as creatures with new abilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrimary\
      \ features:<br />\r\n\u25CF New characters: Female dwarves. The hard-working\
      \ dwarves will be joined by their charming sisters in arms. Female dwarves have\
      \ a little less health than their male counterparts, but their movement speed\
      \ is significantly higher. They will defend the shelter and explore the dungeons\
      \ along with the male dwarves.<br />\r\n\u25CFPets: We\u2019ve made two kinds\
      \ of pets for you that can be called upon to hunt pests, guard the dwarves\u2019\
      \ home, and protect their masters. Having a pet also significantly increases\
      \ your comfort level.<br />\r\n\u25CFMobile equipment: The dwarves have become\
      \ more self-sufficient and now use temporary ladders without waiting for the\
      \ player\u2019s help if they can\u2019t reach a certain spot. They also have\
      \ access to parachutes that allow them to jump from high places without getting\
      \ hurt.<br />\r\n\u25CF Defensive weapons: Dwarves armed with shields receive\
      \ additional armor and can sometimes block attacks completely, but their speed\
      \ is also slightly reduced. Several kinds of shields of various weights and\
      \ armor levels are available in the DLC.<br />\r\n\u25CF When you zoom out on\
      \ the map, resource-gathering locations will be marked with their corresponding\
      \ icons. This will make it much easier to find the resource you need on the\
      \ map.<br />\r\n\u25CF New dwarven defensive equipment: The mechanized catapult\
      \ is effective against large groups of monsters and deals damage to an area\
      \ from long range.<br />\r\n\u25CF In this update you will gain access to various\
      \ panels for finishing walls. Keep in mind that you can choose their appearance\
      \ with a click just like stucco.<br />\r\n\u25CF Wine casks that have been placed\
      \ will occasionally generate bottles of wine that have several useful features."
