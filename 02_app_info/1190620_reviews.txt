The gameplay for me consisted of scrolling around the screen constantly, as the view is very zoomed in and map size is considerably larger. Cannot zoom in or out or mouse scroll at screen edges. You cannot even use the minimap to quick navigate around, and will have to revert to WASD.\n\nTower positions are fixed, and evenly spaced out across the map somewhat sparingly.  Path enemy takes is not very clear. Towers feel weak, poor tracking and have no upgrade options. Having to buy each tower location first feels redundant and could just be added into the first tower buy instead.\n\nThere is no information on strengths or weaknesses for generic enemies or any of the towers. Not even information on what each tower does, or its range (unless I am missing something?). Doesn't provide much in the way of strategy or encourage a replay to try other tactics.\n\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857016/]If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow [u]True Blue Reviews[/u] for more recommendations![/url]","timestamp_created":1575000214,"timestamp_updated":1594976462,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.624186158180236816","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy6yArvMCfM2c3wE="}
