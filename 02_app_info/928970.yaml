      \ is a turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy-western setting filled with\
      \ improbable technology and the supernatural.  Can you survive with just your\
      \ wit and a six-gun at your side?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLost Frontier features\
      \ a 24 mission campaign, which follows the exploits of a band of mercenaries\
      \ as they hunt a notorious desperado.  Throughout the story, your tactics will\
      \ be tested as the game challenges you to master the use of 20 unique unit types.\
      \  You\u2019ll take command of a wide range of Wild West forces, from Gunslingers\
      \ and Cavalry to civil-war era Cannons and Gatling Guns. Or, employ more exotic\
      \ weapons like steam-powered Gyrocopters and Zeppelins, and enlist the help\
      \ of dark forces like Werewolves and Necromancers.  Careful and strategic use\
      \ of your resources will be needed to best your merciless opponents.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nTo help even the odds, you'll take control of a \u201CLiving Legend\u201D\
      , who acts as your commander on the battlefield and helps to specialize your\
      \ combat style.  Prefer long-range engagements?  Enlist the help of Wyatt \u201C\
      Long-Arm\u201D Wilcox, a master sharpshooter who\u2019s long-range units are\
      \ peerless.  Each of 9 unique Legends are available, and acquire perks as you\
      \ complete missions, steadily unlocking their full potential.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nOnce you\u2019ve mastered the game, 20 challenge missions await.  These are\
      \ punishingly difficult battles meant to push you and your Legend\u2019s abilities\
      \ to the limit.  Or, feel free to set up custom games against the AI or with\
      \ your friends via hot seat multiplayer.  Set up the rules, choose your legends,\
      \ and let the bullets fly!"

    review: 'It''s Advance Wars but cowboy themed, what can I say?

      The only real issues with this game are;

      - AI seems very mechanical, you can often learn their actions, and their actions
      can be stupid.

      - This game _needs_ a vsync option or a framerate cap. I get some serious high
      performance screen tears on my not-that-new GPU.'
