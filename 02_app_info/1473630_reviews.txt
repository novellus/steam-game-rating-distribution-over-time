The goal of the game is to reach the end of each stage (and avoid capture or pitfalls!) However, to unlock each lewd scene you're encouraged to lose to select enemies. Thankfully, it's easy to backtrack to the correct areas using the \"select stage\" screen. Most of the \"puzzles\" involve moving boxes or evading oncoming projectiles. Some stages include [i]action-platforming[/i] and others stealth. You'll likely die (a lot), but there is virtually no penalty to death. . . unless you die following a cutscene. There's no \"skip\" button! \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nEllie is on her way to the Prime Minister. However, she is no visitor; she rides beside her sister, Fortuna, [i]in chains.[/i] The Prime Minister has a special appreciation for virgins. Watching them writhe in pain is how he [i]gets his rocks off.[/i] Fortuna doesn't want her sister to be a sex slave -- so she helps her escape, and sends her into the Ilrit forest. Ellie must find the Imperial Garrison to break her chains. However, women, [i]especially virgins,[/i] are a hot commodity, no matter where they go! She'll have to to dodge animals in heat and sneak past rapey bandits. Not even the [i]dead[/i] will pass her up!\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe titlescreen is a total mess. The overall English leaves something to be desired. From \"option\", you may adjust audio, display and language preferences. The player character can be altered via \"customize character\". From the character customization screen, you may choose between breast sizes, color presets and outfits. This is one of those games that worked my GPU to the bone -- be sure to employ a frame limiter if you decide to purchase this game.\n\n[b]- The Goods -[/b]\nThere are ten animated, somewhat interactive sex-scenes to unlock. In each scene, the main protagonist is raped by one or more people or monsters. Each scene includes multiple animations featuring new positions or climaxes. Bodily fluids are animated ([b]poorly[/b]). The models are [i]acceptable[/i]; however, they seldom mesh together. This is a symptom of using a variety of (typically premade) assets made by differing artists. I enjoyed the animations, if it's [b]plain as day[/b] the protagonist experiences emotional and physical trauma as animated tears roll off her face.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nWait for a strong sale and a visual updates. The gameplay is casual and the controls are snappy; but it's repetitive and the \"puzzles\" are shallow. Mosaics and visual errors ruin otherwise [i]decent[/i] adult animations. As much as I enjoy money shots, the distorted cream-pies are unacceptable. [b]Elrit Clover[/b] is a rough platformer that could have better -- [i]much better.[/i] Though [b]Elrit Clover[/b] isn't a bad game, for seventeen USD it's blatant rip off. It plays like a flash game with with memeware graphics. If you're okay with pixelated genitalia, I'd consider this game during an eighty or [i]ninety-percent-off[/i] sale.\n\n[table][tr][td][url=https://wombattrap.com/review/elrit-clover-a-forest-in-the-rut-is-full-of-dangers/]To read the full length review, click here![/url][/td][/tr][/table]\n\n[h1]Support the Wombat[/h1]\n[b]<3[/b] Follow the [b]Wombat Trap Curator[/b] page for more reviews!
