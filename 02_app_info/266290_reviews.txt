I plyed the cd version years ago and it was good. Now I have bought it on sales for a few cents and it is still good. I can even play with Xobx controller and the settings are automatic. Of course the graphics is not great, but this is old and cheap game. And of course the simulation is not something extra, but again it is cheap and old. But it is still a funny arcade for those who are not experts of helicopters.","timestamp_created":1610128758,"timestamp_updated":1610128983,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vdDK8fYCeJzMwQI="}
