    reviews: "\u201C[...] LineDash is profoundly addictive. Its lines and blocks collide\
      \ with a pleasing thud. The whole screen shakes. What starts as a black-and-white\
      \ color scheme gradually expands to neon shades on alternating black-or-white\
      \ backgrounds. The game rewards reflexes with linear tableaus.\u201D<br><a href=\"\

      \ not about saving your lives, but about keeping the blocks from ruining the\
      \ picture you've created on your desktop. Dang squares, always trying to run\
      \ my art!\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://indiegames.com/2016/01/create_striking_visuals_and_ge.html\"\

      \ is basically all there, but it is an entirely appropriate there to the purchase\
      \ price and definitely a game that can offer involvement, fun, a sensible nontrivial\
      \ challenge, and that bit of addiction that can make the fortune of such games.\u201D\
