    review: 'Story of the Survivor the Escape DLC is an okay DLC, but its story time.


      You play as Steve a convict; he and his two friends have Survived the zombie
      apocalypse being in the vary prison that held them before the apocalypse. But
      soon food will run out, so Steve and his two friends must find a way to escape.


      Now what I liked, story was good. I feel the rpg elements were used a bit better
      here than the main game. And there was not nighttime part that made the game
      hard to see.


      Now for the bed, really there is just two. Like the character management still
      annoying, and there are some bugs were you can go into the well and get stuck
      or you can get stuck by a zombie corpse that is in front of the door.


      So with that said not a bad game a bit better then main one, so I say get this
      DLC if you want to buy the main game as well.'
