      new home.  Equipped with advanced technology but limited resources, they must
      build to survive.<br><br>Sigma Draconis is a colony simulation game which focuses
      on building and resource management.  It is designed to be quite challenging
      but also fun and relaxing to play.<h2 class="bb_tag">World</h2>The game features
      procedurally generated maps with vegetation that grows and spreads over time,
      free roaming wildlife, and resources for your geologists to reveal.<h2 class="bb_tag">Resources</h2>Primary
      resources in the game include organics, ore, stone, and coal.  Vegetation and
      exposed rocks can provide what you need to begin with, but later your geologists
      will need to find buried resources that you can mine.<h2 class="bb_tag">Food</h2>Nutrient
      mush can be easily manufactured but is detrimental to your colonists' happiness.  Some
      native plants have edible fruit which can be harvested by a botanist, but for
      a sustainable food supply you will need to grow your own crops.  There are currently
      five varieties to choose from.<h2 class="bb_tag">Power</h2>There are various
      ways to generate electricity in the game, and successful power management is
      vital.  The nights are long and very cold on this tidally locked world, and
      your colonists may die if fuel reserves are inadequate.<h2 class="bb_tag">Colonists</h2>Each
      colonist has one of three skills, all of which will be essential to the success
      of your colony.  Colonists also have individual perks which can effect them
      in different ways.  Various factors such as workload and diet can affect the
      happiness and productivity of your colonists, so these must be carefully managed.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Objective</h2>In the current version of the game, the final objective
      is to build and launch a rocket.

    developer_response: I'm saddened to hear that you did not have a good experience
      with my game.  I will admit that the current version of the game may not be
      as self explanatory as it could be, so in response to your review I'm now going
      to prioritise making a tutorial to help new players.  I hope that you will then
      feel able to give it another chance!

    review: the game looks very nice,.. I am eager to start playing it once alot more
      work has been accomplished on it, esp the water dispenser will not build.. the
      game has terrible tutorial to help you learn   the steps to take to make and
      fabricate the buildings you need.. also it would be nice if you can wake up
      more than one person to actually start accomplishing something b4 u are getting
      messages you are dehydrating and starving and then start dying lol, ill be checking
      ;back for updates, as once those issues are fixed I look forward to playing.
