The graphics, sound and design are great!\nItÂ´s an interesting arpg with a special combat mechanic as you command a party of 4 characters (out of 18 IIRC)\nCombat is well done as you can switch characters and combine their abilities/skills in real-time. I really enjoyed the pace of the whole thing - not as \"hack and slash\" than PoE or Grim Dawn - more strategic, where you need more than 1 devastating attacks to clean the screen. \nBeing a fan of the Souls series, i really appreciate that ( i also love and play a lot of PoE and Grim Dawn for sure) when you have to fight your way through.\nBut enemies do not respawn, so no grinding needed !\n\nAlso have to say the normal mode was a bit too easy as i died maybe 3 times in my entire playthrough (with 2 of them being against the final boss). Gonna try Hard next.\n\nAll in all it's a beautiful and well-designed game that i recommend if you like story driven and slower arpg's\n\n","timestamp_created":1609970209,"timestamp_updated":1609970209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jvrs7PYCecKPwQI="}
