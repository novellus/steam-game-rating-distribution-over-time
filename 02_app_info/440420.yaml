    review: It's ridiculous how much I enjoy this series.  In order to be relatively
      biased (cause I'm like that), this lil gem suffers from the same fate as all
      great point n click/moon logic strat puzzle games we all enjoy; once you've
      played through it once, you will remember all the fun and frustration you had
      before.  That out of the way, I loved the programmer's music, puzzle solving,
      and story-telling.  I was engaged in the totality of the adventure.  Granted,
      the infamous bonus chapter-door puzzle code was infuriating, but for anyone
      looking to lose a day or a solid afternoon with a great lil adventure, I highly
      recommend it.  You may want to wait until it's on sale, but that only adds to
      your appreciation of this solid lil thing.  Well done, Goblinz!!
