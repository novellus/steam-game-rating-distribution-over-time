    about_the_game: "As a lightning-fast acrobatic ninja rabbit, you can choose how\
      \ to approach each encounter. Do you want to pick off enemies one at a time\
      \ like the killer in a slasher film? Dive into the thick of it and fight whole\
      \ groups in a frontal assault? Steal the most powerful weapon you can find,\
      \ and turn it on the rest?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you die, there is never any\
      \ load time; you can try again instantly! As your skills improve, you'll see\
      \ that the game is not about winning. It's about experimenting to make the coolest\
      \ action scenes that you can. Every design decision is made with that in mind,\
      \ from the mouselook camera to the context-sensitive combat controls.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nAfter completing the story modes, you can try out all the mods that\
      \ players have created with the integrated editor! If you want to play as a\
      \ human character in a city, or try a whole new campaign, or even fly around\
      \ as a bat, there's probably already a mod that makes that happen."

    review: This game is really fun don't get me wrong but there are many problems
      with it that make me not recommend it. It is a game with potential but most
      of the potential isn't used. It has very unique combat which is fairly challenging
      but fun. It lacks though in movement where it is slightly floaty and lacks difficulty
      in the parkour aspect. The weapon combat is fun but not really balanced where
      some weapons will just knock yours out of your hand. The judo throw is also
      quite over powered since there is almost no defense but timing right click in
      time to counter it. The last problem is the quality of the game; it feels like
      an early alpha game. The story modes aren't really well made since the dialogue
      is lazily made which makes it less immersive. There are a lot of awkward transitions
      and stock assets which reduce the quality of the game. Lastly the UI isn't very
      well made either and is too simple. The price shouldn't be where it is now considering
      how incomplete the game feels and there aren't many game changing or improvement
      updates.
