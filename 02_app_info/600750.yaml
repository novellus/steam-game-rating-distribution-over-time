    review: "micro transaction garbage ported from the phone... dev team is non responsive\
      \ to in game issues, support tickets go unanswered... if you have disabilities\
      \ that require accommodations dont expect them, the dev team could careless.\n\
      \nmajority of the ships are literally the same just different paint jobs plastered\
      \ on them or a different angle of the ship is portrayed or even worse they just\
      \ flip the image of the ship and then given a new name and an even heavier price...\
      \ bad bad design.\n\nif you want to play on different platforms get ready to\
      \ play the intro a few times and note its not short... the dev team didn't care\
      \ to work in any way to log into your account prior to playing the intro....\
      \ bad bad design...\n\nloot boxes are extremely over priced... no shocker...\
      \ and there is no way to see the odds of the rewards granted... bad bad design...\
      \ \n\nlets be flat out this game is a great way for the developers to target\
      \ kids and people with impulse control issues and take advantage of them by\
      \ way of this gambling loot box system garbage..."
