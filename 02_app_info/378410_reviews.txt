So.  I have a bit of a chip on my shoulder when it comes to what seems like arbitrary character deaths in games.  So maybe I'm being too hard on this.  But there seems to be at least one arbitrary death zone on each level.  \nWhat I CAN legit complain about is the controls.  They are not good.  I believe the word commonly used for this issue is \"floaty.\"  I've played through a level and a half of this and, quite frankly, I have not encountered anything compelling enough to put up with the controls any further.   The game play is iffy.  The challenge is sparse until it becomes instantly fatal with little of no warning.  I have not gotten far enough in to know if the story is worth it but I get the feeling it's not.  The artwork is not bad per say but I can't say it's particularly good either.  It's a style I'm not normally fond of so take that criticism with a grain or three of sodium.  \nOverall, I can't recommend this.  I PERSONALLY dislike it enough to be asking for a refund.  But, objectively I can see where some would enjoy it.  Just not me.","timestamp_created":1593391117,"timestamp_updated":1593391117,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rN7g/vICeYOYkQI="}
