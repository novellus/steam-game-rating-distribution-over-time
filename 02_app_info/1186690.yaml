      [b]timpu''s treasure[/b] is a follow-up to the excellent [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/1219020]kili''s
      treasure[/url], though all they share are the presentation and gameplay, the
      story and characters are not connected.


      so this is also a [b]voxel-based isometric point & click adventure[/b], but
      instead of being confined to the rooms of a single house, you can explore an
      entire town and inspect and interact not only with all kinds of items, but local
      residents as well. help them find things they''re looking for to gain entry
      to other parts of their houses, learn more about their families and secrets,
      and ultimately finish the treasure hunt the mayor tasks you with at the beginning.


      advancing the main story involves just one item at a time and opens up new locations,
      while residents will ask you to find items in pairs. [b]there''s no inventory[/b],
      interacting with an item simply puts it in the lower left corner where the (let''s
      call it) ''interaction log'' is. all you need to do to fulfill an npc''s request
      is interact with the appropriate items one after the other, but unlike [b]kili''s
      treasure[/b], the order doesn''t matter. it cuts down on going back and forth,
      but [b]the map still offers fast travel[/b], so it would''ve been a non-issue
      anyway.


      walking around can be done with the mouse, the arrow keys or wasd, shift highlights
      interactable items even while moving around, and there''s a help screen with
      all the controls. the presentation is great as ever (I love voxels), the music
      is very pleasant, there''s windowed mode and resolution options, and you can
      save whenever you need or have to quit.


      there''s a lot to see and do, and while I didn''t find the story as heartwarming
      this time, it still had its touching moments and was really amusing. if you''re
      into charming, not too difficult adventures with likeable characters, pick this
      up (along with [b]kili''s treasure[/b] if you haven''t) even at full price for
      an afternoon or two''s worth of family-friendly fun. and don''t call me shirley!'
