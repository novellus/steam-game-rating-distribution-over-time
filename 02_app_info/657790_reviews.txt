That's important to some fans of the genre.  \nThere are a handful of tactical options, three that renew over time, and three that you have to buy. I find these lackluster, in that they all seem to be basically the same thing, a little damage. (One slows the foe, but not very much it seems)\nThe maps are interesting, and your foes, the tribes of early Briton, can come at you from odd ways, along the rivers, out of the forests and anacronistic as it seems, balloons. I wish there were a mechanism to allow me to target my chosen foe at times, but I don't see one. This adds a fun, and often challenging dimension to things.\nThe levels do tend to build, and get more challenging towards the end, something I enjoy but which I have found lacking in some games. The build up teaches you quickly not to ignore upgrading the towers to the rear regularly as things progress. \nThe core of the creativity is spent on the idea of gears that you can use to upgrade the various tower types. There are five shapes in total, damage, range and rate of fire followed by an increased chance for a critical hit, and increased critical damage. I find this adds to the strategic aspect of the game in an interesting way.\nThe entire time you are given simplistic quests which help in garnering the gems needed to do most of the upgrades and builds outside of the actual levels.\nAll in all I give this game one thumbs up, I feel it is simple, but solid, and so far everything works.","timestamp_created":1568214529,"timestamp_updated":1573080045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43JK4oe4CeNKG0gE="}
