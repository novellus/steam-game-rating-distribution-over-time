    short_description: Rob Hubbard is generally regarded as one of the greatest Commodore
      64 musicians of all time, though he would be the last to say that! In this film
      Rob talks about what first interested him into getting a Commodore 64 and from
      there working out how to use the SID Chip to make music.
