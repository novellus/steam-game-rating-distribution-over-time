    review: "When they say this is a short game, they mean it. I completed the full\
      \ game in less than 20 minutes. However the love and effort that has went into\
      \ crafting this has not gone unnoticed. Everything from the nostalgic 90s point\
      \ and click style graphics to the soundtrack really paints a scene not to dissimilar\
      \ to Blade runner and other neo-noir classics. \n\nI also loved the voice acting.\
      \ For a small production team they have really made the story feel alive, not\
      \ once was I drawn out of it due to cheesy line deliveries. The story it's self\
      \ also had my attention the whole time, the only thing I wish is that there\
      \ was more of it. The game feels like a prologue to something bigger."
