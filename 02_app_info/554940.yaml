    review: 'My first regretable buy from the summer sale: even at 75% off, this game
      wasn''t worth the $6.00, and it''s hard to see it getting much better given
      the mechanics in play. The music suits the game well, and the narrator''s dialogue
      has a ''portal''esque sarcastic feel that was entertaining (if a little out
      of place given the world-ending alien invasion), and the controls are quick
      to pick up. However, the feel of the droid you control, the weapons you use,
      and the enemies you fight have no real substance. There is no feedback to being
      hit, no excitement to killing enemies, and you''ll find yourself standing next
      to the objective unloading your clip x3 without much of a feeling of accomplishment.
      The game feels largely uninspired, and plays mostly like an extremely short
      ''90s FPS. For <$2.00, I''d go for it for an experiential 30 minutes, but as
      is I can''t recommend.'
