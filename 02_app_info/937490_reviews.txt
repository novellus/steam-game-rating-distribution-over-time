The text is nicely written, building tension when it's due and the characters interactions have a good flow to them. Its well paced, never boring or wasting any time to move forward.\n\nThe presentation follow the purest tradition of sound novel : emphasis on the text by having it occupies the entire screen (NVL style), emphasis on the sound atmosphere and sound effects, minimalist illustrations (with occasional beautiful b/w CG). It could have been done better in the sound effects department but all in all, the presentation serves its goal right : carrying its story by accompanying it with an eerie atmosphere.","timestamp_created":1605087384,"timestamp_updated":1605087384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518716573715209961","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnLqq2/UCdLvbrQI="}
