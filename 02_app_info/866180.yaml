    review: "Game simply does not work.\n\nI get to what looks like a game options\
      \ screen (normal game) - and then it becomes unresponsive. No matter what I\
      \ do, the game does nothing. I had to kill it with Task Manager. \n\nI wrote\
      \ in the game discussions on 31 October 2019 about this problem - today is 20\
      \ December 2019. More than a month. Zero response from devs or anyone who can\
      \ actually help.\n\nNot only do I not recommend this game to anyone, I specifically\
      \ recommend NOT buying it."
