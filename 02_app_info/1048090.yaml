    review: I went into this expecting a crappy game. To my surprise, it was thoroughly
      enjoyable. Not like, 'great', but more than what you could expect from a game
      with this price. The story is entertaining, though a bit weak. The many different
      paths that one can take is one of the strengths of this visual novel.
