It was such a simple and heartwarming game. ... The realism in this game is awesome as I myself work in forests and my work is indeed affected by the current movement restrictions so this game makes me feel like I’m in the forest again doing what I like doing best. Thank you very much for creating this game. I wish more game developers will make similar quality games about nature like yours as well.”<br \/>\r\n1StopBorneo Wildlife<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n“You can tell a lot of love was put into this – there’s just some really cute details that didn’t have to be in there, but make it all more charming.”<br \/>\r\nSoTypicallyTori<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n“I didn’t expect to enjoy it so much to 100% it and then go back for the bonus dialogue but it was quite fun and relaxing to play!”<br \/>\r\ndraconnan<br \/>\r\n","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1441680\/header.jpg?t=1604337297","website":"https:\/\/www.thesheepsmeow.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br><\/li><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Dual Core (2.0 GHZ)<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 512 MB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Dedicated graphics card and Webgl enabled<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 500 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>"},"developers":["The Sheep's Meow"],"publishers":["The Sheep's Meow"],"package_groups":[],"platforms":{"windows":true,"mac":false,"linux":false},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":22,"description":"Steam Achievements"},{"id":25,"description":"Steam Leaderboards"}],"genres":[{"id":"25","description":"Adventure"},{"id":"37","description":"Free to Play"}],"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1441680\/ss_9800e161bd887819d40389c5517f9872b64e0ed3.600x338.jpg?t=1604337297","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1441680\/ss_9800e161bd887819d40389c5517f9872b64e0ed3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1604337297"},{"id":1,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1441680\/ss_c471963ff410bc58fd0c883557f9cc99857b6013.600x338.jpg?t=1604337297","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1441680\/ss_c471963ff410bc58fd0c883557f9cc99857b6013.1920x1080.jpg?t=1604337297"},{"id":2,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1441680\/ss_71c57f356e9dd73aa31b48df7b21dd1766fdcaf0.600x338.jpg?t=1604337297","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1441680\/ss_71c57f356e9dd73aa31b48df7b21dd1766fdcaf0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1604337297"},{"id":3,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1441680\/ss_010c1f35ee77c51e27cd9604ed12ad124c484e41.600x338.jpg?t=1604337297","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1441680\/ss_010c1f35ee77c51e27cd9604ed12ad124c484e41.1920x1080.jpg?t=1604337297"},{"id":4,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1441680\/ss_72f5568d8366027782a145f814c0abb40de76480.600x338.jpg?t=1604337297","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1441680\/ss_72f5568d8366027782a145f814c0abb40de76480.1920x1080.jpg?t=1604337297"}],"movies":[{"id":256805282,"name":"Tree Trunk Brook -
