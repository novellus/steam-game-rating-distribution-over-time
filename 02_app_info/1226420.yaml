    review: "[h1]Experienced on Windows Mixed Reality[/h1]\n\nYou can see almost the\
      \ whole gameplay here: https://youtu.be/x_Nk4I2icis\n\nI paid .99 cents and\
      \ I wasn't expecting much, but this game still didn't deliver. I'm still not\
      \ sure what exactly I played. I should have read the store description better\
      \ which talks about a narrow bridge. \n\nThat's really the whole game. You cross\
      \ a roof-top bridge. Otherwise a fish eats you. So far either the fish has eaten\
      \ me or I got stuck on the bridge without being able to move. I don't understand\
      \ the locomotion or this game.\n\nYou start out like in a visual novel almost.\
      \ You can't do much. You can view the 3D environment around you. There are some\
      \ minor animations, but it's mostly just viewing a static scene. Then you can\
      \ finally move around at the rooftop. I fell off at least 3 times. Then I got\
      \ suck on my last attempt, without being able to move at all. Is this meant\
      \ to be a room-scale experience? Does your flashlight move you forward? Are\
      \ you able to use full locomotion to clear the bridge? I did manage to fall\
      \ 3 times using full locomotion, but not on my final attempt. \n\nWell, whole\
      \ thing takes like 3-4 minutes. Game just starts out of nowhere and ends the\
      \ same. You'll be having to restart the game for subsequent attempts at this\
      \ bridge crossing. I even had trouble starting the game straight from the Steam\
      \ library. I had to start from within Steam VR.\n\nDid I have fun? No. Was this\
      \ an interesting experience? No. Was it pretty to look at? No. At least it was\
      \ only .99 cents and I could see it was going for something unique at least.\
      \ Maybe the full game will be better. I won't refund although I probably should.\n\
      \n[b]Rate 4/10. This should be free to play. I would have given a 5/10 if it\
      \ were free. [/b]"
