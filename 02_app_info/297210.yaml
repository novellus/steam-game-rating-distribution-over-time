    about_the_game: Famaze is a retro themed puzzle adventure game. The game combines
      charming SNES era visuals and sound, randomized &quot;roguelike&quot;mazes,
      strategy and puzzles, rpg elements, and a fun lighthearted story. The game is
      simple to pick up but offers endless replay because of the procedural nature
      of its levels.<br><br><i>The story of the game involves a mad king who has captured
      the happy rutabagas of the land and has turned them into evil monsters to guard
      his kingdom while he searches for the elusive perfect recipe for rutabaga pudding.
      The heroes of the land (a knight, thief, or wizard) must delve deep into the
      king's domain to rescue the rutabagas, find the gem of truth to unravel the
      secret recipe and put a stop to the mad king's plot.</i><br><br>Original soundtrack
