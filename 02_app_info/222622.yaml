    about_the_game: "The latest route for Train Simulator captures the rugged beauty\
      \ of South Africa. This route will take you on a 3\u20196\u201D Cape gauge line\
      \ through twenty six stations or halts on the way. Experience a range of terrain,\
      \ from lush green plantations, winding rivers, traversing gorges, numerous tunnels,\
      \ mountain sides, deep valleys and open plains. Travel through the rolling green\
      \ hills of Pietermaritzburg at a height of 672 m and end approximately 191 km\
      \ further north at Ladysmith, 1037m above sea level.<br> <br>The route starts\
      \ at Masons Mill\u2019s huge railway yard and depot just outside Pietermaritzburg\
      \ in the KwaZulu Natal province of South Africa. From there it winds with double,\
      \ electrified track to the first major station on the route, Pietermaritzburg.\
      \ Travelling north from Pietermaritzburg, it forms two complete balloons (loops)\
      \ at Boughton station, in order to negotiate the narrow valley at the foot of\
      \ the first mountain range, then climbing to the first tunnels at Cedara, two\
      \ single bores each 6km long.<br> <br>After Cedara, the line continues to progress\
      \ through more tunnels, river crossings and a few major stations, surrounded\
      \ by plantations, factories and the occasional traditional village next to the\
      \ line.<br> <br>Between Merrivale and Tweedie is the huge wall of the Midmar\
      \ dam, a spectacle to tourists, which can be seen from the line.<br><br> The\
      \ product features Class 6E1 Series 4 3Kv DC electric locomotives, designed\
      \ and built for the South African Railways (SAR) by Union Carriage and Wagon\
      \ (UCW) in Nigel, Transvaal. One hundred locomotives were delivered in 1973\
      \ and 1974, numbered E1446 to E1545. The South African Class 6E1 was produced\
      \ in eleven series over a period of nearly sixteen years, with 960 units produced\
      \ altogether, all built by UCW.  This makes the 6E1 the most numerous single\
      \ locomotive class ever to have seen service in South Africa and serves as proof\
      \ of a highly successful design.<br> <br>The locomotive is presented in four\
      \ livery variations, Blue, Red, Red with yellow stripes and Orange.<br> <br>In\
      \ addition, a selection of wagons is included along with a passenger car.<h2\
