The whole premise of Risky Boots having to traverse the same levels that you just beat as Shantae is contrived in and of itself. The reason for buying this DLC is to allow you to play through the campaign again as Risky instead of Shantae, utilising a different set of abilities for offence and traversal to match her character, all while getting to experience all new voice acting, enemies, and animations. \n\nIf you are expecting a brand new set of levels and bosses, then this DLC probably isn't for you. On the other hand, if you enjoyed the main game and want an excuse to play through a somewhat remixed version of it, then you should definitely consider buying this DLC. Whether you think its worth the full $10 or want to wait for a sale is up to you. Alternatively, if you don't already have the base game, you should probably just buy the version that includes all the DLC to begin with.","timestamp_created":1609988176,"timestamp_updated":1609988405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48K6y7fYCcpeWwQI="}
