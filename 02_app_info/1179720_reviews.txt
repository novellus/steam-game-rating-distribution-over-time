I know a couple of my reviews start like that, but I don't always go out of my way to make one, but this game is truly a game changer.\nIts like someone took all the fun and music from Minecraft and decided they could do better. Coming from the company who makes DayZ, its nice to see a get better and better. If you like casual survival and exploration games, then you have to try this game.","timestamp_created":1609861802,"timestamp_updated":1609861802,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgbXP6fYCeZbewAI="}
