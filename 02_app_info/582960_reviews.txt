LIT is an okay puzzler with well-established mechanics. Each room gradually ramps up the difficulty to the point when trial-and-error is the best way to solve everything. The 8-button control scheme keeps things simple, yet is better suited to a controller than a keyboard. Unfortunately, that's all the good I could glean. The background music is loud and the story is barebones.\n\nFor those of you unaware, LIT originally debuted as a WiiWare game. I, sadly, didn't get to play it before the Wii store was closed for good, but my old Nintendo mags and YouTube have been great aids. Instead of a 2D puzzler with a cutesy art style, it was in 3D with a more realistic approach to the visuals. And that's what it has over the iOS version: better visuals and a better horror atmosphere. Instead of grey tiles, there were writhing masses of shadow with things scuttling about in them that wouldn't hesitate to drag you in if you took one wrong step. The monsters were a lot more unique than the same generic sprite, showing what would happen if the shadows consume you like they did the staff and other students.\n\nIt also had more intriguing mechanics: a flashlight to illuminate parts of the room to see what's hidden in the shadows. An electricity meter to ensure you don't abuse the TVs and computers, along with motion-sensing cameras which punish heavy electricity use. There were boss battles. What's more, you would occasionally get phone calls from Rachael as she struggles to survive as a nice atmospheric bonus.\n\nIn short, we're stuck with the inferior version of the game. If anyone has a WiiU, then you may have a chance to (re)download the original. Better that then this version, I say.","timestamp_created":1578341735,"timestamp_updated":1591823665,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.660289168357849121","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49rCF0PICcaCu6gE="}
