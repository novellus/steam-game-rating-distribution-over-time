    review: "I'm going to be generous with this...\n\nIts nice to see 45 paint schemes\
      \ for the drivers (especially Jimme Johnson), but being honest, I was under\
      \ the guise that in those 45 paint schemes there would be a few for your own\
      \ custom driver, which there isn't.\n\nIf you're American, enjoy the 50 state\
      \ flags. Canadian or from somewhere else, Better touch up on your American geography!\
      \ \n\nIs this worth $10, not at all, get it on sale. Don't blow your hard earned\
      \ birthday money.\n\nAs I said before, I'm going to give it a thumbs up, as\
      \ the content is nice, but overpriced and slightly misleading."
