I just can't recommend a game where I had zero fun.  I only played 15 minutes, but I just didn't want to keep going.  It's a mirror reflection puzzle game.  You aim the light unto other reflective surfaces until you finally shine the light onto the glowing object.  It's mostly about patience.  You just have to aim it the right way.  There's  also some murder mystery story going on (which wasn't very interesting).\n\nI think the deal-breaker for me is that I just didn't see the point of this game for VR.  You either have a top-down view or a third person view of the light.  You use an Xbox controller to control the mirror you selected from the top-down view.  There was zero immersion in this game.  Honestly, I think the game would be better as a Non-VR game.  For VR, you should be using motion controllers to physically move the mirror with your hands.  Otherwise, there is no point to the VR in this game.  VR doesn't help in any way nor is there any immersion.  \n\nRating 3/10 just not fun, but it does play fine and functions as it is advertised.  This should be a .99 cents game as it is currently.","timestamp_created":1511248128,"timestamp_updated":1511248128,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596786975860595703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgI3a7t8CetnxiwE="}
