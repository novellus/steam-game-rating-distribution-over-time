The second iteration of Renegade Grounds seems to had doubled in quality ^^\nWhile the controls are quite intuitive if we are used to any JRPG, crafting stayed as great as the first.\nI really loved Rhask's voice and even the developer have his own inside.  (Also, see the random NPC's outside the arena, the cough seems a nice touch to details and genuine.)\n\nGraphically, the presentation of the chapters and the use of ePic Character Generator as well as Matseb's spriting and modding helps the immersion.  Music is great even if some loops seems too short or abrupts and the victory one seems missing.\n\nOn story mode, I loved having the confirmation of the side our characters are.  In arena, I really loved how it was more smooth to use winning resources as the correction made less frustrating to win something that we are unable to equip; now, we have total freedom between series of fights.\n\nI would love a third chapter if all evolves as well as in this one.","timestamp_created":1579604861,"timestamp_updated":1579604861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575020372867584229","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hKzy4+8Ccf6X7QE="}
