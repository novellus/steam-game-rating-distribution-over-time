    review: 'I played this long ago but writing this review now


      had a ton of fun with my co-op partner in this game going for 100% achievements.


      I hold the previous title "Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light" higher.

      Still, they did improve on some parts, like having more interesting character
      besides Lara.


      Really good co-op game, and this time up to 4 people!'
