    review: "I play canasta in this app.  the video is badly rendered - cards and\
      \ nameplates overlap your hand and played cards so you can't see. controls are\
      \ variable - the same action sometimes plays a card and sometimes discards a\
      \ playable card. The logic is flawed in measuring your actions - preventing\
      \ you from making legal plays because one of the multiple things you could do\
      \ would result in an illegal play (for example, if there are three playable\
      \ cards in the discard, you can't pick it up and play two, discard one - because\
      \ it sees you *could play all three, and if you did, *then you'd have to discard\
      \ the card in your hand but you aren't eligible to do that).  \n\nIt's adequate,\
      \ in the absence of a better option, but I can't really \"recommend\" it."
