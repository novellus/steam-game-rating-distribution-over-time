Despite Kython can't use his wings, he is really fast both in action or on a walk. His weapons are fast, and magic is strong even withour a proper build, he require much less time to hit someone. Also, he has arguably the best voice action: combined with story of harsh untolkative warrior, who want just to save Ancaria and then to vanish from its history, and mature model, it gives the feeling that he is the true saviour of that land. Seraphim, Khukuri, Safiri and Ancarian look more cartoonish, and act more like children. Moreover, the exact fighting style of Malakhim is one of the few things that really help \"Sacred 3\" to feel like something new and unique.\n\nBut I should mention, that Deep Silver definately chose the strategy to make more money from this character. He was planned to be in \"Sacred 3\" from the beginning of, at least, stages when the concept was completely done. But when the game was released, Malakhim was scrapped into DLC; despite it's cheap, you had to pay for that independently. Or, you should have been pre-ordered \"Sacred 3\", it was a bonus for customers. I wouldn't mind, but the four characters, presented in a base game, were of much weaker gameplay and concept compared to Malakhim, hence it might be considered as a wery light form of \"pay to play\" strategy. I don't see it as a reason to vote negatively for that part of game, it's just for the full picture.\n\n[code]\n* [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/12320]Review of the \"Sacred Gold\"[/url]\n* [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/225640]Review of the \"Sacred 2 Gold\"[/url]\n* [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/247950/]Review of the \"Sacred 3\"[/url]\n   * [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/279110]Review of the \"Sacred 3: Malakhim Hero [DLC]\"[/url] (you are here)\n   * [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/261161]Review of the \"Sacred 3: Orcland Story [DLC]\"[/url]\n   * [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/279111]Review of the \"Sacred 3: Orc of Thrones [DLC]\"[/url]\n   * [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/279112]Review of the \"Sacred 3: Z4ngr13f Weapons Spirit [DLC]\"[/url] \n[/code]","timestamp_created":1552080267,"timestamp_updated":1557599640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566323280334472656","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnIuL1OoCcbPNvAE="}
