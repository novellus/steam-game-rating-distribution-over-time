Warriors Personalization Pack DLC for [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/311210/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_III/] Call of Duty: Black Ops III [/url] includes a skin for your weapons and an exclusive calling card. In my opinion, the calling card isn't that bad, but the weapon skin isn't the best. Overall the content included in this DLC is okay, but the proceeds for this DLC will be donated to help veterans, which is nice.","timestamp_created":1596869697,"timestamp_updated":1596869697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43ru25vMCcouRmgI="}
