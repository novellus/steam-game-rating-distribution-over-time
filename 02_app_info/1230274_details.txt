Built as the first RhB line to be electrified with single phase alternating current, the metric-gauge line was opened in 1913 to the public - and is now waiting for you to discover it in Train Simulator!<br><br>RhB started construction of the core Engadin Linie from Bever to Scuol-Tarasp in 1903, taking nearly 10 years to finish the route, because the long tunnels between Guarda and Scuol presented the miners with unexpected challenges. It was the first RhB route to be electrified right from the beginning - and also the test route for the new single-phase alternating current while the route was under construction.<br><br>The Engadin (literally “Valley of the Inn people”) line leads North East through the beautiful regions of Upper and Lower Engadin following the Inn River. The first section comprises the Samedan to Pontresina railway which was built as a link between the Albula and the Bernina lines.
