    review: 'Great little game for its price. If you expect hours of playtime, don''t
      buy this game. But if you want to play something different and go back to an
      old school arcade vibe for a bit, this game is definitely worth your money.


      If you want a challenge, try to beat all of the developer''s high scores. If
      you want even more of a challenge, try to do so in less than my play time ;)'
