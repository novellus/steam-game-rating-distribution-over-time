You need to like those 3 elements because the gameplay lacks depth. And that's a shame, because what it does, it does it right. Its also a game clearly meant to be played in short sessions, and you can see it was made originally for a portable console (vita) because it's very repetitive.\n\nIn essence, it's a pretty simple brawler, with it's main depth put in the ectasy system. What's that?\nWell the stages have audiences cheering for our display power, so if we do what the audience wants, we get bufffs. And let me tell you, in Hard ,, YOU NEEED THOSE BUFFS. The audience, as you can expect from an Xseed game, is made entirely out of horny women who love guys that dish out punches. So you better dish out those punches the way they ask you. perform well, and you get into a game of panty-slot, No , i didn't say pachi slot. Wich gives you more buffs\n\nYou also unlock trough story mode support girls that improve some of your stats depending again in your performance\nAnd i love that.\n\nWhere the game loses it's momentum is the lack of depth in the combat. The game has almost no crowd control element, throws don't knock out other enemies, so the only way to work around is enviromental hazards, or wall running. Making you rely too much on one strategy makes the fun go out fast, You can always come back, the game is damn fun for short bursts. But don't expect anything close to Yakuza combat .\nI only recommend this game if you like those 3 elements, but consider it's only fun for short daily bursts.\n\nPros\nlots of available characters to play as.\nPretty good ost to accompany the action\nover the top action.\nYour expected XSeed style fan service\n\nCons.\nCharacters kind of play the same and some share moves\ncombat lacks depth and can get repetitive fast.","timestamp_created":1609686244,"timestamp_updated":1609686244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqtux5PYCe/6LwAI="}
