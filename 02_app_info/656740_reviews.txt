The reward modifier thing didn't bother me at all - I think the way to play is to just get what you get and it's enough to keep you upgrading, and only to maybe grind for cash rarely.","timestamp_created":1609330980,"timestamp_updated":1609330980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501661121845245361","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyr7m2fYCcqXhvgI="}
