Shortly thereafter, he announced that he plans to remove the game completely from the Steam Store. I bought the game before that happens because I want to give this review as a warning. The game could not be downloaded at first, it was missing the complete game folder, the game was totally empty and useless. With a trick by downloading older files from the internet I finally managed to get it to work. The game itself is very bad. The same lettering keeps popping up over the whole screen over and over so that the cards are barely visible. There is no introduction how to \"play\" and nothing. It's 0% fun. I would not recommend anything coming from this developer. Message to Valve because of the revoking and empty files has been made. In addition, the dev closes unpleasant threads or deletes them.","timestamp_created":1554992924,"timestamp_updated":1570100162,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.714809775352478027","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3eXQyO0CdbGEvwE="}
