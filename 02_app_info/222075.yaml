    review: I feel like I should stand up for this song and balance out the thumbs
      down.  Granted, I've only played this on 2014, not on Vanilla Rocksmith. Nonetheless,
      as a playable song, it's a pretty fun song that, while challenging for intermediate
      to master, has a lot of interesting elements for novices. I haven't played the
      song on the bass version (for which, it seems, Rocksmith songs seem to get most
      of their bad recommendations), but for regular guitar it's a pretty solid song,
      one of my guilty pleasure songs from the 90's.
