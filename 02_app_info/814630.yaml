    about_the_game: "Cornelius the Elf was living peacefully in a forest with his\
      \ sweetheart Elisa. However, an evil creature known as Necrilous the Not-Very-Nice\
      \ kidnapped Elisa and disappeared with her. Cornelius must embark on a perilous\
      \ journey to rescue the love of his life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo reach her, you\
      \ must traverse enchanted woods, underground mines, jungle swamps, and snow-capped\
      \ peaks, where bizarre, villainous creatures and devious puzzles will test your\
      \ mettle every step of the way! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFortunately, your magic\
      \ ring can cast many spells, increasing in power as you tread deeper into the\
      \ mystical lands of goons, goblins, and demons. You can even control some of\
      \ the background game features, helping you get to where you think you should\
      \ be. Numerous secret areas lie deep within the forest, where vital clues can\
      \ aid your quest, but beware ... you own ghost may materialize to haunt you!<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nElf is a platform action game with light adventure elements.\
      \ Cornelius is armed with a ring that fires projectiles at enemies. During the\
      \ course of the game he can collect herbs and animals (called &quot;pets&quot;),\
      \ which can be traded in shops for upgrades such as stronger attacks, extra\
      \ speed, magic spells, or devices such as a flying machine. In addition, certain\
      \ segments require the player to communicate with NPCs populating the game world\
      \ and fulfill their requests, usually by obtaining specific items for them.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game keeps track of the player character's behavior,\
      \ assigning the player a rating and affecting the ending scene depending on\
      \ the protagonist's actions, which mainly involve killing or sparing the lives\
      \ of the game's non-hostile characters. The protagonist's health is measured\
      \ in hearts and lives, which can be replenished or increased. The player can\
      \ save the game between stages."

    reviews: "\u201CA good arcade adventure is a joy to play - unfortunately you could\
      \ count the amount of good arcade adventures that have been released in recent\
      \ times on the fingers of the foot. Elf puts this situation right. Ok, so the\
      \ actual gameplay isn't going to win 1991's Most Original Game Idea award (if\
      \ such a thing exists), but as long as the gameplay's there, then total originality\
      \ isn't absolutely essential - and there's no shortage of gameplay here.\u201D\
      <br />\r\n90 \u2013 The One for ST Games<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CElf is a first\
      \ class product\u201D<br />\r\n87 \u2013 Amiga Action<br />\r\n"
