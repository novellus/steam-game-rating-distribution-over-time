    review: "one very important rule! DO NOT SPEND ANY REAL MONEY HERE!!! U WILL SIMPLY\
      \ GET ROBBED. NO JOKE! THEY BLOCK ACCOUNTS WITHOUT EXPLAINING ANYTHING. THERE\
      \ IS A LOT OF OTHER PROBLEMS HERE 2. THE LIST IS SIMPLY TO LONG AND WONT FIT\
      \ IN THIS WINDOW. \nbut here is just a few\n\n1. reward system is almost non\
      \ existing, its so little u feel robbed after the end of every match, they push\
      \ u into buying premium account but even that doesn't make a big difference.\
      \ and lol they will ban u anyway so it will run out without u using it (THERE\
      \ IS LOTS OF WEIRD \"RULES U HAVE TO FOLLOW HERE) u don't get any warnings or\
      \ explanations. \n\nno matter how high your score was, ull get a set \"reward.\
      \ (wow communism in gaming lol ) \n\n2. Absolute tons of very rude and cheating\
      \ players, ull get a lot of mother messages for killing a player.\n\n3. they\
      \ offer u lots of super expensive \"packs, but the game has only like 3 maps!\
      \ again lol..\n\n4. there is a \"market place and a \"crafting system, but simply\
      \ stay away from it. it makes no sense. crafting is often way more expensive\
      \ than just buying the weapon on the market witch is always a rip off. \n\n\
      i usually don't like to complain, i just say; \"keep the change\" and i walk\
      \ away.\n\nif u like stress and lots of gaming effort for no reward and constant\
      \ fear of getting banned, this game is for u my friend look no more ;)"
