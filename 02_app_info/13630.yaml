    review: 'I can only comment on Island Thunder in the context of, I never played
      it back in the day and I randomly grabbed it in a sale to try. It was good jumping
      back into OG Ghost Recon again, and I enjoyed these new missions. The atmosphere
      is great, they''re still tense as hell, felt compelled to play through them
      all which gets rarer for me with games these days.


      Encountered two bugs with objectives but didn''t break the game or really have
      any lasting consequence. AI is still a bit aim bot like in some situations.
      But overall, net positive time.'
