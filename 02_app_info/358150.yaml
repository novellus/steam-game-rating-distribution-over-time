    review: 'I honestly bought this dlc to go with my yakuza dlc for stealth and its
      cool if you like to do things load, but even more fun when you can burn yourself
      and get 90% speed boost for 5 seconds and then 70% speed boost, its amazing,
      and if you like to do stings more stealthy, buy this with the yakuza pack, ultimate
      steakth combo! : D'
