    review: "The game is relatively short and even though the description says that\
      \ there are multiple endings, there are only two endings. You either escape\
      \ or die. When I did escape the final room, the game was just over and you see\
      \ the credits. During the game, you heard some things, so I was expecting a\
      \ little more of an ending then just \"boom\" finished, \"You Escaped\".\n\n\
      I have been to numerous escape rooms in real life and there are always multiple\
      \ keys that need to be found. The keys for this game are not really hidden but\
      \ easily accessible and, for a VR version of an escape room and for a single\
      \ person playing, you use the key and then whatever the next step is. Even though\
      \ the game is really short in duration, it was worth the money I spent on it.\
      \ \n\nAs in real life escape rooms where you have to duck and move around objects,\
      \ the space is small in this game but you have to do this as well. I was on\
      \ the floor and I even had to duck under some beams. Although you probably could\
      \ walk through them, the graphics made you feel like you need to duck under\
      \ them. Someone came in when I was getting one of the keys from the floor and\
      \ was like \"What are you doing on the floor?\" They had thought I had tripped\
      \ and fell or something. So being able to be immersed in the game or have the\
      \ feeling like you needed to get down on the floor was really enjoyable.\n\n\
      The only issue I had was when I died, which I did die on my first play through,\
      \ when I selected to restart the game, I ended up looking up towards the cabin.\
      \ So the restart option in the game was bugged. But other than that, I really\
      \ enjoyed the game. It was fun and I would recommend the game."
