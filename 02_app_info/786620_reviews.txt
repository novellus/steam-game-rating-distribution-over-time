Mainly the animation.\nThe animation is very stiff and a lot of the poses look awkward and strange, although this is one of the more glaring issues it is also very fixable with a visual rework of some kind.\nThe way the menu works is kind of annoying and difficult to use, it'd probably be better to have a regular menu so people can navigate it much easier.\nThe music isn't really an issue, although it'd be nice to have different tones of music as some of the encounters feel like they could really use the more serious tone, even if it's just by map.\nCharacter designs. While some of them are perfectly fine, like Percival and Edge, some designs seem really boring and uninspired like #1 and the wind fists guy.\nAnd the ai is a bit dumb, but I can't really fault for that since coding is hard.\n\nThe good thing is that all of these issues are fixable, and the actual gameplay is really fun. I enjoy the dialogue between the characters and the variety of ways the dash can be used. I reccomend for gameplay and in hopes that the aspects above are improved upon in the future.","timestamp_created":1540709488,"timestamp_updated":1540709488,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw2KLc3OYCdoe+rQE="}
