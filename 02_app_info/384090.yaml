    review: "Here is another example of why the platform needs to change, more EA\
      \ lies and garbage.  In the land of STEAM EA abandonware cash-grab I\u2019ve\
      \ been burned about 90% of the time.  I think we should just rename STEAM to\
      \ abandonware Kickstarter actually. In that abyss of those forever EA BS dev\u2019\
      s talking about the future of the game and releasing a bugfix or an update once\
      \ in a great while and promising a playable game that just sits in concept forever.\
      \  It\u2019s mostly killed the fun lifelong gaming experience for me to the\
      \ point of going months or longer without even opening STEAM or gaming in general.\
      \  I understand that STEAM cannot vet people\u2019s intensions, I get that.\
      \  But I feel like they\u2019re using the platform to push as many games as\
      \ possible in your \u201Cdiscovery queue\u201D because EA increases the pool\
      \ of \u201Cproducts\u201D for them to pimp so it\u2019s just more cash in their\
      \ pocket without concern for the gamer.  If you\u2019re new to STEAM or EA,\
      \ take it from someone who has lost a lot, stay away from EA.  I think we should\
      \ start a petition to add a filter to opt out of seeing EA titles in your queue\
      \ or on STEAM home page ads.  I think its killing gaming, it is for me."
