Made by a single developer, which i believe needs to be kept in mind because i am learning to be a solo game developer, and the fact is we cannot not make big complicated games in a reasonable time frame. I am all too familiar with how hard it is to even make a simple game like this, especially if  you are just starting out like i am. Its not a game with an incredible amount of depth, but it is an enjoyable, well rounded, solid game, and it isn't horribly overpriced. So, hats off to the developer.....good job man! :)","timestamp_created":1609001347,"timestamp_updated":1609001347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+4T9z/YCe8K4vQI="}
