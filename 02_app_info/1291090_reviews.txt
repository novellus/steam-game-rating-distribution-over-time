There’s not a lot of content, but it doesn’t cost much. This game is a mixture of sudoku and short stories. Your reward for solving a puzzle is being able to read another page. There are better sudoku games out there, but I thought the stories were told well. I’ll go with a thumbs up because you can read a story straight through after you solve all the puzzles. You don’t have to solve them again. (You do have to save your progress manually in order to just read a story later on, but there is a clear warning that there is no autosave feature.)","timestamp_created":1594960963,"timestamp_updated":1594960963,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586988866329193115","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ425zFrfMCe4HmlQI="}
