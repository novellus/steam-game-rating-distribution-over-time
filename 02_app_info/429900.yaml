    review: I really recommend this bike, it's great, it has a lot power, nice handleing,
      i like the 250 and this bike very much, i would start on a 250 and get this
      at the same time because they are both very good bikes to learn the timing of
      jumps, the 450 is nice but that's a little much at first, at least for me i
      like them also but there very fast. but everyone of them is good so i hope this
      helps someone who's looking to get one. enjoy and have fun.
