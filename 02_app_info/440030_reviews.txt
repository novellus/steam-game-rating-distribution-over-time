I enjoy the promo cards (Battle Screecher, Megahauler, the Ark, etc.) but the gambits themselves feel either underpowered or overpowered. It just feels cheap when your opponent plays a gambit that just accelerates their lead and makes it impossible for you to catch up.\n\nThere is no \"so okay it's average\" option, unfortunately.","timestamp_created":1494218016,"timestamp_updated":1494218016,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.641239345073699951","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0LCV89sCeeDOeA=="}
