    review: 'Fun fact: whenever you''re playing in a match, you can see the name of
      the track that''s currently playing in the bottom section of the screen. This
      game [b]knows[/b] that the songs are good. It''s even a part of this game''s
      selling point.


      That''s how good the game''s soundtrack is.


      By purchasing the soundtrack, not only do you have access to some funky bangers,
      but you can  also support the talented artists behind this masterpiece of a
      soundtrack.'
