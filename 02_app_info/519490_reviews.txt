Probably from back when people thought there would be something better.\n\nResolution can be made sharper with UE4 fix.\nYes there's a bit of aim assist even on all star but you still have to focus and aim and it feels correct when you make a shot.\n\nIf you like MLB Home Run Derby VR, this is the basketball version of that.\n\nGood add to the fitness lineup if you can get it on sale.\n\nUpdate:. This is turning out to be one of my favorite VR games.
