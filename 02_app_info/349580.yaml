    detailed_description: "<h1>Just Updated</h1><p>Dear players,<br><br>All of us\
      \ at Nacho games and Free Reign Entertainment are proud about the Burstfire\
      \ game. We feel that we\u2019ve been able to achieve a lot in a short time.\
      \  Burstfire was fun for us during both our internal tests and Open Alpha Summer\
      \ 2015. <br><br>Unfortunately the game in it's current state did not get popular\
      \ enough for us to provide quality updates for it. To put it simply \u2013 the\
      \ game just doesn\u2019t have enough players to be fun \u2013 you may notice\
      \ when playing that it\u2019s difficult to find players to join a full game\
      \ session.<br><br>We think that by continuing to sell game right now we\u2019\
      re providing a disservice to our players that buy the game and expect an active\
      \ player base.  To make sure that players are not getting a bad experience,\
      \ we\u2019ve decided to halt the sale of the game.  We are going back to the\
      \ drawing board and redesigning the game to better fit player expectations.\
      \ <br><br>For the next 7 days we will provide an unconditional refund to anyone\
      \ who bought the game regardless how many hours you've played or how long ago\
      \ you purchased it on Steam or other platform.  We will refund your purchase\
      \ 100%, no questions asked :)<br><br>We\u2019ll keep the game servers up and\
      \ running as long as there are active players trying to play the game.<br><br>Thank\
      \ you for giving us your vote of confidence and trying out Burstfire. We\u2019\
      ll be back with a new and improved Burstfire in 2016, stay tuned for more news!<br><br>Burstfire\

      -:Edit:-

      (Seems to be a dead game now so yea nvm about the below)


      The game has a good breach and clear mechanic but the games are short and also
      there is no real tutorial so the best way to learn the game is to play the game
      and if you jump in a game with no clue of what you are doing sometimes people
      get angry :)'
