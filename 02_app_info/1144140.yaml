    review: "A small JRPG, with a fair amount of secrets searching:\nFollow the interwined\
      \ story of two completely different character, a rather unlucky and mocked prince,\
      \ and a man from the slums looking for his own destiny, as they develop in different\
      \ paths, and yet into the same endgame. \nThe overall mood is silly, funny,\
      \ although it follow a semi-serious plot. \nA game well worth its price: easy\
      \ enough for everyone to get into, but with some enjoyable little dialogues,\
      \ and plenty of corner to check and doublecheck.\n"
