      \ Pacific islands weather data is used in our weather engine<br></li><li><strong>27\
      \ different modifications</strong> for weather engine - players can choose between\
      \ different weather models:<br>      Normal (default), hot, cold, wet, dry,\

      \ gameplay. Imagine a calm scenario making sailing difficult whereas a scenario\
      \ with lots of storms and high humidity makes managing fires a real challenge.<br></li><li><strong>Latitude\
      \ based</strong> weather and season - the actual weather is depending not only\
      \ on the actual day of the year but also from the players actual latitude. Don't\
      \ like the winter season in the northern zones? Simply travel to the south for\
      \ a warm summer breeze.<br></li><li><strong>Complex temperature</strong> system\
      \ (sun, shadow, wind, rain \u2026) - Player can experience the temperature as\

      \ sun and the wind to speed up drying when you and clothes got wet. And when\
      \ it's cold and windy without protection you'll feel the breeze of the freeze.</li></ul><h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Fire and Rain</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Dynamic</strong>\
      \ - the fire engine reacts to the environment and to the used burnable material:<br>\
      \   - Wind - Wind ensures a quick burning fire process but can also make igniting\
      \ a fire place much more difficult. In some cases you need to protect your fire\
      \ places from the wind.<br>   - Rain - Rain makes the used resources wet and\
      \ affects stability and intensity of fire places. If fires are not placed under\
      \ a roof or trees those will go out over time because of the rain.<br>   - Moisture\
      \ - Reliable fires depend on the 'wet property' of added resources. All burnable\
      \ resources can get wet due to rain events or when those were found in the ocean.\
      \ Of course, damp resources dry up fast in the sun or in a windy environment.</li></ul><h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Building and Crafting</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Blueprints</strong>\
      \ - Craft and build in 3 simple steps:<br>   - Place the blueprint of your desired\
      \ object<br>   - Insert the required resources you see in the placed blueprint<br>\
      \   - Finalize your project - Some building projects require a certain amount\
      \ of hits with a finishing tool</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sailing</h2><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Realistic</strong> sailing mechanic - Traveling\
      \ by raft is an act of art! You will need wind, an intact sail, a rudder - and\
      \ knowledge.<br></li><li><strong>Sail</strong> - Gets the raft moving. How high\
      \ up sails are hoisted and how they are oriented compared to wind direction\
      \ all takes into account how the wind force eventually affects your rafts moving\
      \ capabilities. In heavy storms you want to take your sails in or those will\
      \ be torn apart or blown away. With many different sail types available also\
      \ different sailing behaviour is to be expected.<br></li><li><strong>Rudder</strong>\
      \ - Steer your raft in an old fashioned way</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Raft</h2><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Modular</strong> rafts - Rafts can be modified\
      \ and dismantled any time. Their components can be reused then again to build\
      \ a better, faster, heavier water vehicle<br></li><li><strong>Building</strong>\
      \ on rafts - Build your own shelters on rafts or convert a plain raft to a houseboat\
      \ (used also by native people or indians at those times). When traveling long\
      \ distances it is essential to have a shelter on the raft to protect the player\
