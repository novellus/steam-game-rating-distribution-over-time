    review: '[h1] Experienced on the Oculus RIft [/h1]


      So I think this is one of the better DLCs for this game. The animations are
      pretty good. The environment looks good. Ride runs smoothly. I really loved
      the dragon / wyvern. Probably the best looking asset in this series. It''s also
      animated pretty well, which is surprising because most animations in this series
      is lacking.


      The ride is pretty long as well. I think it''s around 5-6 minutes long. It has
      speed, jumps, twists, turns, all of it. It has nice background vistas as well.
      And you''re doing all this with lots of battles going on all around you.


      Rate 7/10.
