    review: "played for an hour not massively impressed, but it is early access etc,\n\
      \nFirst off let me say I play this with quest 2 + Virtual desktop, as some issues\
      \ could be attributed to setups in VR\n\nBad points -\n1. Grip to SHEATH a weapon\
      \ . . . why? I was in combat in last room of the run, and I sheathed my weapon\
      \ mid fight . . . . cause I grip something when I hold it I don't let go to\
      \ hold something and reverse, my god this annoyed me so much\n2. the dungeons\
      \ seem very plain, definitely considering the long loading times and how little\
      \ is loaded per load screen, takes you out of the experience\n3. TOO. MANY.\
      \ MIMICS. I could tell the chest was a mimic but you can't do any thing but\
      \ attempt to open it til it attacks, I tried casting spells and hitting it preemptively,\
      \ doesn't work. I had 5 mimics in my single run. Mimics should be used sparely\
      \ and effectively, placing them so commonly diminishes the effect of such a\
      \ wonderful creature (This message is brought to you by the Mimics appreciation\
      \ society)\n4. having to kill all enemies before you can continue, why MUST\
      \ I fight? surely I should be able to avoid a fight if I feel the enemy is too\
      \ powerful, but the rooms are locked with either death or kill all the only\
      \ completion scenarios.\n5. Melee combat feels a bit wagglely, the enemy strikes\
      \ very quickly bit this is offset by the fact they can barely hit, a better\
      \ ramp up would be good, with more clear parrying results \n\nNow what does\
      \ the game do right?\nThe good:\n1. Traps work fairly well, that said a skeleton\
      \ walked through a wire and it didn't activate so might not be perfect, but\
      \ they are reasonable enough to spot that it's not just a random HP reduction\n\
      2. the atmosphere, the dungeons, whilst bare, do feel like lost dungeons, the\
      \ music plays well and the overall graphics are fairly nice\n3. gold upgrade\
      \ system per run, works again, pretty well, the descriptions are clear enough\
      \ that I can tell what swords I would want to buy eventually etc\n\n\noverall\
      \ I have more bad points than good, but of the dungeon crawler games I have\
      \ tried this is one of the better ones so far, some just don't play well at\
      \ all, and others are just garish, I look forward to seeing updates to this\
      \ game and will be keeping my eye on it\n\nTLDR: the current price reflects\
      \ it's early access polish, but is worthwhile if you want a dungeon crawler\
      \ that could possibly last you a while, but it won't haunt you til your dying\
      \ days if you give it a miss"
