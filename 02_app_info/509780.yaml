    review: The longest five minutes of your life... This is essentially a single-level
      bullet hell shmup, but that single level mutates and iterates so many different
      ways that there is easily a full game worth of content. If this came out in
      the 90's, it's the type of thing that the old GameFan magazine would have salivated
      endlessly over. Hard as nails, but HIGHLY recommended. Another reviewer pointed
      out the Treasure influence and I have to agree. The dev has a bunch of other
      high-quality shooters a well and every one is well worth playing.
