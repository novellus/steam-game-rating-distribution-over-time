    about_the_game: In a world with a debt to an all consuming creature at it's centre,
      where capitalists must feed the creature money in order to stop it destroying
      the planet, as a factory owner you must make enough money, by the end of the
      week, to feed the creature. The public will see you as greedy but that is the
      price to pay for the brave capitalists, the secret heroes of the world.<br><br><br><br>Production
      Inc. is a 2D puzzle game where you can make a production line to manufacture
      objects in any shape you want. You will be running a factory whilst trying not
      to go bankrupt. At the end of the week you will have to pay the debt. You will
      make money by getting contracts and setting up a production line to manufacture
      objects that fulfil the contracts specifications. To do this you will buy the
      appropriate machines and materials, build the production line, program the machines
      and maintain them. The contracts have a quality threshold so you can cut corners
