The puzzle architecture is more like Rhem with a lot of switches, valves, etc. that have to be in the correct settings.  There are clues for sure, but no obvious logic as to why things would be done that way.  All the same, a very enjoyable game, could have wished for it to be longer as there were areas left unexplored.","timestamp_created":1609444090,"timestamp_updated":1609444090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwifyV3fYCfPeYvwI="}
