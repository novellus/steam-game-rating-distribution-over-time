Credit receive is pretty much low but the EXP is insane. \nThe first few Monsters are good if you are around Lv. 80~100. Going deeper the difficulty increases greatly - also the EXP.\nWithin one hour I managed to level from 80 to 999. So if you may be stuck in a Boss from the story but dont want to farm alot, buy this one.","timestamp_created":1585047314,"timestamp_updated":1585047314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.615858674049377441","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5dOLhvECdq7P+gE="}
