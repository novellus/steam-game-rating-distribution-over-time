    about_the_game: It's a cool summer evening in 2009. You're about to sit down and
      play your favorite platformer,<i> Epic Rabousch! The Armenian Electrician</i>.
      But then, you hear those awful, awful words. From down the hall, your mother
      calls to you:<br><br>&quot;Sorry sweetie, but it's your little brother's turn
      on the controller. You can help him though!&quot;<br><br>Now you're going to
      have to sit and watch as the sniveling little brat lowers your average highscore
      that you've spent many months trying to raise. Maybe you could guide him in
      the right direction, if he'll only listen...<br><br>LITTLE BROTHER'S TURN is
      an infinite, procedurally generated platformer that takes a new twist on how
      you control the game... or rather, how you don't! You'll have to work with a
      delay as your brother takes time to complete your commands. It's platforming,
      but planning ahead. Your brother, being the brat he is, can also outright disobey
      you. But maybe there's something you can do about that...<br><br>How far can
      you make it before losing your temper?

    review: Well worth the $2.99. Very frustrating at first, but there are a few strategies
      once you figure them out. Good luck!
