I really want to be able to recommend this game. BUT A lot of times the rounds will start and the bike moved 3 ft ahead of where you originally were, when you grab the paper, it's hit or miss, sometimes you'll get it sometimes you wont. Until this game gets some updates, fixes some bugs, and feels like a finished game I can not recommend this. \n\n[Quote] If you liked this review Make sure to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33220185-VR-Games-and-Tools/]Click here[/url] and give a follow for more reviews of good, bad and decent VR titles.
