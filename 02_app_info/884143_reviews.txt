Furthermore the \"snow\" functionality is too simplified to really be fun (why is there snow from Flensburg to Leipzig every winter, but never in the Alps?)\nAll that could be fixed easily with a relatively simple overhaul, but for now I cannot recommend it as it's just frustrating to play the map","timestamp_created":1609321969,"timestamp_updated":1609321969,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41o7E2fYCebLdvgI="}
