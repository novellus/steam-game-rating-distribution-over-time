It's often hard on basic story mode, and I haven't tried endless. It has a lot of puzzles and resource management, which can get stressful, but other than that it's mostly reasonably relaxing. There are also some minor horror elements in the story that I think fit reasonably well with the game. I also think the graphics are really good.","timestamp_created":1588792140,"timestamp_updated":1606538592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8K/KhvYCc6qEhgI="}
