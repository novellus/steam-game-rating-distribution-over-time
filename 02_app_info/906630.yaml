    review: '[h1]Amazing Soundtrack[/h1] but don''t buy it on Steam. Kinda expensive
      at full price, wait for a 50% off somewhere else.

      The soundtrack as a whole is nice and ties the whole X series together, but
      the meat of the soundtrack is the X Challenge boss themes. In Maverick Hunter
      X, the X1 soundtrack was just revamped into some futuristic techno stuff which
      was really dissapointing. In this soundtrack, the arranger understood what was
      great about each boss theme and worked off of that, expanding upon the great
      song that was already there and making it better. The jewel of this soundtrack
      is of course the original instrumental boss theme RE;FUTURE, which matches the
      music of the soundtrack and shows off what an X soundtrack should be on modern
      platforms.

      The issue I had with this soundtrack was when I bought it, I wasn''t able to
      download it. I tried everything, looking at fourms on steam and contacting Capcom
      support. After a month of concacting support they found that there was an error
      with steam''s download and I could finally listen to it in all its glory. I
      would say that I might just be unlucky but I am not the only person with this
      issue, so unforutnately I cannot reccoment that it be downloaded on this platform.
      If you enjoyed the soundtrack in the game please support Capcom and buy it on
      another platform.'
