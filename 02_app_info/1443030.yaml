      \ by an architectural designer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter losing his cat Mobiius\
      \ to lifelong illness, a father sees him again in a brief Dream.  The father\
      \ then designs and builds a device called The DreamCatcher, which allows him\

      \ in the Dream World, the DreamCatcher glitches and the father experiences sleep\
      \ paralysis, trapping him in the Dream World against his will.  The only way\

      \ Dream.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMobiius' Final Dream has him challenged with defeating\
      \ the nefarious Devilopers, who are harvesting planets of their resources, solely\
