    review: "First Impressions after about 90 minutes worth of play:\n\nPros:\n-UI\
      \ update is great\n-Now feels like an actual challenging drift game, probably\
      \ the best since nfs\n-Drift score will lead you to train and try and make moves\
      \ through the track \n-goal times are a challenge \n-you can and will break\
      \ loose if you are careless\n-the miniscule adjustments to your setups actually\
      \ matter as much as they should\n\nCons:\n-WE NEED MORE CARS WITH THEM!\n-Slight\
      \ sound bugs whenever you wheel hop or spin into corners with more worn tires\
      \ \n\nSummary:\nEasily the best drift title since EA's 2007 NFS. If you have\
      \ been wanting a proper challenge in this Genre, this is the best game yet and\
      \ will highly recommend to any fan of the drift car racing. Did I mention this\
      \ game has the new Mercedes concept car (best car)? Please keep up the good\
      \ work, PLAYWHIZGAMES you have done a great job awesome game kudos to the team\
      \ gg (all I would like is some extra cars, please!)"
