    review: It's good in how you learn a good bit about Japan. It's bad though it
      that it makes people from Japan apparently temperamental. The way it tries to
      tell the story is off, with choices potentially sending you down a bad turn
      without any way of knowing it's coming. Better flow and structure would make
      learning about Japan worth it, because here it just detracts.
