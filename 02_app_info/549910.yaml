    review: "Confusing. Buggy. \n\nThe atmosphere seems promising, but altogether\
      \ it is really hard to figure out what you're supposed to do in this game. I\
      \ didn't get very far because this game is missing the standard journal system\
      \ that helps to keep you on track of what you should be trying to accomplish.\
      \ \n\nI've said this before and I'll say it again: Simply telling me to get\
      \ out of a building isn't enough. There was a cell phone that would give hints,\
      \ but I felt like it would have been unnecessary with better writing. And the\
      \ hints aren't always very good. \n\nYou'll find an item and think, 'What now?\
      \ What's this for?' And it remains a mystery until you've clicked every item\
      \ in the office trying to figure out where it goes. Oh joy. That's ok, I give\
      \ up haha. \n\nI'd recommend giving this one a miss, friends. Sorry. </3"
