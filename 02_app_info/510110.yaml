      an unwitting knight and his feisty wife find the Fountain of Living Water! You'll
      need to cross rugged terrain, battle undead skeletons and overcome huge obstacles
      to make it, but with the knight's fair lady cracking wise every step of the
      way, you'll barely notice the other hardships...<br><br>To complete 40 levels
      of finely tuned time management action, you'll need to carefully balance your
      resources as you harvest food, mine gold, repair bridges, build buildings and

    review: "[h1]Short version: 67%[/h1]\nNew Yankee 2 is a bit closer to a trial\
      \ and error game than a traditional time manager, but that can be fun if you\
      \ enjoy puzzle-like levels. It does its job well; it just doesn\u2019t do anything\
      \ else beyond that.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nOne of the most defining elements\
      \ of the first New Yankee game was its pace. Since we had many workers to gather\
      \ food, wood, gold, and mana, there was not a moment of downtime on any level.\
      \ This sequel tries to follow a similar vein but still attempts to tone down\
      \ the speed somewhat.\n\nThe worker count is up to nine now, but we can only\
      \ receive resources from production buildings when we assign a worker to them.\
      \ Also, the levels are closer to little puzzles, where we must follow an intended\
      \ order and timing to stand a chance beating the countdown clock.\n\nAs a result,\
      \ we get a time manager that is both fast yet still methodical. Trial and error\
      \ is a large part of playing New Yankee 2\u2026 although some may say that it\
      \ is a too large part of the game. Those, however, who enjoy puzzle-ish time\
      \ managers, will love this one.\n\nAs usual in this genre, there is barely any\
      \ story; it is mostly pre-level banter among the many characters. Although I\
      \ have to admit, seeing the big, burly protagonist cover in her from his wife\
      \ has a few funny moments."
