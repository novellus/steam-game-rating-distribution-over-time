    review: "[b]Redemption Cemetery 5: Bitter Frost [/b](IHOG or Match-3 Adventure)\n\
      \n[i]This is a standalone story[/i]\n\nOptions include separate sliders for\
      \ Music, SFX and Voices, Full-screen, Widescreen and Custom Cursor.  Three Difficulties\
      \ to choose from, or you can go with Custom Mode.  Can be changed at any time.\n\
      \n[b]Story[/b]:\n\nWenonah, the Spirit of Cold, had feelings for the Owl Spirit,\
      \ Koturi, but her feelings were not returned.  When Koturi fell in love with\
      \ your ultimate grandmother, he gave up his immortality to marry her. Wenoah's\
      \ rage knew no bounds, and this Christmas Eve she will finally enact her revenge\
      \ by killing off your ancestors to make sure that YOU will never be born!\n\n\
      The spirit of Koturi was able to freeze time, temporarily saving your life,\
      \ but it's up to you to save your ancestors... and yourself!\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1939598684\n\
      We do have a Journal, but each of the three segments is pretty nicely encapsulated,\
      \ so you probably won't need the story reminders.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]:\n\n[i]Bitter\
      \ Cold[/i] takes the usual [i]Redemption Cemetery[/i] formula and changes it\
      \ by having you save the living, rather than helping the dead.  As usual we\
      \ will visit three distinctly different eras during our journey.\n\nBe on the\
      \ lookout for [b]Collectible Snowflakes [/b]as you play.\n\nThe [b]MAP[/b] is\
      \ only semi-useful, as the areas where we have actions to complete are shown\
      \ even if we can't do anything there right that moment.  The insta-transport\
      \ is of course very helpful, but if you need help, the directional [b]HINT[/b]\
      \ is likely going to be your best bet.\n\n[b]Hidden Object Scenes[/b] vary in\
      \ type, and although you will revisit each scene once, the items you found previously\
      \ will stay gone.  If you don't feel like doing HOS, you can switch to [b]Match-3\
      \ mode[/b]... Although this is like no M3 I've ever seen before!  Once you make\
      \ a few matches, one of the pieces will start to glow.  Match that piece to\
      \ remove one item that needs to be found.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1939599509\n\
      The [b]Mini-games[/b] are nicely-varied, and many have the option of completing\
      \ them in Casual or Hard mode.\n\n[b]Sights and Sounds[/b]:\n\nI was really\
      \ impressed to hear actual, appropriate emotion from the voice actors -- they\
      \ did a great job (although the narrator seemed a bit too chipper).\n\nVisually\
      \ there are some stunningly gorgeous scenes and I like the character design.\n\
      \n[b]CE Content[/b]:\n[list]\n[*]Integrated Strategy Guide\n[*]Bonus Chapter\n\
      [*]Collectible Snowflakes - purchase decorates for your snow globe!\n[*]In-game\
      \ Achievements\n[*]7 Wallpapers (including one of my favorite scenes!)\n[*]10\
      \ Concept Art\n[*]35 Cutscenes\n[*]5 Screensavers\n[*]4 Music Tracks \n[*]18\
      \ Mini-games\n[*]11 Hidden Object Scenes\n[/list]\n[b]Bonus Chapter[/b]:\n\n\
      A postman's carriage slipped into the river, and he cannot rest until the packages\
      \ and letters in his care are delivered.  The extra chapter does not involve\
      \ any of the characters from the main game (except you), but there are a few\
      \ familiar scenes along with some all-new areas.  \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1940978781\n\
      [b]Verdict[/b]:\n\nThe visuals immediately drew me in, and the main goal of\
      \ saving your ancestors ties the separate stories -- and the simultaneous Christmas\
      \ and Native American themes -- together beautifully.  All told the game + bonus\
      \ took me about four and a half hours, and I enjoyed it all.  Recommended!"
