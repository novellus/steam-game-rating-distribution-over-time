    review: 'So awesome!! I love both this and the captain mc pain skin a lot, but
      this skin was the one that I somehow always had in mind and wanted to buy (no,
      not gay but because I thought its so funny). Awesome look with the hat and shiny
      discoball-bombs or spotlight-airstrike  and super funny party voice lines. (Defend
      = This partys too hot!, Help = This is gettin outta hand!)

      Probably one of my favorite skins in the game. The type of favorite where you
      cant even explain why exactly but you just know that feeling and its a favorite.
      If that doesnt convince you then you should Look at your score, now look at
      mine! Back to your score, now back to MIIIINEE!'
