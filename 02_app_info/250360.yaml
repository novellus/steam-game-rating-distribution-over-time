    review: 'If you aren''t familiar with formatting scripts into this type of Screenplay
      format, then this would be a good starting point to learn from. If you''re serious
      about it, though, I would recommend that you use this as more of a scratch pad
      of sorts.


      The software makes it a lot easier to structure your screenplay, at least when
      it comes to writing. Just list how many characters you have, and you can easily
      write a few pages of dialogue in no time. But that''s also because the width
      margins are kind of narrow, and you''ll end up using way more pages than needed
      if you''re needing to print your finished work. And the software, unfortunately,
      doesn''t allow you to edit these margins. If anything, be prepared to edit this
      in Microsoft Word, or use a printer where you can print on both sides, if you''re
      trying to conserve paper.


      As someone who writes multiple screenplays for my own YouTube channel and other
      endeavors, having this software on hand does make it a lot easier to write scripts
      faster, but from my experience, this is essentially "Baby''s First Script Writer".
      If you''re looking for more Industry Standard type of stuff, like Final Draft
      11, you''re gonna be paying anywhere up to $249 for it. So if you''re looking
      for a simple start, or just something cheap, then you can start here. But, basically,
      you''re getting what you pay for.'
