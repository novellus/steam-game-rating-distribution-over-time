    review: "As much I love some games done by this developer, I cannot recommend\
      \ Ashworld because it is still look like a work in progress which might remain\
      \ like this more or less  (If you follow Orangepixel YouTube channel, you'll\
      \ probably got the impression that more games are now currently developed, rather\
      \ than having this one improved / worked on). \n\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed\
      \ my 1.2h of playing Ashworld (so far) and I most likely going play more when\
      \ time permits. It has a good concept and switches from a top-down shooter to\
      \ a platformer game with the \"signature\" pixel graphics from Orangepixel.\
      \ But I had a few issues when playing that prevent me from giving a thumb up:\n\
      - Quest marker disappearing on the map - That leaves you roaming the map having\
      \ to do another side quest to hope triggering the active quest. Not sure if\
      \ I missed something there or if it was an actual bug...\n- The lack of hints\
      \ or possibly a tutorial. I ended my gaming session on what I think is a radioactive\
      \ room without actually knowing what I could do to prevent radiation to affect\
      \ me (I would believe there is some sort of suit that I can get somewhere -\
      \ I did skip my first or second encounter pointing me to a radioactive building\
      \ and not to go inside)\n- The control could be improved. It felt hard to move\
      \ from a room with platforms moving around. The car control is a disaster with\
      \ an Xbox controller to a point it is easier to walk than trying to figure out\
      \ why the car is not steering.\n- The overall mechanic to force you to sleep,\
      \ find food and find a shelter every day is not really working forcing you to\
      \ travel the map constantly to find a shelter. Maybe the span of a day could\
      \ be longer to actually let the player explore more.\n\n\n"
