    about_the_game: "This is a game requiring both logic and strategy where the goal\
      \ is to build solid layers of cubes without empty spaces using given figures\
      \ with some certain shape. A player gets score with each built layer and this\
      \ layer of cubes is removed from the matrix. The game may help to develop 3D\
      \ space orientation skill and may seem difficult for players who naturally don\u2019\
      s have this skill. The game speeds up a bit with each complete layer, but it\
      \ also possible to choose your own speed of the game via options. I feel some\
      \ kind of satisfaction and relax playing it. Hope you too."
