Gunplay is pretty good, Visuals are ok but I noticed that sometimes player models would go stiff while sliding around, spawns on small maps are god awful, and TTK is a little high but that seems to be a counter for the spawns being so bad. Oh and the game is dead. when I first opened the game there was a single server with only 1 human player. Bot enemies were ok at best.","timestamp_created":1609806365,"timestamp_updated":1609806365,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lPj75/YCefzGwAI="}
