This would be fine if it was advertised as such and i was dumb enough to pay for skill but no, the picture on the content is of what looks like a beefed up version of the other submachinegun in the game with a different skin would be fine for a dollar which is what i was assuming i'd get. For a second i thought it didnt install but no i was looking for something new that i bought when i should've been looking for a gun i already had because thats apperently what i paid for. It's just a dollar but its wasted if spent on this waste your money on the skins or something.\n","timestamp_created":1524782362,"timestamp_updated":1524782362,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2Y2HguMCceqMnwE="}
