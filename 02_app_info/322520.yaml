    review: The game is fun, the game is simple, it's a old school game with old school
      graphics, one thing i noticed that i disliked, is the pc version has clunkier
      controls and worse graphics than the console counterpart this was probabbly
      done on purpose so more people could play it on the pc, but in that case why
      not have a HD mode for people who have the computers to run it? Over all though
      fun hack n slash game, nothing ground breaking, just good oal button mashing
