So on more difficult stages, you will have to keep replaying even if you win just so you can get that one last big reclamation to get enough bonus for the 3rd star. Why not give the player more breathing room to claim more playfield after hitting the winning threshold (like shortening the timer and speeding up the enemies or something). The player is then given ample opportunity for a bonus but with extra risk.\n\nTLDR; if you love Qix and Qix clones, it's worth checking out this game for a few minutes and a dollar. If you don't absolutely love those, you should probably skip this.","timestamp_created":1581904081,"timestamp_updated":1581904081,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hpa1qPACc6Lk8gE="}
