    review: I cant really recommend this one, the story jumps too much to the point
      I don't even know what is going on anymore, your choices are esentially non
      existant, this is a linear story just with some flavor options but nothing more,
      the fact that the story jumps so much makes you to not care at all about any
      character because of the many jumps in the story.
