      \ Baldwin DR-6-4-2000 \u201Cpassenger shark\u201D diesels and the railroad\u2019\
      s flagship passenger train, the Broadway Limited!<br><br>In the diesel era,\
      \ the Pennsylvania was the number-one customer of the Baldwin Locomotive Works\
      \ and among the 643 diesels PRR purchased from Baldwin were 27 2,000-horsepower\
      \ DR-6-4-2000 diesel passenger locomotives which were outfitted in  the Raymond\
      \ Lowey-designed \u201CSharknose,\u201D a styling inspired by PRR\u2019s Baldwin-built\
      \ T1 steam locomotives. Pennsy\u2019s DR-6-4-2000 passenger sharks entered service\
      \ in 1948 and were used system-wide on PRR\u2019s fleet of passenger trains.\
      \ Originally dressed in PRR\u2019s classic \u201Cfive-stripe\u201D Brunswick\
      \ green passenger livery, over the years the DR-6-4-2000s wore multiple liveries\

      five-stripe\u201D and \u201Csingle-stripe\u201D versions in both Brunswick green\
      \ and Tuscan red. In their later years, the Pennsy\u2019s DR-6-4-2000s migrated\
      \ to the New York &amp; Long Branch (now NJ Transit\u2019s North Jersey Coast\
      \ Line) where they were employed in commuter service. The PRR retired its last\

      \ On the competitive New York \u2013 Chicago route, it was PRR\u2019s Broadway\
      \ Limited and New York Central\u2019s 20th Century Limited that duelled for\
      \ supremacy. The Pennsy had re-equipped its flagship with streamlined equipment\
      \ in 1938, but in the fervor of post-WWII passenger competition PRR again introduced\
      \ new equipment in 1949. Constructed primarily by Pullman-Standard and Budd,\
      \ the Broadway Limited\u2019s post-war equipment included a variety of sleeper,\
      \ lounge, and dining equipment. And along with the Baldwin DR-6-4-2000, DTM\

    review: '02-DEC-2020 - UPDATE on this pack - The developer has fixed the previously
      identified issues with the rolling stock.

      The developers - DTM or Digital Train Model - were most helpful in addressing
      the major issues with this pack. The textures on the red loco have been completely
      fixed. The cars were also fixed, as a problem with the brake system configuration
      was identified as the culprit for the sluggishness of the train.


      I contacted the Developers on their Facebook page - look for Digital Train Model
      - and they sorted all the aforementioned problems in real time, and swiftly
      made the appropriate patches to fix these issues. The patches are RWP files
      which can be installed using TS Utilities.


      As I write this, Steam does not yet have the updated/corrected version of this
      add-on.


      After installing the patches, I find this pack to be a "must have" in your depot,
      especially if you have the Horse Shoe Curve add-on route.

      Yes, I do recommend this add-on. Just make sure you get the patches from the
      Devs after.'
