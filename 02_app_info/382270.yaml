    review: 'When a game is less than $1, the real question is "is it worth my time?"
      The answer for most people for this game is probably no.


      The game brings its own charms and contributions to the Qix genre:

      A power up/ability system

      A nice soundtrack

      The ability to cross over your own unfinished lines

      Enemies start a "fuse" when they touch your unfinished lines rather than killing
      you outright

      And a unique graphical perspective that gives the playfield a nice touch of
      depth.


      Unfortunately, there was more about this game that I disliked than liked:

      Your own avatar feels too big and clunky most of the time,

      Because the player sprite is large and allowed to overlap with unclaimed areas
      from claimed areas, you can get killed by enemies in the unclaimed area even
      when you''re not attempting to draw.

      The UI is unrefined and though the game allows a mix of controls, it seems the
      UI doesn''t support the same set.

      I''m not positive how it compares to Qix and other Qix clones, but the pacing
      of the game feels slow and sluggish.

      The star scoring system places too much emphasis on how much extra playfield
      you claimed over the threshold on your winning move. So on more difficult stages,
      you will have to keep replaying even if you win just so you can get that one
      last big reclamation to get enough bonus for the 3rd star. Why not give the
      player more breathing room to claim more playfield after hitting the winning
      threshold (like shortening the timer and speeding up the enemies or something).
      The player is then given ample opportunity for a bonus but with extra risk.


      TLDR; if you love Qix and Qix clones, it''s worth checking out this game for
      a few minutes and a dollar. If you don''t absolutely love those, you should
      probably skip this.'
