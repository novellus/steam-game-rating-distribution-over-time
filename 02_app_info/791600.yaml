    review: "Man, I have very mixed feelings about this game\u2026  On one hand, I\
      \ did find myself enjoying this very tongue-in-cheek adventure about four misguided\
      \ and mostly dimwitted \u201Cfriends\u201D.  On the other, there were SO MANY\
      \ little things that frustrated the hell out of me!  \n\n\t[u][b]Let\u2019s\
      \ start with the good:[/b][/u]\n\t\n\tFor the most part, battles are pretty\
      \ straight forward.  The classes for each character are fairly interchangeable,\
      \ but essentially, you have 3 physical-focused characters and 1 magic-focused\
      \ character.  Honestly, I didn\u2019t notice much of a difference in damage\
      \ output between the 2 (magic and physical), and it was pretty tough to compare,\
      \ due to enemies perma-dying.  Each character can dish out a fair amount of\
      \ damage on their own, and they each have their own form of support spell. \
      \ Even so, they mesh together well enough to make a fairly cohesive unit.  All-in-all,\
      \ not a terrible system, but I\u2019ll leave my nit-picks for later.\n\n\tThe\
      \ story is sold as \u201Clight-hearted, unepic, fun, [and] cynical,\u201D and\
      \ it pretty much hits the mark.  The only real story element that is consistent\
      \ throughout the game is your party is WAY underprepared for what they got themselves\
      \ into.  Other than that, there isn\u2019t too much substance.  The story does\
      \ sort of shift right at the end from \u201Cmonsters have kidnapped our people\u201D\
      \ to \u201Ca demon ordered them to do it to ascend to a more powerful form!\u201D\
      , which was honestly a bit jarring, and not very consistent with the overall\
      \ joke-y tone of the game.  I will quickly point out that there were a few grammatical\
      \ errors, but nothing too terribly distracting.  Not bad enough to put in the\
      \ \u201Cbad\u201D section below, at least.\n\n\tThere is a bit of exploration\
      \ within this short game; enough, at least, to justify the mention of it.  The\
      \ last few quests in the game require a bit of persistence and a bit of attention\
      \ to detail in order to find, but they\u2019re not so far out of the way that\
      \ they would be easily missed.  Most of the rewards later on are the \u201C\
      ultimate weapons\u201D for each of the characters, which do give fairly considerable\
      \ boosts for the final battle.\n\n\t[u][b]Now, for the bad\u2026:[/b][/u]\n\n\
      \tThis first one is a bit silly, but I was bothered by the fact that skills\
      \ that can hit two (or more) times on random targets were able to target already\
      \ dead enemies.  Yes, there are skills that hit more than once, but specifically\
      \ only target one enemy, which I totally understand.  Yet, when you pay a higher\
      \ cost for a skill that is able to \u201Creach\u201D more enemies, why the hell\
      \ does the second or third attack have a chance to hit a target that is clearly\
      \ already dead?  That\u2019s just lazy programming!  This is not a new thing,\
      \ and it should be fairly easy to program into these skills.  Plus, the higher\
      \ costs of these skills make them almost strictly worse than their \u201Csingle-target;\
      \ two-hit\u201D counterparts.  I know this is a small thing, but this aspect\
      \ royally screwed me on more than one occasion.\n\n\tSticking with the \u201C\
      random\u201D theme, DO NOT MAKE FOUND ITEMS RANDOM!!  This is not a rogue-like!\
      \  I was about halfway through the game when I noticed that the gold piles you\
      \ find on the ground would give paltry amounts of gold, which I thought was\
      \ weird.  I wondered if the amounts were random, so I tested it by save-scumming,\
      \ and they were!  The range of what they can give is insane, making them almost\
      \ pointless, unless you want to save and reload until you get a decent drop!\
      \  I wouldn\u2019t have included this, but since all encounters are gone once\
      \ you fight them, it means resources in this game are finite.  Plus, having\
      \ an achievement that encourages you to hoard gold drives the point even further\
      \ that \u201Cgold is rare and precious and should only be spent in an emergency!\u201D\
      \  It sets a REALLY strange and uneasy tone.  Yes, I am aware that there is\
      \ plenty of gold throughout the game, and yes there are plenty of places where\
      \ you can full heal for free, but it\u2019s the effect it creates that makes\
      \ it less fun and more stressful.\n\n\tSpeaking of the full heal spots, why\
      \ in the ever-loving bull nuts would you program it to be random whether or\
      \ not it would work?!  This has [u][b][i]ZERO[/i][/b][/u] effect on gameplay,\
      \ and it just causes players to waste time talking to the same spot over and\
      \ over again until it actually sticks!  Again, this may seem like a minor nit-pick,\
      \ but I thought I had broken the game when it took me 5 or more attempts to\
      \ get a full heal to trigger.  It\u2019s not fun, nor funny.  It\u2019s just\
      \ EXCEPTIONALLY annoying.  Random elements should be something that is (at least\
      \ partially) within the player\u2019s control, and actually has a meaningful\
      \ effect on the game.  OR something that has a small chance to trigger that\
      \ gives a small Easter egg.  This is neither, and is a great example of how\
      \ to annoy your player-base.\n\n\tOne small nit-pick before I get to the last\
      \ big one was the music.  It wasn\u2019t bad (nor was it good), but a lot of\
      \ it was very repetitive and dissonant.  Also, there was no boss music, except\
      \ for the final boss, which was way more epic than it deserved.  Not a terrible\
      \ thing, but just something I thought was noteworthy enough to point out. \n\
      \n\tFinally, why would you taunt the people that payed money for this game by\
      \ not giving ANY reward for a \u201Cmonster-in-the-box\u201D?!?  There are about\
      \ 5 or 6 chests that have fairly hard battles inside, and the rewards range\
      \ from absolutely nothing, to some random healing items!  This is insulting\
      \ and not fun.  The point of these types of fights is to have a \u201CSurprise!\
      \  You\u2019re going to have to earn this treasure!\u201D effect, rather than\
      \ \u201Chahaha, look at how dumb you are for opening this chest, which was just\
      \ a big kick in the nuts!\u201D  It really just discourages exploration, and\
      \ makes the player paranoid.  \u201CWhen was the last time I saved?\u201D  \u201C\
      How healthy is my party?\u201D  \u201CWill I survive [i]opening a treasure chest[/i]?!?!\u201D\
      \  It\u2019s dumb and very poor design.  DO NOT PUNISH PLAYERS FOR EXPLORING\
      \ IN A GAME THAT IS MEANT TO BE EXPLORED!!!!\n\t\n\t[u][b]The Verdict:[/b][/u]\n\
      \n\tEven with my ravings in the \u201Cbad\u201D section, I still think this\
      \ should get a passing grade.  Honestly, even though I was frustrated more than\
      \ I wasn\u2019t, I did have fun clearing everything out and getting all of the\
      \ achievements (which, by the way, are fairly easy, but do take a bit of digging).\
      \  There was a sense of satisfaction going back through older areas, not having\
      \ to worry about getting into battles since I had already taken care of all\
      \ of them.  The upgrades that come with finding all of the best equipment make\
      \ the final boss a joke, but, again, there was still a sense of satisfaction\
      \ after I won. \n \n\tAlthough this game seems like a school project at times,\
      \ it still feels complete, which can\u2019t be said for a lot of RPGMaker games\
      \ out there.  The price is fair, but it is a pretty short game, so it might\
      \ be a twinge high for some people.  Not a bad game albeit a lot of VERY annoying\
      \ issues.  Definitely give it a shot if you looking for something a little less\
      \ serious and still fun."
