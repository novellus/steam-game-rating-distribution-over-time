    review: 'I bought this because it claimed to be WMR compatible.   It is not.   A
      large number of us, based on the forum cannot launch the game.   It crashes
      immediately after the UE4 logo at start OR launches, but without any menu to
      start the game.     Unfortunately,  I can''t get a refund because I waited too
      long for a response on the support forum and it was no longer eligible for a
      refund.  I am still waiting for a response weeks later, as are others.


      Apparently it works well with occulus.  But simply does not work on WMR,  and
      by the developers post responses to others in the past, it sounds like they
      didn''t have a WMR headset to test it,  so they should never, ever have indicated
      it was WMR compatible.


      So if you have an occulus, it might be worth trying.   If not,  you are out
      of luck, and the developer doesn''t appear keen on fixing the problems for WMR
      users.


      So I have to give it a big old thumbs down.   I was scammed.   Would never have
      bought it if they were honest about WMR support.


      This is sad.    I was very much looking forward to playing this.'
