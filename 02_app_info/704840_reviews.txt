Loved the idea and aesthetic. The main let down and the reason why I can't recommend it is the save system. Sure it's a roguelike, but having a system where the player is not able to save his CURRENT run and come back to it later is just plain stupid.","timestamp_created":1608882323,"timestamp_updated":1608882323,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471014469861984253","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44/+2zPYCc4f+vAI="}
