I was gonna try to go buy it. It says \"free\".\nOh well, whatever.\n\nThis game rules! Roguelite shmup. Well executed on both those fronts, imo! Lots of weapon and enemy variety, cute pixel graphics, great metal soundtrack.\n\nGet it!\n\nOne great thing this game has going for it is being able to switch between weapons. So if you get a long-burst long-cooldown weapon, or a very narrow-focus weapon, you aren't entirely stuck with it. You can swap back and forth with your main blaster and it just one more dimension. It's sort of like Ikaruga with their bullet capture/damage mechanic, only a bit more variety and very *slightly* less pain on the decision making. IMO it keeps you slightly more in flow, and requires less fore-knowledge of the level. The end result is you get to experience a lot of the weapon variety that you wouldn't in other SHMUPS due to the weapons being very special-purpose.","timestamp_created":1581889687,"timestamp_updated":1581890532,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqr6BqPACecDg8gE="}
