It's easy to pick up and a great way to unwind. Plus it can get really difficult but in a good way, the learning curve isn't super steep, and it's satisfying. The graphics are crisp and bright, very visually appealing. For the price this game is awesome.","timestamp_created":1581203019,"timestamp_updated":1581203078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566666662693023682","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt4fDk/ACfdWE8QE="}
