Exploiting the replayability aspect of a roguelite sounded great on paper. But the first impression is very mixed.\n\nWhen playing a roguelite, you generally expect  a bit of diversity in the runs and the possibility of using various strategies in function of whatever powers you can unlock within runs or in-between runs. There is literally zero variety here and the levels are chained in the same sequence, like in any traditional shmup, withouth variability. And no strategy either. The friends' powers don't really bring anything else than \"more power\" or \"more health regen\" to your gameplay.\n\nYou can unlock some non-gameplay elements in the form of dialogs between your party members which, if you unlock all of them, give you access to the real ending. This sounded like a good idea, unfortunately the dialogs here are a bit cringe and amateurish at first sight, with grammatical errors.\n\nUnlocking the good ending seems definitely not worth the dozens of playthroughs it requires. Or is it?\n\nDespite all that, the shmup part is pretty good, in fact even better than a lot of indie shmups, even though the presentation is very modest and un-spectacular. So you'll probably accept to replay it a couple times before shelving the game. \n\nThen you might get used to the dialogs and realize that the repetitivity of the run kinda work on the long time. Especially when each run becomes easier and easier with supplementary unlocks.\nYou can enter a \"zone\" and play it like solitaire as a way to pass time or empty your mind.\nSo if you play it in that way, the \"roguelite\" aspect is okay and works pretty well. Pretty much the same as a \"clicker game\", which is the devs' original specialization. \nIn the later half of the game you unlock enough ships and powers for some nice interactions to start happen in your play-style.\n\nSo it's cheap and even cheaper on a sale and even as just a one-time shmup it's extremely correct with coherent graphics and good gameplay, so why not?\n\n[h1](follow my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url] for more retro and indie reviews)[/h1]","timestamp_created":1608569649,"timestamp_updated":1609092833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47oPa0vYCfq/9uwI="}
