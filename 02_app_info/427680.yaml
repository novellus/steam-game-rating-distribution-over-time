    about_the_game: "Pokkle and Pipiro are two step-siblings living by themselves\
      \ in the ho-hum village of Puck on the time-forgotten floating continent of\
      \ Arges. Pokkle loves making terrible puns and wears a tail for funsies, and\
      \ Pipiro loves buying fashionable clothes and has no filter whatsoever. Together,\
      \ they meander through what seems to be a peaceful, monotonous existence in\
      \ their sleepy little burg where nothing interesting ever happens.<br><br>Until\
      \ something does, anyway! A mysterious masked figure shows up one night and\
      \ steals six holy idols from the local shrine. The self-proclaimed \u201CArchduke\
      \ of Arges\u201D tenders a hefty reward for their return, and our \u201Cbrave\u201D\
      \ duo jumps at the chance to go find them \u2013 Pokkle for the glory, and Pipiro\
      \ strictly for the cash moneys.<br><br>Their journey will take them to every\

      \ screwed?<br><br>Released in Japan simply as <i>Zwei!!</i>, <i>Zwei: The Arges\

    review: Absolutely recommended. the game has a rough start, depending on how you
      use the starting money, and how much you could adapt to its weird combat physics.
      Like Pokkle's dashing attack, or Pipiro's slow magical attack. but once you
      get the hang of the combat and the gameplay loops and more magics for Pipiro,
      you'll find a delightful dungeon crawler that is filled with fun dungeons and
      engaging combat which adds up to an addicting gameplay. Coupled with gorgeous
      soundtracks, great worldbuilding, hilarious characters and dialogues, and you've
      got a fun-filled experience of a game. The game has shown its age by the lack
      of QoLs that results in a lot of backtracking, there's also a certain order
      you have to go through these dungeons that the game does not tell you. But if
      you're okay with that, then you'll have plenty of fun. Good game, play it.
