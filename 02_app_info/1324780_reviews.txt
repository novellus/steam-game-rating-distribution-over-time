Being Early Access, there isn't all that much to play yet but it's coming along. The graphics are not overwhelming but OK for the price. One thing that takes some getting used to is that the controls differ slightly from most FPSs.\n\nDefinitely worth it for anyone who wants to relive the classic Battlefield Series or is looking for a nice FPS to play in between.","timestamp_created":1610159774,"timestamp_updated":1610159774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwk4vA8vYCdpPZwQI="}
