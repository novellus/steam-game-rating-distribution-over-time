You can tell it's not your typical pixelated VR game.\nIt's very hard to even score in this game and the bouncing could be a lot better.\n\nThat having said I spent a good few minutes playing this game! Sadly it's not something you could play for hours. However if it would be possible to make this game multiplayer? In the sense that friends of yours can join in and have fun. I wasn't exactly talking about random online people. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game. Definitely worth a try!\n\n8/10 + 0.1 for being a free game.","timestamp_created":1488210895,"timestamp_updated":1488210895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950523376464844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iYSSwNoCeIWlcw=="}
