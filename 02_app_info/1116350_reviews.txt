The character's movement are buggy. No chance to dodge counter and so on. Keep on smashing the attack button. No way to counter enemies. Great potential poorly executed.

Please don't say sorry. We are the ones who have to say sorry. \n\nSorry for the game don't meet your expectations.\n\nWe got a lot of feedback on the lack of tutorials and that cause people don't know how to play. We are working on that and also, improve some of the control to make it more easy to play.\n\nAt the current state, we have a counter-attack and we are working on dodging, and other active skills.\n\n\nIf you don't mind. We would like to keep in touch and when we think the game can meet your expectations. We would like to offer you a Steam Key to come back and try it again. \n\nThank you so much.\n"}],"cursor":"AoJ4tf/EtvACc4/x8wE="}
