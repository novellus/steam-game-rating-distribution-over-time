I felt like you were going to be more of an economy and travel focused game with a merchant focus. You weren't really that. I'm not sure what you were. I've had better random side quests and side mechanics in other games that do the same thing you do, but better. The fact you tried to make a game centered around something, and then didn't centre it around that, and in fact centred it around seemingly nothing, is impressive. But you don't get points for bad game design. Sorry lads. 3/10.\n","timestamp_created":1609347415,"timestamp_updated":1609347415,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498633891344070435","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vZel2vYCe5bqvgI="}
