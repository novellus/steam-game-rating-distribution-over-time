The dash is NOT a single input, and you can micro it technically, which leads to some cool and wonky plays. I would love to see a TAS. \nI must say, this game is addicting to run. It's a fun platformer! It's cute as fuck too, omg. So cute. Get on sale if you enjoy platformers","timestamp_created":1609197102,"timestamp_updated":1609197102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu+Tn1fYCecehvgI="}
