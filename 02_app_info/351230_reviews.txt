You can play with friends with shared experience and have a lot of fun exploring a world that is absolutely packed full of content! The game has several modes, but I have only gone through the regular quest so far. \n\nThe enemies are brilliantly designed, and they each have a unique fighting style that I think added a lot to the overall experience. The combat is so enjoyable that I found myself seeking out battles wherever I could find them!\n\nIt has a LOT in common with old PC immersive sims like Thief, giving the game a very nostalgic feel. \n\nIt is not grindy whatsoever. Enemy levels do suggest a sequence of events, but in no way are you ever blocked off with a hard wall you cannot cross. It's always possible to sneak into high-leveled areas and grab some cool loot. \n\nIf you are someone who dislikes the path that games have been going down in recent years and wish that you could go back to when games were less grindy and restrictive, and allowed you to freely explore and enjoy the world at your own pace, then be sure to give this one a try! If you like this sort of game, you will sink in 6 hours at the absolute minimum if you do not try any other modes and you complete it quickly.\n\nThe way this game deals with resources is also brilliant. It reminds me a lot of Resident Evil, in the sense that I only ever had exactly how much was needed to make it through each given area. You can return to old areas and find useful items if necessary, but returning to old locations is not required.\n\nNOTE: This game does not have a dialogue system or detailed quest lines. It's more about combat and battling your way through areas and dungeons.","timestamp_created":1608620346,"timestamp_updated":1608620668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxu7QxPYCcdSOvAI="}
