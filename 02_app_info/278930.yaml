    review: "It may look like it, and it's partly why I tried this game being a fan\
      \ of all things Mecha - but it's no Front Mission: Gun Hazard or Cybernator\
      \ from the SNES era sadly, not even close.\n\nFor some reason, whether through\
      \ nostalgia or otherwise, people believe that games in the 90's were flawless\
      \ (some were, don't get me wrong).\nWhat I mean by that is the 'retro' graphics,\
      \ the way a story was delivered, gameplay, how health was managed, continue\
      \ screens etc.\nThere's a reason we organically moved on - games matured, quality\
      \ of life features were added (ability to save progress via codes or resume\
      \ a chapter) and some things altogether dropped (removed time limits on levels).\n\
      \nMaking a game in 2014 'play' like it was made in the 90's right down to the\
      \ things that irk a player is a questionable direction to take.\nNo doubt retaining\
      \ some aspects of that era can be amazing, such as pixel art, chiptune music,\
      \ but not enough of either stands out in Gigantic Army.\n\n[b]For a time attack\
      \ game, movement is unnecessarily heavy and slow.[/b] The forward dash is very\
      \ short with no dedicated button to just blast forward and the hover ability\
      \ is also limited and takes forever to recharge. It's a time attack game but\
      \ you're hopping on one leg trying to get to the finish line located on the\
      \ other side of a mountain. \n\nI don't mind time limits in games, but you never\
      \ ran out of it in Metal Slug and you probably didn't even notice it there in\
      \ the first place. Yet in Gigantic Army it's ever present, with pickups designed\
      \ to extend it by 1 or 5 second intervals, why?\n\n[hr]\nThat all aside, if\
      \ you can accept that it's a time/score attack platformer with little to no\
      \ mech customisation that looks like a SNES game and plays a little rough then\
      \ by all means give it a shot. \n\nI eventually found my groove and enjoyed\
      \ replaying levels a little to try and get through with little to no damage\
      \ and take down bosses faster, but there's little else to actually do and there's\
      \ no actual incentive either. There is a storyline there somewhere and that's\
      \ probably the games strongest part - you read text off a data tablet between\
      \ each level so... I guess your imagination fills in the details?\n\nI'd give\
      \ this a Neutral if it were possible, however there's not enough in this game\
      \ to recommend. \nHave a look at the total hours played for most reviewers and\
      \ you'll find there's a reason most are only 2 hours on average.\n\nAt least\
      \ the Nintendo Switch version looks a good deal better than it does here. Though\
      \ it was made by another company and a shame it didn't not make its way onto\
      \ steam to replace this version."
