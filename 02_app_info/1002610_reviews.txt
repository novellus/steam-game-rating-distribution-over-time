It takes roughly an hour to complete if you're hoping to achieve all endings to get all achievements and has two additional short stories in the Gallery that tell after stories from the Good Ending. There are sexual scenes in the main story as well as in both of the short stories between the two women and the art is fairly competent. This is very clearly not a major work done by a well-off industry but seems like a passion project of a small handful of people if not potentially just one inspired person.\n\nThere are some issues with the game that I encountered, such as the alleged minigame never starting for me and just giving a failure message if even attempting the minigame, on one occasion my screen went black and I had to restart the game, and I had a crash on another instance. These issues seem to become more likely the longer a single play session goes on for and can really sour the experience as a whole.\n\nThat being said, these issues happened once each for me and while they were enough to make me sigh, I think these issues are bound to happen for a small creator. Given the cheap price tag (I bought it for a dollar on sale), I think it's unreasonable to expect an indie team or person to be able to master the tools that they work with and I applaud the effort they have made. I hope they take the negative criticism they have received and use it to booster their own skills later on and I hope to see more work from them.\n\nGiven the plentiful bugs, I suggest grabbing this title on sale like I did. It isn't going to be your favorite visual novel but it's a fairly unique setting they've placed the story in and it's something different to go into.","timestamp_created":1609715940,"timestamp_updated":1609715940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqv+i5fYCfZmdwAI="}
