No explanations whatsoever, everything seems unfinished. After some mindless boring fighting without any introduction a wizard asks me to follow him, had no idea how. After pressing random buttons I suddenly was somewhere else and couldn't figure out what do to.\n\nTried for 15 minutes, complete waste of time in this state. I don't care if it's developed by one guy only, provide some basic explanations on what we're supposed to do!","timestamp_created":1558957501,"timestamp_updated":1558957501,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.447761178016662598","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1559394125,"developer_response":"Good day to you!
