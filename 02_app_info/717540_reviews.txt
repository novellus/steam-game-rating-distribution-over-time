The one-button playstyle, levels that bounce you, and the rail which gives you a chance to get back into the scrap leads to amazing moments of insanity.\n\nThe easy to learn, hard to master controls are perfect for multiplayer matches. New singleplayer thangs on the way, too, so if you play alone you'll be covered.","timestamp_created":1513287166,"timestamp_updated":1513287166,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwg7W8q+ACc5eSkgE="}
