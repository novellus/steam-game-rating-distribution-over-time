Fair enough, but there isn't anything currently on the website to indicate that is the case. I guess there's a news article third down.\n\nEven if that's so, the gameplay videos and screenshots do not match in game at all.\n-I have no 'Captain' ship. There are no 'turns'. You have control over the buildings but nothing you build to defend your colony do anything but move from one building to another, never to be seen again. I played for a half hour to see if like...maybe I didn't know what I was doing? I'm not dumb. Other than clicking buildings and pressing buttons (that cut off numbers and words in the tooltips), you can control placement. There's no menus like in the video. You launch, choose a ship you never see, and then you can place five buildings and upgrade them and watch them be destroyed without being able to do anything about it. \n\nI mean I'm happy to be wrong but...there probably should be some kind of 'Early Access' or shots that match the current state of the game. The only thing it MIGHT be is a rogue-like...but not one you're going to feel good about because it's about as inevitable as an hourglass.\n\nI hope the Dev continues to work on it. Could be an amusing sidebar. Now it's pong with highlightable objects.","timestamp_created":1512508171,"timestamp_updated":1512508171,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54703831672668457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r+SglOACc5KmkQE="}
