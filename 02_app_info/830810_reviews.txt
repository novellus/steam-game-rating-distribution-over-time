I had skipped over this assuming it would be in the actual game.\n- The campaign is roughly 3 minutes of holding \"a\" or \"d\" for 10 seconds each level until it says you've won and moves onto the next.\n- Dying first, although advertised as the goal makes no difference to whether or not you win or lose. You win if you die, essentially.\n\nThe campaign levels are a snoozefest, but I can see how it would entice somebody to want to create their own levels. The controls are unintuitive and frustrating - I recommend taking a peek at the youtube video in the Dev's response as it provides much needed clarity.\n\nThis game has potential based around its level creator. If you enjoy a more \"lemmings\" type level creator where the only goal is to kill a bunch of guys as interestingly as possible you may enjoy this game.","timestamp_created":1575949173,"timestamp_updated":1577441998,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554418206214904785","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1579388658,"developer_response":"Hi, thanks for reviewing! There are all very valid concerns, but I'd thought I'd jump in and try to help anyway.\n\nThere *is* a level editor tutorial. On the first launch, the game will ask you if you'd like to watch it. It appears you've missed that somehow, so here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWZi8oisDDI&feature=youtu.be\n\nI'd like to change some things so this is more obvious, so that's a big woops on my part.\n\nAdditionally, when you launch the game, it starts with a \"game configuration\" window. You are able to view, and change key bindings there. I would like to do key bindings in the actual game, but the engine I use makes things quite complicated.\n\nTake care!\n\nEDIT: I've now patched the game so you can view the tutorial at anytime."}],"cursor":"AoJwy9a3o+8Cd6eo4wE="}
