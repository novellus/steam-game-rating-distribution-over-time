      further enhance the fun.<h2 class="bb_tag">Hard Mode</h2>Can you go through
      all the stages with just one life and all the powers at the very least? Come
      and test your skills in this mode.<h2 class="bb_tag">Passwords</h2>Died and
      want to continue where you left off? Use the passwords that the game gives you
      to resume your game from the point where you stopped, or to release special
      functions in the game.<h2 class="bb_tag">Creation of the game</h2>The whole
      game was made by one person, nothing easy. Just a lot of hard work and dedication.<br>Made
      in Brazil.
