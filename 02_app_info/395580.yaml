    review: "I don't recommend this on STEAM. As it is, the game is a pretty fun goldberg\
      \ machine type puzzle game thing. But it is also a very lazy port from mobile.\
      \ It's pretty much the exact same game as mobile but you are paying double for\
      \ it. There's no optimization for the swap to mouse and keyboard so everything\
      \ feels a bit clunky since they were meant for touch and drag. \n\nOptions:\
      \ almost non-existent, you can reset the game and turn music on and off. Sound\
      \ effects stay on no matter what and you have to use the windows shortcut to\
      \ get it out of fullscreen which is annoying.\n\nThe game itself: Standard,\
      \ not really a new concept. It works fairly well for the most part and is really\
      \ adorable. Puzzles start off simple and as you progress more stuff gets thrown\
      \ into the mix and makes things more complicated. \"Multiplayer\" is useless.\
      \ It's not so much multiplayer as a level creator and sharing levels. The issue\
      \ is it lacks an actual workshop, the only way to play other people's levels\
      \ is to add them into your in-game friends making the level creator worthless\
      \ if you don't have friends playing this on their pcs or phones. \n\nConclusions:\
      \ I like the game honestly but get it on mobile, or at least try it on mobile\
      \ because you get the first 14 levels for free. I don't really feel like paying\
      \ double for a lazy port on pc is worth it at all."
