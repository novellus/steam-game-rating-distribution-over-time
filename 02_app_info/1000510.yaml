    review: "Here's what my thoughts think, what a load of garbage!!!  \n\nIt starts\
      \ OK,  you're at least moving along the track for a few seconds whilst the woman\
      \ talks about your mind.\n\nThen you come to the cogs, the ride stops, the woman\
      \ talks for what seemed like 10 minutes talking about how to look at things.\n\
      \nThen it moves again, decides to speed up like it's trying to be a roller coaster\
      \ for just a few seconds.\n\nIt's like they didn't know what they wanted this\
      \ to be.  \n\nThey should have made it a full on rollercoaster, not an explore\
      \ your mind thing where the ride is sat still more than it moves.  I could have\
      \ been more forgiving had the ride kept moving along, but no, you're stopped\
      \ for ages staring at cogs in wall.\n\nThe environment's decent, so it should\
      \ using the unreal engine.  \n\nSo my thoughts of the past are... I shouldn't\
      \ have wasted my money on this, that's a negative thought but it's not a thought\
      \ I'm going to forget.\n\nAvoid unless it's goes free, even then you'll die\
      \ of boredom."
