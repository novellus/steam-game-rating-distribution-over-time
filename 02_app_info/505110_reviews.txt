It's essentially an action strategy game, with more emphasis on the strategy component than the action arcade games that inspired it, eg Pac-Man.\n\nYou can play in either God (top-down view) Mode or First-Person mode and each presents a fun and challenging take on the game. Levels consist of an arena filled with ghosts; you explore and subsequently re-murder the ghosts in order to win. Simple concept and solid execution. \n\nIcing on the cake is that it comes with a level editor. All told, this is a cheap and fun addition to your VR collection. Even if you're not personally into it, it helps round out your VR collection for when you have friends who wanna try different things.","timestamp_created":1544313030,"timestamp_updated":1544313030,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550000011920928955","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw19iOyOcCdcbptAE="}
