Fun indie rpg that's definitely not as easy as it seems at first.\n\nClean graphics style & creatures that are punishingly fast. Already died a good few times but that's just solidified my resolve to beat it.\n\nFinally realized i could press I to pause the fighting & heal myself which has helped me move forward. The grind is real... but quick & straightforward.","timestamp_created":1528515308,"timestamp_updated":1528515308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499875366687774658","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnpWn8eMCcPC8ogE="}
