    review: "Pros: I enjoyed the idea this game had; viewing the struggle of this\
      \ town under a dystopian dictatorship and watching it unravel as a bird simply\
      \ looking for material. I think the art style really suits the game, the music\
      \ is pretty relaxing. This game can be pretty relaxing when you are flying high\
      \ in the sky and looking down on the village below. I wasn't a fan of some of\
      \ the voice acting but I can see the love that went into the story writing through\
      \ the dialogue so that was cool. There is a pretty good attention to detail\
      \ in populated areas of the map. The bird player model is really well made and\
      \ thought out- the bird's feathers actually act aerodynamically and mimic real\
      \ bird flight. I thought that was pretty cool. \n\nCons: I kept trying to give\
      \ this game chances and kept being disappointed. I spent about 30 minutes trying\
      \ to fix a graphical bug that was tied to the render distance in the game  (the\
      \ most pivotal part of the game play). This game is poorly optimized (I have\
      \ a pretty hefty pc that can handle pretty much anything) and had lag. There\
      \ were bugs with the waterfalls and the controls are horrific. I switched to\
      \ a controller and still had issues. Your bird pulls wherever it wants at times;\
      \ this made focusing on the game a little hard as it changed from a story based\
      \ experience to surgeon simulator with wings. \n\nOverall: I don't agree with\
      \ this game being released with such game mechanic breaking bugs (the render\
      \ distance glitch i had). BUT I do think this game is worth the money I spent\
      \ on it (I got it on sale for less than 2 dollars). I wanted to like it so much\
      \ more. I think if this game was fixed and a bit more polished, they could've\
      \ expanded on it a lot and made something compelling and powerful. This game\
      \ has such a unique way of presenting information to the consumer; but it feels\
      \ half finished- especially at the end."
