It might've been interesting if stapled to its successor, [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/752780]W4RR-i/o-RS: Descent[/url][/i], as an additional mode that integrated with the gameplay in that game. But here it is, exactly as the Store description states: a nearly zero-player game that almost plays itself. This is not some secret game hiding behind a bland listing. It is exactly what it says on the tin.\n\nI did end up pasting hundreds of commands (with line breaks) into the terminal window and watching the list of Warriors live, fight, advance, and die. It's certainly a way to quickly demonstrate to oneself how easily the human mind can spin a narrative from the output of a weighted random number generator (to borrow from xkcd #904). But once I got all of the achievements, I immediately uninstalled this game.\n\nDon't bother with it.","timestamp_created":1571051129,"timestamp_updated":1571220051,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5395241379737854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w+qA6u0CcI+M1AE="}
