In fact it's essential. Unfortunately there is little else of note here. Sorry.\n\nIf you find the game on sale and the battle mechanic interests you then it may be worth a purchase, but as much as I hate to put down a developers hard work, I recommend you do not pay full price for it.\n\nI enjoyed micro-managing and rewinding my two-warrior party during battles, but things rarely get more complex than dodging and counter-attacking or exploding barrels from a distance. I can see why they limited parties to two - it would be too much to micro-manage a larger group of warriors.\n\nSkills are the usual fire/ice/heal magic type stuff, the very linear story is mostly uninteresting and the dialogue isn't great. Don't expect to get a choice of responses, there is no branching conversation tree, you're a passenger story-wise and I quite often found myself grinding my teeth at the heroines \"Reluctant hero\" shtick which went on for too long - I just didn't feel invested in the character at all.\n\nThe game is largely a series of missions strung together with two to three small maps per mission including a dungeon, there is little variety to the assets so each island/dungeon looks largely the same. There is no loot beyond picking up inflammable things you can throw at enemies.\n\nThe game saves automatically between each map (There is no manual save here). At the end of each mission you may upgrade one skill for one hero in your party (The game decides who), there are no accumulated \"Upgrade points\" to spend. Upgrades are pretty much along the lines of 'Small fireball', 'Bigger fireball', 'Biggest fireball'. Fire does spread if you hit something inflammable which is a nice thing to factor into your battle tactics, but it's not a new concept and there is an awful lot of inflammable foliage on an island and some tight enclosed spaces, so you do have to be extremely careful setting light to things.\n\nAfter each mission there might be a little dialogue to progress the story, then it's on to the next mission/set of maps. Do not expect a world map, side quests, things to click on, conversations with NPC's, loot, weapons and armour shops, deep conversation trees or other complex systems. They are not here.\n\nI will say that there's the bare bones of something which could have been great given enough time, resource and budget. Unfortunately what we have is merely an OK diversion. Maybe if there's an Iron Danger 2?\n\nPros:\n* Interesting 'Rewind' battle mechanic\n* Nice graphics\n* Nice music\nCons:\n* The 'Rewind' battle mechanic becomes repetitive\n* Complete absence of many of the systems I consider essential to an RPG/ARPG\n* No depth to the systems that are there\n* Uninspired skills and progression of those skills\n* Uninteresting linear story","timestamp_created":1609557413,"timestamp_updated":1609689832,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557739555835723877","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpLO/5PYCetfMvwI="}
