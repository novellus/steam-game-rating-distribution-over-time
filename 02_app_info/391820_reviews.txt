I appreciate that the dialog was spiced up with many humorous bits.  \nI enjoyed running the primordial soup simulation to see what randomly evolved and all of the related achievements popped before I got bored.  Because the organisms are generated randomly, I found it oddly challenging to keep the larger life forms alive while single-celled organisms proliferated like crazy on their own.  I did eventually get a useful larger organism with which I could mop up those little single-celled nuisances.  \n\nSome advice to achievement hunters struggling with Outbreak mode.  Upgrades help a lot, collecting DNA increases weapon effectiveness against that organism, and each organism's behavior is completely different from the next.  They do not all charge / attack the player's ship!  \nGetting the last achievement on the outbreak mode took me ten hours, and certainly not all in one sitting.  This process became much more interesting when I read the author's store description and learned I was fighting other users' best organisms.  Also, early survival is greatly aided by knowing that the ship's wake of bubbles pushes organisms away.  \nWhen I was really stuck, I just waited until most of the organisms starved because only a rare few organisms would actually eat nearby food.  I am going to pretend this was an intentional strategy on my part, and not a consequence of trying to milk organisms for upgrades.","timestamp_created":1596182351,"timestamp_updated":1596182351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ybn40fMCc7fJmAI="}
