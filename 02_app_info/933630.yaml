    review: i admit I enjoyed the game when I first tried it, but a complete lack
      of support and updates after a couple of years, make me understand that teh
      devs have abandoned the game. Anyone who reads this I recommend you not to purchase
      and stay away even if the devs start communicating because that is not proof
      that they will actually do something and bettwe send you money on games like
      Oriental Empires
