    review: "I sincerely hate posting negative reviews, however this game lacks almost\
      \ any positives. There's only three positives I can give this game:\n\n1. Nice\
      \ soundtrack.\n2. Trigger free.\n3. Good for all ages.\n\nSo now here's the\
      \ reason I have to give this an overall negative review:\n\n1. Monotonous gameplay\
      \ lacking any incentive to keep playing.\n2. Only 3 minutes per day, meaning\
      \ you don't have time to accomplish much.\n3. Lack of interest.\n4. Doesn't\
      \ entertain or make you feel anything other than boredom.\n\nOverall, this isn't\
      \ worth any price, except maybe \xA30.00"
