    review: 'be threatened by growing crises is a fascinating game, though this kind
      of thing probably only works once, I imagine. let''s be honest: the game is
      a $12.99 scam asset flip of one of those generic 3D FPS game makers that were
      really popular in the mid-2000s. your aim is sluggish and unresponsive, partially
      due to the game constantly stuttering and partially due to the game feeling
      like it was designed for touch controls and hacked apart to allow for mouse
      aim. the title isn''t untrue: you are indeed threatened by growing crises, whether
      it be the increasing difficulty of encounters with the insidious enemy, the
      constantly lowering framerate and inability to aim, or the memory leak threatening
      to crash the game the longer you play it. at one point approaching a gate makes
      loud train sounds play and it''s absolutely terrifying, because like ten seconds
      later a rocket launcher wielding insurgent leaps through the air towards you,
      likely killing you instantly the first time. this never happens again but it
      always feels like it could. every encounter has this kind of tension; you''re
      always struggling with the controls or lack of ammunition or the mostly-useless
      arsenal and the enemy are always more numerous or more competent than you. the
      final area in particular is full of way more enemies than you''ve ever had to
      fight at once before and is probably designed that way to pad out playtime to
      prevent refunds. interesting but probably not on purpose.'
