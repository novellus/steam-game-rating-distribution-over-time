The team acted quickly and resolved the issue. Thatâ€™s just about the only thing a user can ask for from a dev. So thumbs up! Will play lots!\n\n\n\nTried to load the game up and there's nothing under \"Room Code.\" Hyped this game up to friends and got embarrassed when I couldn't play. Plus the steam forum thread on the issue doesn't have any response from the Dev, and the Dev twitter hasn't been active since March of 2020. \n\nTroubleshooting: double checked modem and router settings, no problems there. Hosted other online games via steam, also no issue. \n\nIDK if their servers are overwhelmed or what but it was a huge let down, especially after a host of online marketing campaigns involving streamers and youtubers I trust.","timestamp_created":1609211058,"timestamp_updated":1609387690,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609342360,"developer_response":"Hi Clintown, thank you for letting us know about this. We did not see this issue on our end before release, but some other players are reporting it too - so we have rolled back to before the Winter Holiday update temporarily to ensure all players can play. We should have a proper fix next week.\n\nThank you again for letting us know, and apologies for not catching this sooner. We really appreciate you giving the game a chance!"}],"cursor":"AoJwgem+2/YCeaqovgI="}
