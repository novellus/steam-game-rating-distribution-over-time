    review: 'It`s a 2010 game and, honestly speaking from today, part of the game
      sucks. Mainly due to the extreme difficulty, as it`s literally impossible to
      achieve certain things unless you are REALLY patient or, should I put it, lacks
      anything better to do. And in some cases, that`s not enough. You HAVE TO be
      directly hinted by the authors themselves before you end up wondering whether
      the game is designed to be beatable.


      But that`s also to say, the rest of the game is GREAT. If you take it more as
      an artbook than a mere game, you`ll be surely fascinated. The authors are, so
      far as I`ve seen, one of the best artists, aesthetically speaking. So long as
      you`re not in a hurry to "beat" the game, instead just view it as an amazing
      sightseeing into the world they created, it`s not only great. It`s FANTSATIC.


      My first hearing of the game was at some shabby online minigame site around
      10 years ago. I played its incorrectly named demo, and immediately got fascinated.
      At that time online payment was way undeveloped, and I had to send an international
      bill to purchase, so I did. That`s how I first got the game. The time I spent
      on this game should be able to match that of a 3A work like Witcher III, and
      I`ve satisfyingly achieved all 60 endings. That`s really a painful grind, but
      also a nice and wonderful view into this world the authors created.


      This time, I`d like to once more support the authors via Steam. Thank you for
      the game, and hopefully, just make more and better games!'
