    about_the_game: "<strong>King under the Mountain</strong> is a simulation-based\
      \ settlement-building strategy game set in a fantasy world. <br><br>The game\
      \ is based around these central pillars:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>A\
      \ simulated world</strong> \u2013 The game world is built on a series of interlocking\
      \ systems which combine together to simulate a living, breathing world. As night\
      \ changes to day, trees and plants will grow (or not) based on sunlight and\
      \ rainfall. The local environment and changing seasons have effects on the native\
      \ flora and fauna. Your settlers and other characters have their own personal\
      \ social and physical needs that you\u2019ll have to fulfil to keep them happy\
      \ (or at least stop them from breaking and going insane!)<br></li><li><strong>Procedural\
      \ generation</strong> \u2013 Every map is randomly generated from an initial\
      \ seed (a large number) so that no two maps will ever be the same \u2013 unless\
      \ you choose to use the same seed! The art assets for the game have been created\
      \ in such a way that they can be drawn by the game engine for near limitless\
      \ variation in colour \u2013 so every tree, plant and character will have their\
      \ own unique combination of colours and appearance.<br></li><li><strong>Peaceful\
      \ expansion</strong> \u2013 It\u2019s an important design goal that it\u2019\
      s possible to play the entire game without getting into armed conflict with\
      \ other factions (if you choose to). Although weapons and combat can be significant\
      \ parts of gameplay, we wanted to make sure you can peacefully build up a fully-functioning\
      \ town to have the satisfaction of sitting back and watching your settlers go\
      \ about their business in an \u201Cart farm\u201D style of play.<br></li><li><strong>Multiple\
      \ ways to play</strong> \u2013 As well as different ways to build and grow your\
      \ settlement (do you focus on mining? farming? crafting? buying and selling\
      \ goods?), in King under the Mountain you can play as several different races\
      \ and factions each with their own unique gameplay elements. You could build\
      \ a dwarven fortress dug deep into the side of a mountain, a town of humans\
      \ at an important river crossing, or a tribe of orcs hunting and raiding others.\
      \ More than just different races to play as, we want to introduce completely\
      \ new play styles as unusual factions \u2013 perhaps a lone wizard building\
      \ their secret lair with golems they have constructed, an evil necromancer raising\
      \ an army of the dead, a dragon amassing a hoard of gold in a giant cave system,\
      \ or even an invasion of demons attacking the material world.<br></li><li><strong>Player-driven\
      \ content</strong> \u2013 Have you ever spent hours in a creative game building\
      \ something, only for it to sit hidden away on your computer? In King under\
      \ the Mountain, players can opt-in to automatically upload their settlements\
      \ for other players to visit. This drives the basis of the adventure mode \u2013\
      \ you put together a party of champions from your settlement\u2019s population,\
      \ and go off on an adventure to explore another player\u2019s creation. This\
      \ mode will involve turn-based tactical combat as you explore and battle through\
      \ another player\u2019s fortress, claiming rare resources that may be difficult\
      \ or impossible to acquire otherwise. It\u2019s important to note that nothing\
      \ will be lost by either player in this encounter \u2013 you don\u2019t actually\
