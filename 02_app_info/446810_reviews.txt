Most of the time, the gameplay is satisfying, but other times it can feel tiresome. The game is very linear to the point that the \"dungeons\" are mostly just long gauntlet corridors with only a few branching rooms. It's not like in Zelda games where the dungeons are vast, interconnected, and require going between rooms to solve puzzles. In Blossom Tales, its basically a straight shot from the beginning of a dungeon to the end.\n\nOne negative I have with this game is its lack of puzzle variety and the fact that the puzzles that do exist are straight forward. As previously mentioned, dungeons are mostly just big hallways full of enemies. There are six types of puzzles you will encounter:\n1) kill all the enemies in a room\n2) a path puzzle (touch all the tiles)\n3) a block pushing puzzle (push the blocks onto the tiles)\n4) hit a switch and move on.\n5) Memorization puzzle (hit stones in the correct pattern)\n6) code puzzle (correct symbols on blocks)\n\nOccasionally you will find a locked door in a dungeon, but you always just have to go into a single room to the side to get the key. There isn't any path-finding logic that you would expect from a Zelda-like. I think that is the biggest negative overall for me - the game tries to be Zelda, but ends up coming short.\n\nAlso, the game is NOT open world - it is very linear.\n\nThat being said, the game is not terrible. I recommend this game to people who enjoy action-adventure games,  but do not have a history of playing a lot of Zelda games. If a veteran Zelda player plays this game, it will probably end up feeling a bit mediocre.","timestamp_created":1609886650,"timestamp_updated":1609886650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6Zmu6vYCfeHrwAI="}
