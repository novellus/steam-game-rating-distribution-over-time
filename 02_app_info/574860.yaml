    review: 'Pale Moon Crisis is a side-scrolling game which was initially hentai-game,
      I suppose. However, there is No hentai content in the current Steam version
      but a few not really hot bikini pictures. I''ve tried to look for the "original",
      but it seems to be unavailable at the current moment.


      So, now it is a short wanna-be survival horror game: you basically landed in
      some mystic mansion, filled with monsters and closed doors. You need to check
      for some hidden boxes, find the keys to unlock the doors and solve some puzzles,
      fight some melee monsters with the pistol or the old-school knife, and eventually
      get away from the mansion. To speed up the player, a satiety scale is introduced
      into the game, which basically acts as a timer counting down the time until
      the end of the game. The average gameplay time is about 1-2 hours (and most
      of that time you''ll be figuring the locks and keys).


      The visuals ain''t all bad, the looped music track (or there were two?) and
      sounds ain''t all bad either. However, it is all not good enough for the 5$
      tag. The only reason to buy the game is the usual two bad things combination:
      easy "complete" with achievements, and steam cards, which seems to be overvalued
      at the market at moment. All that shady overpricing about profile backgrounds
      with the girl in underwear... Sex sells, right?


      Well, I can''t recommend the game for being that low and miserable. Even if
      I actually like some of the arts and parts of gameplay there, I''d rather bought
      some book with my dollar. My mark for "PMC" is 4.5/10. If you''re not into shady
      steam market deals with over-evaluated cards, don''t bother.'
