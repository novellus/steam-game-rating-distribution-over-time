The game takes place on a train after the main characters death. You can walk around the train, you can talk to people, you can look out the window. \n\nEventually you are able to remember some things that happened while you were still alive. The key to playing this game seems to be to remember these memories in a particular order with no clues that I could find on how to do that. These memories are also way less interesting than what's going on aboard the ghost train. Also apparently I looked out the window one too many times and got sent to hell. So yeah, not playing this thing again.","timestamp_created":1592394316,"timestamp_updated":1592394537,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gouH4fICedvJjgI="}
