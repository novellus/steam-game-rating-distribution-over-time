The controls, while simple in mechanics, were hard as hell to use in practice to actually shoot the planes. The enviorment is pretty barebones too.\n\nI made a gameplay video with the basic experience I got from the game:\nhttps://youtu.be/B1GQGivDpHs\n\nIf this is your first game, don't give up. It's a good starting point but you should work more on your craft.\nAnd this is not worth 6$. Overpricing a small game like this is also not a good practice.\n\nGoodluck in the future man, but for now I'll have to say no to recommending this game.","timestamp_created":1521710601,"timestamp_updated":1521710601,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.623361587524414063","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sqLBpuICe7WlnAE="}
