But, I don't have the patience. This game could be named \"The errand boy simulator\" because the only thing I did was to go fetch whatever anybody wanted, and even that was linear. I quit when the guy sent me to bring him some soup for lunch. \nIs this really necessary? Can't you start the game with something interesting? \n\nAnd user interface is lacking. You should add some shortcuts for (I)nventory, (Q)uests, (E)quipement... instead of going through the menu using arrow keys every time. The same goes for guess the number mini-game. It could be simple as write number, press enter, write number... But no, it is write number, press down, press submit, press up, backspace backspase, write number...\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1492201941,"timestamp_updated":1492201941,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533227682113647461","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gNWKt9sCdsjmdg=="}
