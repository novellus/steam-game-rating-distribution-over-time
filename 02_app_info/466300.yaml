    about_the_game: "The original Planescape: Torment was released in 1999 to widespread\
      \ critical acclaim. It won RPG of the Year from multiple outlets for its unconventional\
      \ story, characters, and amazing soundtrack. Since then, millions of Planescape:\
      \ Torment fans have enjoyed exploring the strange and dangerous city of Sigil\
      \ and surrounding planes through the Nameless One's eyes. <br><br>Discover an\
      \ incredibly rich story and a unique setting unlike anything else in fantasy.\
      \ Defeat strange and alien creatures, engage in rich dialogue, and explore the\
      \ dark and dangerous Planescape setting in this 50+ hour RPG classic.<br><br>This\
      \ is Planescape: Torment like you\u2019ve never seen before.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Story</h2><br>&quot;What can change the nature of a man?&quot;<br><br>You are\
      \ the Nameless One, a hulking figure covered in scars and tattoos collected\
      \ over the course of countless lives\u2014none of which you can remember, but\
      \ are now coming back to haunt you. You are prodded awake by Morte, a floating\
      \ skull and keeper of secrets, to embark on an adventure taking The Nameless\
      \ One from the dirty streets of Sigil into the mysterious Outer Planes and even\
      \ into the depths of Hell itself.<br><br>Portals riddle the planar metropolis\
      \ of Sigil, providing access to anywhere in existence, but only if you have\
      \ the proper key. Known as the &quot;City of Doors,&quot; Sigil is a neutral\
      \ ground where demons, devas, and races from across the multiverse gather under\
      \ the watchful shadow of the Lady of Pain, the city's enigmatic ruler. This\
      \ is a place where the word is mightier than the sword, where thought defines\
      \ reality, and belief has the power to reshape worlds.<br><br>In your search\
      \ for answers, you'll find companions matching the bizarre nature of the planes:\
      \ a chaste succubus who can kill with a kiss, a confused crossbow-wielding cube,\
      \ a suit of armor animated by a spirit demanding JUSTICE, and more. With these\
      \ companions and others at The Nameless One\u2019s side, you will explore worlds\
      \ in search of answers, all to discover that some destinies cannot be escaped\
      \ and some memories cost more than an even an immortal can bear.<h2 class=\"\
