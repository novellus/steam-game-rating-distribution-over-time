In addition for being on PC it was for the Phillips CD-I ANd I believe the best game ever for it. Way better than Mario Hotel or Zelda\n\nI got this game when I was 14. Dad found it at a budget software place said he thought I might be interested\n\nBoy was I! Its advanced for its time! It has real video from the French mini series about Marco Polo that had Leonard Nimoy and a few other great actors that was made in the 80s. It was great!\n\nThe game is also multiplayer and up to 4 players may play, you travel the middle east and the orient visitng famous people from the 13th century including Pope Gregory X Yusef Ali THe Lion of An jalut and Kubulai Khan among others. \n\nIT also features documentary data on goods places and legends at the time and on the life of Marco Polo.\n\nYou play as a merchant and travel trading and performing missions. Its a good trading game. Its kinda like Starflight 2 and Gazillionaire but better.","timestamp_created":1609732964,"timestamp_updated":1609732964,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6vfj5fYCc8WkwAI="}
