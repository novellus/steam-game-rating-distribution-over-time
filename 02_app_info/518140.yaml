      pixellated adventure about isolation, exploration and new beginnings. <br><br>Deep

    review: "I really wanted to like this game and was enjoying it and felt immersed\
      \ up to the server room level, would be happy to befriend the dev and point\
      \ out where I find game breaking glitches. I run a brand new MSi GE62VR and\
      \ had trouble with screen transitions and loading. The first stage end transition\
      \ saw drops in frame rate to 6 or 7 fps, maybe less. I even went outside the\
      \ map at the beginnings of the server room floor where the outside skyline can\
      \ be seen, walked through, no jumping, never to return again. I had an issue\
      \ at the start I shrugged off where my sprite fell to the lower levels and i\
      \ was seeing screens from elsewhere in the game with no sprite on screen. I\
      \ opened the map to try and figure out what happened and when I exited the map\
      \ i was visible and in a completely different area. I had an instance of checkpoint\
      \ reversal where I died just after hitting a checkpoint but it threw me back\
      \ to the checkpoint before, then to test it further went and died on an obstacle\
      \ placed before that checkpoint and got rolled back even further. I saw no return\
      \ to the furthest checkpoint and it wouldn't trigger as if it were a new checkpoint\
      \ again. This left me disappointed and I hated feeling that way because the\
      \ whole post human civilization with a little guy coming along to revive it\
      \ was a nice story line. I love metroidvania and while this was more of a platformer/ruins\
      \ explorer type game i felt right at home. I absolutely HATE to not recommend\
      \ this game because it has such potential and feels a little like a cross between\
      \ fez and \"the dig\" for those old enough to remember that game. \nTL;DR\n\
      I LOVED IT until I found game breaking glitches."
