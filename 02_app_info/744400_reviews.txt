Since it's free now you have no excuse not to play it.\n(Except maybe the sluggishness of the movement and the occasional bugginess requiring a restart)\n\nI especiallly enjoyed the new secret \"Tratel128\" mode by press H at title screen (WAS NOT IN ORIGINAL ITCH BUILD)\n\nps. BUY THE DLC, it has cool extra content.\nMore game makers should release packs like this\n\n","timestamp_created":1511427658,"timestamp_updated":1511427658,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkfqG9N8CfcqMjQE="}
