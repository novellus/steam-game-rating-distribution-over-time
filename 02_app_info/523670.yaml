    review: 'This is an exceptionally well done game. The attention to detail is outstanding.


      It basically follows the 16-bit (SNES, Genesis, Amiga, etc) style of platformer
      except here everything is in HD. The levels are colorful, well drawn and most
      important there is a good amount of interaction.


      The gameplay is very good! It''s the kind of game that encourages exploration
      with the idea that if you die no big deal you''ve learned something so try again
      armed with the knowledge you just gained. That is old school. And here it is
      very well done.


      The pace of the game is a bit on the slow side for my personal taste but certainly
      not so much as to ruin the game. The only part that I think absolutely should
      be faster is when you die. I don''t want to wait for my bunny angel to rise
      up to heaven. Perhaps there is a way to skip that sequence but I have not found
      it yet. When I die I want to be able to immediately get right back to the start
      of the level and start playing again.


      Besides that this game is excellent! Oh another thing I want to mention is the
      music & sounds. Both are superb. The music puts me in a sort of fun lazy mood.
      The sounds are very effective at complementing the on-screen interaction. Overall
      the entire game is very well done and it is easy to see the developer spent
      a lot of care and time creating this game.


      Highly recommended if you enjoy platform games.'
