I'll e posting a video to go along with this to showcase just how much of an ordeal this became over 2 days. \n\nI don't care if the game works anymore, And I'm amazed I cn edit this review ( which was certainly marked and locked as spam by a dev or moderator, I'm recording this whole thing and showing how this review didn't even appear in my profile list at all, and how I cant delete it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct8L4jQP1b4\n\ncheers.","timestamp_created":1559781755,"timestamp_updated":1567352484,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.420258581638336182","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1607121158,"developer_response":"We released a second-day patch to fix the display issues this reviewer initially complained about, and we were perfectly polite in thanking them for bringing this to our attention.\n\nIn the initial review the reviewer also made an incorrect complaint about controls which they misread in the options menu, and the reviewer admits to never having gone past the main menu to actually play the game.  When we first reached out to them, communications were cordial and they expressed a desire to edit or remove the review, but could not at that time.  We reached out again recently to see if they would like to try once more, and did so politely at first.  Instead of trying to edit the review this user responded with insults and dismissiveness, also claiming they were still unable to.   It is also clear from this edit above that they are able to edit it, and so all of this clearly could have been avoided if the reviewer had checked to see if they could edit the review before starting an argument, or even politely declined to edit it - as they're certainly under no obligation to extend us that courtesy... regardless of whether leaving abusive reviews with false information is in bad taste.\n\nWe have no problem with legitimate criticism, but when criticism is given on false pretenses and is made with vitriol we do like to reach out and find a resolution.  Obviously that was not possible in this case for a number of reasons. "}],"cursor":"AoJwip7f9uwCf6bpwgE="}
