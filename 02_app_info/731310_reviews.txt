(They'll do stuff like get stuck in a room, or pilot your about-dead-ship into mines that could have very easily been avoided or destroyed... but they're pretty good in general with the rest of their duties)\nI'd really like to see more missions go into this game, but as to the ones that are up they are fun (though, they could do with a bit more variation... especially exploritory-wise, as traveling through space doesn't seem to terribly interesting, but I'm not sure how you'd add more variety to that, besides maybe having a map where you have to carefully pilot around obstacles, or maybe pilot your way into a hanger/base of some sort).\nIt's quite fun to multiplay and teamwork, I really like that aspect.\nGreat game so far, especially for so small a team!","timestamp_created":1586120062,"timestamp_updated":1586120062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJww+6HpvECcrS5/gE="}
