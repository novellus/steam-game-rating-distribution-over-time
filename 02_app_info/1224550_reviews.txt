This contains the two soundtracks from the game itself!  I was glad to see 'em and add them to the collection!  \"Survive the Night\" isn't on there, but the game has a build in MP3 player, so listen to it there if you want.  These are upbeat and fun too.  I can't describe music, but if ya play the game, you can obviously recognize what they are and see if you like them.\n\nGo, go, go fun music!!!","timestamp_created":1593306941,"timestamp_updated":1593306941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530516445636749268","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45NCf/PICfZvwkAI="}
