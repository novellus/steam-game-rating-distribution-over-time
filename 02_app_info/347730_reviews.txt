I can understand both the previous good and bad reviews. For starters, this game has five \"invocations\", which are sort of playthroughs, but each playthrough is different (even though they start the same and have some similarities). When I finished the first invocation, I was really liking the game. However, after the second one, I started to see some problems. These problems are a bit specific, and some people may not be interested in reading them. If you are one of them, skip the next paragraph, and continue on to read other less specific thoughts I had on the game. But before going into detail, I have to say, this game has a really good atmosphere. It's quite lovecraftian in nature, with a few easter eggs (but without overdoing it), and it has a great ending. Also, I liked the soundtrack. I wished it had voiceover, that I gotta say. Now, onto the details:\n\nFor starters, there's one specific thing that's very early on the second playthrough, and if you don't do it (and it's intuitive not to do it), you will get the same ending. This means repeating the invocation all over again, until you get it right. That's quite frustrating, especially because there's not any kind of warning, or heads-up, that the ending MUST be different, and that triggering a different ending requires something VERY specific. In that regard, a heads-up, or a simple explanation of that mechanic would have been very useful. This is not really a problem for the other invocations, because those endings are much easier to find (in that it's a lot clearer that you must head a different way to trigger them). However, if you're going for the achievements, there are equally bothersome things to find in the first and third invocations. You will get to choose which invocation to replay after you finish the game, so that helps in getting the achievements you missed, but there's one exception: you CAN'T replay the first invocation. If you miss an achievement that can only be found there, you'll have to restart the whole game to get that achievement. That's a problem that's been commented before on the discussions page, and I still hope the developers will fix it in the future (it may even be a bug, not a choice). There's a REALLY hard thing to figure out (at least for me) in the third invocation (very counterintuitive); if anyone has problems with it, I suggest to check a thread I made in the forum, which gives you a clue to find it (I had to check youtube, since there were no guides here that told you that specific detail). After having these problems, which led me to replay the first and second invocations, I started to feel that this game became more of a chore rather than something I was enjoying (luckily I read somewhere that you couldn't replay the first one without restarting the whole game, before replaying the second one, so I didn't lose much playtime; had it not been so, I probably wouldn't have bothered).\n\nTL:DL: achievement hunters, make sure you get the ones that can only be found in the first invocation before going on to the rest. In the second invocation there's an early choice that determines if you get another ending, or else, you'll have to replay it until you get it. Both these things inclined me towards giving it a negative review.\n\nSome things were also a bit too dark for me, especially in the third invocation. However, the ending actually helps with this, so it ended up being passable by my standards (I tend to dislike things that are too dark, violent or such). I didn't like the third invocation that much though (and it's the one that remains the most vague story-wise, even after seeing the game to the end), and that would have led me to still give it a negative review.\n\nIn spite of all of this, the fourth and fifth invocations turned out to be really cool, and I really liked the end of the story. It totally comes together in the end, and leaves you feeling quite satisfied with what you got. That's what won me over, and led me to give it a thumbs up. Getting the achievements was, mostly, not that hard, and each one reveals a small piece of text in your in-game library, which help in getting the full picture of what's going on. The last book, which unlocks after you get all the other achievements, has some really fun stuff, I appreciated it. \n\nOverall, I suggest you check it out, I never really though an RPG would appeal to me (haven't played many before, not counting pokemon games on the game boy xD), but I am now really impressed at what you can achieve with them; how atmospheric they can get. I'll definitely try others in the future. I thank this game for that.\n\nAdvice for the developers: a small description of what you need to do to get the achievements would be helpful. If one doesn't want to get those clues, it's just a matter of not checking the achievements before playing, which is what most people do anyway. And PLEASE make it so you can replay the first invocation without restarting. A chapter select might be too much, but I think it would drive a lot more people to completing the game in full. Also, the thing I was talking about in the third invocation (something I mentioned in the discussions page) is really really vague, and it doesn't really make any sense story-wise; if you could do something to make it a bit clearer, it would really help (perhaps something like [spoiler]\"I don't know why those numbers seem interesting to me\").[/spoiler] Thanks for a good game!\n\n","timestamp_created":1606373880,"timestamp_updated":1606373880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjIbWgfYCfKzksQI="}
