    review: 'It''s Puyo Puyo, but with some old memes. It''s an alright Puyo Puyo
      clone with some great music track and some really well done animations, I sadly
      can''t recommend this game, even for the cheap 89% off the price. Why you might
      ask? Well let me tell you my experience.


      The first match I did was in the Arcade mode (to unlock the other characters
      and powerups), on the "super easy" which is just one match, just to get a feel
      of the controls. It plays well, the controls felt responsive, and was enjoyable
      match that lasted about 10 min. Feeling good, I jumped to the next tower named
      "easy" which has 3 matches. The first game was easy and straight forward, but
      now onto the second game. The games AI difficulty is measured with "spicy" levels,
      which means 1 spicy is easy, and more is harder (might go up to 10? idk the
      highest I could see is 7.) Well the second match jumps from 1 to 4, and holy
      fuck this game AI seems to be super cheap. I STRUGGLED in this match for over
      1 hour!! When I thought I was going to win the match, the bot would spring back
      and clear their board and fill up my board, then I would get lucky and clear
      my board to fill up the AI''s board, and so on and so on. This went on for 1
      painful HOUR!! But I eventually won, with some pure dumb luck... So then it
      was onto the next and final match.


      The AI was a 4 spicy again, only this time the AI completely destroyed me in
      less than 1 min! The AI moves so fast that it''s almost impossible to even keep
      up to them. The AI is more cheaty than Dr. Robotnick in Mean Bean Machine!!
      Look I''m not a pro at Puyo Puyo, but I can play and get through most of the
      game, hell I have beat DRMBM, but at least that game it got harder as the game
      went on, not right from the start of the game!


      BUT!


      If you can somehow find friends to play with, it could be a great party game
      to play with friends. If you can not play with AI, it would be a fun game to
      play for an afternoon. It might not keep you busy forever, but there is a decent
      game here, just a shame that it''s the AI that ruin it.


      It''s just a real shame that you would be stuck having to force yourself to
      play the arcade to unlock everything. I thought I could enjoy this game, but
      it''s clear the AI is not balanced! Good thing there is no achievements. The
      game is not worth it at full price! Avoid, unless you really want to, get it
      cheap.
