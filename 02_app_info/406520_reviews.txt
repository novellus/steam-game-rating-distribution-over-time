The composers did a wonderful job, of making this on the verge of a dystopian future world, feel like there was weight to every choice. Highly recommended.\n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\n[olist]\n[*] Welcome to Neo-SF: A start to what the soundtrack will be, a slow, somber vaporwave start, with electric trumpets to boot. Possibly theremins. \n[*] Main theme (Neo-SF Streets Mix): A remix of the commercialized song. Pretty up beat and and with great snares.\n[*]  Turing's Theme: Cute theme for the best robowaifu, better than Whisper, has little water drop sounds going on in the background, as the Turing's head does look like a water drop.\n[*]  Scrubbing For Clues: Funky synthwave mix that you'll be listening to quite a bit, this is one of the prominent songs. Pretty catchy.\n[*] Club Stardust: Another prominent song in the game, you'll get used to this song if you're trying for a 100% run, synthjazz primary instrument is an electric wind instrument.\n[*] Home (Not) Sweet Home: One of the first songs you hear once in control of our player character. Reminds me of a Synthblues/jazz, primary instrument is an electric sax, and it makes sense. The player-character's house is a disgusting mess.\n[*]  Both Sides Of The Law (TOMCAT's Theme): I can't not think of Springman's theme from Megaman 7. It makes sense, first lawbreaker we meet who is one of the more lawfully good characters in the game.\n[*] Step Careful (Lexi's Theme): The first character that things could go wrong with, and Lexi's theme has a beat that I feel is supposed to represent a racing heart. She is a cop after all, all cops are bastards. The electric guitar is a great addition to the song.\n[*] Read Only Memories (Piano Theme): Great song for when the party loses their lead, and things seem at their worst. The single electric piano playing Streets of Neo-SF is great.\n[*] Intimidation Tactics: The repeating beat is increased in volume, speed, and eventually instruments, as this song reaches its end.\n[*] The Park, Dayside: Very mallsoft sounding, like those shopping malls in California that have hidden speakers in the bushes and rocks.\n[*] ROM User Setup: About 30 minutes or so in the game, we get our character customization, which in this game is more attune to selecting NPC dialogue options, as you don't ever see or hear your character, the only thing that changes is the pronouns used. This funky jam is quite fun to listen to.\n[*] Stardust Hybrid Night: Very upbeat hip-hop song for the club, its sad you hear this one once, as it's one of my favorites.\n[*]  Catch Me First!: Nostalgic for me, reminds me of those third scenario in the original Megaman Battle Network, having to stop the bus that's gone off the rails by manipulating the stoplights. In fact...\n[*] Hassy Bar: Another mallsoft snyth song, very good shop song for a video game, however if I'm not mistaken, you don't ever buy anything there.\n[*]  Troublemakers: Classic FM synth jam that has quite a mellow rhythm.\n[*] Distant Scenery: Great transitional song, with what I presume to be a real saxophone, accompanied by the use of some electronic sounds to emphasize the night sky.\n[*]  Saving The World (Jess' Theme): A harsh fast tempo song, accompanied by an electric guitar, symbolizing this characters brutal and angry outlook on an equally brutal and uncaring world.\n[*]  Neo-SF Medical: Interesting mysterious and anxiety riddled beat, reflecting the position of the game at this moment.\n[*] Street Action: Song features some up front electric-chimes, and a beat that once again feels like it could be in a Megaman level.\n[*]  Strange Developments: A sad slow song, as harsh mysteries are solved with unpleasant revelations\n[*] Tell Me Your Story: one of my favorite songs to start off a sleepytime playlist with. An electric harp and piano are prominent here, as the fog begins to clear on some mysteries the player wasn't even aware of.\n[*]  More Than Words Can Say: This is a slow melancholy song.\n[*]  Turing's Sadness: As if to continue on from the previous song, this song features more synth instruments with a very slow melody.\n[*]  Media Blues: More relaxed from the previous 2 songs, it features a nice conjecture into a more upbeat and inspired set.\n[*]   Office Politics: Strange song, as tensions rise the song seems  to be off note intentionally to raise stress.\n[*] Tension: As the previous song lead into, this song is fast, it doesn't follow a solid beat, and a lot of electric distortion accompanies the main instruments: snare, piano, some sort of electric bass.\n[*] Flower of Decadence: This song features an avant-garde-esque take on classical bougie music with a cast of completely synthetic instruments.\n[*]  RAP ONLY MEMORIES: A rendition to Welcome to Neo-SF, Main Theme (Neo-SF Streets Mix) with a funky mix, a lot of classic hip-hop tropes, including disk scratching, voices used as background instruments, etc etc.\n[*] Do It 4 The Moolah: \"I got shots ya'll and they don't stop, I got beats ya'll and they don't stop\" Another funky hip hop song featuring a lot of theremin and electric pianos\n[*]  There Would Be Thousands (Main Theme Higher Mix): Another rendition of Welcome to Neo-SF, Main Theme (Neo-SF Streets Mix), and RAP ONLY MEMORIES. This version is a bit slower, and features a higher tone electric guitar as the primary instrument.\n[*]  Data Heist: This song is a real kicker, starts off somewhat scary, turns into a bop.\n[*] The Final Run: This is one of my favorite songs, it's very romantic jazz, featuring a sax and bass, beautiful.\n[*]  Lead The Way Into The Heart: Interesting song title for this one, very psychedelic vibes, weird warping of the sound track, probably musical terms I just don't know the definitions of.\n[*]  Tunnel Battle: This song takes me back to the Turtles in Time game for the SNES, a loud electric organ leads this fast tempo song.\n[*]  Player's Choice!: An actually scarey atmospheric song, it has what sounds like metallic breathing, distant chattering, accompanied by a beat that sounds like a heart beat, some off-putting laughing and whirring. Quite a good thematic song.\n[*]  Turing's Way: This song features what sounds like a heavenly chorus of voices singing a hymn if said voices had been shoved through a computer, and it reflects the tragedy in the game.\n[*]  WINTERMUTE.LIP: Continuing from the previous song, this song is distorted uneven and has the sounds of whirring machines crashing, exploading, and shortcircuting.\n[*] Epilogue (Easy Way): Nice synthbeach jam, acompaneid by what I believe to be an electric pedal steel guitar.\n[*] Epilogue (Hard Way): Sadder version of the previous song, featuring a lot of the same instruments, but accompanied by a lot more base than anything else.\n[*] Love Me Better (ft. S A M M U S, Heather Plunkett and the Neo-SF Choir): Another remix of the There Would Be Thousands (Main Theme Higher Mix), Welcome to Neo-SF, Main Theme (Neo-SF Streets Mix), and RAP ONLY MEMORIES. This is no joke a great and well composed theme, this song features 2 primary singers, whom give this a nice Black Eyed Peas style rendition, just funky.\n[*] You're The One Who's Spoiled Everything: Once again we have a remix of the Love Me Better (ft. S A M M U S, Heather Plunkett and the Neo-SF Choir), There Would Be Thousands (Main Theme Higher Mix), Welcome to Neo-SF, Main Theme (Neo-SF Streets Mix), and RAP ONLY MEMORIES. This time we have just a completely off tone version of the song, accompanied by amazing doots and deets, makes my skeleton just jingle.\n[*] 2064 Theme: We know what it is, you know what it is, another remix of You're The One Who's Spoiled Everything, Love Me Better (ft. S A M M U S, Heather Plunkett and the Neo-SF Choir), There Would Be Thousands (Main Theme Higher Mix), Welcome to Neo-SF, Main Theme (Neo-SF Streets Mix), and RAP ONLY MEMORIES. This time we have a high pitched electric sound, feels like they were\n[/olist]","timestamp_created":1594066603,"timestamp_updated":1609019592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1NHC0PYCeuCukwI="}
