Not only is it impossible to unlock achievements due to them being broken, but after you die you can infinitely control your character in the background and get infinite points and coins. If these two items are fixed I'll write a more in depth review but at this point this game is completely broken. Not to mention the gameplay is that of a mobile app, and the Unicorn's and Bee's \"death\" animation is parrot feathers flying everywhere, instead of a custom one like the Bat has.","timestamp_created":1609138945,"timestamp_updated":1609138945,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vveJ1PYCcrmCvgI="}
