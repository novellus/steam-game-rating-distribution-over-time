    review: "The game is a nice mix between Dragon Quest Monsters and Pok\xE9mon,\
      \ as other reviewers have pointed out - taking elements from both games while\
      \ (most of the time) avoiding being a blatant clone of either.\nIt's not short\
      \ by any means, the grinding is not actually sapping the fun out of the game\
      \ (so far), and you'll always have something new to explore or even go back\
      \ to older areas, uncovering secrets or finding new creatures.\n\nThe controls\
      \ as well as configuration options are fairly rough around the edges - it's\
      \ quite possible your controller won't work well, but workarounds for that (as\
      \ well as for the lack of window resizeability) exist.\n\nIt's a real little\
      \ gem I am glad I stumbled upon."
