    review: 'I''ll admit I bought this purely for the nostalgia that the graphics
      give me. It reminds me of a lot of gamemaker games that I was obsessed with
      in my youth.


      The game itself however, is suprisingly deep. Each unit has a type and a list
      of techniques and these techniques take time to pull off. But here''s the catch:
      you can pay action points to speed it up. You''d think you''d be constantly
      doing that but action points are shared between the whole team and they are
      also used to move your units and spawn new ones.


      Did I mention that some units can transform into different forms? Each form
      is its own beast: different sprites, different techniques, and they can even
      change movement methods (flying, swimming).


      I look forward to what this game will bring to the table as time goes on.'
