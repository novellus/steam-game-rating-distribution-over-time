The game is somewhat like a vr zelda somewhat. Magics work really well and you will use all of your spells quite often. Swordplay is near perfect as well. Parrying and then attacking has never been a mechanic I cared for until this game came along and did quite well with it. Boss battles are cool and if you set your mic to your hmd, you can actually talk to the shop keeper rather than select which text option to choose. I thought that was a great way to use the mic on the hmd. Well done! \n\nThe game is a fairly good size and as the game progresses, so do your skills, weapons and magic abilities, which is great. Weather its an add on expansion or a sequel, I'd absolutely buy another vengeful rights game if one is created. If you buy the game, stick with it, give it a bit of time and when you start unlocking powers, you can use several combinations that can be quite effective. If you happen to get stuck on a particular enemy or a group of them, think about your magics and how you can use them to gain the advantage in a fight. Great RPG and worth buying at full price if not on sale.
