The game is incredibly technically demanding despite being a platforming game with poor controls. Most of the levels don't utilize any kind of mechanics and just exist to waste your time. Long load times every time you die, and with lots of bugs and ledges it's very easy to do so. Story is nonexistent and the ending cutscene is not worth suffering through 20 levels.","timestamp_created":1594058194,"timestamp_updated":1594058194,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxbfRkvMCfourkwI="}
