The first time I selected the CT206 for free flight the plane looked like the color of an old tin can. \n\nHowever, I am more interested in the GPS; VOR's; Radios and other instruments working correctly.   Perhaps my computer and monitors aren't powerful enough to get the graphics \"dialed\" in.  One thing is for sure, you can't set/operate instruments if you can't visually make them out.\n\nThe GPS 500 in the 172, and other instruments and radios are way better to make out.  I wanted a refund to try out another plane, but STEAM denied my request.  I thought you could, perhaps, just do a swap, like for a Cessna 182 RG, or something.\n\nOr, better yet, why can't you get a trail period for all add-ons?  Say for example, a seven-day period.   \n\nIf you don't like it cancel.  If you do like it, then approve the purchase within the seven days. \n\nI think this would give greater customer satisfaction.\n\nHappy flying.","timestamp_created":1593704485,"timestamp_updated":1593704485,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iJKMiPMCcOuckgI="}
