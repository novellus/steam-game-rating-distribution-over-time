    review: "I'd give this a 'Meh', this looks like some kind of project out of Newgrounds\
      \ or Armor Games (unless it originally was). This Game seems way too child-like\
      \ to take seriously, which isn't a bad thing, but not a great thing either,\
      \ it's all just very 'Meh' and one notch above mediocrity.\n\nI kind of like\
      \ the design & visuals, the characters, the voice acting of the cast, the mysterious\
      \ setting and the soundtrack (even though a song titled 'The Fun Theme' that\
      \ was from the Game's OST sounds like Bittersweet Symphony for some reason)\
      \ \n\nThe most Negative thing I can say about this, is that the Game has very\
      \ little replayablilty value, meaning that if you have already played this Game\
      \ once, then you've basically seen it all and then you just move on, but to\
      \ this Game's defence - It is only a very short puzzle Game with a 'Meh' story.\
      \ And I have yet to see any other relating installments of the Game to better\
      \ understand the Detective Grimoire Universe, so I have no idea of what direction\
      \ it's concept is going, either before or after this Game."
