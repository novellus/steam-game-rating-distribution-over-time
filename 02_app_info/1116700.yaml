    review: I definitely would not recommend. What started out with promise quickly
      turned into a grey washed out blobby mess of put this thingamabob into this
      whoseewhatsit. It actually got worse as it went on. The bonus chapter should
      be classified as torture as all the screens look the same, the puzzles make
      no sense and it's just a barren mess with nonsensical crap hunts. Lazy. Next
      time make a game which has more people to interact with, keep up the pace of
      how it started which seemed promising and don't just make it one big crap puzzle
      fest; actually have a few interesting locations with goals instead of ugly repetitive
      puzzle hunts.
