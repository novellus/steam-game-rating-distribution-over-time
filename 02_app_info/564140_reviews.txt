This game was fun. This game deserved a recommendation.\n\nThis game has not been updated in over a year with no info from the developer. This game is probably abandoned.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's fun for a bit. It's just not eight Euros or your regional equivalent fun. Consider it when it's 75% off.\n\nUnnecessary update: seven months since this review was written and nothing has changed. We have reached a point where we're closer to two years of silence that we are to one.\n\nUnnecessary update 2: well, I doubt anyone is reading this any time soon. Regardless, we have reached two years and three months of silence.\n\nUnnecessary update 3: three years and a month. Still nothing.","timestamp_created":1515223252,"timestamp_updated":1579636939,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561594188213348389","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4j9vs5O8CcruYlQE="}
