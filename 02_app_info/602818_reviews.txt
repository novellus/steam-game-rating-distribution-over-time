It has a serious audio problem though. Somewhere around and in between  50 to 80% throttle the engine audio glitches out. It goes from crackelyto mute and back again as you throttle up or down through the ranges I mentioned. This takes a lot of the fun out of cockpit flying because unless you throttle up to about %90 you have no engine sound or at best a muted crackling sound. I kept the aircraft anyway because I just love the airplane. Not a lot of switches and buttons to use, but that’s pretty typical here. \nAs far as how it flies and whatnot I’m pleased enough to occasional take her up. \nThe animated ball turret on the belly is real cool. So are the waist gunners. \nIt does have a functioning supercharger but you can’t use it and the throttle at the same time without being forced to open the throttle window and mouse over to control each engine while your controller manipulates the supercharger. That is, if you choose to enable manual control over the SC. Otherwise the throttle will control both equally. \nFrom the outside the engine rumbles are pretty nice, I just wish it were the same from the inside at all throttle positions. \nIf you’re a WW2 plane lover than you may feel like you must have this, so I’d advise waiting for a sale considering the audio issues.","timestamp_created":1565917857,"timestamp_updated":1565917857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zsj+y+wCd5G30AE="}
