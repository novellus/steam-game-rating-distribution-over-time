    review: 'You know what its not in English!

      I have an English version of MZ and I just tried this so called sample and its
      totally messed up since its not in english..

      MZ starts in whatever language it starts in and to be honest its probably japanese
      but why mess up dlc like this when its sold to english speakers?

      It seems to me the japanese treats us with very very very rude treatment.. its
      like we dont even need a translation because obviously we can just learn japanese
      cant we? Yeah...'
