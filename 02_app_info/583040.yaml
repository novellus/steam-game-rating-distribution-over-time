    review: "I guess this game is still quite enjoyable for PM fans, but for those\
      \ who are new, this game might be frustrating.\n\nPerhaps since this is the\
      \ first of the series, the UI is awful. \nFirst, about the shortcuts, you need\
      \ to try clicking every icon to know what they do. And worse, each save data\
      \ icon doesn't show any difference (like the date/time you saved the game or\
      \ the name of your daughter, or anything). It does have number, but sadly the\
      \ number is too small and aren't placed correctly (2nd are in the middle of\
      \ 1st and 2nd save icon, and the 9&10th's save icon doesn't even have number).\
      \ And this way, it's very hard to look for a certain save data, esp if you haven't\
      \ been playing it for a while.\n\nIt's also frustrating that the daughter could\
      \ still refuse to fight despite being OP. Esp on early exploration, the daughter\
      \ could ends up being killed first. I also kept getting crash on errant quest\
      \ thus making me unable to complete the map.\n\nHarvest festival is another\
      \ annoying thing. We are forced to join, and even when we can choose to rest,\
      \ we are forced to see the other competition. Why should we care to see the\
      \ other competition while the dialogue did nothing significant? It couldn't\
      \ even be skipped.\n\nThere story and interaction are also very lacking, although\
      \ tbf this is a very old game, so I shouldn't expect too much.."
