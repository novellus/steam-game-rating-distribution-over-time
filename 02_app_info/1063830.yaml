      /><br><br>You are the drifter, a wandering agent of the inquisition taking rides
      through void portals wherever threat to the humanity emerges, spreading holy
      light and wisdom through superior firepower. It won't be easy at first, but
      you will grow in power, faith and equipment to take on bigger threats to spread
      influence of the Dreadborne Citadel to protect the remains of humanity.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2><br>Dreadborne
      Drifters is fast 2d platformer ARPG full of loot, tons of enemies and plenty
      of opportunities to make your character more powerful. The more you progress
      in the game, the more lootcentric it becomes as rare items come with unique
      perks that can create thousands of combinations and possible builds  when combined
      with character talents you gain as you level up your character.<br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Classes</h2><br>You can choose between Enforcer, Dronemancer
      or Stalker. Enforcer is a tough badass who can groundslam while creating massive
      impact explosion or can hover midair while launching a devastating rocket barrage.
      In addition enforcer is the only class who can gain energy shield for enhanced
      survivability. Dronemancer can control and command multiple drones, throw grenades,
      and unleash massive death beam. Stalker is cyber ninja-like character. Can detonate
      enemy corpses, use time hacks and drain souls of his enemies.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1063830/extras/db_04.png?t=1572285988"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Environments</h2><br>Every map is randomly generated during
      short loading. Filled with basic structures and enemies, mini underground dungeons
      and various environment specific terrain decorations, sometimes tied to minievents
      to enrich your journey and gain additional rewards. Dont expect anything too
      complex or complicated as Dreadborne Drifters is designed as run and gun game.
      Thats why you wont encounter anything that will disrupt your momentum for longer
      than necessary.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1063830/extras/db_03.png?t=1572285988"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Weapon customization</h2><br>Instead of using proceduraly
      generated weapons(whitch was original intention), i have decided to implement
      full weapon customization like you might know from bigger games and let players
      creat the guns they want, instead of having player waiting for very rare item
      drop. Various accessories can be attached to some of the guns(well, to any gun
      if you have right reputations and certain ammount of currency) and apply atributes
      that you lack, or need to run your build with ease.

    review: 'Even though the inventory and stats screens might amaze you, it is not
      a nice game to play. You would expect this game to resemble a game like Risk
      of Rain, where your power is determined by your build and you are focusing on
      optimizing your moves and builds, but this game has many flaws with it''s gameplay
      and you don''t even want to go through those. With it''s many flaws of game
      design, even though rarely I review, I have to warn it won''t be that of a nice
      experience.


      Many obvious bugs and things that make you upset, I''ll skip over those because
      this is a cheap and small title. Even when the teleporter can''t take you in
      because you are falling faster than it pulls you (they forgot to make portals
      reduce gravity, lul) or teleporter doesn''t let you go when you want to go see
      what that interesting thing is or loot a thing. Let''s say whatever right?


      I won''t skip over an arpg game attempting to create build-like game mechanics
      in a fun action but fail miserably. There are many flaws with how game plays.
      The skills don''t serve to a greater playstyle, they are just there. Not the
      mention them being clunky in a game of action. You take damage, you have to
      wait a while and get your skills back if you don''t wanna die. Enemy movement''s
      are not readible, so a random beam of DEATH could sneak up on you. You are the
      most powerful and blaze through everything? Not this lil dude with a shield.
      Just skipping the enemy is so much better than trying to deal with it.'
