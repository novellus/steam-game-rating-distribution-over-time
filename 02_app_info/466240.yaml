      \ in an action-filled, multiplayer first-person shooter. You wake up in unknown\
      \ surroundings to the sound of the Game Master\u2019s unfamiliar voice. Surrounded\
      \ by five others, a third of your group have been infected with the Game Master\u2019\
      s deadly virus and tasked with taking down the other innocent players. Innocents\
      \ must stay alert, traverse the three zones and escape through the safety hatch\
      \ as the infected try to pick you off one by one.<br><br>When playing as an\
      \ innocent, you\u2019ll progress through the map and come across items to help\
      \ you survive as you advance towards the exit. However, you will need to decide\
      \ which of these are most valuable to you, and whether to collaborate or fight\
      \ with other players to get your hands on them. Every decision gives you more\
      \ information on your teammates and what side they\u2019re likely to be on.\
      \ <br><br>A test of strategy and skill, innocents must work together to gather\
      \ weapons, secure objectives and vote out those suspected of infection to strengthen\
      \ their chances of survival. But the environment has been setup to cause conflict\
      \ amongst the group, creating doubt about the true intentions of players. The\
      \ infected will be busy collecting bloody and trying to cover up their sabotage\
      \ attempts, whilst the innocents will be keeping an eye out for suspicious behaviour\
      \ and attempting to make alliances with those they think they can trust. <br><br>At\
      \ the end of each zone, a blackout period occurs, allowing the infected players\
      \ to transform into their terror form and attack. You\u2019ll need this form\
      \ to kill innocent players. In terror form you\u2019re faster, stronger, and\
      \ have better vision than your innocent victims and with an array of intense\
      \ killing animations you\u2019ll be able to create some frightening but also\
      \ amusing gameplay!<br><br><br>Deceit combines the frenzy of fast paced combat\
      \ mixed with strategic gameplay, and of course the psychological mind games\
      \ of determining who you can trust."

    review: Since the game mode rework, its lost all tension, all atmosphere, and
      any kind of stakes. The objectives are unclear, and overall the game feels worse
      than launch. Don't recommend unless they revert the changes to the old style
      stay away and save your money, its just an Among Us Wanna Be.
