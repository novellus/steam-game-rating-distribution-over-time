    review: 'Fun little game!


      The game itself is kind of simple. Stay alive, and in power, for as long as
      possible.


      Sounds pretty easy right?


      Well the game is a sort of turn based game, where you spend each round allocating
      different resources to different official or unofficial government branches.
      Each time some you do so, you''ll make some people happy, and some other people
      less happy.

      The key is to try and keep most people happy, or at the very least, the people
      who can protect you happy.


      Different factions or groups of people can turn against you, as well as you
      closest advisors might try and take power from you.


      So if you''ve ever dreamed about being a real life dictator, well here''s your
      chance. But watch your back!'
