Although it doesn't really reach the high of the first pack in terms of maximal difficulty, there are consistently more difficult song charts in this pack.\n\nOn Hard mode, the easiest, Challenge by Chronowolf, is full of trills and syncopated patterns galore; Lazarus by Dya has a ton of consecutive notes and a few super-fast triplet sections, while ABXY from Popskyy is packed with trills AND fast triplet sections, in a few cases there's an awesome fast triplet section occurring DIRECTLY after a note trill!\n\nWhile they don't reach the high of Flow Unlimited from the first pack in terms of difficulty, these provide immense challenge in their own right. And then you have the 3 arena challenges, 3 items, blah blah blah...I'm kidding, but really, I get the packs more for the songs themselves than for the equipment personally. But that's not to say that the equipment is useless - rather, they can be incredibly beneficial in certain circumstances.\n\n[h1]When to buy[/h1]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/K3W3L/recommended/522650/]You know what I'm going to say at this point[/url].\n\n[h1]9.5/10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1480067527,"timestamp_updated":1480067612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.606690168380737305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1u+5zdgCd5TLaA=="}
