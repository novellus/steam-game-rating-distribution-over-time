I have not had issues with the multiplayer, but I only did local coop. I never tried online. I will say the game has a good amount of character variety, each feels unique and has different powers. So that is kind of cool. The enemies design change, but they all pretty much will do 1 of the following: 1)run at you to hurt you 2) shoot at you to hurt you. Thats about all the enemy types. The items in the game certainly feel you have progression. Although, I will say I have gotten stuck on a level with pyromage dude, but after some mild grinding, you can get past it. The bosses are really, REALLY in design and in mechanics so good job with them. The music is awesome. But the biggest complaints: (apparently) online multiplayer sucks, can get a lil old and only giving you a few hours of fun, and I 99% the Devs abandoned the game entirely. If they did, I get it.... but it would be nice to see some enemy attack variety. Or maybe give us some enemies that buff or debuff us. something other than \"i run at you\" or \"I shoot you\". Cool game. Is it worth the $15? Probably not. If it does go under $10, snag this title for sure. Then it is major worth.","timestamp_created":1580272056,"timestamp_updated":1580272056,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7L7j9+8Cd8/o7gE="}
