      objective : cross the room.<br><br>Each level has a start portal, an end portal,
      ... and things in between. <br>You can count on two things to help you defeat
      each level : a glowing katana that cuts through everything and reflect projectiles,
      and a furry B.E.A.R. that you must protect at all costs.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>
      25 levels - about 1 hour of playtime.<br></li><li> Change the color of your
      weapon at will.<br></li><li> Not a wave shooter : ACROSS makes you think and
      observe before acting (well, except for that one level).<br></li><li> Roomscale
      VR : Makes full use of the HTC vive capabilities. ACROSS is played standing,
      and without pressing any button.</li></ul>'
