      puss parse fishtanks into oblivion? <br><br>Orginally designed as a virtual
      arcade machine minigame inside Big Robot's <i>&quot;The Light Keeps Us Safe&quot;</i>,
      this standalone version of Sqvishy is expanded and improved. Guide towering,
      tumbling fishtanks toward matching exit tiles in an increasingly frantic fever-dream
      of puss-based-puzzling.<br><br>Sqvishy is a fast-paced action/puzzle game of
      visualization, forward-planning and sharp reflexes. Giant fishtanks spawn at
      the edges of a randomly generated grid and begin to roll... By switching the
      directions of the grid tiles your puzzled-puss can guide these colorful cages
      to matching exit tiles. For every fishtank freed you score a point, but for
      each one lost - either through collision with another fishtank or by rolling
      onto an edge - a point is deducted. You must reach a certain number of points
      to clear a level. There are six levels - newly generated each time you play
      - with exits, fishtank colors and spawns randomized. Find a level of difficulty
      that suits you and get puzzling!<br><br><u>Features</u><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Six

    review: 'It''s very cute, so you control many different cats and you guide moving
      cube tank full of fish. You need to push the coloured tanks into their coloured
      square. You can''t let them go of the edge or they will de-spawn and if you
      stand under the cubes when they are moving you will die. It is adorable i love
      it when you/the cat goes of the edge there is like a rainbow effect. The game
      is simple yet fun i will play more. The only downside is the title screen may
      make you dizzy. but all and all it if fun.

      7.6/10'
