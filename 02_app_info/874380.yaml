    about_the_game: The game is great for people who are tired of ordinary chess,
      and want something more interesting. We invite you to solve unique chess situations
      and find a solution for each one of them. For example, you will be asked to
      make a mate in 3 moves with pre-arranged figures. The solution may not be obvious,
      and often the only one, but this is the essence of the game and its main point.<br><br><img

      you hone your skills and learn how to win the most difficult chess situations.
      In addition, the solution of such problems will help you develop strategic thinking
      and learn how to think in advance, by several steps. It will be useful for both
      adults and children.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/874380/extras/os.png?t=1530001964"
