They are clunky and the puzzle solving is kind of infuriating. You think you've solved the puzzle to open a door for example, but, nope, that was just the first part. Now you have to figure out how to open the second part of the lock. With items not yet in your inventory. And a LOT of running around, like more than usual. I also found this particualr game (the undertaker) crashed a lot, and each time due to some run time errors.","timestamp_created":1547307742,"timestamp_updated":1547307742,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws86uoegCedmWuAE="}
