I thought this was going to be one of those games that embraces the \"glitch\" aesthetic. Sadly, the game is just plain glitchy. Overall it's a poorly-made, bug-filled mess that's not worth your money. \n\nIssues:\n[list]\n[*] Poorly-designed UI. The buttons don't respond when you hover or click on them.\n[*] No loading screens or loading bar. When a level is loading, the entire game just freezes and becomes unresponsive for several seconds. There's no indication that anything is loading.\n[*] Poor collision detection. The player character sticks to walls like glue.\n[*] Unresponsive controls. When you click to punch, the player character punches about half a second later.\n[*] Major game-breaking bugs. For example, I have tried to play the game three times; each time I get to a point where I get stuck in a wall or a piece of furniture. There is no option to restart the level. When this happens, I have to quit the game and re-launch it from Steam.\n[/list]\n\nI'm going to see if I can get a refund. [b]Edit:[/b] Refund was denied because I was outside of the 14-day refund period. Don't make the same mistake I did. Don't buy this game.","timestamp_created":1485110316,"timestamp_updated":1485208776,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1O3V5tkCfqKhcA=="}
