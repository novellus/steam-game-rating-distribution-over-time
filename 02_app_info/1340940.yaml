    review: 'TL;DR It''s got some unique story elements, a nice selection of songs/charts,
      and some pretty models to use in the editor (if you''re into that).  If you
      go into files and check the soundtrack folder, you also get the soundtrack versions
      of the songs.  It''s a good bundle of stuff.


      The extremes are a pretty hefty step up in difficulty from anything found in
      the base game, and I wouldn''t expect most people to even clear these charts
      on their first try.  The patterns are pretty complex, and I found myself performing
      some wacky finger gymnastics throughout the pack.  That isn''t a bad thing though,
      these charts have some of the most fun patterns in the game, and they''re also
      the most visually engaging charts to watch.  Remember Sailor is definitely my
      favorite, though I''m a sucker for 2DCAT charts.  I''d say that these charts
      are worth the price of the DLC alone, but you also get the aforementioned tracks
      models and story content - the former of which will be very fun to use in the
      editor.


      Story content isn''t really my thing, but the story this does contain is a nice
      little add-on to the existing story.  The gimmicks in these missions are also
      pretty neat as well, and the random race mission is a nice little side activity
      to go do every once in a while.  These are some cool mission concepts.


      You''ll also notice that Hardcase makes an appearance in this pack, even though
      there''s a version on the workshop.  Don''t worry about that though, Hardcase
      got a pretty large overhaul in this pack in terms of visuals.  It''s essentially
      a new charts based off the visual elements alone, but the Hardcase chart itself
      received some polish as well, and is overall more complex and difficult than
      the first version.  Hardcase got a large enough face-lift to justify being in
      this pack.


      Another thing about Hardcase; I played the story missions before playing the
      charts in the arcade mode, and you''ll notice (especially on Ultra) that Hardcase
      has some pretty brutal bursts that aren''t present outside of the story.  I
      personally would''ve liked if the bursts were in the arcade versions of the
      chart, but it''s pretty reasonable that they weren''t; it would''ve made a pretty
      tough Extreme into something completely brutal.'
