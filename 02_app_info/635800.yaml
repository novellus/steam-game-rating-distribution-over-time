    review: 'This is the first time I bought a video on a gaming platform and to my
      disbelief, this video had made it internationally for the first time to a Western
      audience for what had been inherently intended for a Japanese audience.


      I have always been a massive fan of Key''s works, and I long-awaited for the
      day that [i]Rewrite[/i] would be available on Steam for the first time from
      2 years ago, but I couldn''t wait any longer. I had to get this for the Kagari
      background ever since I laid eyes upon it.


      Luckily, I know a bit of Japanese so I can put my Japanese comprehension abilities
      to the test by watching this with English subtitles while comparing it to the
      original Japanese lyrics.


      Video-wise, I have no complaints regarding its video quality. At 720p, it already
      looks extremely high quality. Of the languages you can select for the video
      track, they include English, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, and Japanese.
      All of them come with their respective subtitles except for Japanese because
      it is already expected that you would be able to understand the verbal parts
      of it aside from the singing without overlaying it with Japanese word-for-word
      because by any standards, that would be too extreme.


      Because there are already subtitles present by choosing the video track, there
      is no need to enable captions as it simply adds on a duplicate layer of subtitles
      over the subtitles themselves. Thus it had been mentioned before in another
      review how it is "hard-coded" into the video. Though for the best viewing experience
      with the least strain on your eyes, if you don''t care so much for how pretty
      the subtitles look, you can set the video track to Japanese and turn on English
      captions.


      As of now, this video is no longer downloadable but instead pops up in your
      web browser. On the upside, that saves you the time of having to download and
      take up space on your computer.


      It was challenging to find where I can write a review for this video as any
      empty text box is virtually hidden from sight. The only way I was able to write
      a review was by getting to another page upon clicking on [url=https://store.steampowered.com//recommended/recommendgame/635800]"None
      of your friends have watched this video recently. Tell them why they should,"[/url]
      which brought me to that link.


      To finish off, I would highly recommend this video to any other die-hard Key
      fans such as myself. The concert itself was a very enjoyable experience, and
      I felt like one of the excited fans in the crowd cheering for the singers on
      stage.

      There were also some shock moments when I recognized the voice of Kud, Haruka
      Shimotsuki, the moment she said "Wafu~," but I didn''t know the song she sang
      for the visual novel [i]Kud Wafter[/i], [i]Stardust (Hoshikuzu)[/i], since I
      never played it.


      Although I did not know all of the songs, that did not hinder my experience
      one bit as I still enjoyed the rest of the songs as they were excellently sung
      and were beautiful to the ears.'
