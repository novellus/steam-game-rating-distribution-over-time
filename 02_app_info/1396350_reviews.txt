Slay the Spire clone with small changes in between here and there. Has lot of replayability to it and you could spend lots of time playing it.\n\nWhat I find bad is that there is no support for 3440x1440 in my case, and the settings of the game can't be changed that much so you are pretty much stuck with same resolution overall. \n\n If you want to see my full review check it out on Youtube.","timestamp_created":1600857482,"timestamp_updated":1600857482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472972989082336426","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwsdSi3fQCfvPCowI="}
