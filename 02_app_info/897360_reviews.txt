Usually, Unity is pretty solid and I had quite a few test systems. However, as a single developer, I just can't test on all possible combinations, so maybe it is a display-resolution issue, or something with the graphics card.\nThanks for trying the game nevertheless :-)"}],"cursor":"AoJw/ezL/OsCe5e7zgE="}
