There is NO OBVIOUS way of how to make your ship move FORWARD.  The ONLY \"Thruster\" is upward which is located on the bottom of the ship.  There is NO possible way to GO ... ANYWHERE, without TILTING the ship and using the AWKWARD BOTTOM Thruster to \"go upward\" while yawing a given way..... And not even to mention the controls (the key maps, mouse, and gamepad) are WOEFULLY LACKING and are NOT easily discerned as to what does what.\n\nNOT EVEN THE BASIC \"tutorial\"-like SIMULATOR HELPS PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO FLY!!!!!!!!!!\n\nAlso all of the landscape is STUPIDLY PIXELATED.  HOW do you GET AWAY with releasing this HORRIBLE CLUNKY GARBAGE???  This game FEELS like GARBAGE!!!  I wish i had known better what i was getting into BEFORE i paid real money for this nonsense.\n\n","timestamp_created":1602700918,"timestamp_updated":1602700918,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.437578886747360229","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz+ealPUCf7rvpwI="}
