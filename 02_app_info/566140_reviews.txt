It is reminiscent of sokuban & alpha team, but the use of multiple holo-copies of the player with recorded movement is a clever twist.  The graphics are simple, but effective & the sound track is pleasant & atmospheric.  If you like brain-teaser logic puzzles, this should be well worth the low purchase price.  I will be keeping an eye on Tarbutton Studio to see what they come up with next!","timestamp_created":1487655346,"timestamp_updated":1487655346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547775864601135254","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9ePKr9oCf/vbcg=="}
