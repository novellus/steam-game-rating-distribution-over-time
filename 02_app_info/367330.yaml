    review: 'The implementation of Superfight into Tabletop Simulator is pretty good.
      Minus a somewhat cluttered playspace with lots of players and the rules being
      on a card that you have to examine very closely (just as a head''s up, the website
      that''s listed as an alternative manual on that card just leads to an Amazon
      page where you can buy Superfight), it''s still a perfectly playable game. The
      inclusion of other decks (even if the Orange and Red ones have to be paid for
      in a sort of DLC-for-DLC kind of way) is pretty cool, also.


      What I will say is this, though: while being on a call with friends is recommended
      for Tabletop Simulator but not required, it''s damn-near necessary to have a
      good game with Superfight. Superfight is, to put it bluntly, a game about silly
      arguments. Its main crux is talking a lot, which will leave you with diminished
      returns if you''re stuck in the text chat.'
