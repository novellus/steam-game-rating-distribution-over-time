    review: "Well... It's a solitaire collection. From Interplay. That is on Steam,\
      \ for some reason, with $12.59 price tag on it. That costed $1.25 on a sale.\
      \ That I bought last evening, while, as it seems, I was drunk as a lord.\n\n\
      Its graphics looks like the game was made in late 90's or early 2000's, but\
      \ actually it was made in 2017 on Unity engine. Surprisingly, it has no music,\
      \ and its primitive interface reminds me of old free games written in HTML.\
      \ And there is nothing that connects this project to Interplay besides the logo\
      \ on a title screen and a picture on a deck...\n\nSo, Interplay Solitaire is\
      \ a shameless cash-grab trying to strike on your nostalgic feelings simply with\
      \ the word \"Interplay\" in a title. It was made in 2017, but it has simplistic\
      \ graphics, lazy art-design, poor interface, and it's completely deprived of\
      \ any music (all you will hear is a rare sounds). I still can't believe that\
      \ this pile of code was released under \"Interplay\" brand. \n\nAnd you know\
      \ what's funny? I found Interplay Solitaire on Google Apps - and it's completely\
      \ the same game! For free, for mobile phones! But for $12.59 on Steam! DIXI."
