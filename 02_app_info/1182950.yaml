    about_the_game: "Whimsy is the story of a girl who has always lived in the forest,\
      \ however one morning she awakes to find little red footprints outside her door.\
      \ As any fearless protagonist would, she follows them. They lead her through\
      \ the forest where she meets new woodland friends (and foes) while solving charming\
      \ puzzles. The journey is more important than the destination in this game,\
      \ however the destination is still pretty freaking neat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      A perfect mix between whimsical and macabre, Whimsy was created by a one woman/one\
      \ shihtzu team consisting of Madison Karrh and Buster Brown.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nI'm excited to share this demo with you, please let me know if you find any\
      \ bugs or oddities!"
