Besides Mittenwaldbahn, Nürnberg-Regensburg also ships its own 442.\nThe München-Garmisch scenarios are fine.\nThere is a reflection on the windshield and as usual with most German trains with LCD screens, driving in the dark isn't really nice as the eye adapts to those bright white areas.\nThat aside, it's a nice train to drive for non-express passenger services across various routes. On downgrade heavy routes, might want to move the air brakes towards application to isolate from the electric brakes.\nPrefer to run as a single (4-car) set as the electric brakes are only functional in the first car, so the 8-car set has half the effort - so it takes a while to stop. (It's how TS works.) No big deal, you'll learn to work around it.","timestamp_created":1606051765,"timestamp_updated":1606051765,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550561785697937012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sKOJ+PUCc5vwrwI="}
