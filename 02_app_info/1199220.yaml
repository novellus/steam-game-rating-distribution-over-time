    review: "I don't usually play CYOA/Text adventure games, but the premise of this\
      \ game was too good to pass up. The game's writing is excellent, and the protagonist's\
      \ development over the course of the game is very well done. This is one of\
      \ the few CYOA stories I've seen where the narrative itself is actually gripping.\
      \ Moreover, the number and variety of endings is quite impressive. Contrary\
      \ to some of the other reviews, I felt that the player has a lot of freedom\
      \ in this game to do what they want to do. I will say this in part seems heavily\
      \ dependent on the choices you make, and I could see how some endings (particularly\
      \ the worse ones) feel more constrictive. \n\nThe author is also clearly very\
      \ knowledgable about the ancient world and Greek mythology. The game is more\
      \ than just a retelling of the Odyssey; it also brings in features from other\
      \ Greek myths and Greek tragedy. For those player's who have a good knowledge\
      \ of the Classical world, these intertexts are a really nice touch.\n\nThat\
      \ said, the game isn't easy, and it will throw some curveballs at you at times.\
      \ When playing the game, you need to be prepared to not succeed at everything.\
      \ Some players might get frustrated by this, so it's good to be aware before\
      \ going in."
