Of course, I can relate to it in a different way, since I know the developers, but I still believe it's worth a shot. The music is touching and calmed me down, and exploring the levels and reading about the world and it's people was soothing. The puzzles can be a little confusing at times, if you don't talk to the right NPCs first, but very solveable after some thinking. \n\nIf you need something to play and complete in a couple of hours, maybe after a long day at work or school, and you're in need of some alone time, I highly recommend playing this game.","timestamp_created":1605392176,"timestamp_updated":1605392176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuJK15PUCe8S0rgI="}
