Also, despite its age, I had no technical problems running on Windows 10 in 2021.  I note that letting the configuration module do its thing upon start-up probably helped.\n\nPros:\n- well-written, funny\n- excellent voice acting (lack of perfect accents didn't bother me; the voice actors did a nice job capturing the characters with very few mispronunciations of difficult words/terms)\n- the protagonist Nina is a good blend of intelligent and a tiny bit naive; she doesn't know it all, but she's smart; she isn't a complete daredevil, but she's courageous and not whiny\n- secondary characters, including the secondary lead, are reasonably well-developed\n- the scenery and art is great; despite older graphics, the game is immersive - Russia, Cuba, Ireland are all nicely captured\n- the game only made me think \"and how the heck could I know that??\" once; the other couple of times I consulted a walkthrough were on me (as a moderately experienced player, I should have known)**\n\n** not that checking a walkthrough is inherently a bad thing:  always remember that the most important thing about gaming is enjoyment! This is the beauty of single-player games...\n\nCons:\n- you absolutely do have to get your mind into adventure game logic in order to solve certain puzzles/ situations (is this really a con, since this *is* an adventure game?)\n- no true widescreen (due to the age)\n- no Steam achievements or cards\n\n[b]Overall:[/b]  Definitely recommended for anybody who appreciates old-school adventure games with lots of action and humour.  I appreciate games that put obvious thought into the story and make the mystery interesting.  The ending is slightly weaker than the game as a whole, but it's not bad.\n\n~ Imp","timestamp_created":1609633850,"timestamp_updated":1609838975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.608163237571716309","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gav46PYCfoX0vwI="}
