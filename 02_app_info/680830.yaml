    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEVELOPER MESSAGE</h2><br><i>I started developing\
      \ <strong>Wait! Life is Beautiful!</strong> while I was going through one of\
      \ the roughest periods of my life and perhaps I\u2019m still here precisely\
      \ because of this game. I never aim to bring you down, I just want to tell you\
      \ a story about something that may affect everyone. That nearly happened to\
      \ me, and may you never be that close to the edge. I don\u2019t really hope\
      \ to save someone or to make any global impact, but I do hope that you will\
      \ simply enjoy my game and maybe learn something for you.<br><br>Suicide is\
      \ one of the most common causes of death worldwide. If you or someone you know\
      \ is depressed and/or suffers from suicidal thoughts, the best thing to do is\
      \ to seek professional help. In such a situation, even the closest people (who\
      \ do not have the proper training/preparation may - and often will - only make\
      \ things worse). There are signals that can let you know that your friend or\
      \ relative is in a crisis and needs help. I hope that maybe <strong>Wait! Life\
      \ is Beautiful!</strong> will remind you to be attentive to your loved ones.\
      \ Even if they seem doing perfectly fine, they may be going through rough times.</i><h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">ABOUT THIS GAME</h2><br>The process of playing Wait! Life\
      \ is Beautiful! is similar to watching a film that stimulates a nerve, especially\
      \ when the viewer finds themselves immersed in the protagonist's anxious state\
      \ of mind. At the center of the plot is a young guy, an ordinary clerk, he is\
      \ not at all a hero, and certainly not a magician. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/680830/extras/s1.gif?t=1601624899\"\
      \ /><br><br>Watching him, we are instilled with his emotions such as tiredness\
      \ from the monotony of life and depressing thoughts about the meaninglessness\
      \ of life. However, there is a desire to change his life for the better, to\
      \ look for a new meaning - in empathy, compassion, while helping others.<br><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/680830/extras/istillhatemyselfantwanttodie.gif?t=1601624899\"\
      \ /><br><br>As we try to engage in dialogue with potential suicide victims,\
      \ we can study their problems and carefully choose the right words in an attempt\
      \ to talk them down. This can be difficult because the main character tends\
      \ to cover up his fear with black humor and an ironic attitude to what is happening.\
      \ This is his defensive reaction. Against the background of stress from the\
      \ stories he heard and his regrets about the departed, the main character begins\
      \ to see dark psychedelic dreams that give rise to a feeling of approaching\
      \ madness.<br><br><i>However, do not forget: all events and characters in the\
      \ game are fictional. Moreover, the game does not aim at saving everyone. The\
      \ only purpose is to make you think.</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">W!LiB! Prologue,\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>SUICIDE BRIDGE</strong></h2>Abandoning his\
      \ monotonous and meaningless office job, Will tries to imbue his life with new\
      \ meaning by saving people who have given up all hope of finding it themselves.\
      \ Every night he goes to a bridge beloved by suicide victims, hoping to save\
      \ as many lives as possible.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>WAIT! LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL!</strong></h2>It\
      \ isn't just the name of the game. The main character speaks this fateful phrase\
      \ every time he tries to strike up a conversation with another visitor to the\
      \ legendary Suicide Bridge. And it's the only element shared by all his conversations\
      \ with people on the edge. Every story is unique \u2014 you\u2019ll have to\
      \ learn to cope with unpredictable reactions. Just remember that you can't save\
      \ everyone.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE RIGHT TO DIE</strong></h2>While\
      \ hoping to save as many lives as possible, Will encounters an unexpected opposing\
      \ force: a group of \u201Cfreedom of choice\u201D activists led by a spiritual\
      \ guru are actively campaigning for a person\u2019s right to commit suicide.\
      \ Will the main character be able to resist them? It\u2019s all up to you.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MONEY CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS</strong></h2>...But you\
      \ can't live on happiness alone! Having lost his regular income, Will has to\
      \ borrow money from his parents. However, he isn't completely dependent on them\
      \ because he occasionally manages to get \u201Ctips\u201D from the grateful\
      \ people he\u2019s saved and their family members \u2013\u2014 or bribes from\
      \ those who want to rid themselves of an unexpected savior.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      ><strong>I'M JUST MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, OFFICER</strong></h2>When it comes\
      \ to mass deaths, anyone can become a suspect. Will has to explain himself to\
      \ the police on more than one occasion. Why was he the last person to see these\
      \ people alive before they committed suicide?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DON'T\
      \ WORRY, IT'S JUST A DREAM</strong></h2>The psyche is a fragile thing. Needless\
      \ to say, you can't talk to suicidal people every day without letting it get\
      \ to you. Will eventually starts having psychedelic interactive dreams in which\
      \ you also participate.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>WHERE WILL IT ALL END?</strong></h2>Like\
      \ every interactive film, Wait! Life is Beautiful! has multiple endings. Some\
      \ of them may seem like an obvious development of the narrative, but others\
      \ will shock you and subvert your expectations. How will the story end? It\u2019\
