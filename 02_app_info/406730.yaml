    about_the_game: Visit a quiet town in the Peruvian desert at night searching for
      spirits and taking photos, then sharing these pictures with locals who free-associate
      based on them. This game is based on time I spent with a brujo in the desert
      suburb of Cachiche, a town that was founded by witches during the Peruvian Inquisition.
      Here descendants of witches still live and continue to practice traditional
      healing and fortune-telling.<br><br>FEATURES <br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Explore
      a 3D world with ambient sounds, voices and textures from the Peruvian desert,

      what they imagine.<br></li><li>See yourself as an outsider, lurking in alleys,
