    review: "This should have been part of the original game or given for free. How\
      \ can you justify 3$ or 1$ for so little content ?\nConsider tropico 4 as an\
      \ incomplete / unfinished game, unless you buy the whole pack of dlc. \nIf you\
      \ can have the Collector's bundle (that include the 11 DLC) for a good price,\
      \ then take it, this is a good game. If you buy the each item at full price,\
      \ then you are a moron."
