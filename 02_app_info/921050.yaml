      bugs and I'm very sorry for this, hope the modify will solve this, if you could
      give me a chance and try another time?

    review: I've played this for about 20 minutes, and I'm left with only questions,
      why does my character keep crouching when I go to the right, what are those
      gems for, why did the death animation replay on a loop, why did the menu not
      allow me to press any buttons on my controller, why can i sometimes not move
      at all or pick up any jars..... I'm so confused
