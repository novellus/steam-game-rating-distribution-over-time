    review: "Trop de bugs lors de l'affichage.  L'avion Airbus par d\xE9faut fonctionne\
      \ beaucoup mieux.  Tr\xE8s d\xE9\xE7u !\n\nThis software add-on is not made\
      \ for use on Steam FSX.  The overhead panel does not work like it shoudl do.\
      \  It is impossible to shut down the engines with buttons and start them from\
      \ there, of course.  If you have read the user manual thoroughly, you would\
      \ have learned that to fill the MCDU with the appropriate datas as it should\
      \ be, you must start with a cold start.  However, this is not possible on this\
      \ version of FSX on Steam.  As some byers wrote, it is a complete scam or they\
      \ should fix it to offer a full operating panel."
