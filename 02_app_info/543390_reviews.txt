At each step of a level, you are essentially in a bubble fighting an incoming wave of enemies. You can perform quick dodges inside of the bubble with your thumbstick, and you can also dodge with your own body. Once you beat a wave, a red marker appears -- you click your trigger at it and warp to the next wave location with your full HP back. Sometimes you can choose between two different markers that affect the path you take thru the level.\n\nEnemy bullets travel relatively slowly so you can see a muzzle flash and physically dodge bullets (by leaning, ducking, etc). At any time you can trigger bullet time slo-mo, but time only moves as slowly as your physically move. The better you get at the game, the less you have to use bullet time and more start to feel like the combat droid in Mandalorian. Level 2 and 3 give you katanas that you can use in either (or both) hand(s) and slice anything in half (including incoming bullets).\n\nPros:\n+Constant action; can feel like a workout if you get really into it\n+Excellent haptics; firing the guns just feels *good*\n+Enemy designs just overall look cool, and the ones introduced in level 3 are awesome\n+Slashing things cleanly in half with a katana is immensely satisfying in VR\n+Aesthetically (after level 1) it reminds me of 90's era robot anime\n+There are three levels total, but each has a very different look and are meant to be played multiple times (beating the game unlocks progressively harder difficulties). In order, the levels are: 1) a simulation that looks very similar to Super Hot (white walls, minimalistic enemies), 2) a factory (enemies now look fully fleshed out compared to level 1 and you gain access to the katanas), and 3) the best looking map of the 3; a Halo-esque landscape.\n+Enemy variety is shockingly good for such a small game once you get past level 1\n\nCons:\n+The gameplay is simply not well-explained; this is the biggest issue by far and takes time to truly understand how it all works. For example, Locomotion seems broken at first until you realize it's meant as a dodge, not for long-distance travel. Also, pulling out your katana requires a holding the trigger for a second rather than just a quick click -- I fired a ton of bullets over my shoulder before I figured that out.\n+Level 1, while fun, is far more simplistic (looking and gameplay-wise) than 2 or 3 -- many players may get turned off thinking that level 1 is indicative of the entire game's variety/quality\n+By default the volume seemed extremely loud compared to other games (easy to fix in the options, but not a pleasant first impression)\n+The game didn't sell enough copies to warrant the additional content they were planning for it\n\nHighly recommended, and I hope one day this game gets picked up by a streamer or something so that sales justify either the updates they had been planning or a new game by the same developers.","timestamp_created":1609805679,"timestamp_updated":1609806179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4q5375/YCfdXGwAI="}
