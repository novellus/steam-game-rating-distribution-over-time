    about_the_game: <strong>Pixel Ripped 1989</strong> is a wacky multi-dimensional
      homage to the early days of gaming. The player embarks on a journey into the
      screen of a classic videogame and beyond. Set in the era of portable 8-bit consoles,
      this game-within- a-game follows the adventures of Dot, an in-game character
      who sees her world torn apart by the Cyblin Lord, a villain able to break through
      the video game screen and invade the real world. In the game, the player inhabits
      Nicola, a second-grade student who must help Dot save both realities from this
      menace by facing challenges in the retrogaming 2D world, all while distracting
      the cranky teacher and escaping from the furious headmaster in her own 3D world.<br><br><br><br><img

    review: Game seems to be completely abandoned for 1995 and no longer works with
      most motion controllers including index. Tried to start the game with the index
      with all buttons and could not get past the screen of "choose the controller
      you would like to play with." Really wanted to try this game for years but is
      completely unplayable on modern headsets. I have to refund since i can't even
      start the game...
