    review: 'This is good.  If this really is version 0.1 as it says, this game is
      really good.  It''s far from a complete game, but still very playable and great
      for kids.  I''m using a Valve Index, and the controls are really nice in this
      game, and the graphics are awesome in Ultra.  I just wanted to start out my
      Valve Index experiences with a decent "Iron Man" type of flying game to see
      how it made me feel, and this one was perfect!  It''s simple and easy to learn
      and play, and actually makes me a little dizzy hopping from skyscraper to skyscraper,
      and I even get cramps in my legs from balancing a lot when I think I might fall
      off of ledges or buildings.


      Sure, it''s a little silly hunting cute kitties, but I like it.  And my grandkids
      just love it.  I only hope they add the ability to reset the game to the beginning
      again, because before my grandkids even tried it, I had already captured most
      of the kitties and had already upgraded my boosters to the max, so there was
      little left for them to do except fly around and explore.  I assume (and hope)
      there will be a lot more added to this game in future versions, including that
      reset option.  This game really has great potential and I''m looking forward
      to what its future holds.


      If there''s a way I could even delete my save data on Steam for this game, I
      would greatly appreciate the how-to from anyone... I already tried an uninstall
      and re-install, but it still remembers.  And I also tried searching for any
      leftover files for the game on my system after uninstalling, and deleted those,
      then re-installed, but it STILL remembered.


      Great game though, I recommend it, even in its version 0.1 state.
