And it didn't start out so bad. \n\nYou were told you have to win the love of three out of six girls (?) in order to get their love token, which is needed to return home. To do this, you have to talk to them, remember what they tell you, and give them a present they wish for. Sounds easy enough, right? \nBut I realised very soon this game is hardly playable. I'm aware it's still Early Access, but imo it is not even ready for that. \n\nHere is what I encountered, and why this game is not worth bothering until it got out of EA:\n(For a better understanding it's important to know that flirting means, you have to answer their questions, nothing more)\n\nAfter talking to a person once, I chose the flirt option. It worked out for the very first Character I met (the vampire girl), but soon after she started to ask me questings about her she never answered before while talking. Well, I could manage, but with the other characters, it got worse. \nI talk to them, and they don't even respond. And you can't break the talk / flirt machanic, because if you do that, like talking twice or more in a row to get more information, they stop talking to you entirely! You're stuck!\nWhy stuck? Because you have to woo 3 out of 6, otherwise you can't return. One wrong answer (or making them stop talk to you), and you're done for!\n\nI managed via guessing and relaoding until I got their love, I finished their quests (give them an item they want), but I never got the promised love token in return. So I practically did 3 of them, got noting in return, and the game continoues infintie, you can't go anywhere else, do nothing else. And all this relaoding and going through the same dialogue took me only about 90 minutes, so it's short, too. I might give this game another try if it gets out of EA, but most likely not. It depends on getting a refund or not.","timestamp_created":1530356308,"timestamp_updated":1530356308,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.646451711654663086","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwgoOWqOQCcNTdpAE="}
