    review: "A rather unknown period and region, but the creator made it worth my\
      \ while.  Playing as Franche-Comt\xE9 I first was troubled by a large unbeatable\
      \ stack entering my lands, but the card brought some relief by the death of\
      \ its leader, and later the French king and the cardinal. If you are successful\
      \ they will attack from more than one side, but cities can hold out sieges several\
      \ turns and if you play wisely you can secure Besan\xE7on and the south of your\
      \ regions."
