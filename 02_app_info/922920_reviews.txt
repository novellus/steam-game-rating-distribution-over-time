Instead, they surrunder and leave you. Sometimes, they come back and give you money or loot, as opposed to you just killing them asd snatching your loot off their dead bodies.\n\nBy saying Retro, I mean, it's retro in every sense. it even dialog is beyond simplistic and straightforward, with random people regularly just giving you hints strait away. I actually like this. Just basic adventure RPG gameplay with no strings attached, where the combat system is very simple.\n\nHowever, I would only recommend this game if you are into retro RPGs, and you're looking for something to relax to\n\nps: the game had many bugs upon release, but these were fixed within the first few days after release","timestamp_created":1555840233,"timestamp_updated":1609122667,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512890934944152832","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n+vL0/YCeZXXvwE="}
