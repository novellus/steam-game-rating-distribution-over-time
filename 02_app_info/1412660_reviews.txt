The music samples and voice recordings made me immersed into the time period and the events, which is the greatest achievement of this game. The bulk of the gameplay is about cross referencing dates, making notes and connecting separate events into a neat timeline. After all that the story opens up to be a very human story of two friends living their lives in each others shadows. \n\nI would easily recommend the game to any fans of detective games.","timestamp_created":1609422685,"timestamp_updated":1609422685,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tKjE3PYCes+NvwI="}
