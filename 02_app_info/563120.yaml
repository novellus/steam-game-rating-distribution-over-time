    review: This game is very interesting, but it need some fixes and I'm here to
      talk about that. So first things first, an update. This game hasn't had an update
      since 2017, it's been 3 years now. The game could definitely use some new content
      or mechanics, like for example, more weapons, store decorations or even if it's
      possible, a manual save system. The game just feels a bit dull and repetitive
      after a while, especially with the grey and dark atmosphere of the store and
      the mundane routine that starts to get remarkably boring a few hours into the
      game, so store decorations and more weapons would make the gameplay feel more
      varied and interesting. About the save feature, it's more of a second option
      if you can't add more variety into the game. Why is that, you might ask? Because
      if it does eventually get boring, I would want to quit or take a break from
      the game for a moment, but I can't do that if I'm in the middle of the day because
      all the progress would be lost, as the game only ever saves during your sleep.
      After all that, mores sprite would be cool too, as there's like 3 NPC sprites
      that are used over and over, and make the experience way more generic, so a
      few more sprites (say, 3 per type) would add a lot to the gameplay. Also, not
      important or necessary, but a bit more detail to the sprites themselves (if
      possible) would be nice. Like multicolor clothing, and more facial features
      (not things like eyes or mouths, as the game's art style is supposed to be more
      minimalistic). At last, one thing that would change the way the game feels is
      a more "durable" gameplay type. With manual saves, extra store features and
      ramp-up difficulty, the game would feel less like a disposable mini-game and
      more like a life-long experience that goes on forever and has more ways of keeping
      your progress. Overall, I can't give a rating because the game still needs a
      LOT more content to be considered "finished", even if it's no longer in development,
      it doesn't feel right to give a rating to something that needs more time to
      work.
