There are all the usual\nrally mods, Rally, RX, Baha buggies (landrush), Hillclimb and extreme Khana (Joyride).\nEven the career is quite similar to Dirt Rally's one.\n- Physic is quite good for an arcade title. Maybe too good for an arcade title.\n- Exterior sounds, like gravel, crashes on metal parts, snow, car landing are excellent.\n- Graphics are OK, passable, and the locations are nice enough.\n- Random Generated rally stages is better implemented here than Dirt 4.\n- Interiors are very nicely done.\n- All the Rally modes are interesting enough.\n- There is a healthy pool of cars and tracks, even if there are about 6 locations.\n- Split screen is always welcome.\n- Test Area is included.\n\nAnd now the ugly one.\nCons: \n- Game is a huge grind.\n- Music is unbearable\n- Tutorial is about a hour long, boring and unskippable. \n- Colors of the cars looks faded.\n- Co-Driver calls are debated. Sometimes he is so slow, even with \"too early\" setting, \nthat in the time he makes the call you are already into the turn. So you are forced \nto use the chase view.\n- Performance is all over the place, with 30 to 40 fps drop in some areas.\n- Collision boxes of some road objects are frustrating. You could end crashing into one, \neven if there was definitely enough distance in between, and they have a glue effect.\n- AI records in some rally stages are questionable. On the other hand AI is pathetic in \nV-Rally Cross.\n- Engines sound are all over the place.\n- There is no point of rain and wipers. There is no rain effect on windscreen.\n- It feels like a tech demo just before the WRC 8 title.\n\n\nI enjoy V-Rally and can recommend it, with a disclaimer. This game is a weird one, it is not pure arcade rally like e.g. Sega Rally or maybe Gravel, and it is definitely not a sim one, and I don't know if I can classify it as simcade too. From my point of view I like it because it feels like a Dirt \"Lite\" and I can see someone that can't  use to Dirt Rally, trying this one.","timestamp_created":1607546636,"timestamp_updated":1608857816,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvMHZy/YCefq7uAI="}
