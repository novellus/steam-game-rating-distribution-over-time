    review: 'Edit: i''m gonna change my review now, i feel like after some time has
      passed and since the developer changed/fixed a lot of my gripes with the game,
      i can say that it is a decent game now. i''m gonna leave the rest of my review
      untouched, so everyone can keep reading my initial response to this. the most
      frustrating parts for me, no longer exist in the way they did, so it is hard
      to put it into a clear rating now. probably jumped from 3/10 to 6/10 or something.
      i think many people will still find it too... "simple"? of a game, but there
      is enough fun to be had, if you don''t mind.


      okay, i played through this completely, i had a lot of fun here and there, but
      overall i simply can not recommend this to anyone, unless i want them to rage.
      not even because the game is hard, but because it feels shi-tty.


      for example: the submarine parts are just something i don''t want to play in
      an metroidvania/platformer and the controls felt incredibly bad, and this game
      already controls a little weird from the get go.


      another one would be that the mechanics aren''t very well instructed.

      you are supposed to just know that you need a magnet for a new kind of platform,
      that at first just looks like vines. so i tried several times to grab them in
      any way i could think of and almost quit, but after explaining all my problems
      about it to a friend, i noticed a spark on the map, that wasn''t just supposed
      to show you a scary place, but it was the needed magnet powerup. the same shi-t
      happens later with some kind of zelda like maze, that i still don''t know, if
      you had to have gotten the correct path somewhere before, but i did enough trial
      and error, until i finally arrived somewhere. i think you needed to go the correct
      direction, like 11 or 12 times. there was no clue to help you figure out how
      you were supposed to know where to go. so i tried again and again, writing down
      my solution every single step further. it was a pain and i almost quit, because
      after 10 symbols, i still wasn''t through and thought it was pointless.


      last is the bosses.. knowing what to do, they aren''t that bad, but figuring
      it out, especially once you have the groundpound attack, was very weird. my
      first try to hit the bosses in which i was supposed to use it, they never took
      damage. i wanted to throw that move out the window multiple times aswell, as
      it often got used, just while climbing up, even though i made sure to not touch
      down whatsoever... there are more buttons, just give this ability its own button.
      this was a very frustrating ability, once you had it. also having to use it
      multiple times on stonebricks, just made it bug out, if you wanted to go fast
      and sometimes did nothing. so i almost didn''t realize i needed to use it, because
      at first, nothing happened.


      and the last boss.. oh boy. you get hit all the time, even though the attacks
      aren''t even frking close to you. and why do i have to fight a shi-tty starfox
      clone boss in a platformer game anyway?


      i had lots of fun too, but most of it, because i was laughing at how bad things
      were. there definitely exist worse games and in my own library, this game isn''t
      even in the worst tier i pu my games in, but i can only click "yes" or "no"
      here. and for the majority of people, i believe a "no" is more representable.
      i''d say it is a 3/10.'
