    review: "This is an interesting precedent.  This is the second review out of over\
      \ 100 that I've ever swapped my decision on.  This is currently my (at least)\
      \ 3rd playthrough since my first is the one that crashed, and the second I seem\
      \ to have locked myself out of an area for 100% completion.  \n\nThis game is\
      \ VERY hard.  A lot harder than most RPGmaker titles, and I appreciate that.\
      \  However to make things easier for the common folk out there I found a method\
      \ that makes a lot of the later game enemies and bosses MUCH easier.  Which\
      \ I'll be sharing.  I call it the Inversion Tull method.\n\nThis method you\
      \ cannot fully implement until your around lv 11-13 (lvls are based on story\
      \ progress not grinding in this game) but you can even at the start begin to\
      \ make this build viable.\n\n1) Whenever you gain new CP early game for Tull\
      \ upgraded the following stats: health, evasion, crit, and speed (dexterity).\
      \  All other stats on him for this are totally irrelevant.\n\n2) You will eventually\
      \ get manawell and fortitude chaos spheres, equip all of them onto Tull.\n\n\
      3) Around 1/3 to 1/2 the game (lv 9/10 depending on how you went) your party\
      \ is split up, and when they regroup Tull has two new abilities; analyze and\
      \ Program 12.  Program 12 is what we're focusing on.\n\n4)  Program 12 is based\
      \ on Tull's max MP, not current but MAX.  Now then you should receive the quest\
      \ from the prince of Rekshava to retrieve the relic from Grisilweir's tomb.\n\
      \n5) once you pass through the forest there is a village nearby with an optional\
      \ dungeon in it to go into Evandra's nightmares DO NOT SKIP THIS.\n\n6) Inside\
      \ Evandra's nightmares there is a chaos sphere this will swap the HP and MP\
      \ pool of the user.  Note how we've upgraded Tull's health so far?  This should\
      \ give him a HUGE health pool.  \n\n7) Also in the nightmare nearly every enemy\
      \ has a chance to drop a 'broken soul shield' this will auto regen 6 TP for\
      \ Tull a round.  There should have also been an accessory at this point to also\
      \ regen another 4 TP a round for Tull (can't remember where it is)\n\n8) Once\
      \ done in the nightmare, go into the tomb make sure to enter the far room on\
      \ the first area to reach a save crystal, and the giant's glove for Tull this\
      \ will boost his Hp (now MP) pool by an additional 1k points if not more.\n\n\
      9) once done with Grizilweir and return to Rekshava and get entry into the desert,\
      \ head into the desert temple and examine EVERY pot, one pot after getting to\
      \ the boulder & statue puzzle has the expert medallion in it which will regen\
      \ 8 tp a turn.  This along with the shield will generate 14 tp a round meaning\
      \ Tull can cast Program 12 EVERY ROUND.\n\nAfter that just equip hp boosting\
      \ gear to increase his MP and you will have an uber powerful member for your\
      \ team.  He will need revived a lot though."
