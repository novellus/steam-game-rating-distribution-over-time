Three Difficulties to choose from, or you can go with Custom Mode.  Can be changed at any time.\n\n[b]Story[/b]:\n\nWenonah, the Spirit of Cold, had feelings for the Owl Spirit, Koturi, but her feelings were not returned.  When Koturi fell in love with your ultimate grandmother, he gave up his immortality to marry her. Wenoah's rage knew no bounds, and this Christmas Eve she will finally enact her revenge by killing off your ancestors to make sure that YOU will never be born!\n\nThe spirit of Koturi was able to freeze time, temporarily saving your life, but it's up to you to save your ancestors... and yourself!\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1939598684\nWe do have a Journal, but each of the three segments is pretty nicely encapsulated, so you probably won't need the story reminders.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]:\n\n[i]Bitter Cold[/i] takes the usual [i]Redemption Cemetery[/i] formula and changes it by having you save the living, rather than helping the dead.  As usual we will visit three distinctly different eras during our journey.\n\nBe on the lookout for [b]Collectible Snowflakes [/b]as you play.\n\nThe [b]MAP[/b] is only semi-useful, as the areas where we have actions to complete are shown even if we can't do anything there right that moment.  The insta-transport is of course very helpful, but if you need help, the directional [b]HINT[/b] is likely going to be your best bet.\n\n[b]Hidden Object Scenes[/b] vary in type, and although you will revisit each scene once, the items you found previously will stay gone.  If you don't feel like doing HOS, you can switch to [b]Match-3 mode[/b]... Although this is like no M3 I've ever seen before!  Once you make a few matches, one of the pieces will start to glow.  Match that piece to remove one item that needs to be found.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1939599509\nThe [b]Mini-games[/b] are nicely-varied, and many have the option of completing them in Casual or Hard mode.\n\n[b]Sights and Sounds[/b]:\n\nI was really impressed to hear actual, appropriate emotion from the voice actors -- they did a great job (although the narrator seemed a bit too chipper).\n\nVisually there are some stunningly gorgeous scenes and I like the character design.\n\n[b]CE Content[/b]:\n[list]\n[*]Integrated Strategy Guide\n[*]Bonus Chapter\n[*]Collectible Snowflakes - purchase decorates for your snow globe!\n[*]In-game Achievements\n[*]7 Wallpapers (including one of my favorite scenes!)\n[*]10 Concept Art\n[*]35 Cutscenes\n[*]5 Screensavers\n[*]4 Music Tracks \n[*]18 Mini-games\n[*]11 Hidden Object Scenes\n[/list]\n[b]Bonus Chapter[/b]:\n\nA postman's carriage slipped into the river, and he cannot rest until the packages and letters in his care are delivered.  The extra chapter does not involve any of the characters from the main game (except you), but there are a few familiar scenes along with some all-new areas.  \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1940978781\n[b]Verdict[/b]:\n\nThe visuals immediately drew me in, and the main goal of saving your ancestors ties the separate stories -- and the simultaneous Christmas and Native American themes -- together beautifully.  All told the game + bonus took me about four and a half hours, and I enjoyed it all.
