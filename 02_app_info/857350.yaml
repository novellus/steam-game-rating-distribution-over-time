    about_the_game: 'CopperCube is a full-featured 3D game engine. No programming
      needed! Create 3D games and apps quickly. Includes terrain editor, low poly
      modelling tools, 3D models, precreated game AI, effects and more. There are
      also plenty of features for advanced users, like JavaScript scripting and shader
      support.<br><br>Create your own 3D worlds and 3D models, set camera controllers,
      materials, behaviors, click ''publish'' and your game or app is ready. As Windows
      or Mac OS X apps, WebGL websites, or Android apps. You can do all this without
      programming. The engine is free but there is also a professional edition (DLC):
      It adds post effects like bloom and the option to customize the splash screen
      logo. By buying it, you also support the further development of the engine.<h2
      class="bb_tag">High performance 3D engine</h2>CopperCube includes manually optimized
      3D engines for all supported targets, running with OpenGL, Direct3D, and WebGL.<h2
      class="bb_tag"> Simple-Click game system</h2>No programming needed: Wether you
      want to create a simple 3D game, a complex, epic adventure, or a first person
      shooter: Select from lots of created behaviors and adjust them accordingly.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Terrain Editor</h2>Create your own 3D worlds directly in the
      editor, textures can be painted quickly with automatic texture blending into
      the terrain. There are also tools for placing grass and bushes, and creating
      trees.<h2 class="bb_tag">Physics Engine</h2>Next to the the built-in blazingly
      fast collision and repsonse system, there is also a full physics engine integrated
      when publishing as Windows .exe and Mac OS X .app.<h2 class="bb_tag">Character
      Animation</h2>You can model and animate characters using any 3D software, export
      it into one of the supported file formats and then import them into Coppercube.
      Also, it is possible to download existing 3D models from the web and use them
      in the editor.<h2 class="bb_tag">Low poly editing tools</h2>You can edit your
      own 3D models directly in CopperCube: It includes a simple 3D modelling tool
      for creating levels, models and items.<h2 class="bb_tag">Cross Platform Script

    review: It's 64 bit as of the latest update, been around forever, and uses JavaScript
      like RPG Maker MV and TyrannoScript.  So, you can script in one language for
      3D, pixel, and VN through Steam if it's just a hobby.  Sometimes it's easier
      to get good at a single language than several.
