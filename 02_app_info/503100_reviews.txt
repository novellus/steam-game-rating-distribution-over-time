Very surprised that a game so simple can be so much fun. The animations when you die are very surprising and will spook me every time I die. I do wish that there was a level editor so we could make levels for others to do.","timestamp_created":1609206787,"timestamp_updated":1609206787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u92M1vYCcKymvgI="}
