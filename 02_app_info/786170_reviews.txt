This game has a long way to go before it is completely flushed out; however, even with the flaws that this game has, it is still fun. I enjoyed playing through the levels and can see myself playing them again, as I missed side objectives and other secrets. I would reccemend this if you are bored and want a short game to play through.","timestamp_created":1522429798,"timestamp_updated":1522429798,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552017807960510254","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw5+T4u+ICdOWAnQE="}
