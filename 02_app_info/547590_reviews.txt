It feels like I'm standing at a real machine, with the added bonus of having the inhabitants of the pinball table move around me.\nGFX, SFX and physics are just great. I'm playing fluidly on a Rift S / 970 GTX w/o any problems.\n\nJust attach your controllers to a table or something at the right height and the right distance from each other to get the total immersion :)\n\nI also bought The Walking Dead DLC and Season Pack 1.\nAll DLC tables run flawlessly and have been created with a lot of passion!\n\n\n10/10\nM-M-M-M-MULTIBAAAAAALLLLLLL","timestamp_created":1609505656,"timestamp_updated":1609857937,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45tXA6fYCfvKxvwI="}
