    review: 'I''ve already ran into multiple bugs. Also just trhows you into the action,
      without telling you what to do, or how to do anything. I can, however, see some
      improvement to this game making it worthwhile over time. I''ve spent 5 bucks
      on worse things.


      UPDATE: It''s been over a year, and no update or anything has come out for this
      game. Almost feels like a scam. I''ve still spent 5 bucks on worse things, but
      this has turned out to be quite the disappointment.'
