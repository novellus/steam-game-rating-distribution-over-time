The game itself is brutally unforgiving and fairly short, but the concept works and I'm excited to see where Weird Walk will take this in the future when more content can be created. More levels? Variety? Items? Progression? Possibilities abound!\n\nI got this game on sale for $0.59, I'm satisfied with my purchase and will keep an eye on this developer.","timestamp_created":1565796637,"timestamp_updated":1565796637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522603988647460938","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lJOwyOwCfOSr0AE="}
