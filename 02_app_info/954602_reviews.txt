It is also very simple, even on the hardest difficulty, the main thing that makes it hard is how the song slows down near the end but the gap between the notes remain the same, so it basically crawls to a halt and makes it very unnatural.\n\nI don't know if Taito ever redo's maps or adds new difficulties, but this track deserves a re-visit. It's a shame that it does not live up to the standard.","timestamp_created":1565204551,"timestamp_updated":1565204551,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41cLdtuwCfpP2zwE="}
