It's a poor long-lost Central Asian cousin of Nathan Drake and Indiana Johns, spiced with some ecological messages and sprinkled with the duty-before-humanity-or-yourself-first themes. It falls flat, and with a boom. The characters are completely unrealistic ([spoiler]especially the love relationship component - it could not possibly happen that a romance between a Russian-American scientist and an Uzbek sailor would end up like this on the turn of the millennium[/spoiler]) and behave oddly - like an American boy calling his mother exclusively by her last name. \nThe voice acting is trully horrendous - the characters speak with obscure Northern European accents and not-quite-there-yet intonations. If the developers were going for the more realistic atmosphere, the characters should have spoken with the Russian accents, save for the American chap. Otherwise, a suitable choice would be a generic American or British accent. \nThe state of the dialogues direction as they are breaks the immersion significantly ([spoiler]also, why would Nikolai and Jumagul bicker in English? They both are fluent in Russianl![/spoiler]).\n\nVerdict: a boring timewaster with no engaging concepts.","timestamp_created":1607129830,"timestamp_updated":1607129849,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yuuZmPYCeNGwtwI="}
