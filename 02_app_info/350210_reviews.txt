It gives you all the games and is better value for money\n\nA mighty attempt at keeping the series fresh, suffering from a lack of pc optimisation and testing. The 360 pad support is there, but everything else looks like it needs more work done with it. In a game about puzzles fused with speedrunning you're thinking 4 player would be an amazing idea! But then you remember it's incredibly easy to troll each other, which will happen 100 times more often than the military like precision needed to make full use of co-op speedrunning. There's a vs mode I haven't tested, but I imagine it has a lot to do with the aformentioned trolling.\n\nOnly get this if you REALLY love the series, love the character, have local friends who are more likely to work together than troll and/or it's on sale","timestamp_created":1448406942,"timestamp_updated":1593358207,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.450835555791854858","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gZnj/fICdZy7SQ=="}
