    review: "Definitely not!  \n\nPros\n.Lovely artwork/graphics/scenes\n.Appropriate\
      \ music/sounds/voice acting\n.Four difficulty modes including custom\n.Mini-map\
      \ with fast travel (receive in-game) \n.Stationary toolbar\n.Intricate to simplistic\
      \ adventure play\n.Variety of hidden object scenes \n.Bonus chapter\n\nCons\n\
      .Story very basic (kidnapped relatives)\n.Mini-map legend in another language\n\
      .No indication when objects in correct position for possible use\n,Mechanics\
      \ were a little slow and clunky\n.Easy to annoying mini-puzzles (with vague\
      \ instructions)\n.Very short, even with bonus chapter\n.On first run thru, game\
      \ froze at final boss battle and would not play any further\n.On second run\
      \ thru, game was very glitching and quit twice\n.On second run thru, game again\
      \ froze at final boss battle (but did eventually continue)\n\nFinal words (2/10):\n\
      I enjoyed the adventure play and hidden object scenes, was often annoyed with\
      \ the mechanics and mini-puzzles, and disappointed over the length but it had\
      \ still earned a five out of ten from me.  Then it froze.  And glitched.  And\
      \ quit.  And froze again.  So I cannot recommend it.  (And I will be deleting\
      \ it.)"
