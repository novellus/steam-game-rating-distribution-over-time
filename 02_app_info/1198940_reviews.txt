Some kind of overworld objective but the main focus seems to be on securing your base first.\nWorth it on discount. I changed my rating to a more positive rating because while one map is an escort mission, you can control the pace of when to move the escorted unit. Of the three maps I like the map where you have to sacrifice heroes the best. The Gehenna stone map was OK, it has a few \"gotchas\" which are fine. The scenario, not campaign maps are kind of like the My Pet Dungeon of Dungeon Keeper II and makes a nice addition.","timestamp_created":1604298756,"timestamp_updated":1604631680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515765786170959473","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwIrgzfUCcaveqwI="}
