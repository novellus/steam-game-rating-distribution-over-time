    review: You get a new hero, a bunch of new items and a handful of neat scenarios,
      plus a little mini-boss of sorts. I'd like to have a few more scenarios for
      it to be worth the asking price though, but I guess you can consider it supporting
      the developer. Overall I enjoyed it and recommend for any fan of the franchise.
      Definately a good purchase at a sale.
