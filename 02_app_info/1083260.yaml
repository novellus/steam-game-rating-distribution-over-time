    about_the_game: 'Take to the skies in Wingsuit: Gudvangen and pursue the daredevil
      career of a professional wingsuit pilot with the action turned up to 11. Put
      on one of the wingsuits at your disposal, choose an exit point, and make Gudvangen
      your playground. The classical action sports location has been faithfully recreated
      as an open world for you to explore, so you can fly the same lines you''ve seen
      in your wingsuit heroes'' recordings, or carve your own way down the mountainside.
      When you''re done blazing sick lines, you can string together high risk trick
      combos for a new high score on the global leaderboard, test your skill as a
      camera man, or try your hand at the truly insane Survival Mode, where you have
      to dodge nasty weather and SAM sites. On top of all this, the world is packed
      with challenging gaps and collectibles, so there is always something fresh to
      explore around the corner.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Six
