    review: Since this is only the demo I'm only saying what I've got from that. I
      don't really understand why this got mostly negative responses. It's a pretty
      good VN. I never liked voice acting in VNs so I always turn the voices off so
      I can't comment on that, but the art is nice, love the soundtrack and the story
      makes me want to play the full version, however I'm still contemplating whether
      to get it or not. It's unique, a bit confusing but easy to understand and I'm
      sure it progresses in the full version of course. Cyrus looks like a chick,
      I really thought he was a girl at first, but hey nothing wrong with a feminine
      looking guy!
