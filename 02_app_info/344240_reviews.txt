There are so many things missing, especially for a WARHAMMER brand game. Usually they do not sign their name to stuff unless it is pretty darned good, I should know, i only have EVERY WARHAMMER game EVER released on ANY platform... But like when you sailing past the shore, you don't see the villages and people going about their lives. Its just scenery too, you don't even interact with it other than looking at it, but it makes a WORLD of difference. Sorry. I know that he who would pun would pick a pocket, but there it is. And the combat system is VERY clunky. And maybe a few small mini games in the tavern. Cards or dice maybe. I mean flesh out the world you have built or at least give us the ability to do so...... But otherwise I like where this game is going story wise. Warhammer world. Sail where you want. Next get out and explore vast cities, not just cookie cutter ports with same three or four options at each, in other words a glorified menu system. PLEASE GUYS DO NOT GIVE UP ON THIS WONDERFUL GAME!!!","timestamp_created":1609130245,"timestamp_updated":1609130245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uN/o0/YCfs/+vQI="}
