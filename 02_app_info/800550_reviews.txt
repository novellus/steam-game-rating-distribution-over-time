The movement is slow until you train it up.  The guidance is pretty lax overall. The graphics are funky.\nIf all of that is true, why am I recommending it. The freedom, the scale and the depth of the procedural generation.  This is the kind of game you could enjoy forever once you get past the bad parts.  I actually enjoyed the combat and jumping around dodging attacks, even without fancy animations, it's still enjoyable and there is a level of skill to it that can help you beat harder opponents. There also is a fairly robust simulation where nations wage war against each other which you can fight in, or you could just mine for resources which also help the nation you are donating them to rank up.\nNpcs can be slaughtered, kings can be overthrown, etc. You can go around backstabbing people as a rogue if you want. \nThat to me is the real appeal of the game. The fact that you can do these complex things even if the interface leaves something to be desired.\n\nEdit: 20 hour check in.  After learning more mechanics and learning more of the breadth of what you can do. Wow.  I mean, there are some really interesting mechanics here and the simulation is real.  When you start smiting armies by yourself, it feels amazing.  Even just beating people up in bars is fun.  I definitely recommend this. You can become a king and have kids and have trains bring resources around and elevate the wealth of the nation.  I can't even understand how awesome it is.  It is huge too.  I wish this existed when I was a kid because you can play for hours and hours.\nEdit:25 hours.  I discovered a few new things.  You can hire NPC's and you can knock down walls and build up your own base.  I don't fully understand this part of it yet but it is seeming pretty good.\nEdit: 40 hours in: I took a kingdom, made half-elf babies with a princess. The children are growing up. I've inscribed my weapons with magic words. Got a full set of wizard/sorcery/intelligence equipment and became very powerful casting spells that I've learned as the player to cast(by typing or using scrolls and inscribed wands).  I've set up hundreds of wizards over my kingdom to defend me.  I've set up stores for people to shop at.   I have my own prosperous wizard nation and it feels good.  Combining magic words to create compound effect spells and training up magic spheres is satisfying long term.","timestamp_created":1606154100,"timestamp_updated":1608508280,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568627476692199707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzJGkwfYCcZqNsAI="}
