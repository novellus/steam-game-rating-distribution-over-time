I'm sad to give it a negative recommendation.\n\nThis game looks super fun at first glance. Music is alright, it's an abstract twin stick shooter. It even seems to have a tactical element through the notion of area control. Neat! Outsmart your opponent by blocking them in and then shooting them.\n\nOr so you would be led to believe, or at least that's what I was thinking. The problem is that this game has a game design.. uh, flaw? It's only a flaw in the sense that I think it ruins the fun for me.\n\nThe way it works is that you press an arrow key and you shoot in that direction. Nice. But if you press the arrow key in a direction while a shot is coming at you and you shoot at the shot, then you \"block the shot\" and both shots disappear. Nice.\n\nIf you time your shot \"correctly\" which feels like a 0.125s gap before the shot hits you, then you override the enemy shot, and deflect the shot back entirely to your opponent.\n\nThis effectively kills all tactical element of the gameplay, and reduces it to a matter of \"who has the best twitch reflex if you are 2 square away from one another and/or manages to accidentally get in a shot from a direction while the enemy is not looking\". There is no tactical element here, just trying to deflect the shots back.\n\nTherefore, if your enemy has 1 ammo stocked up, then doesn't matter if you have 3. In fact, if you time it correctly, you seem to be able to steal a speed shot, if you press it at like a 0.005s window? I felt like I was cheating even when I accidentally managed.\n\nSo VERSUS mode against CPU is effectively \"can you out-twitch-reflex a CPU that consistently reflects shots 3x times if you try to shoot at it while it has ammo available\", and feels less skill-based and more luck-based if you accidentally manage to succeed.\n\nMaybe I just suck, but twitch reflex isn't my type of fun. I thought this is tactical, but it's a matter of pressing the arrow key in a 0.125s timeframe.\n\nMeh.\n\nThe problem is that the game is effectively a matter of \"ammunition management\", the special \"fast shots\" for example provide +1 ammo over your opponent. You'd think what matters is how many ammo you have, but it's more-so a matter of \"whoever shoots first will lose if the opponent has good twitch reflex\", which the CPU obviously does.\n\nIt's probably more fun with friends, because they probably aren't as good at twitch reflex as a CPU. If this game had no twitch reflex deflection, it would be more fun....","timestamp_created":1609865134,"timestamp_updated":1609865231,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qb/c6fYCdI3gwAI="}
