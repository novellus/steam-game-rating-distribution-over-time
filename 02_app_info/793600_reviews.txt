Now that I have, I can say it was actually a lot better than I expected it to be. First of all, the art is really great. There is a fair amount of diversity within the enemies. Cheerleaders, jocks, rockers, football players, security guards, school mascots, and more will put up a fight! The cutscenes are well done too. They are each told in a comic book style scene, but don't drag out and get to the gameplay quickly.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty standard for a beat em up, though they update your moves the more you use them, and a lot of the fun comes from getting gradually more powerful over the course of the game. The boss fights were also really fun, most enemies having multiple phases before finally beating them in a one on one fight.\n\nI do think this game can improve in some ways. For starters, they force you to play in fullscreen, and I would prefer a windowed mode as an option. Finding out how to use specials was a bit strange as well because the game doesn't explain it. You have to hold down Y then press the direction of your choice to make it work. After I learned how to do it, it was easy enough, but the information was not well articulated in the game and has caused some players to actually get stuck at the tutorial! This game also has a lot of gross humour, which is not everyone's cup of tea, so just be aware of that. \n\nThere are better beat em up titles out there, but if you want an inexpensive and quick source of fun and can handle some roughness, give Bully Beatdown a try!","timestamp_created":1607136709,"timestamp_updated":1607136709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561303555965423584","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mIG0mPYCcOaytwI="}
