Each 'turn' is five seconds, where you and your enemy both make their respective moves at the same time. Each planning phase lasts about a minute, enough time to think and a little to adjust yourself. As in your squad of course.\n\nAll in all, I'd give the game a 7~8, 8 might sound generous and would definitely be 8, but the playerbase is small now. When you do find a player though, this game is a blast, I'd recommend playing with friends.","timestamp_created":1597172287,"timestamp_updated":1597172287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44eC47/MCdf3tmgI="}
