    review: 'How can I verify the version of my download. I want the one that stops
      freezes. Most freezes occur while in tracklaying mode. When they do the only
      alternative is ''control, alt, delete'' I have seen  claims this bug is being
      worked on and that it is fixed. Should not the latest version with bug fixes
      be automatically downloaded?
