Did it succeed?\n \nSail and go!\nFrom the start you notice that this is not your regular indie, as in they went for a pretty big open world, or maybe better open ocean game where you travel from island to island. It’s pretty overwhelming and I didn’t expect this at all, recreating some sense of wonder and excitement once you set sail\n \nOnce you did a few puzzles and won some battles you get a very good idea of what this game is about. The puzzles are great and exciting, and the battles serves more like an in between to gain some more resources, although some of them have alternative solutions which is cool to discover\n \nThe boss fights can be pretty hard but once you get thru to them (if too hard you can go back and gain more resources and so power up the princess) you can set off to the next island which is great.\n \nThere will be a huge change also nearing the end of the game which I won’t spoil here but it will take you to very different places.\n \nWhat’s Good, What’s not?\n \nIf you jump into light tracer expecting a triple A experience you will find a bunch of stuff to complain about, since it’s made by a small team. Some things just feel a bit off or not exactly as you wanted them, let’s say some animation or some effects.\n \nHowever, if you are willing to look thru it this indie is quite the gem, for a fraction of the price it offers a huge, very long adventure that will some truly original puzzles and battles while also drawing you in its story.\n \nFor me, it gave me back some of the feelings I had from games I grew up with, that surprised me and took me to place with a wild variety of gameplay and sights that made me excited for that next puzzle, that next scene.\n \nSummary:\n \nIt’s not perfect and at the same time I have a very good experience. It’s an indie’s take op an open world adventure game and like I mentioned above: if you’re willing to look past some issues and blemishes, and if you like games like windwaker, you should definitely try this game out.","timestamp_created":1598023998,"timestamp_updated":1598023998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo+PpiPQCcpTtnAI="}
