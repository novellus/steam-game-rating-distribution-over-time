    review: "Gorgeous map with full infantry, tank and air force aspects of combat.\n\
      Interesting history of war between Tanzania and Uganda where they had some nice\
      \ battles in the jungles and grasslands in the hot & humid interior of Africa.\
      \ \nUnit cards of army, aircraft and leaders are very well crafted. \nIf you\
      \ want some modern combined arms combat plus a history lesson, then dive into\
      \ this."
