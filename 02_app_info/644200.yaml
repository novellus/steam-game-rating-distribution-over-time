    short_description: It takes an immense amount of time for light from the stars
      to arrive our place. When we finally see the twinkling lights, the stars where
      the lights came from might have already extinguished billions of years ago.
      Even though starlight is just an illusion that seems perfect and beautiful,
      do you still like it?

    review: 'Decent writing. Decent characterisation. Stunning artwork and voice acting.
      Wait.

      Wait. She''s...

      [spoiler]Oh god. She''s 11? and he''s 16? oh no no. I see, that was the past
      it''s now her, her 12th birthday? What?

      He said he fall in love with her as soon as he saw her. That''s it, I''m calling
      the loli police. [/spoiler]

      So yeah. it''s great if, you know, you can look past the [spoiler]gradually
      more and more unsettling age gap[/spoiler] then it''s fine?

      You know. It''s like Hannibal Lector. What a great psychiatrist and role model,
      as long as you forget he''s literally a cannibalistic sociopath.

      10/10 thumbs up.'
