But the board is one large 6x3 board instead of each player having their own 3x3 board, and connecting the cards doesn't immediately cause an action, but rather activates them, to do something in X number of turns.\n\nThere are definitely pros to the new game. Being able to place your cards directly in the way of the opponent is nice. The \"spy\" cards that have red arrows that connect to the opponent's cards are very cool, and there's some great balance with them (they often have powerful placement effects, but help your opponent create matches). There's a lot of interesting possible combos you can do. Like powerful cards with no arrows, that have to be activated by other means. Or cards with great effects only WHILE active, which means you want to delay their turn timer as much as possible.\n\nBut there's so much strategy that's been taken away because of the changes. In particular, the ability to win a duel by disabling opponent's cards to block their board is completely gone. The only way to win is getting the opponent to 0 HP. Also, the way that activated cards can instantly activate new cards leads to very stale gameplay that's essentially just infinitely chaining damage cards. This is compounded by the fact that your opponent has no chance to block you if you place a card where one just finished activating.\n\nIn CCN1, every attack took time and you had to be very aware of your opponent's board to know if you might get blocked, or if you should block them. In CCN2, I never really had to pay too much attention to my opponent at all. I just had to make note of how to continue my chain. CCN1's three symbols (attack/defend/heal) made you think more about how to match your cards and what to do with them, but that system is gone in CCN2.\n\nAnd while there are a LOT of interesting card effects, they are all almost completely useless if they aren't damage. Almost all these cards that do nothing but provide arrows, or let you peek at your deck, or swap card colors, or get mana tokens, are all completely inferior to cards that do 1 or 2 damage. Plus, the long delay in activation effects often makes instant placement effects too overpowered. These were powerful in CCN1 as well, like Health Potion or Brickocalypse, but didn't have the same oomph they do in CCN2. Plus, ones like Anna Ban, which stayed ON your board after their powerful effect, or Bomb, which does 2 damage but your opponent has a turn to defuse them, were a very interesting mechanic. In CCN2, there's no con to placing a dead-after-arrival placement effect card wherever on the board. Or even worse, putting 2 Potatos in your deck because there's literally never a reason not to.\n\nAnother thing is that I enjoyed in CCN1 how you face off against strong opponents using a unique Legendary card, and then after you win, you get that Legendary. And you could only have ONE legendary card in your deck. They had powerful effects, like reviving every turn, or shielding damage, or wiping the board, or chaining attacks faster. This element is completely gone in CCN2, and all the rank up battles just feel like normal battles using normal cards. For there being so many potential combos, I didn't really see any \"gimmick\" decks in CCN2, maybe because none of them can be successful compared to raw damage.\n\nAnd last but not least, the deck editor is a bit worse... No mousewheel support for scrolling your card collection or deck? Really? And I absolutely hate how you can't temporarily overfill your deck. I want to put my new cards in, THEN figure out what I'm taking out. It's a super basic feature that Pokemon Trading Card Game did perfectly 20 years ago. And your deck is ordered by when you added the card, not by name or rarity or anything logical like that. It's very difficult to find specific cards in the deck list to remove. And the only way to sort the collection is alphabetically, though there's definitely some improvements compared to CCN1, like searching by name or filtering for specific arrows. But there's a lot of design choices I would change with it if I could, both from CCN1 and from other game's deck editors.\n\nOverall, it's still a fun card game adventure, which is an underappreciated genre, but in trying to create a new twist instead of refine the original further, the gameplay has suffered.","timestamp_created":1609853998,"timestamp_updated":1609853998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu9Kx6fYCdePZwAI="}
