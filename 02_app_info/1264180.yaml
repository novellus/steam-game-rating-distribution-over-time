    review: 'The idea of this VR App is something I love and really want. I would
      pay quite a bit for one that is executed properly.


      The visuals and ability to move around the environment are very poor. You don''t
      get to visit much or explore. It''s just executed in as basic a way as it possibly
      could be.'
