The controls are a mess, everything feels clunky, and you just get bombed by random zombie spawns that damage you before you can really move around. Guns feel bleh, visually it's got all the appeal of a newgrounds game. Do not for *any* reason pay $10 for this, as there are better free games on mobile even. I hate leaving negative reviews, because it means I've played a VERY bad game.","timestamp_created":1609601114,"timestamp_updated":1609601114,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+fvs4fYCee3gvwI="}
