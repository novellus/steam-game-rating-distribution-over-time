All the characters have been established now giving the writers more room to expand on the story they're creating, which seems to me to be a little inspired by \"The Walking Dead - Season 3\" except set in the Half-Life universe. The artwork as well as the narrative which floats back and forth between the humans and the vortigaunt harmonizes a lot better this time around.","timestamp_created":1490965970,"timestamp_updated":1575869604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":34,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.75142139196395874","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwirzJ9O4Cf/PYdQ=="}
