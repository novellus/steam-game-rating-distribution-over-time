    review: Got it on sale with a friend and it was a ton of fun to noodle through
      the puzzles together. A fun mix of work and number and pattern puzzles and a
      good time to be had solving clues together.  Story was a little creepy a little
      silly but over all fun. Though had some glitches that made us have to restart
      the chapter a few times, but still would recommend. I'm sad it's over and wish
      there were more types of puzzles at the last half of the game, but not bad at
      all.
