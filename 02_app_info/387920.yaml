    about_the_game: Mushihimesama V1.5, also known as &quot;Matsuri&quot; mode, is
      an alternate game mode for Mushihimesama with remixed content and new game mechanics.  <br><br>There
      are a number of differences compared to the original game:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>The
      stages have an alternate, more saturated color palette.<br></li><li>An awesome
      remixed soundtrack exclusive to this mode.<br></li><li>Enemies are positioned
      in new locations and fire somewhat different shot patterns.  Some strategies
      will need to be re-learned.<br></li><li>You can collect amber from the ground
      by holding the focus shot button.<br></li><li>You begin with two options equipped.</li></ul><br>You
      can also activate MAX mode by selecting full power weapons in the weapon selection
      screen.  There are a number of additional changes specific to MAX mode:<br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>You begin with a fully powered weapon right at the start of
      the game, but at the cost of increased difficulty and bullet speed.<br></li><li>Collecting
      amber chips increases your counter.  You can generate large amber by shooting
      enemies at point blank range to increase the counter faster.<br></li><li>Bullets
      are much faster when the counter is over 10,000 or 50,000, but you will get
      increased points.<br></li><li>You begin with only one bomb, but with the MAX
      mode enabled Reco will defend herself automatically if hit.</li></ul>  <br><br>MAX
      mode encourages a very aggressive play style right from the start of the game
      and presents a different challenge for veteran players to enjoy.
