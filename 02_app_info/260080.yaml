    review: The most recent member of the Classic Pack, You Don't Know Jack Volume
      6 The Lost Gold offers a dazzling art style and fresh graphics.  In a bizarre
      turn of events, a plot is attached to the game.  A pirate, through the shenanigans
      of treasure-seeking, is trapped by a curse.  The only way to free him is, you
      guessed it, winning money through the game.  After a certain amount is collected,
      he'll be freed from his supernatural bonds.  In fact, every now and then the
      pirate will attempt to help secure his freedom by sneaking a pirate-themed question
      into the game.  These questions are in the vein of the Impossible Questions
      of Volume 3, but centered around pirate knowledge (for example, one question
      asks for the name of Blackbeard's parrot).  Beyond that, everything else is
      standard fare.  Like The Ride and Headrush, there's no option to select how
      many questions the game will have and the comedy is stellar as always.  The
      Lost Gold is certainly worth all of your doubloons and is great to share with
      friends over a bottle of rum.
