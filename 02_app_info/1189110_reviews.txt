The rocks have no collider, you can go through the rocks. The doors of the church have an extremely bad texture quality. The DLC packs used to be very professional!   \nI bought all DLC packs and was always very satisfied,\nbut the Cemetery DLC was very disappointing. I hope that next DLC packs will have the usual high quality again.\n\n","timestamp_created":1576367059,"timestamp_updated":1576367059,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578947365283966064","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g46zg+8CdrWw5AE="}
