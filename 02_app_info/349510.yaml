      /><br>Choose Warriors destined to decide the future of Japan: The Kenshi (Swordsman),
      Naginatashi (Pikeman), Ite (Archer) or Ninja (Assassin). All featuring their
      own style of combat, movement and weaponry.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/349510/extras/ea3_combat_comp.gif?t=1606114628"
      /><br>Master Combat through discovery of different attacks, abilities and combos.
      Our combat system features multiple offensive stances driven by your movement,
      defensive techniques (such as the grappling hook) and abilities (ranging from
      acrobatic combos to multi-enemy sweeps to multi-hit combos).<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/349510/extras/faq.png?t=1606114628"
      /><br><strong><br>What kind of gameplay is this game offering? </strong><br>We
      plan to offer a multiplayer experience with several modes of gameplay taking
      familiar elements and expanding them to fit the game''s backstory and to introduce
      fun and engaging new experiences. Combat is based on your movement direction
      and supplemented by abilities ranging from strong stunning dashes, to multi-hit
      combos and Master level abilities.<br><br><strong>Any customization for the
      different character classes? </strong><br>We are planning on adding some customization
      to the characters &amp; weapons. Like all things this will be determined by
      effort needed/budget. We will likely add weapon skins before characters since
      our content team is limited.<br><br><strong>Will the game have any single-player
      gameplay?</strong> <br>Co-op Vs. AI Mode launching In Early Access v.3 (Apr
      5, 2019) will be playable solo. The tutorial is single-player and you can play
      any map with/against AI.<br><br><strong>Are you planning on bringing the game
      to other platforms? </strong><br>Other systems is something we would like to
      strive for. If we can do it, what other systems we would go onto are still &quot;up
      in the air&quot; questions. Our first and foremost goal is making this game
      the best it can be for Steam. <br><br><strong>What languages will this game
      be in? </strong><br>Well English first and foremost but we plan to do at least
      3-4 others. In fact we put out a survey to collect answers from you as to what
      language do you play your games in which you can fill out at <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://language.hanakogame.com"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"  >language.hanakogame.com</a> <br><strong><br>Where
