It has a similar feel as Reign of Darkness except it's a diablo-esque top down rpg. There are a few issues now and again but nothing game breaking which is surprising since It's in Alpha. \n\nPersonally I think the Creator has done a wonderful job with how far along the game is being in the very beginner stages of Alpha and all. I'm looking forward to future updates. :)","timestamp_created":1601335440,"timestamp_updated":1601335440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwqPbB6/QCdpvdpAI="}
