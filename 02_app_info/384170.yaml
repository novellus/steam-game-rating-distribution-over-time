    review: "When it comes to this soundtrack DLC, we could say that the developers\
      \ are trying to get money for something they got for free: the music here is\
      \ a compilation of royalty-free tracks made by Kevin MacLeod.\nBut in reality,\
      \ it is just another \u2018Thank you\u2019 tipping button next to the [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/384171/]official\
      \ DLC[/url]. And instead of giving you a useless in-game item, this pack delivers\
      \ some actual content, in this case some nice upbeat background tunes."
