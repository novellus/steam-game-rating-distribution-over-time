        GPU, anything made since 2004 should work. However, on old hardware, you may
        encounter performance or texturing limitations mainly based on the amount
        of RAM available. Integrated GPUs (mostly Intel) should be avoided in favor
        of dedicated GPUs (nVidia, AMD).</li></ul>
