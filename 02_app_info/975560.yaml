    review: "To start, I was not really familiar with Homestuck universe before playing\
      \ several volumes of Hiveswamp. \n\nThat being said, I think this volume is\
      \ quite good when compared to the volume 1 which I liked too. The reason I jumped\
      \ right to this volume and one of the reasons I got the game in particular is\
      \ actually [b]the music[/b]. The entire OST is great, but I discovered it by\
      \ one track from this volume made in collaboration with [b]Toby Fox[/b] (Undertale).\
      \ After that I got curious to see the story behind. Won't spoil it for you,\
      \ you can experience the clown-fest for yourself :) \n\nThe writing is great\
      \ along all volumes I've read, many references are present, world-building made\
      \ me want to read the original web-comic. Definitely recommended if you are\
      \ interested in the series. And check the soundtrack!"
