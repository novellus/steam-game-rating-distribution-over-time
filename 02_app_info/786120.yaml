    about_the_game: In this game, you must take down an empire of evil, corrupt space
      ships, and restore peace to the universe.<br>To do this, you must take out as
      many ships as you can, as well as defeat the emperor, who is hiding out in an
      other dimension, in an arena, top down shooter-style game made entirely by 1
      person.<br><br>This game is a retro-style top down shooter space arena fighter
      game that will provide you with [hopefully] hours of hilarious content.<br>There
      are three main game modes to this game. The first, which is available by default,
      is a &quot;story mode&quot; this mode allows you to play the game with an objective
      in mind. By completing this game mode, you will unlock two additional secret
      game modes. Both of which add a unique twist to the game<br><br>The game also
      includes a full modding API. The modding instruction document is about 30 pages
      long, and is filled with Python-based modding. The API is so open, and free,
      you could technically build an entirely different game on top of the original
      game! The modding allows access to a few Python modules, including Pygame, random,
      time, and TkInter! A complete list can be found in the modding API documentation.<br><br>If
      you are new to the game, there is a skip-able tutorial where you can learn the
      basic game mechanics. I would highly recommend that you go through this before
      playing!<br><br>What's more is that there is over 30 seconds of credits you
      can watch over, and over again!<br><br>Good luck, and may the stars align in
      your favor!

    review: 'This game makes my nipples hard. Like, very hard. So hard that they''re
      indestructable. And their frosty too.~

      ...this review is the biggest regret in my life...

      And oh yeah, the game''s pretty good too I guess.'
