    review: "My Dream is a building game like Minecraft, but MyDream managed to make\
      \ me play for hours. you can create a radome world or play online and visit\
      \ other people's world, the game have good Graphics and nice soundtrack.\nThe\
      \ only things I can complain are absence of tutorial and on the speed at which\
      \ the tips on Load Screen are changed, is very fast and does not allow any reading.\n\
      but, is just a Early access and probably still will be many updates. **********************************************************************************************\n\
      UPDATE ONLY ABOUT 9 HOURS AFTER MY REVIEW WENT UP ON STEAM HERE:\n\nI gotta\
      \ say, this is how you handle criticism on your early access game! These developers\
      \ didn't take the only review so far ...my original review found below, being\
      \ negative and basically saying this game is too early in its development status\
      \ to charge $30 USD. \n\n..These developers LISTENED to me... and to the other\
      \ people in the community forums saying that this game is asking too much money\
      \ for it's early state of development!\n\nI will leave my original review unchanged\
      \ below just so that viewers can see my original first review based on this\
      \ games original $29.99 USD price tag at it's early access launch.\n\nBut because\
      \ of the developers listening to this only review so far... and the other posters\
      \ on the forums here... I must say that I LOVE this kind of professional response\
      \ so quick from them.\n\n..They didn't blame me for having an insufficient computer\
      \ or blame the way I played their game.\n\n..They didn't make excuses of any\
      \ kind.\n\n...They simply listened and dropped their price in half, and are\
      \ offing refunds to anyone who purchased this game at it's original price tag\
      \ for early access of $29.99 USD.\n\n....And for that reason, and because I\
      \ do believe this game certainly shows a ton of potential... and also because\
      \ I can see most users getting $15 USD worth of fun out of this game in its\
      \ current state, then I am CHANGING my review from a negative to a positive\
      \ review. Obviously, changing the price doesn't fix the problems, bugs, or make\
      \ the game itself any different. But what it does do is shows me that this development\
      \ team listens to feedback which is HUGE! I do believe they will fix bugs and\
      \ continue to give this game updates and make it better and better as well.\n\
      \nIt is now worth it's asking price. And it has developers who listen and react\
      \ quickly to criticism rather then act like cocky jackazzes who make every excuse\
      \ in the book (we've all seen too many developers like that, right?) \n\nThank\
      \ you developers for listening. And reactiving professionally. You have my support\
      \ now, and I will in turn play your game more, upload more videos, and share\
      \ why \"MyDream\" is worth it's new asking price!\n\n....If only more developers\
      \ were like this! Other developers can and should learn from this! :-)\n\n******************************************************************************************************\n\
      \n---- EVERYTHING BELOW SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS WAS\
      \ BASED ON THIS GAMES INITIAL ASKING PRICE OF $29.99 USD AND BEFORE THEY SHOWED\
      \ THEY CARE ABOUT LISTENING TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND REACTING QUICKLY AND PROFESSIONALLY.\
      \ THIS ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW WILL REMAIN UN-ALTERED, HOWEVER WHAT I STATE ABOVE\
      \ SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS MOST RECENT REACTIONS FROM MYSELF ON THE VALUE OF\
      \ THIS GAME, THANK YOU. ---\n----------------------- ------------------------------\
      \ -------------------------\n\nWatch My Video Review At This Early Access Launch\
      \ Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92lNiAhKn28\n\nOkay, against my better\
      \ judgement, I bought into this game.. another early access sandbox voxel world\
      \ game at what seems like a hefty price. \n\nAfter 3 days, not a single review\
      \ has come in for this game, and I decided to be the first one to buy it, play\
      \ it, and give all of you out there my 'honest' thoughts and opinion as to whether\
      \ this game is worth it right now. The key words being \"right now\" as of February\
      \ 23, 2015. Things can change over time, and this game could be completely different\
      \ and much more evolved in two or three months then it is right now, just three\
      \ days after it's Steam early access launch.\n\nSo... is MyDream worth it's\
      \ asking price?\n\nIn my opinion, as much as I want to like this game... my\
      \ answer is a firm NO. I think that answer would apply to most people who might\
      \ be looking at this game with interest or curiosity. For most people, I think\
      \ there are better options out there for your money. \n\nMinecraft is cheaper\
      \ right now and offers tons of player support, community add on, mods, texture\
      \ packs and more available for free. \n\nCreativerse right now is $10 cheaper,\
      \ will be free-to-play sometime in the next 6-8 months likely and I believe\
      \ is much further evolved and more playable then is this game. \n\nIf creating\
      \ quests and placing treasure and loot and monsters is what you are looking\
      \ for, then please take a strong look at 'Fight The Dragon' at half the price\
      \ of this games current asking price. Fight The Dragon is much more complete\
      \ and fun in my opinion then this game is currently.\n\nAll of the above options\
      \ would be my recommended options for people looking at this game to consider\
      \ first. There of course are always exceptions to the rule. I'm sure there are\
      \ some people who love creating things that might easily get their moneys worth\
      \ and be happy... but again.. I think that kinda person would be an exception\
      \ rather then the typical onlooker curious about this game. Most people will\
      \ probably feel a little scorched for their dollar paying $30 for this game\
      \ right NOW in the state it is in currently.\n\nRight now, there just isn't\
      \ enough finished tools in the game, nor enough players actively playing or\
      \ even on this game's own websites forums to support their asking price. Again,\
      \ this is only my opinion... and I really WANT to like this game and give it\
      \ my thumbs up, but I just can't honestly do that now. I will come back and\
      \ re-review this game in four to six months and see how much has changed and\
      \ if I feel differently at that time, but for now, I have to give this game\
      \ a thumbs down. (If it were half it's asking price now of $15 USD, then I would\
      \ likely give it a pass, but $30 is just far too much for what you get now I\
      \ believe)\n\nIf you are looking for specific reasons as to why I say \"NO BUY\"\
      \ on this game now, please watch my video above, at the top of this review.\
      \ You should see many specific reasons in that video as to why I give this game\
      \ a thumbs down review currently. \n\nI hope that my honest review here has\
      \ helped save someone some money and more importantly saved them the disappointment\
      \ I felt with this game at it's current early access state of development.\n\
      \nSorry devs! I DO see a ton of potential for this game... please keep up the\
      \ hard work! I'd love to be able to play this game in a few months and change\
      \ my opinion around 180 degrees and become a supporter and lover of this game!\
      \ MyDream is a fantastic open world - sandbox game that will lead you to adventure.\
      \ Explore and build your own world using wide variety of tools and assets provided\
      \ or play online and join other worlds! \n\nKeep in mind that it's still in\
      \ early access and there might be few annoyances but I'm sure things will iron\
      \ out with each update. MyDream is the answer to the question, \"What if Minecraft\
      \ and RPG Maker had a baby?\" It's a game based around user-generated, story-driven\
      \ voxelized worlds where just about anything goes, and this gives it a lot of\
      \ potential.\n\nThe graphics are decent, although they're much better than that\
      \ OTHER voxel-based sandbox game everyone enjoys. I'm playing on a laptop with\
      \ an integrated graphics card, too, so I'm sure it's not running at the highest\
      \ quality the Unity engine delivers. Audio quality is good, but I'm not much\
      \ of a techno/electro fan.\n\nI had issues connecting to other worlds, in that\
      \ I attempted to join four/five of the most popular worlds for at least five\
      \ minutes each \n \n\n- Zaxx\n\nIf you like sand box game, you'll like MyDream.\n\
