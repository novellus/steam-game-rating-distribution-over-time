Perfect focussing music for a game that requires a lot of it. I use the OST outside of the game for cracking down on university assignments. I won't say that Baba is You has the greatest game OST of all time, but it's certainly my favourite.","timestamp_created":1608890738,"timestamp_updated":1608890738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1YzXzPYCc42BvQI="}
