The graphics style is unique, in a pleasing way to me, and who doesn't want to play as a wolf?  However, the gameplay is less than desirable to me.  I haven't played it for very long so it's possible it could grow on me.  What bothers me the most is there's no way you can distinguish areas where you can't go, and areas where you can.  A tall dune that looks like it's a blockade, actually lets you run right over it- whereas you'll be out in open space and run into an invisible wall that you can't walk past.  And as you're running through trees, rather than going transparent after the wolf runs through them to allow you to see where he's going, they completely block your screen so you can't see what's ahead.  I stopped playing after I came upon a large crate that was movable- and I'm guessing is part of solving the first puzzle- because pushing it in whatever direction you want to go is incredibly frustrating with the way the mechanics of the game cause it to move.  Maybe you don't actually need the crate so it doesn't matter if it's difficult to move, but at that point I kind of just lost interest.  If these issues were fixed- mostly just the first one about world boundaries- I would totally be interested in playing this game.","timestamp_created":1607114785,"timestamp_updated":1607114785,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jrDgl/YCdv+qtwI="}
