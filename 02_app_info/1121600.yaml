    about_the_game: This DLC (add-on) from eSail helps you practise your man overboard
      (MOB) drill. It includes tutorials, challenges and random triggering of MOB
      during normal sailing. Developed with Keith Colwell (RYA Sea Survival Handbook),
      the drill includes heaving-to, deploying equipment and recovery of the MOB under
      power and sail.  <br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> MOB Quick Stop Method (Under
      Power).  This tutorial takes you through the process of MOB recovery including
      heaving-to, triggering a DSC distress alert, deploying the danbuoy &amp; horseshoe
      lifebuoy, starting the engine and returning to the casualty under power. <br><br></li><li>
      MOB Quick Stop Method (Under Sail). This tutorial begins with heaving-to but
      when you try to start the engine it fails.  The lesson then follows through
      the process of making a figure-of-eigth turn then stopping and recovering the
      MOB under sail.<br><br></li><li> Live Sailing mode.  In Live Sailing you can
      opt to randomly trigger man overboard.  This is a great way of building your
      ability to react in the correct way during an emergency.  You can change the
      frequency of the random MOB as well as how often the engine should fail.<br><br></li><li>
      Challenges are provided for man overboard where you can pit your skills against
      other eSail users. There is a choice of 'Under Power' and 'Under Sail'.</li></ul><br><strong>IMPORTANT
      NOTES</strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> The technique used is the Quick Stop/Heaving-to
      method, followed by a figure-of-eight (when under sail) then picking up the
      MOB on the leeward side of the boat. <br></li><li> For consistency with real
      world training, the man overboard is represented by a fender and bucket. Recovery
      is by using a boathook. The training does not cover recovery methods likely
      to be used to bring a real person back on board as these are very boat specific.   The
      add-on does not in any way replace training and practise on a real boat.<br></li><li>
      The add-on is intended for eSailors of intermediate or advanced level.</li></ul><br>Man
      Overboard was created in close collaboration with Keith Colwell. Keith trained
      as a naval architect at Southampton and Sunderland Colleges in the late 1970s.
      Following a couple of years as a development engineer for a small workboat builder,
      he was offered the role of Technical Reporter on the magazine Motor Boat and
      Yachting, before moving on to become Technical Editor (Power) and then Deputy
      Editor of Practical Boat Owner (PBO) magazine and finally Development Editor
      of Sailing Today. After a 22-year career as a staff boating journalist testing
      boats and equipment, Keith made a career change and joined the Royal National
      Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) as a Sea Safety Manager.<br><br>During his 15 years
      with the RNLI, Keith trained and managed RNLI Sea Safety and Community Safety
      volunteers to give advice to yachtsmen, boat users and the general public on
      how to stay safe when on or by the water. He became a RYA sea survival, powerboat
      and marine vhf radio instructor/assessor in 2004, while working for the RNLI,
      and currently works as a freelance instructor.<br><br>He is the author of the
      internationally-published RYA Sea Survival Handbook and the RYA Boat Safety
      Handbook and continues to write for PBO magazine as their sea safety correspondent.

    review: 'As well as two new tutorials and the challenges, we now have the possibility
      of random MOB events in Live Sailing, with the added complexity of random engine
      failure. Living with that prospect as you sail around adds a nice new element
      to things.


      I already felt like I had a working little yacht full of kit - charts and fenders
      and pencils and winch handles, plus a hand compass added recently - and now
      I''ve got the fender and bucket, a boat hook, I can chuck that dan buoy off
      the back at last, and I''ve got more buttons to press - plus more things to
      tell my slow-loving crew to get on and do slowly. I do think we need a SHOUT
      AT THE CREW button to speed them up, especially when Bob the MOB is slowly sinking
      as his wellies fill with seawater, while the crew plod around, looking for a
      boat hook.


      Having the tutorials added to everything that eSail already teaches you is also
      great, adding more value to everything that''s packed into eSail. I''ll be honest,
      I''d rather see more serious stuff like this, than some of the other less realistic
      elements (dinosaur on a beach, I''m looking at you).


      This is a great add-on for eSail. I''m happy to support the devs as they keep
      building the base product and squashing bugs. They''re communicative, supportive
      and approachable, so I was always going to go for this anyway. But, yes, I think
      that the extra depth this DLC adds to what you can do in the world is well worth
      the price tag.'
