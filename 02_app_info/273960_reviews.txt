It is disappointing the amount of Bugs that this title has. The two which pretty much break the game are: 1. At times your units will stand there and get slaughtered without returning fire and 2. The UI in the lower right hand of the screen will disappear -- meaning you can't interact with mission objectives, reinforce, order new troops etc. Balance and difficulty are also factors which haven't been well considered in this title. Furthermore, in light of all these problems, that fact that you can't save mid-mission is a real kick in the teeth, esp. when a bug is encountered which makes completing a mission impossible.","timestamp_created":1492932941,"timestamp_updated":1607191639,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57362055778503418","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vcaFmvYCf4e6dw=="}
