No players.\n\nIt looks like there's a potential game here waiting to be built, but feels like an unfinished alpha or demo.  There's no explanation of basic gameplay, why you have two decks, which cards you can draw or play when, why there's a dice button that doesn't seem to do anything, why you sometimes receive cards without drawing them, why the same card sometimes has different costs, what the symbols in the corner of the screen mean, what the numbers on the sides mean, why your attacks sometimes cause more or less damage, how to get the special attacks and what they do, etc.  It's all a big black-box mystery.\n\nYou'd think with not understanding the rules, gameplay, or UI, that it would be difficult.  But chances are, you'll win your very first game against the AI anyway, and every game thereafter.  There's no real single-player game here in that it would be very difficult to lose even when you have no idea what you're doing.  So it relies entirely on multiplayer, but no one seems to be currently playing it.  At the moment, only one reviewer has even played for 1 full hour.  (You can play over a dozen games in less than an hour.)\n\nThere's the potential for a game here, but it's been languishing for over a year since release.  If the developers come back to it and flesh it out, it could someday become a fun fast card game.  But in its current state, unfortunately I can't recommend it.","timestamp_created":1593380557,"timestamp_updated":1593380557,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550354599952697754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jLq4/vICdNSTkQI="}
