      [b]Beach anime day[/b] is a jigsaw puzzle game with a beach and pixel aesthetic.\n\
      \n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThis is a basic jigsaw puzzle game, with adjustable difficulty.\
      \ After selecting a stage, you begin with a collection of scrambled tiles. When\
      \ (correctly) assembled, they form an (animated) image. You are timed, and if\
      \ you run out of time, you will lose a heart. If you lose all your hearts, it's\
      \ game-over.\n\nThere are twenty-one stages and eleven pieces of art to put\
      \ together.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThere is no story or character bios. Moving on.\n\
      \n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe title screen is simple and clean, sporting a pixel aesthetic\
      \ and animated bikini babe. She flaps her arms and eyes with ceaseless determination.\
      \ In-game, the center of the screen is reserved for the puzzle, and the remainder\
      \ for your time, hearts and pieces. For some bizarre reason, the developers\
      \ didn't implement a means to disable sound.\n\n. . . so I had to mute the game\
      \ via my Windows \"App Volume\" settings, just to keep rockin' to my jams.\n\
      \nThe moment I saw this game, I thought that I had seen the assets before. There's\
      \ another game I played, with [i]strikingly[/i] similar sprites, mechanics and\
      \ overall user interface. The game in question has been removed from the Steam\
      \ Store, so I can't provide a link. But I'm suspecting an asset flip.\n\n[b]-\
      \ The Goods -[/b]\nThe artwork looks decent, but I was not [i]super[/i] impressed\
      \ with the animations. As a pixel artist (myself), a lot of the girls use the\
      \ same base, which becomes clear when compared side-by-side. The animations\
      \ seemed to imply that the girls were made of jelly, and lacked bones. As there\
      \ is no gallery, you have to re-solve puzzles anytime you want to review an\
      \ image. You can't fullscreen puzzles that you have solved.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\
      As this title lacks [i]the most basic[/i] of features you'd expect in a jigsaw\
      \ puzzle (from a gallery to turning off sound), I'm going to give this game\
      \ a [i]thumbs down.[/i] Unless you specifically [i]need[/i] a pixel aesthetic,\
      \ I would look elsewhere for your jigsaw fix.\n\n[h1]Support the Wombat[/h1]\n\
      If you enjoy my reviews, please follow my Curator page. The power of [i]wombats[/i]\
      \ compels you!\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/36272124-Wombat-Trap/"
