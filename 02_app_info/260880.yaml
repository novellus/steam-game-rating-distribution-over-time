    review: '[b]DLC verdict: Get it in the Deluxe Edition bundle[/b]


      [b]Comment:[/b]

      There are plenty of songs here, some better than others, but no really bad ones.
      However, nothing really sticks out for me. As a whole it''s a nice addition
      to my OST library but for me it is more about supporting the devs than anything
      else. If you loved the music in the game get this DLC on a sale to support the
      devs ... but the better option is the Deluxe Edition bundle/upgrade because
      that should have this soundtrack already.
