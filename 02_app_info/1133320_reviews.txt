The first thing you should do, is to disable the default walking scheme and enable thumbstick movement - otherwise it is a real pain to move around. After that Westworld is quite enjoyable  - especially if you like the TV show. The scenes, models, lighting, voice acting and facial expressions are great, but don't expect a physics engine, combat, fancy user interfaces etc. Besides hiding, running around, scanning tablets and flipping switches there is not much action, but that's okay. This game is more like an interactive movie with game elements and I like it for what it is. You should get it when it's on sale - 3 hours is a bit short for the full price.","timestamp_created":1609802393,"timestamp_updated":1609802393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42uTs5/YCdpfFwAI="}
