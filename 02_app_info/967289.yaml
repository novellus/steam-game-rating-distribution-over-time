      \ reaching the end of its innovative life, and with an expected growth in the\
      \ European market within the next decade, engineers looked to evolve the platform\
      \ into something new.<br><br>After taking inspiration from the latest designs,\
      \ a new family of locomotives emerged, the Vectron. Adaptable and reliable,\
      \ the Vectron could be suited to any duty, and come equipped with electric,\
      \ diesel, or dual-mode operation.<br><br>Many railway operators placed orders\
      \ for Vectrons in various configurations, including the Austrian Federal Railways,\
      \ who in 2017 pledged to take up to 200 of these new locomotives which they\
      \ would classify as the \xD6BB 1293.<br><br>The \xD6BB 1293 was ordered on the\

    review: 'NOT A PRO RANGE!

      The model is not bad, but it has simplified controls (compared to RSSLO Vectron
      Advanced, which much more fun to drive, but not available from Steam store).

      Also, it doesn''t worth separate purchase. Get excellent RSSLO Karabankenbahn
      route, and you will get this locomotive for free with some extras'
