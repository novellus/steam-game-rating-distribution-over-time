    review: "Likeable, but also quite frustrating, puzzler / climber.\n\nNo locomotion.\
      \ I found myself hitting the walls of my room with a controller too much because\
      \ the edges of the play area were just a little small.\n\nQuite janky at times,\
      \ and needs haptic feedback on controllers when climbing. \n\nShort, and the\
      \ story is really appalling."
