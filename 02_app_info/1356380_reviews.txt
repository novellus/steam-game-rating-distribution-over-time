Although I admittedly don't have much experience with physics-based puzzle games, I've never played anything like it. The level design is quite good, in general. I liked the feeling of simply moving the pendulum (as it has a certain weight to it), and in trying to maintain enough height to maneuver with some precision. I decided to pick up Pendelum so that my co-op partner and I could play through the three sets of levels designed specifically for co-op play. \n\nHowever, I do have a few gripes. First of all, it's just a bit too punishing for my tastes. Levels come in sets of four, and if you don't complete the whole set in one go, you'll have to start again from the first one in the set (even if you've made it to the final level). There are also no checkpoints in the levels themselves. This omission is more forgivable - however, some of the levels are quite long. My co-op partner and I failed repeatedly on the penultimate level within the second set of co-op levels, and then put the game down until the following week. We picked it back up again, made it to the final level, but again failed repeatedly until we became exhausted with the game.\n\nWhen you play a level as many times as we did, certain things begin to grate. The pleasant & chipper music becomes obnoxious, you realize how some of the levels require one player to just sit around while the other performs a task (rather than playing simultaneously), and you notice how certain level obstacles can be a bit unpredictable (like the rows of fans). When you fail when navigating obstacles like this, it can be difficult to tell exactly what you've done wrong.\n\nI can't say that we didn't enjoy at least some of our time with Pendelum, but I think we would have been more persistent if it were easier to put it down and pick it back up later, and if we could more quickly and easily try the most challenging sections of various levels.","timestamp_created":1603139759,"timestamp_updated":1603140591,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.438957482576370239","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42YOoofUCc9XyqAI="}
