Its simple, but complex at the same time. i really like its style. i do, however, wish that the dev would update the game with some better graphics, and maybe other stuff. theres alot of factory games out there, and this i think is the first one in VR. i wish it was more like factorio, where you gather resources to build, but the puzzle solving levels work good too. then agian you can always just build a massive factory of your own.\nSo ya i had fun, and will definately beat all the levels. which for the price, theres quite alot. im impressed. i expected very little, but it surprised me alot.\n\nIf the dev does decide to add to this game, hopefully better graphics and animations would be nice, also a way to share workshop levels, so any vr player can play eachothers level. considering there is no  gravity, you could add a few more cool block tools. also more levels is always nice.  Also the name kinda sux. nan industrys....\n\nfor the price i definitely reccomend this one of its something your into.","timestamp_created":1569233298,"timestamp_updated":1569233356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480057060718536377","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzpjmru0CdtDe0gE="}
