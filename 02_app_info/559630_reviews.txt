Three times I was blasted by a continual wave of wasps.  Three times I was sent back to the start to do it all again (you can't remap the controls - more later).  Guess what.  I'm not doing it again, and I wouldn't recommend anyone else did either.  Until they add restore points to this (or fix the controls) I wouldn't touch it.  How the hell did they think no restore points was a good idea?  Admittedly the levels are short but you can only belt a frog into a pond so many times before you tire of it.  It might look and sound good, but the \"one step forward, two steps back\" approach is just brutal.\nAnd those controls.  Hit the left trigger to \"shoulder punch\" to pick something up (because I always shoulder punch shit when I want to pick it up), then, while still holding the left trigger, move into position and then jump with a and throw with x.  Is this baby's first video game?\nPick up with x, throw with x.  I'm not a bloody contortionist.\nCome back when they've fixed this mess.\n","timestamp_created":1594145171,"timestamp_updated":1594145171,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ445ydlfMCea7MkwI="}
