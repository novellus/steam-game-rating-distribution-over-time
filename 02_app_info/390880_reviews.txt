Revising to a thumbs-down. I decided to uninstall this to make room for something else, and attempting to uninstall it completely crashed my Steam client and locked up my machine. Not worth the grief for a freaking spreadsheet game.\n\nActually a sideways thumb, neither up nor down. There's this old joke that says fantasy sports leagues are just D&D for jocks. Redemption is a sports game for D&D players. If you've played Age of Gladiators then for all intents and purposes you've played Redemption. (There are also any number of soccer management sims that fit this bill as well.) It's a \"murder hobo team management\" game, with all the cool fights and graphics removed. Another way to look at it is this: picture yourself as the manager/accountant for a team of dungeon crawlers in which your entire job is to review spreadsheets. THAT'S what Redemption is. I might have liked this a bit better if I hadn't played Age of Gladiators first. Redemption offers nothing new, but it does okay at what it does.","timestamp_created":1603107553,"timestamp_updated":1603495639,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/bbyq/UCd9znqAI="}
