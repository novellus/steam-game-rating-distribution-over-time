    review: 'Given that I''ve been buying H. I. S.''s payware packs since he started
      publishing them, I will say that this is another fine addition, and if you want
      to experience Soldier Summit, then this is the pack for you.


      Note: As of me writing this (1/4/20), I still cannot get Scenario 4, SP Local
      UT04L, to complete, even a year later. The automatic switch at Nash siding switches
      back to the main once I enter to do my work, and no matter what I do, the switch
      doesn''t change back. I''ve attempted to contact both HIS and DTG regarding
      this bug, but there hasn''t been a resolution. If anyone has been able to complete
      it, please let me know.


      Edit: As of 7/11/2020, the above-mentioned note is no longer valid as I have
      completed that particular scenario (FINALLY!)'
