Boy, were they wrong. One of the reviews complains about grammar. I don't see it. In fact, that guy's grammar is atrocious. Secondly, the developer states that the font makes the capital \"H\" look lower case. So, that explains a bit. Also the other reviews about the game being too hard? You have multiple characters that have one hit kill items across the map at the start of the game.  Also the side missions were very easy and my people are very strong. It just sounds like people are not actually playing the game and are quick to leave negative feedback. So, I just have to say... play the game. You won't be upset.","timestamp_created":1609127522,"timestamp_updated":1609127522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462532311677932739","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7a3e0/YCf7L9vQI="}
