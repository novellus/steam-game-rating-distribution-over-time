This was cheap, but it was not bad, at all.\n\nI wish there was more to the game such as a leaderboard of some sort, but for the price, that's not really a complaint.\nThere are only 20 levels, but due to the type of game, and again, the price, the levels are all different enough that it felt like the perfect amount of game play and experience for the price.\n\nI used a controller, and only used the keyboard to see if it made a difference in precision. For me, the controller worked great, but I think the keyboard would have worked just as well. I simply prefer the controller.\n\nSome levels are extremely easy, while others require precision jumping and landing. A couple levels made me want to send a \"grumble grumble\" email to the dev for making the level the way they did, but the collision detection did feel accurate, and I eventually beat the level.\nThere are \"cheap\" deaths that had me saying, \"Oh, come on!\" ...BUT at no time did I ever feel like the level was going to be impossible to beat. Just annoying because I would get to the end, not land perfectly, and have to restart. \nHowever, the levels are short enough that retrying over and over until I got it, didn't feel like torture, and I understood it was just part of the type of game I was playing.\n\nThough I am sure some people will nail it the first time and finish the game in no time, it logged my time as 3 hours...but I was not completely focused on the game by any means.\nI was managing multiple clicker games, checking stocks, doing research, had a business meeting and heart to heart with the wife, etc....so I'm honestly not sure how long it would have been if I just played straight through. Definitely not 3 hours lol\n\nOverall I enjoyed the challenge, got my achievements, and had a sense of accomplishment.\nI won't ever play this game again, not because I don't like it, but once I beat it...I felt good and moved on.\nThe game didn't do anything I haven't already seen a 100 times, but what it did was give me more of what I already knew I liked, and didn't over stay it's welcome in my life. \nI would definitely recommend it to achievement hunters, and anyone that just wants a quick challenge.","timestamp_created":1599207470,"timestamp_updated":1599207766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/76NrPQCevDWnwI="}
