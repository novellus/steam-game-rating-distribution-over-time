It has the same gameplay now as it did back then, and the only thing it ever lacked was a consistent playerbase. It was an esport before that term was ever created.\n\nIt's a shame that the Steam launch of UniBall completely killed it. I think it made the game more difficult to access for long-time players, and the only way I ever see another lobby filling is if it's reworked as a browser game.\n\nThanks for all the fun years.","timestamp_created":1487980028,"timestamp_updated":1561602203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ419Ovy+sCd6+Dcw=="}
