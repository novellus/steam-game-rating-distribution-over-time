    review: "I tried and I [b]really[/b] tried to play this game.\nI dont know [b]why[/b]\
      \ but as soon as I open the single player missions menu or the multiplayer missions\
      \ menu, the game begins to lag [b]very heavy[/b] (just image the game starter\
      \ counter is normaly 3 seconds but insteed its 30 seconds...). On the startscreen,\
      \ it runs smooth, ingame (after minutes of waiting coz of \"loading\") it also\
      \ runs smooth. \nI thought its my GC settings but those are all fine. i changed\
      \ the compatibly from win 8.1, 8, 7 and vistra - nothing helped. I changed the\
      \ ingame settings from Epic toll low and that also didnt helped. \n\nIts the\
      \ game itself. I tried to change it but i cant recomment it if that is \"normal\"\
      . its [b]NOT PLAYABLE[/b] in this state.\n\nI asked for a refund already. Its\
      \ sad, the game actually looks nice and i wish it would be playable - i sure\
      \ would enjoy it."
