    review: 'Achievementhunters: Take care, there are problems to get 100% !!!!!!!!!


      Wow, this game is a blast!


      Simple controls, non-stop action. It was a new gaming-experience for me (don''t
      know if there exist similar games). You find yourself constantly in hair-raising
      situations.


      Not much longevity, but very enjoyable while it lasts!
