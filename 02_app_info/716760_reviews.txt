So he soon sets out to find her.\n\nNow for the likes, the some of the music was okay and the background art was kind of nice looking. The enemy designs were cool looking like the faceless spiders monsters and I do like that at the start of a new chapter is told like a fairytale/story book opening.\n\nNow for the dislikes and there is a lot to dislike about this game. To start the story is very confusing, as I said at the start of a new chapter its has a fairytale/storybook opening. \n\nBut the problem with it is its very inconsistent and barely has anything to do with the boy’s story except for Lady Death, but it’s just too confusing and has nothing to do with the boy and his problem. \n\nThe Ending is also really bad and confusing, [spoiler] basically when we get to lady death she says that we have to get a box for her but we're never supposed to open it. but the boy does open it and it turns out that his family is okay but then it turns out he's not part of the family and he turns into some kind of demon thing, I don't know the game doesn't even have narration to explain what the hell happened. [/spoiler]\n\nthe game's graphics/picture is really bad, the game is black and white normally that's actually not a problem but in this game it has this very grainy look to it which can be hard to see sometimes and there's also this weird dark filter thing where this darkness closes in and out like your blinking and it got really, really annoying.\n\nThe gameplay can be very frustrating, it's a simple side-scroller but what made it bad and very annoying was all the damn traps in the game. There are tons of traps that kill you in one hit and when you’re trying to get past you have to be pinpoint accurate or you die. There were so many of them that it almost made me quit the game.\n\nThe game also has this power were you can switch between two different realities but you see in other games that have this kind of mechanic, it can help you solve puzzles or get past enemies. But in this game it's rarely used other than revealing some platforms or hidden doors or showing a hidden lever sometimes times, it doesn't make enemies disappear like in other reality altering games and it’s so rarely used you forget to use it until you’re stuck,\nIt also requires power to use and if your power for drained you have to die and collect the power ups to use it again. Sometimes the platforming can also be a pain we're even though your close to the next platform you still miss it and fall.\n\nThere's also bugs in the game now I don't know if this was my computer or the game, but when I was at one part of the cave level my computer kept going into power save mode and I had to unplug the cable to my computer screen and plug it back in, I even checked if everything was okay, it was. But it's still kept doing that, it did stop and I was able to beat level and it didn't show up again, so I don't know if it was my computer or the game itself. Just thought I'd mention it just in case it was the game. \n\nThe level designs in the game are really bad sometimes the worst being the cave level because of that bug I mentioned, the city level because there's a part in the game were you go into this house and you have to hit all the levers to unlock a door. \nbut it doesn't give an indication you have to hit four levers then the one you see and if you die you have to start all the way back to the beginning which can be a pain in the ass. And the Battlefield level with all the damned explosive traps.\n\nAnd what really makes this game so bad is the fact that it did have potential I mean given to a proper game developer I'm sure it would have been a classic but as it is right now well it's just garbage pure simple garbage.\n\nAll right then with all that said Dream Alone is a complete piece of trash and a horrible game, its story is bad, its gameplay is bad, its level designs are bad and even those I got this when it was on sale I still feel ripped off. So never ever get this game not even if it's on sale, not even if it was a gift.","timestamp_created":1608270589,"timestamp_updated":1608270663,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41dmZuvYCfLWOuwI="}
