I bought this to play in VR but it is just the regular 2-D game but you look at it in VR. The game isn't even that great but for a VR game it would be good if done right, and it's so close. All that needs to be done is instead of having the ship loop back around top to bottom and left to right when it goes out of bounds, just wrap the entire play space in a sphere!!!! Have enemies spawn on the opposite hemisphere of the ship and you can look with VR while still controling the exact same game. Huge dissappointment to see a game just one step away from being really cool.","timestamp_created":1515864798,"timestamp_updated":1583628354,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwneDm2/ACf+38lQE="}
