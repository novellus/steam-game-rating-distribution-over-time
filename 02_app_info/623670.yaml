    short_description: The goal of this game is to turn all the panels to face up.
      You can choose the level stage from EASY, NORMAL, and HARD. However, in order
      to play the NORMAL stage, you need to have passed all the EASY stages, and to
      play the HARD stage, all the NORMAL stages.
