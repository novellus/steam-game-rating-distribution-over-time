    about_the_game: Ghostory is a 2D platformer designed around switching between
      physical and ghostly forms in order to solve increasingly taxing puzzles. Despite
      starting off with a curse, this is a light-hearted adventure, with an engaging
      plot, retro-styled pixel art graphics, and a wild menagerie of puns.<br><br>Ghostory
      won the Best Student Project prize at Game Access 2016.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/568460/extras/gameplay24.png?t=1571587791"
      /><br>In human form players can interact with levers, pick up keys, jump, and
      carry the backpack they'll have to leave behind when incorporeal. In ghost form,
      they can fly and pass through walls. Clever use of both forms is what will allow
      them to survive and escape the cave unscathed.<br><br>The game comes packed
      with dozens of carefully-crafted levels meant to tax your logical and lateral
      thinking skills and is never afraid to introduce new mechanics and unique puzzles
      as players venture deeper into the cave. Ghostory, despite its simple controls,
      always remains challenging and keeps offering fresh, often multi-tier puzzles.<br><br><img

      /><br>In Ghostory, you take on the role of a lone traveler lost in the woods.
      Drinking water from a weird lake has placed a deadly curse on him, but also
      allowed him to transform into a ghost and fly - at will.<br><br>Thankfully,
      an old and irritatingly funny lady can help him prepare the required antidote,
      but she will need a very special mushroom for this. A mushroom that only grows
      in a seemingly safe cave nearby. Surely, nothing can go wrong now.
