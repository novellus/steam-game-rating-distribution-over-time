    review: "This gory FPS game is far from a polished title, but for just a dollar\
      \ or so, that is perhaps what you'd expect.\n\nFor the cons:\n\n* The graphic\
      \ design is quite basic. \n\n* There are some repetitive sounds (The first few\
      \ fights especially have the same basic enemy span and make their call over\
      \ and over again.)\n\n* Very simple hoard enemy spawns, where the game locks\
      \ a door and then makes you kill some enemy spawns, which sometimes will pop\
      \ into existence right in front of you.\n\n* Several bugs (the floor and some\
      \ other objects lacked collision in a few places).\n\n* Some poor tutorialisation.\
      \ Some later enemies require some specific actions to beat, and I feel they\
      \ could have been telegraphed slightly better, rather than just requiring some\
      \ trial and error.\n\n* Sparse story. The opening text/diary has some typos,\
      \ and you only get more text at the end. Clearly something is going on, and\
      \ while some visual/atmospheric information comes in, a tiny bit more writing\
      \ (like between levels) would have been good.\n\nBut it has some stuff going\
      \ for it:\n\n* The price. I got it on sale for 75 cents.\n\n* The weapon variety.\
      \ I counted 6 guns (and a melee weapon), 5 of them with a secondary fire, and\
      \ most of those secondary fires being somewhat relevant.\n\n* The enemy variety.\
      \ It starts off a bit boring, but gradually expands to more and more interesting\
      \ enemies (each vulnerable to different guns, I believe).\n\n* The atmosphere.\
      \ While in has some flaws, the gradual change of scenery, and the sense of discovery\
      \ as you progress, is pretty cool. I think this could have been enhanced by\
      \ that little bit of writing I suggested earlier.\n\n(I beat the game on the\
      \ 2nd hardest difficult in just under 2 hours, and haven't tried Survival mode\
      \ yet. I found the last boss a bit too hard, but not too bad.)"
