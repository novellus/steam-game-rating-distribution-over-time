    review: 'Terrible.


      The developer created pixel art with no concern over whether they function as
      picross. As a result, you are regularly left with multiple viable solutions
      and simply have to guess, fundamentally failing the most basic requirement of
      a logic puzzle.


      Beyond that, most of the puzzles inexplicably have to be unlocked, 1 by 1, with
      "stars". You can earn a maximum of 4 stars for a perfect solve, and the *minimum*
      price to unlock a puzzle is 5 stars... I''m sure you can see this is an inherently
      broken in-game economy, but the devs evidently could not - or, less charitably,
      they were planning this as a mobile game and intended to have in-app purchases,
      and wanted to make sure people were forced to pay in order to play.


      As I said - terrible. Don''t buy, at any price.'
