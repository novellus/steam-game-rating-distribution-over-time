    review: Very good and well modeled coaches, make a nice change to the GWR and
      BR Mk1 coaches that come with everything. Only complaint is that the interior
      views are very gliched. (the only way I can think to describe it is 'it looks
      like your lying down in a reclining chair, you can see a very gliched view out
      of the right and another coach interior on the left out of the windows') I would
      like to see a patch for this.
