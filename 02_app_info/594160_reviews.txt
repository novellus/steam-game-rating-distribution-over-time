Its a pretty short game, it can be completed in 30 minutes or less.\n\nIt has the usual GameGuru issues, awkward movements, stiff reloading, useless iron-sights, dumb AI, and choppy framerates. I can't blame the developer for these issues, as these issues should be fixed by the engine makers, The Game Creators (TGC). However, I will blame the developer for picking GG over Unreal and  Unity.\n\nUnlike some other GameGuru games, The Last Patient has a price tag slapped on it. I think I paid $0.49 for this game, so you can say that I got ripped off. This game is not worth $0.49, and its not worth your time.\n\nConclusion:\nAvoid it.","timestamp_created":1602920481,"timestamp_updated":1602920481,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jrDgmvUCesOuqAI="}
