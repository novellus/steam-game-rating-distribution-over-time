On other.. let's me be straight. For me, it was struggling, almost whole time. Story didn't touch me and in parts when I wasn't pursued by monster I suffered from very slowing storytelling. For comparison, first game could be beaten in something about two hours (here it took four, I tried to make it quick). And there wasn't any moment when I wanted to stop. \nSecond part is more flash-y, has more creaking sounds, its four acts (in fact five, but last one is short) are long and filled with information you couldn't understand at early stage. \nI get only one ending and I don't think I could bare another playthrough.","timestamp_created":1610020905,"timestamp_updated":1610020905,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gqyu7vYCetygwQI="}
