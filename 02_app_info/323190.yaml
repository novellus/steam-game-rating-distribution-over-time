      \ Frostpunk has been enriched with a number of updates. You can enjoy the new\
      \ <strong>Endless Mode </strong>(with 3 ways of playing it) that increases the\
      \ replayability of the game. There is also a <strong>new scenario - The Fall\
      \ of Winterhome</strong>, that further expands the game\u2019s universe and\
      \ lore. And for the dessert, we\u2019ve added things like <strong>naming characters\
      \ and automatons</strong> and finally a <strong>photo mode</strong>. All of\
      \ this is <strong>available for free</strong> for all the owners of the game.\
      \ There are also three expansions, available with the paid <strong>Season Pass</strong>.\
      \ At the same time we would like to inform you that we are not planning to create\
      \ any more content for Frostpunk, as this journey is over for us, but there\
      \ are more to come in the future, so be sure to keep an eye out for our games.\
      \ Of course the game will still receive patches and fixes and we\u2019ll provide\
      \ the technical support.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/323190/extras/Package_header_image_620x177.jpg.jpg?t=1603983228\"\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE CITY MUST SURVIVE</strong></h2><br>Frostpunk,\
      \ the newest title from the creators of This War of Mine, is a society survival\
      \ game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely\
      \ frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming\
      \ cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the\
      \ means necessary for your community to survive. <br><br>Optimization and resource\
      \ management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While\
      \ city and society management will consume most of the ruler\u2019s time, at\
      \ some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its\
      \ history and present state.<br><br>What decisions will you make to ensure the\
      \ survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who\
      \ will you become in the process?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MAKE THE LAW</strong></h2>Establish\
      \ laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their\
      \ working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday\
      \ life. Maintain their hope and contentment \u2013 the moral condition of your\
      \ society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.<br><img\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY</strong></h2>If you reach\
      \ a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should\
      \ you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith?\
      \ Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember:\
      \ there\u2019s no turning back.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/323190/extras/FP_STEAM_GIF_02.gif?t=1603983228\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES</strong></h2>Some of\
      \ your decisions will seem small \u2013 like deciding the fate of a troubled\
      \ citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction \u2013 but be aware that\
      \ the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their\
      \ faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.<br><img\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES</strong></h2>Survival\
      \ demands progress. React to current events, but don\u2019t forget about the\
      \ long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing\
      \ a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and\
      \ other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your\
      \ management and leadership skills.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/323190/extras/FP_STEAM_GIF_04.gif?t=1603983228\"\

      \ London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies\
      \ within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable\
      \ intel, precious supplies and grow your society\u2019s population. There may\
      \ be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.<br><img src=\"\

      \ Mode grants you unlimited replayability for the game. Play on 8 various maps,\
      \ with different terrain, weather conditions and challenges to face. We know\
      \ that different people look for different experiences and that\u2019s why there\
      \ are 3 modes to play in Endless Mode. Endurance will be an ultimate test to\
      \ your building, managing and survival skills in the harshest conditions. Builders,\
      \ where there is no generator available from the start, which creates a different\
      \ type of challenge. And last but not least, Serenity which is focused on enjoying\
      \ the art of building the city itself, without unnecessary pressure.  <br><img\
