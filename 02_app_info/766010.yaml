      is the fourth major game developed by <strong>Fabraz</strong>. The three previous
      titles being <strong>Planet Diver</strong>, <strong>Cannon Crasha</strong> and
      <strong>Wild Wild Pixel</strong>. <strong>Slime-san</strong> is a game that
      is fun down to its very core. A silly story, with an unlikely character and
      gameplay that is addictively fast. It features hours of single player content
      yet is tailored for speed runners as well. The very core mechanics and level
      design lend themselves to be played competitively online. It is a visually unique
      adventure using a carefully crafted, 5 color palette world that is filled with
      fun and goofy Japanese references. It also has a soundtrack that is worth the
      price alone, featuring some of the most popular chiptune composers in the world!

    review: If you see this review, I suggest you buy the full Slime-san game. This
      is a free update for the original game, but I still bought because I want to
      try the game on Steam instead of only on Switch. I have no regrets. It's a good
      add-on that's only a bit buggy or annoying to control in some places. The game's
      levels shine in terms of good design and being fun to speedrun.
