      notes: 'As players complete mission objectives, they use swords, axes, and spears
        to kill enemy warriors in melee-style combat. Blood-splatter effects occur
        frequently as enemies are killed; some areas depict large bloodstains and
        impaled heads on spikes. Players can also perform finishing attacks (e.g.,
        decapitation, impalements) that are sometimes highlighted by close-up camera
        angles. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: bound warriors decapitated
        by swords; characters executed with weapon strikes to the head'
