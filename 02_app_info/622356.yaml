      \ your night flying experience in Spain. Using a series of databases, this add-on\
      \ adds appropriate types of lighting to different kinds of roads and other areas.\
      \ Hundreds of thousands of lights clearly show how highways connect cities and\
      \ how smaller roads meander into neighbourhoods. Visual navigation at night\
      \ becomes an absolute joy with this stunning pack.<br><br>The Night Environment\
      \ database contains an incredible amount of accurate road data, more than default\
      \ FSX: Steam Edition, so roads will become visible at night where you wouldn\u2019\
      t normally see them during the day. All lights are potentially visible for 60\
      \ miles, so large urban areas and highway junctions will illuminate all around\
      \ you as you fly. As the highway lights are raised above the surface and have\
      \ a lit bitmap below them, a realistic 3D effect is created.<br><br>Night Environment\
