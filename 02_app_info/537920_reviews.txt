Bought it because I heard it had an asymmetric mode to play with friends, but we couldn't get that to work in any meaningful way (outside the second player controlling the VR player's body, which is instant naseua).  Controls were imprecise, couldn't ever get to the point where I was confidently doing what I wanted to do with my hands.\n\nGameplay is very simple, seems to just be a large arena with a maze in it, and the maze spawns loads of messed up looking monsters.","timestamp_created":1504135635,"timestamp_updated":1504135635,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4g4zemt4CdeiIhAE="}
