The Full Metal Mayhem have become my favourite Team, simply because of their Arena and the fact that all the players are parodies of real life musicians like Ronnie Maimes Dio and Mic Dagger. The Cracksumskull Jugulars are a parody of the Jacksonville Jaguars on the other hand. \n\nWith this DLC you also get another Race: The Hell-Spawned Demons. They are complete imune to Fire, wether it is Traps on the field or Dirty Tricks like Flame On. They also can jump the highest and stay a bit in the air thanks to their wings, making them absolutely perfect for interceptions. Their big weakness is their really bad health regeneration, they die a lot during longer matches just from all the punishment they receive. But overall, they are a good addition. \n\nAlso included are two Dirty Tricks. The Time Warp is really nasty, since you can use it after a play to erase that. So, let's say on Offensive you fumbled or the opponents intercepted your pass: Do the Time Warp and it never happened. It's also available on Defense for some team and the same applies: Enemies scored? Time Warp them back and they look really stupid. \nThe other is the Sonic Blast and is used for Pass Plays. Once the Receiver catches the Ball it will emit a massive blast wave that knocks down all defenders around it, usually leaving the way wide open for a easy Touchdown. \n\nI obviously recommend this one.","timestamp_created":1565466932,"timestamp_updated":1565466932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.58495020866394043","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsrbGvuwCcMSO0AE="}
