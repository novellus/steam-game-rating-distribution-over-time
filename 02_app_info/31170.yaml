    review: "Me ha gustado bastante esta quinta entrega de la saga Monkey Island.\
      \ Por la oferta que hab\xEDa de 3,12\u20AC merece mucho la pena. El juego tiene\
      \ gr\xE1ficos en 3D pero es mucho mejor que la cuarta entrega, la peor en mi\
      \ opini\xF3n. Nos encontraremos con personajes ya conocidos como: LeChuck, Elaine,\
      \ Murray, la se\xF1ora Vud\xFA y Stan. Tambi\xE9n hay personajes nuevos, algunos\
      \ muy carism\xE1ticos. La narrativa del juego mantiene el inter\xE9s durante\
      \ los cinco cap\xEDtulos, el quinto cap\xEDtulo quiz\xE1 es el m\xE1s complicado\
      \ por la mec\xE1nica y el nivel de puzles. Adem\xE1s, podemos instalarle un\
      \ parche para la traducci\xF3n al espa\xF1ol y por lo menos tener los subt\xED\
      tulos, aqu\xED est\xE1n las instrucciones: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=958048643"
