      \ I do not think this tool is not even worth $40 now. Except the visual graphic,\
      \ nothing is better than RPG maker 2000. I'll wait for sale or update.\n\n\n\
      What I did not like\n1.Very poor event system.\n2.No hot keys(playtest, utilities\
      \ etc.).\n3.Price\n\nPlease tell me if these things are because I am using the\
      \ trial version."
