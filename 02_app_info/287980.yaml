      \ /><br>In Mini Metro, you take on the task of designing the subway layout for\
      \ a rapidly expanding city. Your city starts with three stations. Draw routes\
      \ between these stations to connect them with subway lines. Commuters travel\
      \ along your lines to get around the city as fast as they can. Each station\
      \ can only hold a handful of waiting commuters so your subway network will need\
      \ to be well-designed to avoid delays.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/287980/extras/MM_SteamHeaderGIF02.gif?t=1608072693\"\
      \ /><br>The city is growing. More stations are opening, and commuters are appearing\
      \ faster. The demands on your network are ever-increasing. You'll be constantly\
      \ redesigning your lines to maximise efficiency. The new assets you earn every\
      \ week will help immensely \u2014 as long as they're used wisely.<br><br><img\

      \ /><br>Eventually your network will fail. Stations will open too quickly. Commuters\
      \ will crowd the platforms. How long the city keeps moving is up to you.<h2\

    review: 'Lots of maps to play on, most of which you likely won''t beat your first
      try. It''s difficult to make everything work, but it doesn''t feel difficult,
      and if you meet the fail condition, doesn''t force you to restart. Just asks
      if you want to restart or if you''d like to keep playing in Endless or Creative.
      Challenges for each level of which, again, there are many. Controls are simple
      and easy to learn. Even has a night mode.


      Only real downside is that some colors are too similar to each other, which
      might make it hard to keep track of your rails.


      Otherwise, if you''re into something that will kill time, this will certainly
      do it. Got it on sale, but it''s probably worth full price.'
