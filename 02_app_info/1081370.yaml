    review: 'Bought it as it looked interesting, currently only episode 0 is available
      and it''s around 20-25 minutes, like mentioned below this is a  cinematic visual
      novel and it''s fully voiced, this plays out just like a kinetic visual novel(but
      here no need to read as it''s fully voiced) at least for now as this have no
      choices, if there is an auto option to continue after conversation this will
      play out like an anime etc.

      Prologue doesn''t offer more info instead introduces to the world and gives
      as a brief intro of the world, we also get introduced to the protags.


      I don''t know how this will turn out but looks interesting for now.

      I didn''t see any Review in English so writing this so if any one interested
      gets to know what to expect.'
