If you have an issue with the newer version of PPG, you can switch to the OG look in the options screen, which is what I did immediately. Each girl has one power specifically for them that works in different ways for progression. The game itself is fairly simple and easy, you could possibly beat it in two or three sittings depending on how long you play for.","timestamp_created":1594094085,"timestamp_updated":1594094085,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uKzak/MCdMG4kwI="}
