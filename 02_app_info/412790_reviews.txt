The control input method being gamepad only with no support for motion controllers (emulating a gamepad) is a shame but not the end of the world.\n\n- The amount of content (both plot and total playtime) is minimal and provides about 45 minutes of gameplay if you pace yourself and look for the secrets\n\n- Difficulty is non-existent, the enemies aren't hard to beat and traversal is very simple\n\nConclusion:\nThis is a cheap but polished Adventure Time game with about as much content as you'd expect for the price. As a PCVR game it's just kind of ok (if you find this game scratches an itch for 3rd person VR action-platformers you didn't know you had, \"Moss\" and the Oculus Store version of \"Chronos\" are both stellar examples of what the genre can offer when given a bigger budget and scope), but as an AT tie-in this game really sticks out as a neat little novelty and is something I wholeheartedly recommend to fans of the show. \n\nAs a side note, if you're seriously writing negative reviews complaining exclusively about the amount of content in a five-buck bug-free Gear-VR-to-PC port from four years ago, maybe just go fuck yourself instead","timestamp_created":1609881187,"timestamp_updated":1609882312,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1NOd6vYCfovpwAI="}
