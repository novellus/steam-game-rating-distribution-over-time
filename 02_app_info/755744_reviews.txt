The previous sets are great and definitely worth it if you are interested in this particular art style.\n\nNow onto the Farm and Fort set.\nThe tilesets for the actual forts and farms themselves are great, and of the same quality as every other release for Time Fantasy. The icons, however are not. Included in this DLC is multiple size formats for the icon set (also the reason I believe this DLC is the price it is, almost 5.00 CAD more than the other tilesets). These icon sets are the proper sizes for every rpg maker EXCEPT for VX Ace. I've spent quite a while trying to fit them into my project, and not a single size (including the size that is listed as the intended VX Ace iconset) functioned. I've had to end up making my own icon set from the ground up, resizing everything and as a result lowering the quality of the icons to fit the game. I would not recommend it if you are interested in the icon sets for VX ACE (others seem perfectly fine), as you will not find what you are looking for. Hopefully I can change this review to a recommendation in the future, but as of 7/5/2018 it will remain a thumbs down.","timestamp_created":1530835365,"timestamp_updated":1530835365,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.600832641124725342","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yL25tuQCe5+ppQE="}
