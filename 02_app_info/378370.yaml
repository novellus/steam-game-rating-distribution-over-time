      <br><br><strong>Base Building</strong><br>Create your own bases by chopping
      down trees for wood. First create your foundation and snap walls, windows, doorways
      and ceilings to it. Add a door and lock it. Place a workbench so that other
      players cannot build in the surrounding area. Make sure your workbench is hidden
      as other players can use it. Upgrade your wooden base to stone, by going out
      and mining with a pickaxe.<br><br><strong>Farming</strong><br>Find and collect
