    short_description: By chance, Naruto and Sora get Asuma to coach them. Under the
      guidance of Asuma's iron fist, they immerse themselves in training with Wind
      Chakra. Asuma's words soothe Sora and he begins to settle into life in Hidden
      Leaf Village--until Furido suddenly appears and drops a bombshell.
