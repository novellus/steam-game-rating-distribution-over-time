Where do we start here?\n\nI understand these are early tables, I think they were ones released with Pinball FX2 back in the day (so not quite as old as Excalibur or Earth Defense, but around that era) and the polish isn't QUITE up to zens usual standard. There are 2 very good and fun tables here, and 2 quirky and strange tables that could be either seen as challenging or \"bad\" depending on your level of patience.\n\nEl Dorado:\nBest table in this pack. Lots of multiball to have fun with here and a number of exciting modes. Hidden sinkholes, and even a skeleton pops up for a short \"battle\" at times too. If it wasn't for the totem pole this could easily be a real table. El Dorado is challenging, but it rewards you for exploring all aspects of the table.\n\nTesla:\nThis table seems to be fairly split in the community. I for one love it. Its a beautiful table with a steampunk aesthetic. Starting missions is challenging and the missions themselves can be downright mean. Some of the shots are hard to find (The tesla coil ramp in particular is extremely nasty to locate) but I find beating modes extremely satisfying because of this. Be patient and you'll find yourself enjoying it.\n\nShaman:\nI'm in two minds about this table. It looks horrible, and the soundtrack contains recycled guitar samples from V12 (or vice versa, it's a chicken/egg situation). At first glance it's difficult to figure out exactly what to do. But you have to light \"element\" by hitting all the standups on the raised playfield. This will then allow you to select an \"element\" to essentially massacre a native tribe with... weird, right? Be it flooding them, burning them with lava, scaring them with an earthquake or blowing them away with a tornado. It's kinda messed up. However the inclusion of the 3 whirligigs creates for some tense shots and difficult situations. Honestly, I'd probably rate this table higher if the left hand scoop wasn't so difficult to hit. Doesn't matter how much I play this table, I will ALWAYS struggle to hit that scoop, which is required with every \"element\" mode. For all its faults though, Shaman is definitely worth checking out.\n\nV12:\nNow here is my biggest issue with this pack. I'm not sure why but the physics on this table seems absolutely wacky. The flow is completely messed up. For some weird reason, if the ball hits the top of the bumpers next to the flippers it will more or less stop dead. It's really jarring and makes for an extremely odd play session where you sort of never really know what the ball is going to do. It feels normal on the flippers but almost like a soft ball when it's interacting with the table as if it absorbs all impact. The table itself is interesting, there's a lot to look at and a lot to discover. However, everything requires extremely precise shots in extremely small time frames, so most situations are missed opportunities. With new physics and ruleset/code this table could actually be pretty damn fun. \n\nThis is definitely a \"sale\" purchase. Half price it's definitely worth it. But at full? Nah. Not unless they fix a few things on V12 and considering it's been around since Pinball FX2, I highly doubt that they will.","timestamp_created":1608850707,"timestamp_updated":1608850707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o7K+y/YCe5rzvAI="}
