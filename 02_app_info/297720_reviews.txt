If you like the works of Phillip K. Di*k, the Strugatzky brothers,\nor David Lynch, this is your game. \n\nIf you are into the strange and unusual, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.\n\nHowever, you have to listen and examine everything very carefully, take your time, check for small details and do all the side objectives, otherwise I guess the story might simply be confusing... But if you do take your time and are attentive, there is alot to find and everything fits together like a puzzle to create a very immersive and profound experience.\n\nPro:\n-Intriguing story\n-Lots and lots of cool details\n-Very unique\n-Atmospheric\n-Beautiful music\n-Great humor\n\nCon:\n-Not strictly a walking simulator \n-Simple platforming involved\n-Clunky controls (you will get used to it very quickly)","timestamp_created":1607207897,"timestamp_updated":1607207973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iO7DmvYCcdfOtwI="}
