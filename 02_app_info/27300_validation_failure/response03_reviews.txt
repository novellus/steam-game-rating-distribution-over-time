The combat, as you all probably know, is awful, and I mean AWFUL. But the puzzles are creative, the environment is grand, and the story is good enough to be on par with the movies. Although there is a theme of fight, puzzle, puzzle, fight, puzzle, big puzzle, fight, it never tends to get boring. Can't wait to make it to the end! As of now, I would highly suggest this game to any one who is a fan of the series, or wants a good gorey puzzler.","timestamp_created":1422743276,"timestamp_updated":1422743276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnvGGocsCdYC3Ng=="}
