Falling somewhere between flOw and Oddworld, it presents you with a living and bizarre world to explore with an equally bizarre alien character. The platforming is solid, thanks to tight controls, unique movement and organic symbiotic powerups that open up new degrees of freedom for your character. As you fling, float, and crawl through through the level you spread ectoplasm, like a bee spreads pollen, which changes the barren levels into thriving alien ecosystems. Don't expect that all your questions will be answered from just the first episode, you won't even know by the end whether you made the right choice or not. Instead, anticipate scratching just the surface of Ectolibrium's rich lore.","timestamp_created":1548987439,"timestamp_updated":1548987794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwpcC30+gCdODZuQE="}
