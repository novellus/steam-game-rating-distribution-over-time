    developer_response: 'Please update the game. on the start menu in the upper right
      corner should be version 1.3.0.2 most of the bugs that were fixed in your video.

      Tutorials will be added in a few days!

      The way the second character appears has also been changed.

      As for the second character - he should appear and be controlled from the second
      gamepad connected to the computer and controlled by another player (at least
      on our computers it works like this), please tell me which controller are you
      using?'

    review: 'There is a lot of good stuff going on here.

      -Hand drawn art is beautiful.

      -Soundtrack is very relaxing and solid.


      Unfortunately, the bad stuff needs a lot of work.

      -Tutorial needs to include how/why to control 2 characters at once.

      -The fighting feels sort of pointless.

      -There are apparently upgrades and other attacks but I never got to do anything
      other than a simple punch.
