    about_the_game: 'Back in the mid-80s! With this add-on, the player can take control
      of a completely new Hungarian bus, adapted to work in Germany, allowing him
      to take a ride through the streets of Berlin and other cities and towns of Eastern
      Germany. The bus has a length of 16.5 metres, with its engine located under
      the floor. A thruster rear axle makes it comfortable to move around the narrow
      streets of the big cities.<br><br>During the 90s many buses were re-exported
      into many ex-Soviet countries. The add-on includes versions made for many cities
      of some CIS countries (Russia, Belarus).<br><br>The Ikarus 280.02 is presented
      in versions from 1984 to 1987. They all differ in both appearance and interior.
      The bus has a 6-speed manual gearbox and a six-cylinder diesel engine D2156HM6U,
      which allows it to reach a top speed of 60 km/h. It is adapted to work in Germany,
      so the road train signs and head parking lights are missing. Also, it differs
      in the almost complete absence of window leafs in the passenger cabin (2 per
      section).<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/629990/extras/omsi_features.png?t=1557472939"
