The engine sounds are satisfying when going up through the power band, but at Run 8, things get un-naturally quiet--as it sounds like it switches to a completely different recording. It doesn't help that, like almost all the US TS diesel locomotives being offered, the stacks produce anemic puffs of smoke even at full power.\n\nThe technical specifications indicate UP 9000-9002 and UP 9003-9005 were delivered with differing traction motor types and gear ratios, but all were rated for 80 MPH operation. I was not able to achieve those speeds with a single unit on straight and level track. \n\nAll in all this unit is a solid entry from the developer.  It handles well whether used in multiple on mainline freights, or singularly in switching duties, and I can recommend it to anyone who wishes to add it to their collection.","timestamp_created":1578626034,"timestamp_updated":1579042109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45M6P0+8CepmA6wE="}
