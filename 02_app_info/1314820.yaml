    review: "it is a good RC Simulator \ni bought my first RC helicopter and saw this\
      \ RC simulator on a youtube video from a man out dubai \nso i thought before\
      \ i start destroying real stuff lets get this RC simulator to get the feeling\
      \ for it \nsuch as 6G normal flying 6G is super easy & 3D stunt flying SUPER\
      \ NOT EASY \ni started with a lot of crashes but now i'am sometimes able to\
      \ do some 3D flying without crashing\nand that with just 2 hours of gameplay\
      \ and i have never ever before flew a RC helicopter in my life or in game\n\
      so DEFINENTLY A BIG THUMBS UP for this RC Simulator  \n\n\n"
