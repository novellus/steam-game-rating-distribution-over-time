    short_description: A world of Police that have forgotten what, and why, they are
      policing. Rooftop Cop is a collection of five endless vignette games and a 7-track
      album. The games are set on a loose metaphysical timeline in which the Cops
      slowly lose their way.

    review: 'There is no reason to play any of the vignettes past the first few minutes
      of each, unless you''ve fallen in love with the systems for their own sake.
      To me, this is a game design dream come true. Everything is laid bare, and in
      a few cases I can feel the game outright mocking the idea that you might want
      to ''complete'' a vignette or be rewarded for doing so.


      Not recommended if you''re looking for a nice fun videogame experience, but
      I truly love Rooftop Cop and recommend it with my entire heart if you''re interested
      in... well, whatever the hell it is. It speaks to me about the nature of videogames,
      so it''s not "for people who don''t like videogames." Maybe it''s for people
      who are acutely aware that they like videogames TOO much.'
