    review: '7th entry in the MOAI serie. As the previous 6, it''s a time management
      game (i.e perform a serie of actions in a given time to reach a predetermined
      goal).


      For those who don''t know anything about the serie, it''s a good enough time
      management game. It works without issue (on Win7 64bit at least), the game is
      responsive, there are in-game achievements, etc.


      For those who are familiar with the serie, well, it''s another story. What''s
      obvious right at the beginning is the change in the levels'' design. Obviously,
      a new team handled it. I finished 58 of the 60 levels with gold time on first
      try. That is clearly a sign something''s different. Several levels could be
      finished in less than half the allotted time ! on first try !

      Another change is that there''s no more mana temple - only MOAI statues to get
      mana.

      Now for what I believe is the strangest part : the pirates (island invaders)
      can freely wander by and ask for ransom on any exploited land (farm / mine /
      etc.) What''s strange is that you can''t interact at all while he walks to said
      land. You could zap out the ghosts that randomly came and attacked your constructions
      in previous entries in the serie. No such luck here, which is VERY frustrating.

      There''s no bonus levels (the star ones that triggered on the map when all,
      on its way, were beaten with gold status). Also no bonus level in the menu once
      you''ve beaten all the "standard" levels.

      Some achievements imply to replay many times already beaten levels - I gave
      up once everything was with gold status.


      I think this entry is not as good as the previous entries in the serie, however
      it still is enjoyable. It took me 8 hours to make it through with several in-game
      achievements still open.
