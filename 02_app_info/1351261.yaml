    about_the_game: Civil war has erupted!<br><br>Spain has divided herself in two
      as revolutionary Nationalist forces launch a coup in an attempt to overthrow
      their Republican counterparts.<br>As the citizens of Spain begin to take sides
      in the conflict, so too has the rest of the world. Germany and Italy have seen
      the opportunity to test new weapons and new tactics in the battle for Spain,
      and send their aid to the Nationalists. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union and International
      Brigades throw their support behind the Communist factions of the Spanish Republican,
      deploying Soviet made tanks and aircraft onto the battlefield.<h2 class="bb_tag">FROM

      the Republican battleship Jaime I at Malaga, or assisting one of the last mass
      Cavalry charges in the history of warfare at Teruel.<h2 class="bb_tag">GAIN

      special prototype vehicles, and even convincing historical officers to join
      your army.<h2 class="bb_tag">COMMAND THE CONDOR LEGION</h2>Consisting of a number
      of newly formed bomber, fighter, recon, tank, and anti-aircraft battle groups,
