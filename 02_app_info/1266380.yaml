    about_the_game: <strong>Super No Crying in Baseball</strong> is an endless baseball
      rogue-like where you play as a little league baseball player going to one of
      his games. The catch is, your dad showed up this time! You're so emotional that
      you could cry! But, your dad always told you, &quot;There's no crying in baseball,
      son.&quot; Maintain your composure as you play this home-run derby! But beware,
      it gets harder as you go, and the other team doesn't play fair.<h2 class="bb_tag">Controls</h2><table><tr><td><img
