    about_the_game: 'The Evenness Sensory Space is designed to recreate a multi-sensory
      space as an environment where the primary senses are stimulated through the
      use of sensory based materials in virtual reality. They can provide a safe,
      non-threatening environment for anybody. Multi-sensory spaces may use the following
      equipment to calm or stimulate the senses: fibre optics, bubble tubes, sounds,
      colour, laver lamp and lighting all in virtual reality. Multi-sensory equipment
      is a vital and effective part in the treatment of sensory disorders with children
      and adults alike. A sensory space can be made to provide a range of sensory
      experiences, allows user control of the environment, and lets the individual
      have fun, irrespective of their behavioural, emotional, or physical needs. In
      doing so, they can help develop key life skills including vocalisation, gross
      motor skills, colour recognition and tracking.'

    review: I  tried the Evenness Sensory Space with my primary school ASD students
      and received very positive feedback. As a small school we do not have available
      space for a sensory room so this product helps us offer a sensory experience
      to our ASD students. Evenness offers a calm environment where the children have
      control over their surroundings. There is lots of opportunity for sensory engagement
      and the space encouraged imaginative thinking. The children loved the sounds
      and colours and the movement of objects and colours creates a calming effect.
      I would recommend this product to others.
