For a quirky indie title its pretty much what I expected. Something weird to kill some time. Loading times are terrible, it keeps telling me target is down when they clearly are not, ammo seems to run low even though your supposed to be some kind of trained operative going into a planned mission ... idk. I really want to finish watching all the cut scenes just because wtf. But I doubt I'll be trying to get through this game any time soon. Maybe if I get an upgrade and it doesn't take 4 mins to load each level. I mean damn, I might not have a top of the line computer but for this game ... it should be able to handle it no problems.Oh yeah, and every single time you get hit a nurse pops in front of you telling you you've been hit. Needs some tweaking but I could see it being good game.","timestamp_created":1565831259,"timestamp_updated":1565831409,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ41uW0yewCf5Gv0AE="}
