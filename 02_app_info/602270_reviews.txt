The game starts out with a tutorial which can seem a bit slow, but shows you the unique mechanics of the game. I especially enjoyed the shield feature which made the cover based combat interesting and fast paced. The boss fights are challenging and well designed with a variety of enemies. The lava environment is beautiful to look at, and a unique background to the story. I look forward to see what else the developer adds to this game.","timestamp_created":1571112714,"timestamp_updated":1571112714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499612092971801758","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw8a/n5u0CetaR1AE="}
