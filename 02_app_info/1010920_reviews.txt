Well; I was right, but it was also a nice implementation of a good story. Stellar voice acting! Really sells the whole thing.\n\nOne thing that I gotta say is that, despite the game being intriguing and drawing; it's not scary. Not in the slightest. Also, the protagonist could have been better.\n\nIt was hard to relate to such a... guy; and without relating the diary becomes less meaningful. At horror, you sometimes root for the monster and it's fun to do so, but the protagonist should also be 'root-able' if it makes any sense. Maybe it would have worked to make him less of an irredeemable loser?","timestamp_created":1609736412,"timestamp_updated":1609736412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtovx5fYCceqlwAI="}
