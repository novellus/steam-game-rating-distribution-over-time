    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Chariot of the Gods</h2><i>The job was routine,
      the money fair. Then the damn company diverted you to answer a distress call
      from a ship that disappeared almost 80 years ago--a derelict carrying something
      bizarre, twisted, and alien. What the ship's frozen crew brought back with them
      was bad enough--what they themselves were turning into was a bloody nightmare.
      Add to that an annoying sensor ghost shadowing you in the void, and your stress
      level is shot.</i><br><i>It's all a bit much.</i><br><i>You don't get paid enough
      to deal with monsters. But hold your breath, count to three, and play your cards
      right with this one, and you just might walk away very rich. Oh, who am I kidding?</i><br><i>You're
      all going to die.</i><br><i>Chariot of the Gods</i> is a complete Cinematic
      Scenario for the ALIEN Roleplaying Game written by sci-fi novelist Andrew E.C.
      Gaska. The booklet designed to introduce you to the game while at the same time
      taking you on a thrilling, terror-filled ride into deep space where no one can
      hear you scream. <i>Chariot of the Gods</i> is designed for 3-5 players plus
      the GM and takes at least 4-5 hours to complete.<br>The digital conversion includes

    review: "Possesseur d'une licence FGC passez votre chemin !\n\nLe DLC est sans\
      \ doute tr\xE8s bon. Mais il est compatible uniquement sur une licence FGU contrairement\
      \ \xE0 ce qui est annonc\xE9 sur la page de pr\xE9sentation du produit.\n\n\
      De plus, pour pouvoir jouer \xE0 ce Chariot of the Gods, vous devez aussi acheter\
      \ le DLC - Alien the Roleplaying Game.\n\nMa note sanctionne le manque de visibilit\xE9\
      \ sur l'achat des diff\xE9rents DLC ainsi que leurs compatibilit\xE9s entre\
      \ les diff\xE9rents licence FG.\n\nMa demande de remboursement va dans ce sens."
