So because it is a racing game, you can fly left and right, and since it is in space, you can also go up and down.

A cube ship have 6 thrusters, one on each face. Inside that cube is a spheric cockpit from which you can pilot the ship. That sphere will turn inside the cube, which in turn will rotate the outter cubic frame in the opposite direction (because of some funny law of physics stating that for each action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

You will still have to show some skill... after all this is what racing is all about.<br><br>Oh i forgot one minor point: in space you can go as fast as you want. But don't.
