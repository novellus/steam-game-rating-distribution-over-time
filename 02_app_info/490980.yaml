      /></a><br><br>This game lets you try on the role of a Supernatural Newspaper
      Agency boss and editor. The world it takes place in is a dark and haunted one,
      with ghosts, zombies, monsters and even shapeshifting murderers, pretending
      to be human after they have stolen their victims' bodies or infiltrated the
      humanity. It was inspired heavily by the works of H.P.Lovecraft and it builds
      on the atmosphere of uncertainty and noir of the 1940s. <br><br>Send your sextet
      of weathered journalists, detectives and occult specialists to investigate murder,
      affair, and horror in the Town. <br><br>Each time, the story will be different.
      Sometimes, a werewolf is shredding innocent (and less innocent) victims to pieces
      and it is your task to unmask the creature. Other times, it will be a body stealing
      alien from outer space, a mummy that some misfortunate archeologist has excavated
      and is now haunting them. Perhaps it will be Jack the Ripper, still mysteriously
      alive and lurking in the streets at night. <br><br>Or maybe there is a really
      bad big tentacled monster hidden in the cellar of the University? <br><br>It
      is for you to find out and entertain your readers while bravely standing up
      against ancient evil.

    review: 'The Daily Chthonicle is a fun little game. Much more fun than I expected
      it to be. Imagine a board game, Lovecraftian horror, mystery novels and Film
      Noir thrown into a witch''s cauldron, along with the usual eye of newt and milk
      of a dragonfly, and shaken really well!


      Gameplay:

      The game feels and plays much like a board game. You control newspaper reporters
      who are in fact part of secret outfit that protects against supernatural threats.


      Gameplay is complex, and involves moving your agents on several locations on
      the map, equiping them with items and dealing with encounters/adversaries, supernatural
      phenomena, events, obstacles, etc.

      You also publish newspaper articles with your exploits and photographs that
      you may manage to take while solving cases. This is one of your sources of income
      that allows you to equip, train and care for your reporters.


      There is a big in-game manual that I advise everyone to read, before starting
      the actual game. It is rather big and impossible to digest entirely in one go
      (you will visit it again many times, for sure) but even skimming through it,
      will give you at least an idea of what it is that you are supposed to do.

      The tutorial mission also explains a lot of things as you play but you will
      find yourself clicking the "read more" item on the cards that takes you to the
      relevant sections of the in-game manual.


      Fully describing gameplay here would essentially need to rewrite the in-game
      manual. Rest assured the game features several mechanics that will keep you
      engaged.


      Graphics:

      In the graphic department the game opts in for retro graphics with a film noir
      style (Did I mention one of your reporters is named Sam Spade? :D).

      I believe the style fits the game nicely but art style is something objective.
      It may not work for everyone.


      Music/Sound Design:

      In this department the game is taking a very casual approach. Like soft piano
      music playing in the background, mixed with somekind of eerie ambience and very
      minimal sampled sound effects like the occasional sound you would hear in a
      newspaper office during the 40s.


      Story:

      There''s really no consistent story. The game generates random cases that you
      have to solve. Each case is a short story involving the murder, the supernatural,
      cults etc.


      Pros:

      -Manages to blend several elements in a very nice way.

      -Feels and plays like a complex board game.

      -Randomly generated content keeps replayability high.

      -Good in-game manual


      Neutral:

      -Retro style graphics are not everyone''s cup of tea.


      Cons:

      I really could not find something I could consider a con.


      Conclusion:

      I have played many different games in the past 2 weeks and this one is the one
      I have enjoyed the most. Solid gameplay, intelligent and I love it''s art style,
      the Lovecraftian and Film Noir references and basically everything about it!

      Gameplay: 9/10

      Graphics: 7/10

      Music: 5/10
