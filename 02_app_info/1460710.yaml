    review: 'It is FINE but uninspired.

      The best part about the game is the soundtrack which is excellent.

      Each level starts essentially the same, then there are several variations, none
      of which are particularly interesting.

      I''d love to give this a thumbs sideways but I am going to go with no for this
      one.
