If you look at the GOAT difficult platformers, either the entire level has a consistent difficulty or there's not much leadup to the hard parts, making the game more interesting throughout. You also usually checkpoint more often. In Pivot Pilot, I felt like I was often going through a pretty long level and ended up failing a hard part, then doing it all again. \n\nAnother major issue I have is the occasional \"no way to know that except by dying\" elements. For example, a fourth saw that has to be mid-air jumped right after three saws that you have to drop past. There's really no way to read this except through sheer luck, and when you fail you have to do allll of the level again (which exacerbates the first issue). Just one of several examples in the game. In general, there's not enough of a telegraph and many levels are virtually impossible to sightread. I've always preferred level design where it feels like it really is feasible to sightread if you're mechanically good enough.\n\nThird main thing I didn't like: the controls don't feel that good. Idk. You have to quickly double tap to double jump to max height, otherwise it's too short. Mid-air movement feels imprecise. Some parts require a lot of precision, far too much for my taste. \n\nIt's not all bad ofc. The pivoting mechanic is a great gimmick, there's still some decent platforming, a banging soundtrack, and interesting level ideas even if the execution didn't live up to it. It's not a garbage game, but I did dislike a LOT of parts, enough for me to not recommend it. Also keybindings reset when you exit :(","timestamp_created":1576109925,"timestamp_updated":1576110075,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543859660625457764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x+Xe++4CeKTY4wE="}
