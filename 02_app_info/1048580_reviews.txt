I am a very casual annual holiday skier, and not getting away this year. I have to say this will help scratch the itch. The graphics are ok I have it on Ultra settings working on a Acer predator laptop i7 with RTX2070 Maxq. Iâ€™m using a Quest 2 with Virtual Desktop. I hope the graphics do get better. The gameplay is really intuitive, the only thing is going to be all the medal unlocking (boring)ðŸ˜„ I saw earlier videos of players getting on to ski lifts, but canâ€™t seem to find that in the game yet. Also I get a bit lost on the mountains, but practice and memory should help that. Now to add to the realism(I am not suggesting anybody do this) I used a fitness vibrating plate machine, while playing, itâ€™s total immersion and you will feel the burn, but please donâ€™t try to parallel with your feet, like what I did, thankfully nobody saw that.\nI hope any skiers or wannabe skiers with VR will buy this and support the dev team to turn this into a total VR gem.","timestamp_created":1610037293,"timestamp_updated":1610037293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4/O3s7vYCfouowQI="}
