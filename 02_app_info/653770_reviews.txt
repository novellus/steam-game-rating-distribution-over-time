While I have not finished this title (I am stuck at the moment) I have enjoyed it enough that I felt motivated to leave my thoughts on it here. While not a horror game per se it does have a creepy atmosphere that will allow you to get sucked in if you let it. The game-play is pretty standard rpg maker fare and reminds me a bit of Final Fantasy 4 in terms of interface outside of combat and early Dragon Quest games in combat.  However you are able to make literal life or death decisions that seem to have an impact on the story as a whole. There are puzzles aplenty in this game and a wrong decision can cause instant death. I would advise saving often to avoid frustration, As a whole though this is a good game that more people should give a try. My review is not complete  but merely a placeholder that I will leave here until I have completed my play through.","timestamp_created":1552711162,"timestamp_updated":1552711162,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiYOzwukCedWTvQE="}
