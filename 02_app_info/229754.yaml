    short_description: Invoking the feel of SNES-era RPGs, RPG Maker DS was a big
      hit in Japan. Unfortunately, it hasn't made it over to North America (yet).
      What has made it over however is a boatload of resources and graphical goodies.We've
      taken the original resources and modified them (when necessary) to work perfectly
      with RPG Maker VX Ace.

    review: My favorite DLC pack, namely cause it went unused in RPG Maker 3DS! I
      was the one who restored it, so technically i've been using this DLC for 4+
      years, and I love it.
