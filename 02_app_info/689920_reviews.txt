It's not for everyone, but its for sure something I like.\n\n[h1] Songs [/h1]\n1.) 1bitarrange-ver1: Don't remember this Piano promenint song from the game...\n2.) 1bitarrange-ver2: This Christmas song I don't remember from the game either...\n3.) 1bitarrange-ver3: This elevator jazz song I don't remember from the game either, must be me....\n4.) 1bitarrange-ver4: This remakeof Swanky Kong's game show song was absolutely not in the game..\n5.) 1BitHeart: Is probably in the game, and is preformed by vocaloid Rin Kagamine, and I'm okay with this one, I used to be super big into vocaloids, until Momocashew ruined me for every other vocaloid.\n6.) 1BitHeart: Is probably not in the game, this is the same as the previous song, except it's preformed by Minx, whom I never heard of.\n7.) 1BitHeart: is the instrumental for the last 2 songs, which combines Chiptune style 16 bit music with what I would describe as beach rock.\n8.) Mushoku Futoumei: This one is probably in the game again, it's preformed by vocaloid Rin Kagamine, brings back a lot of nostalgia.\n9.) Mushoku Futomei: Again probably not in the game, but it's the same as the previous song, however it is preformed this time by Tezuka.\n10.) Mushoku Futomei: Instrumental of the last 2 songs, no lyrics, very Big house Japanese meets jazz.","timestamp_created":1594063770,"timestamp_updated":1608743880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1PCmyPYCf8OtkwI="}
