I still have some issues with a few things here and there but they deserve a thumbs up for all the work they put in. I've included a link to the full series (I played through the game in 3 parts) and you can clearly see the changes from part 1 to part 2 to part 3. By the end, the gamebreaking stuff was no longer present. Some people will still be on the fence but it's a recommend from me - especially if it goes on sale. I enjoyed the final version of the game enough to give it a thumbs up. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O0d8U5F1zg&list=PL08FwntTpxPACBXeVvsSB2I_LURxNq81r\n\nUpdate #2: The game has gotten better. It's still not at a state where I can recommend it yet but the dev has been working hard and has been pushing patches for all the issues we've been locating so that's definitely a plus. It's getting there. I'll update more when I've had time to test the newest patch. Here's my newest video showing some of the changes and updates to the game so far.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVGMg8C59wY\n\nUpdate: I'm changing this review to remove some things about the dev attacking me. That was a misunderstanding with someone who appeared to be the dev but was not. I did refund the game (the first refund I've ever made on Steam) mainly based off my interaction with the person who appeared to be the developer. \n\nThe game is borderline unplayable. I could not progress due to a bug that you can watch in my video on my Youtube channel. There are sound issues, there are texture issues, there are issues with item placement (where they are literally placed in a spot where your character CANNOT reach them), and there are progression issues that literally make it impossible to go further in the game. And that's just the start. \n\nThat being said, with some patches the game could actually be decent. I'm not saying the game will never be a good game. I'm just saying at this point (November 4th) that the game is unplayable in my opinion. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O0d8U5F1zg&lc=z22tsxiyuuzqv35jg04t1aokg3bmiuc024hu5q4jpkydrk0h00410","timestamp_created":1541352706,"timestamp_updated":1542072621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561051607131958008","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/JqshecCfr2GrgE="}
