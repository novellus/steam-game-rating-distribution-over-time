    review: "This is garbage. It might be a funny joke but should not be for sale.\n\
      I don't even think the play time tracker is working for this, good maybe I can\
      \ get a refund!\nIf you have companion hold position they don't use their ranged\
      \ weapon.\nIf you get damaged you can't rest properly in a settlement to recover.\
      \ \nIf you don't top the mauradurs  in the starting quest they become a large\
      \ party you can't beat as you cannot recruit anyone at that time.\nThe unarmed\
      \ zombies can block.... why? \nSo you expect a player to wack all these zombies\
      \ with hoe for 12 exp and take 0 damage to survive the muarader quest before\
      \ being able to get any more equipment or troops?\nFunny, yes hah hah your arrows\
      \ don't come back after battle, oh so hardcore.\nThis shouldn't be sold."
