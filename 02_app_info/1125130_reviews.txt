I do not care if it is a meme game, i expect quality. Game is short and repetitive. There seems to be only one map. There are three classes that i could care less about. The meme wasn't even that funny to begin with. I just wanted it to see if it was a good game. They could of made it a free to play game just for a joke but we are expected to pay for this? No. No point in refunding it because of how dirt cheap it is. Poor effort, poor gameplay, poor environment, and poor pricing. I give it a 2/10.","timestamp_created":1594069298,"timestamp_updated":1594069298,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498139530420303345","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwteX7kvMCf+6vkwI="}
