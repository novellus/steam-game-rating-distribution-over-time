    review: 'My first impressions: It''s neat, for the price. Still don''t know what
      the box is for, but I''ll figure it out.

      I was looking for a (preferably VR) game for a small price that would give me
      a bit of that holiday feeling in this rather difficult year. And this game delivered.

      There are still some minor bugs, and I wouldn''t recommend teleporting too much
      while inside the cabin, as you might accidentally teleport yourself outside
      and have some trouble getting back in.

      But overall, if you want to decorate snowmen, but don''t have any snow, this
      is a nice little alternative.'
