You can't really complain about something like that, can you?\n\n[h1] What I disliked [/h1]\n• Short game, unless you're not speeding through it, this game offers you about 30 minutes to an hour depending on how quick you pick up on things.\n• There are no settings to turn of music or sound effects, a bummer since if you wanted to listen to a YouTube Video or anything else in the background you'd have to mute the entire game.\n\nAs a person who enjoyed their previous game, CPU Invaders, and made a review for it, I also enjoyed this one. In fact, I would argue this one might be better than CPU Invaders. Both are very similar, but this one you play as a different character and the game is more challenging in my opinion compared to CPU Invaders, makes you think more.\n\n[b] Pretty fun and short game, CPU Invaders is also the same price so I would recommend going and getting it as well if you wan't the same experience (as well as achievements!)
