Most \"souls-like\" games are just unfairly hard, but this is different. Legacy of Lina requires a great amount of precision, like in the Souls series, most of the time you die because you haven't played optimally and it's SUPER GOOD to do it again and pass it. So if you like real challenge, look no further, that's your game.\n\nPros:\n- A challenging gameplay;\n- Good, appealing clean graphics;\n- Responsive commands, with maximum precision (no blaming the controls);\n\nCons:\n- No audio controls (but great sfx!);\n- Fullscreen preference resets every time;\n- Menus are hard to navigate;","timestamp_created":1544235579,"timestamp_updated":1544235579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561640501022338867","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4557nxecCcdXctAE="}
