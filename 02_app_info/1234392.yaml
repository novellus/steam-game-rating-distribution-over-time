    developer_response: 'Hi mathiassorrow

      Sry for the problems. The shop itself on the screenshot was never a exclusive
      part of this dlc. The screen was used because the upper left button with which
      you were able to buy ingame 7 days premium account and this dlc made a permanent
      premium status possible.The shop emnu itself was never a port of it. The shop
      menu was deleted when we deleted the complete ingame shop from the game because
      players didn''t liked them. In the description is nothing written about a exclusive
      menu, only about the extras you get. if you don''t like the extras which will
      get more when game content increases please refund it. We will exchange the
      screenshot and rework descriptions of the game/dlc to make it easier to understand
      and ebtter show the actual systems. We simply forgot to exchange this specific
      screenshot during postdevelopement process. Sry for the problems

    review: "QUESTION FOR DEVS.\nMaybe I'm missing something ? I purchased this dlc,\
      \ it says it's activated in game, but I can't find the pictured option menu\
      \ anywhere. \nI would like to point out that I purchased this specifically for\
      \ the options menu AS PICTURED. \nIf I am missing something I would appreciate\
      \ info on how to access this content asap. \nIf the PICTURED content is not\
      \ available with this dlc I WILL be requesting a refund.\n"
