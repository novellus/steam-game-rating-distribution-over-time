The game gives you and the AI three (random?) cards, and then you choose one, then the AI chooses one. Then you wait to see who wins, which is generally just the one with the larger number. There is no strategy in the game, as the only thing you can control is what order you play the cards in.\n\nAlso, the AI makes these remarks about how embarrassing it is to strip, and bids you not to look, but you have no choice. You have to pick something to strip, or the game won't proceed. Also, there are very few options on what to strip. You can only strip the skirt, underwear and shirt. You can't select the leggings or shoes.\n\nAnd the password for entering the game? Useless.If you put in a wrong password, it just asks you if you want to create new password, and then you gain access.","timestamp_created":1609013829,"timestamp_updated":1609014158,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq/St0PYCdMDAvQI="}
