This addictive game is extremely easy to figure out, but surprisingly difficult to master. Despite thinking that this game amusing and enjoyable enough for me to recommend it to the average user, I'll go ahead and tell completionists like myself not to buy this game. If you're anything like me, you'll want to get all the achievements without consulting any walkthrough or achievement guide, and let me tell you it's some of the most difficult shit I've ever had to go through. If you don't care about some good 'ol cheevos, you'll enjoy this.\n\n7/10","timestamp_created":1489004740,"timestamp_updated":1609122605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/MzL0/YCccj6cw=="}
