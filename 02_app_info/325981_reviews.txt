The hills covered with grapevine look very beautiful, especially in the autumn.  Also, I like the signals in this route, the lenses are visible from the distance, no need to use zoom to see what's signal ahead. PZB also works correctly, contrary to other reviews. Just use proper locos with PZB.\nI swapped Aerosoft BR189 in all scenarios with BR185 from Frankfurt-Koblenz add-on, and it works just perfectly for this route. AFB and PZB is working, and display even shows current speed limit, which allows to drive without HUD.\nBR628/928 diesel railcar is fine.  Other locomotives like BR143 and BR151 used as traffic in scenarios - they are simplified versions of models provided by VirtualRailroads (not Pro Range models) \n\nPositive:\n-Decent length\n-Nice landscape work with custom greenery (grass is the most realistic I ever saw in TS) \n-Plenty of scenarios\n-Iron ore cars included, which worth separate purchase otherwise\n-Decent performance\n-Grass\n-Grapevines! \n\nNegative:\n-Stock locomotive BR189 is mediocre and lacks many features\n-Trees made of X-shaped 2D polygon are bad choice for close distance, it looks like MSTS in 2003.","timestamp_created":1609614451,"timestamp_updated":1609614451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k+yf4vYCe4XpvwI="}
