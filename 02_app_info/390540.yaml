    review: 'I like the idea of this and what they''re trying to do, but it''s quite
      broken at this time - to the point of being unusable.

      The main issue for me was that in visiting any location, the VR controls would
      stop working and I couldn''t navigate away from the location or move around
      in it.  The VR menu button still worked, but attepmting to use any option gives
      no result in the headset. I found that it was displaying the results on the
      desktop, requiring me to take off the headset, click the option, then put the
      headset back on.

      Also constantly loading items, which never seem to appear, so I''ve not seen
      the game look like anything shown in the screenshots, only a blueprint like
      mess.

      This is a great idea, and I think VR needs something like this, but High Fidelity
      needs a huge amount of work before it''s even useable, let alone enjoyable.
