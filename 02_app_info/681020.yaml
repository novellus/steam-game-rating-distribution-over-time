    review: "I love to read while I'm in the toilet.  I also like to do the interwebs\
      \ while in the crapper.  So it's just a natural progression that I dreamt about\
      \ being able to Waveshooter (or WvSh as the hipster kids call it these days)\
      \ while taking a dump.  Throne of the Dead brings this dream into reality. \
      \ I cannot wait until we get some mixed reality or augmented reality takes on\
      \ this new concept of gaming.\n\nIn TotD, we get 6 different VR environments\
      \ where we can take a dump and shoot zombies (or Frosty the snowman) for 15\
      \ waves.  Want to take a dump at home?  Check.  Want to take a dump in someone\
      \ else's farm house?  Check.  Want to drop a duece in a porta-potty at a consruction\
      \ site?  Well, that's one obvious, of course you do, who doesnt?  How about\
      \ dropping a deuce in an outhouse out in the desert?  If you're the frontier,\
      \ trail-blazing type then the answer is as obvious as a asking a dog if he wants\
      \ to mark the tree with his essence.  Have you ever dreamed of travelling the\
      \ North or South Pole and braving the sub-zero temperatures to take a dump in\
      \ the ice?  Well, now you can thanks to the magic of VR and TotD.  And they\
      \ say there is no killer app in VR.  Those people are either ignorant or fools.\n\
      \nIf I haven't convinced you yet to get this game, then let me tell you that\
      \ each environment is nicely done.  There's nice little details in each environment\
      \ and the zombies have skins that match the surrounding.  And you get zombies\
      \ coming at you from 1 sides, from 2 sides, from 3 sides!  But never 4 sides\
      \ (after all, the dev can't just let your posterior be unprotected, that could\
      \ be dangerous).  \n\nYou only have 2 handguns.  There's no other weapon types.\
      \  However, you can get powerups that do change the way that your weapon functions.\
      \  Your handgun can turn into an alien laser gun, an exploding ammo gun, increased\
      \ ammo to the max, or a freeze gun (in the winter setting).   You can also shoot\
      \ rubber ducks that pop up to give you extra health (max of 3).  Although the\
      \ zombies do have different skins, I didn't notice much difference in their\
      \ health or attack pattern.  Other than in the western setting where some zombies\
      \ had dynamite that exploded.  I found the construction site and the winter\
      \ setting to be the easiest levels.  Even though the winter setting had snowmen\
      \ and a new gun powerup, I found it to be the most boring setting because the\
      \ it was extremely easy and very repetitive.  Winter came and it had little\
      \ variety ... sad :(  \n\nWith certain success you can unlock weapon skins which\
      \ was a nice surprise and I liked the variety in them.  Spoiler alert:  [spoiler]\
      \ If you die you go to hell and if you finish all 15 levels then you get to\
      \ take a shit in HEAVEN! [/spoiler] I was having fun for the most part playing\
      \ this game.  I think it's quite the steal at the current sale price of $2.74.\
      \  Unfortunately, the last level (winter) left me with a bitter taste in my\
      \ mouth because I had been enjoying myself until then and was hoping to give\
      \ a glowing review.  \n\n[u]I played this game on the Oculus Rift with Touch\
      \ Controllers on i7 1060 GTX and there were no issues [/u].  If this game just\
      \ made a few changes, I would have given a 10/10.  Quick suggestions to improve\
      \ game:  Add more enemy types, how about zombies that throw stuff at you and\
      \ you have to dodge the attacks?  Bigger zombies.  Faster zombies.  Having to\
      \ flush the toilet when your poop fills up?  Add flying reindeer or Santa boss\
      \ to winter.  Definitely add bosses to the end of like every 5 waves. \n\nSale\
      \ price rating 7/10, Normal price rating 6/10\n\nNote to dev: [spoiler] please\
      \ turn down the flames bloom effect in the hell afterlife, there's like red\
      \ flames that pop up on your eyes and it's like looking at the sun, it's not\
      \ very pleasant ... other than that, well made heaven and hell and nice concept\
      \ [/spoiler]"
