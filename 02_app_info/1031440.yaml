    review: Fantastic VR visual novel with a gripping story. I do wish that the world
      and character models had a more realistic scale to them, but it wasn't a huge
      deal. The animations were just enough to give a good sense of immersion and
      connection to the story and the narrative was already great on it's own. Overall
      an amazing experience and really looking forward to the future of VR visual
      novels like Tokyo Chronos.
