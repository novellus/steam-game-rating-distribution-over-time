    about_the_game: "In 1982, a new breed of hero was born. Horace \u2013 who would\
      \ go on to star in three popular games \u2013 was unleashed into the world by\
      \ his creator, renowned 8-bit coding maestro William Tang.<br><br>Although it\
      \ was never officially declared so, the loveable blue\u2026 <i>thing</i> that\
      \ is Horace was considered by many to be a mascot of the highly popular ZX Spectrum.\
      \ Just seeing his instantly-recognisable sprite often sends gamers of a certain\
      \ age into rapture, insisting that everything was better \u2018back in the day\u2019\
      \ when graphics and sound didn\u2019t matter as much as <i>gameplay</i>.<br><br>Horace\u2019\
      s first adventure \u2013 <i>Hungry Horace</i> \u2013 took inspiration from popular\
      \ arcade titles of the day, with the titular character navigating his way through\
      \ a maze, picking flowers and avoiding the angry parkies, whose clumsily-dropped\
      \ lunch would then be rife for the taking.<br><br>Now available officially on\
      \ Steam, this lovingly-remastered version is faithful to the original, offering\
      \ retro fans and casual gamers alike a chance to experience the same thrill\
      \ as the first generation of players had back in the day.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >According to the original instructions:</h2><i>You are Hungry Horace, intent\
      \ on devouring everything in your path.<br><br>Each flower in the park that\
      \ Horace eats scores 10 points. But beware of the park guards who are out to\
      \ catch Horace and eject him from the park. If Horace is caught three times\
      \ he will not be allowed back in and the game will end.<br><br>There are several\
      \ alarm bells in the park. If Horace can ring one of the alarms, the guards\
      \ will panic and Horace can turn the tables, catching them and throwing them\
      \ out of the park.<br><br>Look out for when one of the guards drops his lunch\
      \ of cherries or strawberries. You will score 100 points if Horace eats the\
      \ guard\u2019s lunch.<br><br>The park is divided into several sections and in\
      \ each part there is an exit leading to the next section. Horace does not need\
      \ to eat all the flowers or reach the alarm before entering the next section.\
      \ Each section of the park is harder than the one before.</i>"
