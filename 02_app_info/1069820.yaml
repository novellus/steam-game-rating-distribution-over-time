    review: "A nice quick story with a good amount of options, and engaging cast.\
      \ The 2 main story lines fit quiet well together, with most ending/solutions\
      \ to the issues being satisfying, and making scene. Be a soldier, rebel, humanitarian,\
      \ a monster, or a mix of all 4. There all options, leaving good replay ability.\
      \ \n \nAgain, this is a short story, but that's not a fault, being more then\
      \ able to convey a thrilling story. \n\nIf your looking for a quick read with\
      \ a nice straight forward story, I'd say get it."
