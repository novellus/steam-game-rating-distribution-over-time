Your Plasma Cannons for example can shoot at double the range with the appropiate research.\n\nOne of the main features of this game is scanning planets and exploring them in text-based \"Choose your adventure\" segments, in which each choice you make affects the outcome. You may get resources, new missions, or face consequences depending on what response you pick.\n\nThe one and only, yet major issue I have with this game is the travelling. While being able to fly anywhere you want sounds good on paper, you will soon realize that the galaxy is quite big. While multiple solar systems are connected through wormhole networks, certain more isolated solar systems require you to fly all the way to them, essentially taking 3 - 10 minutes of just holding Shift + W, depending on how fast your ship is.\nI highly recommend researching engine upgrades as quick as possible.\n\nBesides this sizeable design flaw, the game is pretty good otherwise, and I recommend playing it if you don't mind the travelling.","timestamp_created":1609890024,"timestamp_updated":1609890642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhbe96vYCeJrtwAI="}
