      \ differ, it has the same properties as a vibrohammer. Because Fencer weapons\
      \ tended to look intimidating, complaints were voiced by townspeople near the\
      \ base. In response to these complaints, development decided to make a disguise\
      \ that wasn't intimidating at all. Furthermore, it has a peaceful paint job\
      \ to give it a more agreeable appearance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe hammer causes\
      \ an immense vibration on impact, shattering not just the object struck, but\
      \ those around it. &quot;"

    review: "I feel like I wasted $4 on this. \n\nWhat point is a silly weapon skin\
      \ if it's useless on higher difficulties.\n\nThis is a level 0 weapon that under-preforms\
      \ compared to other level 0 weapons. \n\nI mean it's a pillow so at least that's\
      \ \"realistic\"... but c'mon. This weapon isn't even useful on easy difficulty,\
      \ considering there's much more powerful alternatives unlocked from the very\
      \ beginning. \n\nBad dlc do not buy."
