    review: "The author mentions that this game is the last in the series of the parody\
      \ dating sims they created. So, If you have a spare time, try the other ones\
      \ too! The first in the series, is Other Age which is free to play, the second\
      \ one is Other Age Second Encounter which is available also available in steam\
      \ and in their main store. The only relation of the game on the previous series,\
      \ is that they are all  parody dating sims, nothing more, nothing less. So you\
      \ don't need to play the other games to in order to catch up in the story. Relationship-wise,\
      \ this game has actually a little connection in the \"Present\" in Area-X. Hint:\
      \ School Uniforms!\n\nAs of now, I complete the whole game and I enjoy the experience\n\
      \nRatings: from highest to lowest.\n\nCharacters (9/10)\n\nThere is not a single\
      \ character that I hate in this game, I love them all! But to be honest, I prefer\
      \ the some characters over Manly, the protagonist. However, Manly's character\
      \ traits blends well with everyone. To put it simply, Manly makes the other\
      \ character shines more when she is around with them. After unlocking, the extra,\
      \ I read on the character's profile, then eventually laugh hard when I found\
      \ out God's interest is censored*. Well, it is hinted on the game what his interest\
      \ is, it is indirectly revealed in some hidden events. Be sure to check it out.\
      \ Based on my gameplay this is how rate them. God >>> Rian > Johnny > Muki >\
      \ Jaki > Manly> Maki >> Doki > Myu-Myu. Most of the charcters has the tendency\
      \ to be a stalker.lol \n\nStory (9/10)\n\nThe mixture of the most cliche and\
      \ most impossible things to happen is a perfect touch to create a new storyline,\
      \ the only thing to complain is how short game's story is, but compare to their\
      \ other games, this is actually longer.\n\nDifficulty (8/10)\n\nIn order to\
      \ achieve an ending you need to meet a certain stat and amount of affection\
      \ in your chosen character. There are hidden events that only appear when you\
      \ reach  a certain amount of affection. Compare to the previous series, this\
      \ is easier , but still hard. There are a few minigames that torture my brain.\
      \ (I'm talking to you Crossword and Sudoku. The most painful part of this, is\
      \ that I don't know how to use skills in this mini games, because I discovered\
      \ it so late). I am really proud that I finish all of the levels in the minigames,\
      \ it was so worth it!\n\nConcept (7/10)\n\nStat-raising is not new to me anymore\
      \ but adding minigame with it, is great and increase the challenge of the game.\n\
      \nSaving Slots 6/10\n\nSaving slots is a Big Yes! I have play their previous\
      \ game and most of it has no saving system, so I was glad to have them, but\
      \ I still need more saving slots. Saving is really crucial in this game, so\
      \ I recommend adding more in the future, if it is not in this game, put it on\
      \ your future Projects.\n\nArt 5/10\n\nThe art is cute, but as I progress, and\
      \ finally get an ending I was disappointed that even the ending CG art is still\
      \ a chibi. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against chibi art but I prefer their\
      \ usual arts rather than chibi. I don't know If it is just me, but I feel that\
      \ they insert lesser effort for the event CGs in this game compared to their\
      \ previous ones. Other than that, character designs is unique and beautiful\
      \ while the backgrounds are gorgeous, I personally like the design of heaven\
      \ realm.\n\nLastly, I recommend this game to someone who is patient, enjoys\
      \ challenging minigames and for the ones who enjoys their previous games."
