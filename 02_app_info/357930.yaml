    review: 'This game is dumb !!! at first I liked it. the cocept is good but some
      levels are super easy while others are impossible ???

      I guess that would come down to poor level design? as much as I have played
      I can not seem to fully grasp the mechanics of it? how do I attack strongly
      or deffend all my combinations have failed ???? having more points ? nope? have
      all of them linked ?   nope. how they are linked. nope still un effected? I
      want to like this game but to many frustrations Not to mention so levels with
      toatly random worms floating around ??? thats not a Puzzle or stategy to that
      it is just messy and confusing for no reason??? I have even looked up how to
      beat some of the levels I could not beat but what I saw in vids never ever worked
      for me no matter what I tried or how fast. even got to the point where I was
      almost winning but still lost. WOULD REALLY like to now how this game is suppose
      to work. what allows you exactly to have a take over ??? Cuz it never fucking
      teaches you that ????'
