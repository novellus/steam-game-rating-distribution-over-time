Brigand Panama is a huge improvement over the base game in every aspect. The narrative is much more engaging and keeps the sprinkle of bizarre that was in Oaxaca. Every character has their own personality and backstory that is just as interesting as the main narrative. Brigand Panama brings in a lot more dialogue between npcs which helps get you attached and care for them. On the downside, you'll be hurt emotionally when they die from an enemy. There are many new things to play around with such as different rockets and grenades, flowers for stat boosts, traps, new enemies, new skills, and areas that flow well with each other.\n\nThe biggest improvements that the dlc brings are making the stats that sucked in Oaxaca more viable such as stealth and melee. No more instant death from enemies expect for one case with a boss. And, I have to mention again, the character development of other characters is so much better. The world feels a lot more dynamic because of it.\n\nThe only downside that I can think of is that some areas feel less optimized for performance than others and I encountered a bit more technical issues in Panama than I did in Oaxaca.\n\nIf you enjoyed Brigand Oaxaca, you'll like Brigand Panama a whole lot more.","timestamp_created":1599061289,"timestamp_updated":1599063189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.582764029502868652","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44Pzlp/QCc/6unwI="}
