    review: "After about 20 hours on the itch.io version, I can confirm this game\
      \ is a fantastic puzzler & worth a purchase. At it's core it is a match 3 puzzler,\
      \ but the breaking/sliding mechanic adds considerable depth to gameplay. You'll\
      \ find yourself eventually picking up the algorithm to set up combos, and when\
      \ a big one hits it is deeply satisfying.\n\nThe included ambient tracks are\
      \ fantastic, especially when 'the drop' hits. Deeply relaxing, zen like tracks.\
      \ You have seemingly endless palettes to choose from - although some are admittedly\
      \ pretty poor from a game play perspective due to poor contrast (but if you\
      \ want an aesthetic, chances are it is there). \n\nThe community is fairly involved\
      \ in the discord, and the game is moddable to add in additional music tracks\
      \ and palettes. In fact - the thing that brought me to this game was a cursed\
      \ music pack which used clips from 'Down with the Sickness' as the combo sounds..."
