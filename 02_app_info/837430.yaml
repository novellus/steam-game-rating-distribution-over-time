      \ is a story based virtual reality (Oculus and HTC Vive) experience unlike any\
      \ other. You will experience what it\u2019s like to train to become a navy pilot.\
      \ As gamers, we search for experiences that aren\u2019t possible in our daily\
      \ lives. With Navy Pilot Simulator, we\u2019re able to bring the armchair pilot\
      \ into the cockpit of a fighter jet. We have long wanted to develop a true pilot\
      \ simulator, but this wasn\u2019t possible until the advent of virtual reality.\
      \ The Oculus Rift allows us to offer an experience that previous generations\
      \ of hardware aren\u2019t capable of. Our goal is to create a true to life experience\
      \ as opposed to a game.  <br><br><br><strong>The Game </strong> <br><br>Flying\

      \ lieutenant) tasked with learning the functionality of the F-18 Super Hornet.\
      \ As you progress through the ranks, the missions become more challenging. The\
