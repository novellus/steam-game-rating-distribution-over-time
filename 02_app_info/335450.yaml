    review: 'A superb entry in the Gamebook Adventure series. The story is interesting
      and varied and the world of Orlandes makes for a colourful setting. This game
      simply knocks the spots off the other entries in this series, with a longer
      and far more detailed narrative and also a much more emotional plot.

      You investigate the death of an old friend and uncover an evil plot. You search
      out your other old friends and you can take any one of them along as a travelling
      companion to help defeat the evil plot. [SPOILER](and save your parents)[/SPOILER]

      The dice-roll combat system can seem a bit harsh at times, but overall the game
      is really well designed and nicely set-out on the screen. The game has three
      difficulty settings and it is long enough and challenging enough to provide
      a good amount of replay value. Also, each travelling companion gives the game
      a noticably different slant.

      There are some excellent colour artworks to collect, as well as a set of 32
      achievements to complete.

      Steam trading cards are also available from this game, if you like that sort
      of thing.

      Overall, the game is superb vfm.

      One small plot gripe: I was seriously shipping the hero with Gatito (the lurvely
      thief-with-a-kindheart) but instead you end up stuck with the irritatingly smug
      daughter of the Archduke, with no option to dump her! Bah!'
