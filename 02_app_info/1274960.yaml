    review: DAMN, DAMN, DAMN. THIS SOFTWARE IS A COOL CONCEPT BUT IT EXECUTES VERY
      POORLY. JESUS, I COULDN'T EVEN GET THE SOFTWARE TO CLOSE PROPERLY SO THERE GOES
      MY REFUND OF 5$. THE SOFTWARE IS SLOW, THERE IS NO TUTORIAL ON HOW TO USE IT,
      SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE FIGURING OUT HOW TO USE THIS SLOW UNRESPONSIVE SOFTWARE
      FROM THE GECKO. MICROSOFT GAME BAR DOES THIS SOFTWARE'S JOB BETTER AND IT'S
      FREE. MICROSOFT GAME BAR HAS IT'S OWN ISSUES BUT AT LEAST IT'S BETTER THAN PAYING
      FOR SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T WORK. I HOPE TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS TO THIS SOFTWARE
      SO I CAN CHANGE MY REVIEW AND SAY "HEY, GREAT SOFTWARE AND IT'S VERY CONVENIENT.
      NOW, I CAN WATCH MY FRIENDS STREAM WHILE PLAYING SKYRIM." THANK YOU FOR YOUR
      TIME AND HAVE A GREAT DAY!
