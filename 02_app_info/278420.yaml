      the hunt!  Build webs of your own design to trap and eat a wide variety of dynamic
      insects, each with its own behaviors and vulnerabilities. You must possess the
      agility and cunning of a spider to master the deep scoring system and top the
      per-level leaderboards in this unique, innovative blend of action, strategy,
      and puzzle gameplay.<h2 class="bb_tag">Your Real World Time and Weather .. Inside
      The Game!</h2> Prepare to be immersed as never before. Spider uses your location
      to reflect the time of day and weather in the game with that outside your window.
      Moths, fireflies, and crickets only come out at night. When it rains in real
      life, the rain also falls on Blackbird Estate. Play on a stormy night when lightning
      electrifies the top of the tower, or explore during a full moon when rare moths
      can be found.<h2 class="bb_tag">Hours and Months of Replayable Content</h2>
      Over 30 unique levels, each of which features redesigned gameplay in all 4 conditions,

      the family who until recently lived here. Use the map to explore the grounds,
      collecting clues that can be pieced together to open hidden passages, decrypt
      secret messages, and uncover long-buried secrets. The clues may help you solve
      the estate''s 7 puzzles, but you''re on your own when it comes to the ultimate
      mystery: The Rite of the Shrouded Moon!<h2 class="bb_tag">A Story of Spider
