Sure, it's not perfect. But when you look more deeply at the game, there's a lot here that is pretty cool. While the animations could use some work, the art style itself is quite nice and atmospheric. And I thought that the mysterious story worked well, too. It's interesting to see a game that leaves as much open to the player's interpretation as this. Lastly, the soundtrack, while generally subdued, creates a nice ambiance. All in all, I'd say to check this game out if you're interested. I got it for $9.99 on sale, and it was worth it.","timestamp_created":1609237731,"timestamp_updated":1609237731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504276871681213379","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46+KC1/YCeaKzvgI="}
