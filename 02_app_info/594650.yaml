      \ /><br>Savage, nightmarish monsters roam the Louisiana swamps, and you are\
      \ part of a group of rugged bounty hunters bound to rid the world of their ghastly\
      \ presence. Banish these creatures from our world, and you will be paid generously\u2014\
      and given the chance to buy more gruesome and powerful weapons. Fail, and death\
      \ will strip you of both character and gear. Your experience, however, remains\
      \ in your pool of hunters\u2014called your Bloodline\u2014always.<br><br><strong>HIGH\
      \ RISK, HIGH REWARD, HIGH TENSION</strong><br><br>Hunt\u2019s competitive, match-based\
      \ gameplay mixes PvP and PvE elements to create a uniquely tense experience\
      \ where your life, your character, and your gear are always on the line. At\
      \ the beginning of each Bounty Hunt match, up to 12 players set out to track\
      \ their monstrous targets. Depending on which mode and team options you\u2019\
      ve chosen, that 12 will include a combination of solo players and teams of two\
      \ or three. Once they\u2019ve found and defeated one of these they will receive\
      \ a bounty\u2014and instantly become a target for every other Hunter left on\
      \ the map. If you don\u2019t watch your back, you\u2019ll find a knife in it,\
      \ and your last memory will be of someone else walking away with your prize.\
      \ The higher the risk, the higher the reward\u2013but a single mistake could\
      \ cost you everything.<br><br>Hunt's Quick Play game mode offers a shorter match,\
      \ during which up to ten individual players race to scavenge gear and find and\
      \ close four rifts as they compete for a diminishing pool of bounty. First Hunter\
      \ to the final rift absorbs its energy, but must survive the final count down\
      \ to complete the mission\u2014while the other Hunters attempt to take them\
      \ out and take the prize for themselves. When the timer runs out the winner\
      \ keeps their Hunter, while the rest perish.<br><br><strong>PROGRESSION</strong><br><br>Even\
      \ in death, you will be able to progress among the ranks of Hunters via your\
      \ Bloodline. Though one character may die, their experience will be transferred\
      \ to your Bloodline, where it can be applied your other Hunters. If you make\
      \ it off of the map alive, you will be able to use the money and experience\
      \ you earn to kit out new Hunters and prepare for the next match. If you die,\
      \ you lose everything but your experience.<br><br><strong>DARK SIGHT</strong><br><br>Dark\
      \ Sight allows Hunters to see into the veil between worlds, making that which\
      \ cannot be seen by mortal eyes visible to those who have been initiated. Use\
      \ Dark Sight when you are tracking monsters, and a ghostly light will guide\
      \ you toward your next target. Dark Sight also marks players carrying a bounty,\
      \ making them more vulnerable to ambush while trying to escape."
