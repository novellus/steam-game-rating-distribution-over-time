    review: 'Early in the base games release, people complained about having to micromanage
      fire extinguishers.

      Dev''s solved it by adding a dlc that requires you to add new fire extinguishers
      over and over and over again in a micromanage scenario from hell. Im a hospital
      manager, im not suppose to be the one replacing them, its dumb as hell.


      Im also supposed to hunt for aliens, which means you have to look at your patients
      and spot when their cloaking device is glitching and then kick them out of the
      hospital. Again, im a manager, why cant i train people to spot them and throw
      them out. Or place traps. Or pretty much anything other than micromanagement
      of a constant influx of aliens.'
