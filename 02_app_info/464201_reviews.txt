Or at least you will be until just before halfway through the game (on Normal).\n\nPros:\n- Long range.\n- Respectable reload and lock-on timers, with no nead for aim-assist from an Air Raider.\n- Crazy high damage for such a low-level weapon. (Seriously, how is this thing only level 3?!)\n- Flies high up before tracking the target, making it easy to snipe enemies from behind buildings.\n\nCons:\n- Completely useless in small spaces like the underground, or when standing under something solid.\n- Has no secondary functions (dash, jump, zoom, etc.).\n\nHighly recommended if you haven't started finding level 10+ weapons yet.","timestamp_created":1547453874,"timestamp_updated":1547453874,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531024515628814697","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9YfcpegCeLiruAE="}
