The game is also still filled with lots of gramatical and spelling errors (In the game, 'Vinnie' is referred to as 'Vinston' for some reason, etc.) I'll have to play some more to get a more detailed review, but looks promising once it gets fixed up a bit!","timestamp_created":1529645815,"timestamp_updated":1529645815,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1529989317,"developer_response":"Hi,\nThank you very much for playing Vinnie's Diary. Vinnie and Vinson present two different personalities of the boy, which is the patient that players would face. Some players believe Vinnie is the inner personality of Vinson, but it really depends on you. \nSorry for the confusion and hope you enjoy this game!"}],"cursor":"AoJ4zdr/kuQCcOXcowE="}
