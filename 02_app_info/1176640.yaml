    review: I bought the game and was really hype until I played the wait for players
      game.... 1 year later..... the game is dead. I really hope the devs advertise
      this game more and add bots or single player mode but until then I wouldn't
      try it. I wish I could have had a chance to play, I wanted to do a video on
      it but sometimes things don't go as plan. inXile entertainment I am sure you
      can make this game work and don't take this review as a really bad review, think
      of it as a suggestion/opinion. The graphics are nice and I am sure if you manage
      to find a lobby maybe it'll be fun.
