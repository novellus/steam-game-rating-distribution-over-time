A turnstile rotating against the direction of your movement? What? Somehow I managed to push through one of them, but not two in a row.\n\nThe ball has huge inertia, sucking any enjoyment out of the game, if there was any to be had in the first place, because the game is barely playable with all its bugs. The main menu breaks whenever you use the mouse. Steam integration is broken. Audio screams so loudly without any ability to change it. Controller support is hit and miss, the worst part being a ridiculously huge sensitivity on camera turning. Double jump sometimes becomes unlimited.\n\nGraphics are OK, sound is quite annoying. Not that this matters...\n\n★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆","timestamp_created":1482620246,"timestamp_updated":1482620322,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570074975490570068","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjdjDmdkCdo2TbQ=="}
