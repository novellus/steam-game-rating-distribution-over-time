    review: 'So, as an avid fan of the entire series, there is a whole lot I like
      about this game, and a whole lot that I don''t. I like to start with the good
      news first, so here are some of the things that I absolutely love about this
      installment over and above the previous games...


      Tactical deployment: In combat, you can choose WHEN to deploy ships, and where
      to direct them to AS YOU ARE DEPLOYING THEM. This adds a whole new layer of
      tactical depth to combat, for those who choose to make use of it.


      Regularly scheduled ship and hull upgrades: The fact that Hope Station will
      regularly provide upgrades for you to buy for your ship hull and new weapons/systems
      for you to purchase means that even if RNJesus hates you (and boy, does he hate
      me), you can still make at least a pretense of having a decent loadout for your
      main ship.


      Greater variety of quests, and more frequent quest triggers: I have not played
      many games so far, but already I have noticed that I receive a wider variety
      of special missions than in the prior installments in the series, and receive
      the ones that are carry-overs from prior installments much more often. For example,
      I have already seen the Yellow Kawangi twice, when in all of the hundreds of
      games I played between Infinite Space and Weird Worlds, I never encountered
      them at all; I had to discover they were carry-overs here. I have received a
      copy of the Horloge of Primordius in nearly every game, when I have only encountered
      it 11 times in the past (and only once in a Universe where I had access to all
      of the other pieces reasonably needed to complete the quest, such as the anti-graviton
      shunt).


      Additional/expanded content: The addition of the Calatians (did I get that right?)
      as a fully fleshed out race, as well as all the new ship systems, etc, are great.


      Information availability: The inclusion of statistics for weapons and ships
      that are comparable helps when judging the relative value of weaponry and ship
      systems; in the past, the only method of gauging the relative value of anything
      was it''s trade value and experimentation... which has it''s own charm, but
      this is one of the few ways in which this game is more approachable than it''s
      predecessors.


      Here are some of the things that I have... let''s say, less enthusiastic feelings
      about...


      The 3D Map: There is an entire thread on this forum created specifically to
      complain about this feature, and while I like it aesthetically, and appreciate
      the fact that it makes navigation more tactical (nebulae are a lot less of a
      problem if you are smart about your flight paths), it makes navigation feel
      like a really cluttered, less streamlined decision. This one change has made
      it so that I can no longer just play a game at work on my lunch break; half
      an hour not only isn''t long enough to play a good game anymore, it''s not enough
      to visit each star system once, even if I ignore grabbing stuff and combat along
      the way and just try to speed-run it.


      The new combat system: This is a really mixed bag. The optional deployment feature?
      AMAZEBALLS. And it means that I can do stuff that is more thematically appropriate
      too, like using fighters such as good ol'' Ripcord to scout out unknown encounters,
      because he will be the fastest to get away if it''s an encounter with hostiles
      that I can''t win with my fleet. The ability to "drag" ship paths, including
      turns, etc? Great, loving it. But there are times when a ship just doesn''t
      seem to want to follow the path I am ACTUALLY drawing with my mouse, and instead,
      starts doing this weird jig on it''s own whim. Cost me my capital ship on more
      than one occasion. And automating the fighters? Cool idea... if I could turn
      it off (can you? If so, someone please tell me how).


      Here are the things that I really, really disliked...


      UI/Controls: This all feels very non-intuitive to me. In fact, my very first
      game, no lie, I quit the game because I had opened the "status window" for a
      ship system and then literally could NOT figure out how to close it, and it
      made playing the rest of the game actually impossible (turns out it''s a right-click
      on the mouse to close it, but nobody told me that). Whereas prior entries had
      a simple UI and controls that felt fluid and intuitive, such that your average
      child could pick up the game and figure out the basics in minutes, this one
      made me feel like it needs a manual, even for adults. So I gave the tutorial
      game a shot. It would have helped some if I had started here, but not nearly
      as much as I feel would have been needed. These issues impact SO MUCH of the
      game that while I am likely to continue enjoying this game, I am likely to clock
      up many more hours in WW:R2IS even now that I have this new novelty to explore.


      Overall, I think this is a good game, that could have been a great game. Still,
      it''s Digital Eel... even when they don''t knock it out of the park, I trust
      them to deliver me a largely positive experience, and Sea of Stars was no exception.
      And it definitely breaks new ground for the series, so at least they can''t
      be accused of pumping out "one more of the same". I''ve already gotten more
      enjoyment out of the game than the monetary value of what I had to pay for it,
      so I don''t feel cheated at all; I just think that some of the design decisions
      could have been reworked to turn this solid title into a true masterpiece.'
