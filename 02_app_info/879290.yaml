    review: "I\u2019m always very wary of purchasing indie games. I find they have\
      \ an alluring appeal, only to disappoint an hour into the game. Multi-Task Master\
      \ is one of those games with an alluring appeal that can keep those who like\
      \ being constantly stimulated or with an ADD brain not only occupied, but satisfied.\
      \ I absolutely love the level of simplicity mixed in with complexity \u2013\
      \ if that makes sense. \n\nMulti-Task Master is a game where the player must\
      \ balance their attention between four screens. All four screens have different\
      \ activities occurring within them, and are all controlled differently from\
      \ one another. I absolutely love the fact that the tasks are related. In one\
      \ task, you might be robbing a bank, while trying to keep the hostages calm,\
      \ while attempting to take out the suspects, while attempting to catch money\
      \ falling out of the building. In another task, you might be a boxer doing different\
      \ training regimes all at one time. Another scenario puts you on a factory assembly\
      \ line. All the scenarios I\u2019ve encountered so far are pretty neat, engaging,\
      \ and fun. The [b]gameplay[/b] delivery on this one is rock solid, straight\
      \ forward, and original. There are a lot of different scenarios and challenges\
      \ to go tackle. Each scenario becomes increasingly more difficult and quicker\
      \ over time. The player is given a certain amount of lives (to make mistakes).\
      \ Make one too many, and there goes your effort! \n\nThe [b]graphics and visuals[/b]\
      \ are well suited to the game. It is a little goofy and even slightly cartoon-ey,\
      \ but it adds character to an already fun game. It uses unity engine and more\
      \ or less all details (even particles) are included. The [b]sounds and music[/b]\
      \ are actually quite key in this game. Different game modes will produce different\
      \ sounds when new obstacles or challenges come your way. This prompts the player\
      \ to react and understand which of the four screens is asking for the player\u2019\
      s attention. This is a super important (minor) detail that will save the player\u2019\
      s butt when push comes to shove!\n\nOverall, this is a pretty rock solid game\
      \ for what it is. If this doesn\u2019t pique your interest at first, I would\
      \ say continue on your game search. If this does seem appealing to you, I\u2019\
      m sure you\u2019ll love it. I\u2019m a person that likes a lot of stimulus and\
      \ challenge; Multi-Task Master provides that and more. It is a little slow at\
      \ first as it forces you to walk through the tutorial. Even for non-gamers,\
      \ the game provides an interesting opportunity for them to step into the gaming\
      \ world. A few family members and even my girlfriend enjoyed it, but the game\
      \ got a little too hard and a little too fast for them. They still got a kick\
      \ out of trying it. I would highly recommend a purchase on sale! \n\n[h1] RATING\
