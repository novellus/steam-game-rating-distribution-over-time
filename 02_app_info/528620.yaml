    review: 'So far 36 hours in, its basically a updated graphics of Panzer General
      3D, with obviously a focus on specific campaigns that it didnt by using DLC
      for each. This campaign Blitzkrieg i''m just starting to invade the USSR, and
      albeit this DLC is very similar to Panzer General 3D, i cant blame the company
      for doing the same missions as they technically are the campaigns that were
      fought.

      Would i recommend this DLC, sure. Honestly its the first i bought and i''ve
      played it more than most games i buy. Fun, has different difficulty modes. I
      stick with easy mode as i don''t like losing. ;) Just be aware that as in other
      comments on this DLC, it is a frequent;ly created campaign to have the poland
      and france invasions, but they did add the yugoslavia and norway invasions that
      we didn''t see in panzer 3d general. I actually love the fact that you don''t
      have to buy all the additions and can get a good glimpse and game with $15,
      but be aware that its going to cost you to get everything. Finally am i disappointed
      that the enemy has more troops than I as in other posts; not really. Its how
      the game operates. Plus im about to start russia; wasn''t that frequently how
      it was? Either way id recommend. Especially if you want a cheap new game and
      generally lose interest within a month or two.'
