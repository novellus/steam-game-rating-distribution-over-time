    about_the_game: 'Control tough vehicles, heavy machines and powerful tools on
      a vast construction site - in virtual reality. In the final version of the base
      game, you will even be able to control a tower crane, to use two types of hammers
      to tear down walls and to build walls brick by brick. All features will be completed
      and optimized during Early Access. Additionally, there will be missions for
      aspiring builders to complete.<br><br>In addition to the base game, more vehicles
      and construction machines will be available for purchase as DLC at a later time.
      Current ideas include, but are not limited to wheel excavators, vehicle cranes,
      concrete mixers, crawler cranes and excavators, caterpillars and potentially
      even chainsaws and harvesters. Some new content might lead to new scenarios.
      And of course, each DLC will contain new missions, too.<br><br><strong>An overview
      of the features planned for the base game:</strong><br>Using the tower crane,
      you can distribute building materials at the construction site. Move a charging
      bucket, pallets of stones or prefabricated wall parts off a flatbed truck. After
      demolishing a building with a hammer or a hammer drill, fill a container with
      the rubble that will be taken away by a dump truck. Build a wall, laying brick
      after brick, held together with mortar. Which of course you have to unload and
      mix first.<br><br>There is no better way than Construction Playground to let
      off steam playfully by demolishing a building, use massive construction vehicles
      and feel as if you''re in the middle of a construction site - all in VR! It''s
      an immersive VR experience on the construction site!<br><br>A list of the planned
