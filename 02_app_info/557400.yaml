    review: GOLD. It's the first thing you think of when you hear MIDAS. Well Midas
      Gold Plus is just that, making gold by touching ''whatever'' with your blessed
      hands from the gods. Everything you touch turns to gold, so start making an
      awesome civilization and get rich and powerful?  I think that was the plan in
      the original myth, but he dies or worse like any Greek tragedy... Anywho, here
      you do click rocks to make gold and start leveling up a little village set up,
      to become a major powerful kingdom. A clicker/idle game- its just profiting
      and reaching high gold production rates with your villages sawmill, ranger guild,
      barracks and such. More gold unlocks more stuff. Rinse by restarting to get
      more powerful and repeat. Now, this isn't just an AdVenture Capitalist where
      its just making money...this is where the Plus comes in. Raids, Knowledge books,
      Diamonds, Blue rocks, Red gems, Relics and Champions are all things you use
      this gold to upgrade and buy and unlock to further more earn gold and make your
      kingdom awesome. Whew, That's a lot of stuff huh? Well yes, but it makes the
      game have more micro organizing and micro managing, thus more fun. Raids and
      Relics and Diamonds and ALL THOSE things basically without nit picking what
      each does and its rewards, is just to buff or increase production to make you
      gold. In some way. Clicking still works on the rocks...lol. Names of champions
      and places to raid and such seem to all come from some form of mythology. Major
      Mythos, I haven't seen anything form like Celtic or Mayan, but yes Greek and
      Norse mythology names are thrown around a lot here. It is King Midas... SO for
      the inner dragon/dwarf gambler that loves gold and loves using multiple managing
      ways to make more gold and gold, then yes, this is your idle/clicker game.GOLD!
      not pyrite.
