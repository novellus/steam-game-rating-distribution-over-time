    review: "Edit: Haven't seen any more updates or communication from the developer\
      \ since I first wrote this review. I would not recommend the game as it is now,\
      \ assuming no further updates. I will leave my original thoughts up, however.\n\
      \nI enjoyed this game very much, for many of the same reasons that other reviewers\
      \ have stated: the variety of heros/creatures and their abilities is great,\
      \ especially when combined with solid turn-based combat featuring smart AI and\
      \ roomy maps that let you outplay your opponent. If you're just looking to kill\
      \ some time on a fun little turn-based strategy game with some decent depth,\
      \ this game could a good choice. There are some problems, however.\n\nMost importantly,\
      \ development seems to be glacially slow, despite the fact that the dev had\
      \ been fairly active on the forums. This is just speculation, but based on their\
      \ responses, funding for the game seems to be rather low, and that combined\
      \ with how long it has been since the last update leads me to believe that further\
      \ updates are not going to be seen in the near future. This wouldn't be a problem\
      \ if the game was already finished and polished, but it isn't. \n\nA couple\
      \ things bug me quite a bit, mainly the fact that you have to pick each class\
      \ and buy each of their abilities before you can see what they do- you can't\
      \ make a decision based on what you know, but rather based on what you can guess\
      \ or what you have learned from taking it in the past (if you can remember such\
      \ an occurence). Also, the way that towns level up makes leveling your heroes\
      \ awkward, since you want your stronger heroes out front conquering new lands,\
      \ but the new lands will be at a very low level, whereas the towns in the back\
      \ where you want your weaker heroes to level safely will be much higher level\
      \ and their quests will be very difficult for your weaker heroes to complete.\
      \ The quests themselves do not have that much variety- there are like 3-4 types\
      \ of quests, the main differences being which units are in the quests (determined\
      \ by the location of the town) and the levels of those units (determined by\
      \ the level of the town). \n\nThese issues aren't gamebreaking by any means,\
      \ but they are enough to dampen my enjoyment of it and they have made the game\
      \ stale for me after a relatively short period of time. If development begins\
      \ to ramp up again and this game gets some quality of life changes that give\
      \ us (the players) more information on the units and abilities along with more\
      \ varied quests/combat environments, I could definitely see myself coming back\
      \ to it, however. Alternative game modes such as a Campaign, co-op/hotseat/any\
      \ form of multiplayer would also tempt me back if I managed to get a friend\
      \ into the game. I have mixed feelings about this game, but I did get quite\
      \ a few hours of enjoyment out of it in the end, so I will give it a tentative\
      \ reccommendation."
