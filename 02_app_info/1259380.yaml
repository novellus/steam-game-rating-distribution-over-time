    about_the_game: In the year 2047, a massive comet ravages Earth's surface and
      the remnants of mankind descend to the bottom of the ocean in order to survive.
      A century passes, and humans, resilient and enduring, slowly create new life
      in their cool blue underwater universe. But even in the still of the deep, one
      truth remains... where man goes, war soon follows. The craddle of civilization
      has spawned the seeds of man's destruction and now all the oceans of the world
      are not big enough for the embattled civilizations of the power-hungry White
      Sharks, the technologically savvy Black Octopi and the alien Silicons. Deploy
      armies, research technologies, mine for resources and set in motion a plan to
      gain control of this spellbinding abyss or find the fate of civilization and
      mankind dead in the water.<br>Features:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Three distinct
      civilizations to play, each with its own objectives, histories, untis, technologies
      and strategies to master.<br></li><li>Innovative all-new units classes and structures
