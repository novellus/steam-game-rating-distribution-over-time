Makes it much easier for the DM to track experience, treasure and combat.\n\nWould love to see a feature where the Ultimate license could dump the chat directly into Discord and players would not necessarily have to install the software.\n\nI will continue to use Fantasy Grounds when gaming in person because it is a great tool for the DM.","timestamp_created":1609772547,"timestamp_updated":1609772547,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u/f65vYCcu+0wAI="}
