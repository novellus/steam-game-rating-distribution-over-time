    review: 'Update 02/04/2019:


      Since last September 2018, the Developer adds tons of updates with tons of new
      features and fixes. The game isn''t the same anymore !


      We got a police system (including a prison), a brand new building system, graphical
      improvements and optimizations. There are shops, interesting locations, voice-chat
      (yeah, you can talk!!) and many many more.


      Believe it or not, there are tons of GREAT features coming soon. Build It going
      forward to be one of the best Life-MMORPG''s out there. I am really impressed
      about the game, the support and the passion of the developer about this game.
      It''s not a quick cash-grab or an asset-flip - it''s really fun and amazing
      to see the development process.


      To be honest, I love this game and it''s one of my favorite games out there
      - and it''s still in development with near unlimited great ideas coming up !


      ====== OLD REVIEW =====


      [h1]FAIR WARNING


      This is an EARLY ACCESS game, that means it''s still in development. If you
      search for an highly optimized, full of content, near free of bugs game, I would
      HIGHLY RECOMMEND to add this to your wishlist and WAIT until an further build
      of this game.


      ONLY BUY THIS GAME if you want to SUPPORT the developer and the idea behind
      it and you''re 100% sure that you can deal with bugs, crashes, errors, clunky/unfinished
      features and so on. Make sure you want to buy this game to help the developer
      to make a great game, post suggestions, report bugs... Don''t expect (especially
      in an early development stage) the best gameplay experience ever! I promise
      you, you will get angry and that wouldn''t really help to make a good game.


      So please, ask yourself: Do I really want it ? If you''re not sure, as I said,
      add it to your wishlist and wait!


      Short sidenote: I am sorry for my bad english, it''s not my native language
      - but I am working on it to improve my skills ![/h1]


      "Build it" is an highly RP based, 3rd person MMO set''s place in an open world
      scenario. There is no story and there is no "path" you have to follow. You''ll
      be able to write your own story, alone, with friends or unknown people. It''s
      up to you: Do you want to be an good guy, work hard to earn money, build your
      own house... or you want to be the bad one, that buy a gun and try to hunt other
      people down to get all their stuff ? "Build it" will allow you to do, what you
      want to do.


      The game combines many many features from other genres e.g. Real-Life simulator,
      survival and building/crafting. There are tons of items available to build your
      unique house/car, so you''ll be able to make what you want to create. But you
      need in-game money! You need to buy those items from NPC''s and there are many
      ways to earn money. But how to earn money ? Do a in-game job !


      There are several jobs available. Some of them are free (gather apples and sell
      them to an NPC), but others will cost some money ! For an example: Gather cannabis,
      drive to the cannabis processor and you''ll be able to generate some joints
      and sell them to the drug dealer ! Or do some mining, gather some diamonds ore,
      drive to the diamond processor and hopefully you get some diamonds you can sell.
      But keep in mind: You need a little bit of luck. Sometimes it''s happen that
      the processor craft "nothing" and you have to do it again. So much work, but
      don''t forget your little health/thirst bars ! Yeah, you have to eat and drink
      - and if you don''t take care about it, a Pain meter will show up until it''s
      full - and you die ! And if you die, you lost everything you''ve in your inventory
      (including money and clothes you''ve bought). But don''t worry, there are several
      ways to save some items/or your money. At an ATM you can send money to your
      bank account and if you die, it will not get lost. For other items, you can
      buy an container and place it into your house. This container saves all items
      that you put into it. So there are many things to to, and in the future, there
      will be much more !


      The graphic in the game - I like it ! It''s not Triple-A, but it''s not bad,
      too ! It''s good and I love to see the day/night/rain/snow cycles in the game.
      It looks amazing! Keep in mind it''s an small developer, and for such an game,
      it''s more as good ! The sound effects - okay, that''s something the developer
      will work (later) on. As I said, it''s a small developer and they focusing on
      more important things. But they will work on it. So, don''t expect some 3D-high-quality
      sound at this stage. The gameplay itself... You have to learn how to play! Some
      features are easy, others needs some playtime to deal with it. But at the end,
      you''ll get into this game really quickly and the developer want to add an tutorial
      to this game. And for sure, the community will help you, too ! If you have questions
      and don''t know how some things works, take a visit at Discord and/or the Steam
      forum.


      The Servers: Currently only one US based server with 50 slots - but it works
      for now (I am from europe!) and more servers (outside the us, too) are planed.
      Sure, it depends a little bit on how many people join the community. But we
      will see in the future what''s happen. But also keep in mind: As an small developer
      you can''t add tons of servers like a big company.


      [h1]Conclusion:[/h1]


      Sure, this game have bugs and sometimes we have to deal with problems - but
      why do we need EA when we don''t expect such things ? But to be honest, the
      developer works really hard on it, take every single bugreport really seriously
      and give us customers a great support. Really, for such an small developer,
      it''s absolutely great. I''ve seen bigger companys without such an great support.


      If you''re into the RP gameplay, it''s a promising game and make a lot of fun.
      I agree that there is many work to do and much more features are needed AND
      announced for the future (check out the Roadmap). And with more people on it,
      it would be an amazing thing and a good game to play.
