I'm a huge fan of indie and 8 bit games and this really does it for me. \n\nIt's a wave based survival game. So build your walls and your army and survive for as long as you can! \n\nIt's quirky and new and was released on steam 6 days ago! I'm really looking forward to what this game has to offer!","timestamp_created":1589759104,"timestamp_updated":1589759104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484015524387359619","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwwNrBkvICdMu/iAI="}
