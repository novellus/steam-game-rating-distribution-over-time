So I'm  taking this opportunity to explain why I've started playing it about three times and always dropped it again very quickly, even though I'm in the target market: I like puzzle games, and I like music.\n\nThe first issue is the music. If you like how it sounds, you're going to like the game more; and I don't. But the choice of having the game sound out the game board continually also means that I don't get much of an aural feedback on what I am actually doing in the game: walking, pushing or turning essentially only adds to that tapestry (and there is no way to adjust the relative volume of it), which makes moving feel somewhat unreal. There is a kind of progression in the music as I solve the game, but it doesn't really sound better at the end than it does at the start.\n\nThe second issue is that these levels are sprawling compared to other box-pushing games. To get to 3-stars, you need to plan way ahead; and since there's also a timer in addition to the step counter (and the step counter always counts up even if you undo), it becomes impossible to 3-star a level the first time.\n\nThe third issue is that these initial levels are designed such that you make the level harder to navigate as you solve it. In a typical box-pusher, you'd need to figure out how to access the difficult boxes that you need to push; in this one, on the first few levels, I can access everything, but solving stuff cuts off paths. In effect, as I play a level, I'm making things more difficult for myself. That's the exact opposite of a traditional box-pusher, where playing along makes my short-term goals easier to achieve.,\n\nAll of these issues conspire to kill my motivation for this game super fast before I've even gotten into it. Looking at the play time on the reviews here on Steam, there are quite a few positive reviews who've only accumulated less than an hour as well, suggesting that this problem is more widely spread than the review score suggests.\n\nSo, to sum it up:\n- this game punishes you for walking\n- this game also punishes you for thinking\n- but you still need to plan ahead\n- the sound of this game does not really correspond to the environment\n- unless techno is Zen for you, the sound punishes you for listening\n- the game punishes you for playing because you need to make the level harder for yourself to complete it\n- motivation derives from a single number going up\n\nIf you're seeing this as a welcome challenge, this may be the game for you, especially if you're into the way it sounds.\nIt's not for me.","timestamp_created":1608148719,"timestamp_updated":1608148719,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.638229250907897949","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42cLItvYCevHjugI="}
