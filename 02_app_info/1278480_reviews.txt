I tested the theory 3 times to prove this and got identical results every time. With this program installed and running it makes some of my windows store programs run slower and less responsive (it is very noticeable). I find it makes no difference to gaming and in actual fact it introduces some very slight micro stutters at rare intervals. In all honesty I have went back to my old program Power Plan Manager by Hamilton Engineering which automatically changes power plans for selected applications and this runs flawlessly. The only drawback is that you need to pay for a lifetime license after the trial period but I would recommend it. If you don't want to pay, you can use a program called Full Throttle Override instead which isn't quite as good but I still recommend and it is completely free.","timestamp_created":1602169364,"timestamp_updated":1602169364,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4ouvhPUCcYnQpgI="}
