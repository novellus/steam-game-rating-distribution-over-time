I don't know why you and him are Ferrets or why the game puts so much emphasis on this, but I honestly do not care. It's a straight up pirate game and nothing less.\n\nThe map is procedurally generated and split into grids. The further a grid is from origin, the stronger the ships roaming in it become. The grids are small enough to traverse them in a few minutes, but large enough to not see any land sometimes.\n\nWithin each grid you start with a blank map and have to discover islands on your own, or you can buy map data from a cartographer (if you find one). Islands have various houses at which you can dock, like Fishermen, Farmers, Shipwrights, Merchants, Artists, Bankers, etc. You interact with these exclusively through the UI, you never actually leave your ship.\n\nIn the early game, you'll want to do some trading so you can buy a new ship. Or if you're feeling lucky you can try to board a bigger ship and take it over, however this has a low rate of success. After you have a decently large ship, you'll probably want to upgrade it further.\n\nThere is an NPC on islands who sells upgrades, but they always only sell one kind, out of speed, maneuverability, cannon power and storage capacity. So you will be busy exploring and finding multiple Shipwrights who can satisfy your upgrading needs.\n\nIf your ship gets destroyed, you lose it, as well as your unbanked money (or half of it in softcore) and it's back to raft business. However there is also some permanent progression with the three existing factions. You constantly gain and lose reputation with factions according to your actions and under which flag you sail. This way you can rank up and gain a number of perks, most of which require you to sail under a specific flag. Your flags are basically your skills, depending on what you want to do, you raise a different flag that gives you different bonuses.\n\n[h3]Bottom Line[/h3]\nIt's a neat roguelite pirating experience. The sailing feels weighty and your ship accurately floats with the volumetric waves. The world is endless and you can go wherever you want. It has the trinity of exploration, trade and combat and while neither of those are exceptional, they are all decent, and most importantly, not annoying. I like the lack of flashy telegraphs for cannons and wind, it makes the game surprisingly immersive for what it is.\nCompared to Sea of Thieves I like that this is a singleplayer game, with progress beyond visuals. Compared to Atlas I like its simplicity, at least when it comes to stripping away everything that is not sailing related, and compared to Salt, it's actually a game and looks better too.\n\n[h3]My Suggestions[/h3]\nWhat this game needs most in my opinion is in-depth ship customization, to enable greatly different playstyles (even within combat itself). I would take a look at the battle royale pirate game \"Maelstrom\" for some inspiration on how to do satisfying functional customization that goes beyond just upgrading 4 numbers straight-forwardly.\nAlso perhaps some \"mysterious\" grids that have undead ships roaming around, that are high risk / high reward in some way.\nA first person view and ability to walk around on your ship would be awesome too.\n\n[h3]Meta[/h3]\nThe dev is putting out huge content updates, bugfixes and performance improvements left and right, even in the short time since I started playing. In this light I'm perfectly happy with the price tag. If you only care about the immediate bang for the buck I would place this at around 10â‚¬ (Yes you can play this potentially infinitely, but so far the content/systems aren't thrilling enough to make that happen yet)\n\nAhoy\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2231563888","timestamp_created":1601383925,"timestamp_updated":1601385688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552004992961883545","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwvM2B7fQCd8HopAI="}
