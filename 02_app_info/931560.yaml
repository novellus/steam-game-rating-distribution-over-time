    reviews: "\u201CSeven Days turns out to be a fantastic visual novel that excels\
      \ in creating a meaningful cast of characters supported by great design and\
      \ music. The game takes a wacky premise and turns it into an emotional tale\
      \ of heartbreak, the afterlife, and existence. Though I might have had an existential\
      \ crisis while playing, I enjoyed this brilliant story.\u201D<br>9/10 \u2013\

    review: "This visual novel is LIFE0\u2019s first work and I will definitely say\
      \ they have done a good job on this work. The galgame \u201CSeven Days\u201D\
      \ has an extremely meaningful story and the most important idea it would like\
      \ to convey is that \u201CTreasure Your Life\u201D. After going through the\
      \ entire game, I ended out realizing so many life principles which really impressed\
      \ me a lot and brought this game to a higher level. For sure I want to suggest\
      \ people purchase this galgame Seven Days and I am looking forward to seeing\
      \ more galgame published by this company in the future. By the way, the galgame\
      \ is for full age and I really appreciate it.      \n\nSakura: A girl who taught\
      \ me to slow down my step, enjoy and live in the moment of present without always\
      \ thinking about what is next. (Moe: Glutton)\n\nKotoha: A girl who taught me\
      \ that the loneliness I was suffering before is not meaningless, the loneliness\
      \ I experienced actually brought up my present toughness and gentleness. (Moe:\
      \ Tsundere)\n\nMari: A girl who was lacking the love from her original parents,\
      \ especially her mother, but finally felt the warmth of mom\u2019s love from\
      \ the protagonist\u2019s mother. (Moe: Energetic)\n\nIchiru: A girl who was\
      \ pursuing a cool life like a passionate life that a shonen manga\u2019s protagonist\
      \ has, burning out all her energy by doing exciting things until the end. (Moe:\
      \ Wild)\n\nShizuku: A girl who was working hard to share the truth behind their\
      \ sadness stories in order to convey the idea of treasuring your life and everyone\
      \ beside and important to you. (Moe: Mukuchi)\n\nNene: A girl who realized true\
      \ love is not really expressed by the physical relationship but built by a metal\
      \ and psychological relationship (Moe: Hentai in the surface but pure in the\
      \ heart)\n\nChiyako: A girl who treasure the forty-nine days\u2019 memories\
      \ spent with the protagonist Shuizie, who was suffering from the nightmare for\
      \ a long time and finally released from the curse by Shuizie\u2019s rescue in\
      \ the end of story (Moe: Tennen) \n\nRecommendation on improvement: I actually\
      \ have experienced some problems with the game system like I cannot make screenshots\
      \ in the full size, and I hope they can make the story longer to more than 45\
      \ hours playing time. Also, if every heroine can have equal story length, it\
      \ will be better.    \n\nOverall, the galgame is worth buying because of the\
      \ quality of the story and the charming heroines. I will give Seven Days the\
      \ score of 8.6 out of 10."
