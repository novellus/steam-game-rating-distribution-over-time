A lot of tactical details big-budget films don't take into account (trigger control, dropping aim so they don't shoot each other).  Half-decent acting.  Unique setting of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  The right actors were cast.\n\nPlenty of rookie mistakes: poor scripting, audio issues, plain visual effects.\n\nBut this is indie pulp.  You're here for the pulp.  You have to know this is what you're getting into.\n\nRent for a fun night.","timestamp_created":1527914437,"timestamp_updated":1527914437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566473960876464844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mIOz3+MCcI3yoQE="}
