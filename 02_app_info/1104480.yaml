    review: I really loved this game as a kid - an enjoyable side scroller, with interesting
      features, good settings, good music and memories of World Cup 94 all tied in.
      There were many versions but as far as I know I had the best, which was the
      Amiga. I don't know what this port is based on but it's so disappointing - the
      scrolling and controls don't even work properly together, which makes it virtually
      unplayable. Was it really that difficult to release a properly functioning version
      of this for the price?
