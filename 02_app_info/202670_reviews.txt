Story was good, puzzles were good. If I was going to complain, it would be how you have to switch between characters. If you are Bess, and need to be George, you can't just call George and ask her to do something, etc., and switch that way. You have to call Nancy and have her take over the case and then Nancy can call George and have her take the lead. It's by no means a reason to judge the game harshly, but it becomes a bit tedious in a single play-through. I don't remember how long the other games took me, but I was able to complete it in 7.5 hours. Also, be wary of relationships because you might get stuck all because it appears as if no one has new information while really you just need to be someone else. Great game overall!!","timestamp_created":1609373588,"timestamp_updated":1609373588,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwooOJ2/YCfvX4vgI="}
