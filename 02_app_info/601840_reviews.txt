Those are actually very fun! Totally recomend if you want a game with rogelike elements in the deck building side and engaging battles that doesn't need you to hit people physically","timestamp_created":1609903919,"timestamp_updated":1609903919,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4+Ynw6vYCe+DywAI="}
