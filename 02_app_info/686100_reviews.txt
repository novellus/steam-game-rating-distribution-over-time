Hit boxes need improved.  I often have a round where I loose 4 or 5 shots because I shoot the ball through the same can over and over again, without it registering as a hit.  My score is also stuck, so I can not purchase any more types of balls to shoot.   Fix these two things and I will recommend this game and change my review.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1542515565,"timestamp_updated":1542515565,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nPTFkucCfbr/rgE="}
