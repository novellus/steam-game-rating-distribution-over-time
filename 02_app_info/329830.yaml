    short_description: You are on a bleak, cold, windy island. And you seem to be
      alone... but fires and candles still burn. As you explore, a story of guilt,
      loneliness, and faith begins to take shape. And it becomes increasingly obvious
      that something is hunting you...

    review: Short, wonderfully atmospheric and a little rough around the edges but
      overall a worthwhile experience. Walking Sims are my jam and this one doesn't
      disappoint in the writing category. Where this game is rough on the other hand,
      is its presentation of dialogue resulting in text sometime overlapping or being
      presented in an awkward order as well as general player movement. Running into
      awkward invisible walls when trying to explore a house or just moving too slowly
      is all too common in this game but its worth it for the visual presentation
      (great retro feel) and its ending. The ending makes any shortcoming the game
      has worth it with a great built up to a satisfying conclusion. Just like A Wolf
      in Autumn, the game is about half an hour long and costs the price of a coffee.
      For such a low price of entry, it's hard to make an argument against checking
      this game out. Short, sweet and definitely worth your time.
