I almost gave up after seemingly endless dreary backgrounds and repetitive tunnel shots without a sense of a plot but I'm glad I persisted.  If you buy the game here on Steam, there's a pop up when you launch that game.  Use that URL on your phone to create an Itch.io account.  From there you can download a Windows copy of the R18+ version of this game.  Or an Android one if you're into squinting at a 6\" screen.  Very hot love scenes that flesh out (no pun intended) the story and the relationships even more.  Something seems to be missing if you read through the PG13 one first time around like I did.  Sex always complicates things, doesn't it?  :)  \n\nOnce the main characters are all assembled, like Your Dry Delight and Highway Blossoms, their stories pull you in.  There are 3 different romance branches and you have to complete the first 2 to get to the 3rd, but each one is fully worthwhile exploring.  Each man has his own demons (ironic to say that for this particular novel) and you as the MC have the ability to help them through it.  I was impressed by the sophistication of the wisdom each character had to add to the relationship with the MC as well.  Kudos to the devs for such thoughtful story telling!  \n\nThe final story is the most complex, the longest to finish and in its way, the most rewarding.  But that seems fitting because this is a very long VN (17 hours of play for me) overall and the final ending is the one that is most complete in realizing the goals of the MC and his future.\n\nSo wish Argent would keep making BL VN!!","timestamp_created":1587152400,"timestamp_updated":1587422846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50428396463394165","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww8vxzPECd67GgQI="}
