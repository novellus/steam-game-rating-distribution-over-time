It's fun, short, has a lot of replayability, and the characters have such vivid personalities! For 5 bucks it's absolutely worth it. I've never participated in a game jam (the max experience I have with programming is messing around in RPG maker), but I feel like I could connect to the characters and share their experiences nonetheless.\nThe music is one of the most impressive things about this game. I love all of the tracks, and find myself listening to some of it with the game open in the background sometimes.\nAlso! I was very surprised to see that Animator-Senpai MOVES? Like, I've never seen a sprite that involves constant animation, and that was great as it was reflecting on her specialty, well, animating. I simply adore this game and find myself coming back to it to replay and play through the different options.","timestamp_created":1572142619,"timestamp_updated":1572142619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l5PAhe4Cd9341AE="}
