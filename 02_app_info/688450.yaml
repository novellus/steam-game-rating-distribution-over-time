    review: I've never been more disappointed in a dollar spent ... When you have
      a game ...where transitioning to the next portion of the map can result in your
      DYING BEFORE YOU SEE THE HAZARD ... You have a bad game ... The hit boxes on
      some of the hazards are just TERRIBLE ... Overall I would recommend almost any
      other game for your $1 ... Dear God this was irritatingly bad
