    review: Really good route. It's a very detailed and good-looking route, quite
      long, and not laggy either. One thing I really like is that in the included
      scenarios, there are a range of different seasons to choose from, which completely
      change the appearance of the route - summer, rainy and overcast, snowy and colourful
      autumn.
