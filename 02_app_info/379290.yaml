      game, and some of its best qualities are lost during online play. As such, Sumo
      Revise is at this time offline-only. BE ADVISED. Also, playing with 8 players
      simultaneously requires four gamepads, two keyboards, and a mouse. The extra
      keyboard is needed because keyboard hardware can only receive a few inputs at
