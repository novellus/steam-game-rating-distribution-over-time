    review: "Pretty fun, I am currently #1 in the world with only just over an hour\
      \ of playtime and I could have gone more but the game decided to make my character\
      \ massive so I don't fit through the obstacles and I died. I guess there is\
      \ a limit to how high the highscore can be but I think it's possible just about\
      \ to beat my highscore if you get lucky with whatever obstacle generates next.\
      \ Just weird that it made my character big so I don't get a higher score but\
      \ I guess the game was telling me enough was enough since the 2nd ranked person\
      \ only has around 7500 points where I have almost 12000 so I guess the game\
      \ decided it was time for me to stop xD \n\nEdit: I believe it's a bug that\
      \ can happen when you step on a specific platform? I'm not sure but I heard\
      \ something about a bug that increses your character size. so when it's fixed\
      \ should be fine!"
