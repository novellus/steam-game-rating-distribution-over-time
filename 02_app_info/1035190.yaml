    about_the_game: In 2022, humanity was faced with an outbreak of an unknown virus
      that quickly killed 99% of people, for unknown reasons, only people with 4 negative
      blood groups managed to survive. The outbreak began in North America and spread
      rapidly throughout the world. People started going crazy, attacking each other,
      devouring their own kind. The survivors had no choice but to quickly adapt to
      the external conditions, they began to unite in communities, to stock up on
      weapons and food. On August 23, 2025, a military plane crashed near one of the
      survivors ' camps for unknown reasons. After the Council had decided to gather
      a group and go to the crash site. Unfortunately of the 5 people groups that
      survived the eve. Going back to camp alone is pure suicide, so eve makes the
      only correct decision to follow the plane to the crash site...<h2 class="bb_tag">Survive</h2>You
