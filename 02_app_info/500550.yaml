    review: "I'll say this right off the bat. This game is great if you're looking\
      \ for something really laid back. It has a cute, light-hearted story; nothing\
      \ too deep, and the gameplay itself is quite simple. It also has a bit of a\
      \ Star Trek feel to it. You can definitely tell the creator is a fan.\n\nBasically,\
      \ you're the captain of a spaceship. You travel from planet to planet  chasing\
      \ down your threat-to-the-unverse first officer while collecting some alien\
      \ friends along the way. You can either try to save the universe and win over\
      \ your second officer, or like me, stab everyone in the back and make it with\
      \ your first officer~\n\nThe game is pretty non-violent. Even your strongest\
      \ weapon is actually just a relocator device. You \"fight\" enemies by walking\
      \ into them. If that enemy poofs, you've won. If your weapon isn't strong enough,\
      \ you'll get bumped back and take on a little damage. \n\nHonestly, you can\
      \ probably just edge around most enemies. They won't chase you, but I'd advise\
      \ having a strong enough weapon just to avoid the nuissance of it. (There's\
      \ no need to bother with shields.)  \n\nThe game offers some fun, self-aware\
      \ humour. It's filled with amusing, silly dialogue and options.\n\nOne thing\
      \ that particularly stood out to me was the unique option to choose your own\
      \ gender and pronouns. There isn't the typical drop down list, so whatever it\
      \ is you'd like your character to be referred as, you can literally type in\
      \ anything. \n\n\n---\n\nIN A NUTSHELL VERSION\n\n- gameplay simple, story light-hearted\
      \ and not too deep, great if you're looking for something laid back\n- non-violent,\
      \ focuses more on character interactions than combat\n- choose your own gender\
      \ and pronouns\n- has some fun, self-aware humour\n\n\n\n* In good concience,\
      \ I do feel I need to give fair warning... This game is very social justicey.\
      \ This is just one extra thing to take into consideration when buying the game,\
      \ because it's not subtle. If you're all for that, cool! Get the game. If not,\
      \ the game still has it's charm, but it's just the one extra thing to keep in\
      \ mind.  \n\n\nEither way, I think the game was fairly priced. Really. It costs\
      \ nothing. I enjoyed it's humour throughout and I genuinely hope more people\
      \ will try it out~ Good job to the creator."
