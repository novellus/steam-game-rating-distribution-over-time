    review: "So after being forced to purchase another app called \"Lossless Scaling\"\
      \ to run this game in fullscreen mode, as entering the Options screen crashes\
      \ the game if you don't bloat your PC with extra language packs.  I can finally\
      \ play the game without hurting my eyes looking at a tiny window on my 4k screen.\
      \ \n\nThis is an alright game.  It feels & plays EXACTLY like Bubble Bobble,\
      \ except you defeat enemies differently.  The audio even sounds similar to Bubble\
      \ Bobble. That should give you a good enough idea of how it is.  \n\nWill be\
      \ recording the whole game later on once I find the time."
