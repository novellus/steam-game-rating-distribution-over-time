This game is junk. A bunch of assets thrown randomly in a room for you to find. \n\nThe interface is poor, mouse speed is painfully slow, there's no setting for it, you have to hold right-mouse button to look about, like why on earth would you not just use mouse look? And because RMB has to be held, the mouse-cursor ends up at the edges of the screen so when you actually want to click something you have to bring it back to the center of the screen manually, it's a mess. There's not even a custom mouse cursor.\n\nInstead of offering a choice of the TWO rooms when you start, instead they've put that in settings. FML.\n\nThere are no achievements, so there's very little reason to play this game.\n\nHow do you make a HOG less enjoyable? Stick a timer on it, make movement difficult and restrict your view by giving you a torch that you can;t even move around easily.\n\nSummary: fail, I wouldn't recommend this game even for 10c.","timestamp_created":1538774602,"timestamp_updated":1538774602,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.639085233211517334","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkaKHo+YCdPGRrAE="}
