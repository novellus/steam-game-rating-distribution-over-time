    review: 'A retrospective tale that shares the joys, doubts and fears of the author''s
      life.

      It''s candid throughout, often confusing and occasionally funny.

      Short but provocative, though quite abstract. A very off-beat experience that
      is somewhat light on gameplay.

      Having done a single playthrough, I don''t necessarily feel much sense of accomplishment,
      but there are parts of the game that I would replay and share with friends,
      which I believe is what the author set out to do.'
