      /><br><br>An ancient prophecy foretold that the kingdom of Greenlands and its
      villagers would experience dark times. This prophecy came to pass on the death
      of the King. The King died without a son and heir which plunged the kingdom
      into chaos as his daughters became emerged in a vicious power struggle. A portal
      to hell was opened allowing waves of demons and dark creatures to rampage through
      the kingdom bringing terror and panic to the villagers, destroying and pillaging
      all in their wake.<br><strong><br>The apocalypse has come to Queendoom!</strong><br><br>But
      all is not lost, the Queens possess strong values; courage, honesty and loyalty.<br><br>They
      have been trained by the masters of Greenlands to fight with the bow against
      the most fearsome enemies. Artisans from all over the kingdom have been manufacturing
      special arrows, with exceptional raw materials and superior forging techniques,
      making them capable of defeating the strongest and most resilient creatures.<br><br>The
      objective is to defend their castle to win the freedom of the villagers, bringing
      peace and prosperity back to the kingdom of Greenlands. The battle will be long
      and arduous, but victory is the only option. Aside from the battle, the Queen
      will also need to complete other mysteries and unlock achievements. <br><br>You
      can lead your own army of warriors, archers and supports. Strategy and good
      resource management will be the keys to success. Hone your skills with every
      hour you spend playing. Defeat your enemies and you will be the heroine of Queendoom
      earning yourself an indelible place in the kingdom's history as you soar up
      through the rankings.<br><br><strong>Are <i>you</i> ready</strong> to challenge
      and face the bosses of hell and their minions? <br><br><strong>The war in Queendoom

    review: '+ Good VR bow game. Not the best, but good.

      - The arrow setting is a little bit off: you have to bend your hand to set the
      arrow to the bow.

      - Also you can''t change hands after you accidentally chose wrong.

      - To get to the next wave, you have to shoot the arrow extra far, instead of
      the possibility to just push a button.

      * Could also have multi-player online choice.'
