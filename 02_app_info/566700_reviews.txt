It is clear fun to play it with a friend especially when you are new to VR and you can experience it with a friend. The game was AWESOME and I would really like to see more levels or games from this developer. And I have to admit that playing with the physics and making PC player to jump infinitely on a barrel was pretty funny and made us both laugh and have fun for more than half an hour. Both players had fun and I think were treated equally good (but idk, I was only the VR one). Also the ability to use steam's option to play online with a friend in home was working well and done its job in those covid times.","timestamp_created":1609652333,"timestamp_updated":1609652510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw04Ox4/YCerP8vwI="}
