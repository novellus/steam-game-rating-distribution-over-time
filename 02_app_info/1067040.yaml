        flashing lights and loud, spontaneous noises.

    short_description: The summoning ritual failed - you couldn't contain the demon.
      Your friend died. Was devoured. You want out, but the door is sealed with alchemic
      sigils. All you have are the remains of your friend's notebook and a derelict
      haunted house full of magical ingredients.

    review: 'Overall a very short and boring experience. The game starts you out with
      a manual that tells you how to create ingredients to solve the puzzle. Then
      you just backtrack... backtrack... then backtrack some more.... Oh enemy spawned
      better backtrack and grab some salt... oh congrats you completed this seal it''s
      time toooooooooooo BACKTRACK!!!
