There is a melee to start zombie. And if you are like me you find that the zombie is outside the play area. Resulting in you not being able to start ANYTHING! When you first start the game you shoot the zombie, it dies and you start killing. But once this melee to start zombie appears you can't do anything, it doesn't go away. So for the time being be aware this one thing can break the game for you. Don't want to but have to refund the game I can't even play any more","timestamp_created":1516921381,"timestamp_updated":1516921381,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515612483024597168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iOzjl+ECdJyQlwE="}
