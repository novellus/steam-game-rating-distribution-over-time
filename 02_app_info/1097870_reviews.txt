It is fun and addictive and gets you hooked, easily. I hope to see more from this developer.\nThis game is worth buying for the fun times to enjoy","timestamp_created":1585649332,"timestamp_updated":1585649332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8pWEmPECeIvY/AE="}
