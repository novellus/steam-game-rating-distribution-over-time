    review: "[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift. VR Review. Updated Full Review 5/1.\
      \ [/h1]\n\n[i] Note: I tried both keyboard & mouse and Xbox One controller.\
      \ I preferred the controller. [/i]\n\n[u] Full Review. I am updating my recommendation\
      \ to nuetral from my initial impressions review. [/u]\n\nSo my initial impressions\
      \ review was positive. I am editing the review now so it can be a fuller review\
      \ of the game and gameplay mechanics. I am also changing my review from positive\
      \ to a neutral recommendation. I still love the game, but it's so difficult\
      \ to overlook the current flaws in VR. I only recommend the game for people\
      \ willing to overlook those flaws. I want to emphasize how jittery the visuals\
      \ are. I have a strong VR stomach so it doesn't bother me, but it is difficult\
      \ to ignore. It's so prevalent throughout and seems to randomly happen. The\
      \ camera controls are also so difficult to overcome. I did find a way to work\
      \ those controls. You have to constanly hit Y on your Xbox Controller to get\
      \ into First Person View. This resets the camera to where your character is.\
      \ From there you can easily adjust the camera. \n\nAlso, during battle, I noticed\
      \ how some of the combat action text was difficult to read as it was to the\
      \ very edge of your screen on the left side. Of course you don't need to read\
      \ it because you can memorize where the actions are on the menu after playing\
      \ a few times. But it is a very noticeable problem. \n\nFinally, there is no\
      \ hand holding. After the start of the main quest, you're basically left there\
      \ with no directions on what to do. I went into many different towns on the\
      \ map. First thing I noticed is that there is a lot of pop-in errors on the\
      \ map visuals. But if you keep walking they eventually fill. Several of the\
      \ areas were blocked off. Several towns were not open for reasons I do not understand.\
      \ However, some towns are open for you to go inside if you go in the correct\
      \ direction. Unfortunately, I dont' know a way to know that other than random\
      \ exploring. You do level quickly. I recommend buying lots of items to restore\
      \ hp, mana, and cure effects. Kill weak enemies quickly first. You can avoid\
      \ most enemies. But you probably want to fight them, make money, spend on items,\
      \ level, rinse & repeat.\n\nMy initial impressions review is below. I only edited\
      \ the final score. I included screen shots in VR.\n\n---- Original Initial Impressions\
      \ Review ----\n\nIf you can look past some of the clunky controls and some of\
      \ the graphical issues, this is a gem of a game for VR. I was actually surprised\
      \ by how immersive the VR was because the dev seemed to indicate only part of\
      \ the game was VR or that it was an afterthought. In fact, the whole game works\
      \ in VR and there's lots of cool options. I do recommend lowering the BGM as\
      \ soon as you can as the music is by default rather loud.\n\nLet me touch on\
      \ the bad first, because that may effect your puchase decision. I did notice\
      \ jittery visuals at times. I'm not sure why, sometimes the visuals look perfectly\
      \ fine and at other times the whole scene looks jittery even when there's not\
      \ a lot of movement going on. And getting the right point of view can be very\
      \ frustrating. The good news is that there are options for controlling the camera\
      \ and eventually you can find one that is best for the situation. But you will\
      \ have to get used to constantly playing around with the camera angle. \n\n\
      So this is classic turn-based action in VR with normal attacks, magic attacks,\
      \ and use of items. So far I am playing the princess bride storyline and the\
      \ story is really good. I am enjoying doing the main quest. Each of your companions\
      \ has unique skill sets to help you out in combat. I liked the art style. I\
      \ love how you can go into FIrst Person mode and it's just amazing to do in\
      \ VR. I just wish the combat could have also been as immersive, although it's\
      \ still classic and satisfying combat.\n\nI also like how the narrative text\
      \ is done. It's easy to read and done really well. There are some spelling errors,\
      \ but nothing too major. There's several save points so you don't have to worry\
      \ too much about dying. There's towns and shops and lots of NPCs to talk to.\
      \ There's all kinds of monsters to battle. \n\nI think at the current sale price\
      \ of $5, this is a really good deal. I highly recommend it at that price and\
      \ I can look past the warts in VR for that price.\n\nRate 6/10. Buy on sale\
      \ only. Only recommended if you can look past all the problems. There's a good\
      \ game hidden underneath all the rubble. See photos below for why I like the\
      \ game.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1375761497\n\
