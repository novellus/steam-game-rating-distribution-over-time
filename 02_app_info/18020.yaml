    review: 'The continuation of whatever the fuck happened in the last episode.

      Your house is still in pieces but this time the two dumbasses from before actually
      know who made those fruit fuckers.

      They drag you along for this adventure because you are needed to kick ass.


      This episode allows you to import your character, which is extra noice.'
