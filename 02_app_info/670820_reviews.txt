It's obviously not quite finished, and some of the features were a little difficult to figure out how to use, but that didn't spoil my enjoyment of the game. I'm a huge fan of Rimworld, and while this game isn't nearly as polished as Rimworld I found it enjoyable in many of the same ways. This game represented a very good value for the price.","timestamp_created":1606680809,"timestamp_updated":1606680809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ44vHoivYCc7m4tQI="}
