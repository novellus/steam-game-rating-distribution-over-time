    review: "I love casual logic puzzles like these, non timed, non action but a lot\
      \ of the time I can finish them in 1-2hrs as they are either very short or too\
      \ easy - those are usually under a $1. This was the perfect level for a relaxing\
      \ casual game with a cuppa.  By medium level (people and houses) most were at\
      \ the level of taking anywhere from 10 -20 mins each to solve/plant fences,\
      \ not hair pulling but not 'this is so boring as I don't have to work it out\
      \ as its so easy'.  I did get stuck at a couple for about 45 mins each but I\
      \ never felt that I was never going to get it.  \n\nGameplay - divide the squares\
      \ equally between the neighbours, by adding fences, making sure each has a person,\
      \ house and eventually fruit in their area.  I really like that it has a level\
      \ map so if you get stuck in a puzzle there are usually 2 other puzzles you\
      \ can play.  There also is a change the view button,  you can turn and tilt\
      \ it by moving it with mouse, even playing top down. You can zoom in and out\
      \ using the scroll button on mouse.\n\nApart from fruit being added later to\
      \ make it a bit harder, there are no new game mechanics introduced so it is\
      \ a bit 'one note'. \n\n It's fun, cute and there are 101 levels.  There are\
      \ fun sayings on the loading scenes between the puzzles (one of them had a typo\
      \ on it).  If you are looking for a hard puzzle game this isn't for you but\
      \ for the rest of us who want to relax, take our time and get a few hours out\
      \ of a casual game, this ticks all the boxes."
