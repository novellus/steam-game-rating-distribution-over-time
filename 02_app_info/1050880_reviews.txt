Moving along a sine wave was a really fascinating concept to me for a sidescroller. It works well, it takes getting used to and is rather difficult but it's balanced well in that you don't have to get all the collectables in a level to progress in the game. So there's a nice adjustment in each level to account for different levels of players. \n\nWhat was interesting to me was how the sine wave acts as a visual for the player's future actions. It's interesting to me because I was looking more at the wave than the actual character so it asks interesting questions about who we are in the game. \n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_RnFQN9YuM] YouTube Analysis [/url]","timestamp_created":1590146481,"timestamp_updated":1590146481,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4treHnvICc8O/iQI="}
