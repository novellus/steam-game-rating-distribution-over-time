As much the same ones from Normandy 44 were nicely done, those ones look as if they were never finished but sent to the client \"as is\". They look like drafts. \n\nART BOOK \nNot so much explanation, a lot of images (nice images though) pitched together, no conclusion, no team presentation, no final word, no credits. The book end brutally. Shows if it was never finished.\n\nBATTLE LOG \nNot so bad, not especially nice, font is really basic, no frills, but the less worth of the three in terms of layout. About the content, nothing new, we find the same story in the game itself. Advice are no big secret.\n\nTACTICAL GUIDE \nTable of content is a mess. All pages are wrong!\nInformation is pitched one after the other without proper page break. \nThis guide especially is really awful in term of layout. A real draft. I was shocked to receive such product quality. We paid the big bucks after all. I feel cheated.\n\nACES\nMore simple, you can't! Just a small picture in the card's corner, half hidden with the requisition points... no special border. No description in the Art Book as well. Only photos without any Ace's name!\n\nI still recommend Steel Division 2, but base game only (and not at full price, see [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198059484979/recommended/919640] my other review[/url])\nDon't waste your money for this [i]Commander Deluxe Pack[/i], [b]it's worth nothing[/b].","timestamp_created":1562976692,"timestamp_updated":1609107581,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.675692439079284668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hKWS0/YCcZWezgE="}
