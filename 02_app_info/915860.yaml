    review: 'Zettavolt Trigger is a retro-feel, platform-type game with 20 levels.
      While trying to save your company from a hacker, you progress through the building
      from the basement to the upper levels through hallways, offices, elevator shafts,
      and even outside. Along the way you pick up several additional weapons and a
      few upgrades to your character (roll, double-jump).


      The first few levels feel basic (lacking the additional weapons and upgrades).
      However, they pass quickly and each new level feels more engaging as your environment
      changes, level design varies (e.g. an epic "battle wave" in an elevator a la
      TMNT?!?), and enemies get tougher and room setups become more sophisticated.
      There are a couple of slower points in the game, but there also are unexpected
      twists to levels that I found delightfully entertaining--and surprisingly challenging.


      Perhaps the biggest detractor to enjoying the game is some issues in resolution
      and a minor bug or two as you go through the game (enemy stuck in a crate?).
      None of it harms the gameplay or is overtly distracting, but things like the
      pause menu and cut scene fades don''t center properly.


      All in all, for an inexpensive game from a new developer, give it a go! Playing
      it all the way through I think you''ll agree there''s more here than meets the
      eye.'
