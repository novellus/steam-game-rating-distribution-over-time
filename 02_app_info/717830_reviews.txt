Based on the choices you get different endings.\nOne loop takes about 10-15 minutes. The game has complete voiceover dialogue.\n\nThere's no saving feature, so you have to take it in one go.\n\nOne novel feature is that before starting a new game the program asks if you want \"auto play\" or \"click play\" experience. The difference is that click play requires you to press a key or mouse button to move forward the dialogue, while auto play makes no pauses during the dialogues. The developer argues that \"auto play\" is more immersive. I myself disagree, but it depends on the individual I guess.\n\nAll in all, cool little branching story, although I think the character art and animations is quite horrible.","timestamp_created":1564266447,"timestamp_updated":1564266447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536817073822021484","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ifjimuwCfpGgzwE="}
