      /><br>Hazel Sky is a heartfelt adventure about a young engineer facing his destiny
      and his desires.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1094920/extras/DetailPage02.png?t=1608024742"
      /><br>Sent to an island far from home in the flying city of Gideon, Shane must
      pass the trials and return as an Engineer or face banishment. Connected via
      radio, Shane and fellow trainee engineer, Erin strike up an illicit friendship.
      A friendship that will change the way Shane sees the world.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1094920/extras/combi.gif?t=1608024742"
      /><br>The Trials are the ultimate test that every Engineer must take before
      taking the honored role.  For Shane, the trials are his destiny, but destiny
      and desire rarely align and, in a world, divided between honored engineers and
      reviled artists, Shane finds himself torn. The trials, events in Gideon, and
      an unlikely romance tell the bittersweet story of love, ambition, and a society
      on the brink of something new. <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1094920/extras/welding_2.gif?t=1608024742"
