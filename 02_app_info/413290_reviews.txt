Lots of ups, [i]tonnes[/i] of downs, but enough straight-up realism to set you straight about just what you're getting yourself in for. \n\n   While my sympathy was a little limited at times - like the guy who chose to go homeless for the sake of his games, but lo and behold, he already has [i]two kids[/i] (!) - it's hard, on the whole, to not feel for these people, especially if you're a struggling artistic type yourself. In fact, I can safely recommend this to anyone who fancies themselves as an art-maker of [i]any[/i] kind; though the doco clearly speaks more to people going it alone or in small teams than it does to those who aspire to AAA. \n\n   Did I \"enjoy\" it? Not really, given that I'm going through some tribulations of my own right now. Was it cathartic? HELL YES. Maybe save this one for when you're feeling a bit of despair about your [i]own[/i] artistic future, and use it to give yourself a much-needed kick in the butt. \n\n   Oh, and a final note. Fans of Indie Game: The Movie may notice some, er, \"influence\" that seminal documentary film had on this one, both structurally and aurally. That's okay: nothing new under the sun, and if you're gonna \"steal\", at least steal from sources worth stealing from.\n\n   Verdict: 8/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1546429520,"timestamp_updated":1547940572,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517900764942169189","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwttWctOgCd7ygtwE="}
