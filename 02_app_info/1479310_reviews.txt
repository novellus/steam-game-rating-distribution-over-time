It does well to balance artistic description with plain description, being neither too simple or pompous. The backgrounds and talksprites are well drawn, the music decently fitting. It establishes a relatively consistent immersion to the world. Although, to me, it looks like the arms and hands of the talksprites are a little too large relative to their bodies. The character with red hair in particular looks awkwardly proportioned compared to the other characters, especially with their sharper yet smaller head. It's also somewhat awkward that the talksprites face towards the player, and not eachother.\n\nThe protagonist has a pretty classic personality but manages to avoid being generic via the strong, thoughtful writing. The only demonstrably negative character is the one with green hair, who displays a highly generic joke personality that is extremely out of place amongst the otherwise genuine cast. The story itself has a great premise however the overarching mystery elements of the plot are not especially interesting, compared to the day to day relationship development of the characters. Hopefully the dramatic mysteries of the story will stay in the backseat for the forthcoming episodes and it will continue focusing on the more slice-of-life aspects that are generally much stronger.\n\nAlthough the post story radio sequence was slightly amusing, the toll it may take on the immersion of the player and the respect the story itself commands doesn't really feel worth it. So if players do not like out-of-character immersion breaking comedy mini-shows they should avoid the radio sequence they unlock after completing the main story.\n\n\nSeveral hours for several dollars is a pretty solid rate for such a well written story, especially with all the effort that went into the various backgrounds, music and talksprites.\n\nIf you're interested in finding more games like this I've probably reviewed quite a few on my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38950844-Anoemalous/] here [/url].","timestamp_created":1608625105,"timestamp_updated":1608630103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548872172832489014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ve30xPYCeIyQvAI="}
