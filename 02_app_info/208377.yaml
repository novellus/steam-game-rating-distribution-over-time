    about_the_game: "The ICE 1 is a ground-breaking German high-speed train which\
      \ delivers real performance for drivers around the world in Train Simulator.\
      \ <br><br>The InterCity-Express, or ICE, was introduced by Deutsche Bahn in\
      \ 1991 to run high-speed passenger services across a broad network linking such\
      \ German cities as Frankfurt, Mannheim, Hamburg and Dusseldorf. With a top speed\
      \ of 186mph (300kph), the ICE was a huge leap forward for passengers with journey\
      \ times being reduced significantly. With 14 cars per set, these 410-metre long\
      \ trains have been produced in 5 different versions since their introduction,\
      \ with the later ICE \u2013T and ICE-TD featuring tilting technology for faster\
      \ cornering. However, the original ICE-1 sets have now been refurbished to include\
      \ more refined interior fittings and electric power sockets for the passengers.\
      \ All are air-conditioned and include special on-board boosters to improve mobile/cell\
      \ phone reception while travelling. The ICE for Train Simulator recreates the\
      \ original ICE-1 series of trains introduced in 1991 and includes accurate controls\
      \ (including automatic drive and brake system), passenger view, moveable cab\
      \ blinds and more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Includes:</h2><br>German ICE Express\
      \ Train with accurate controls including automatic drive and brake system and\
      \ move-able cab blinds<br><br>Scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online\
      \ and in-game. Train Simulator\u2019s Steam Workshop scenarios are free and\
      \ easy to download, adding many more hours of exciting gameplay. With scenarios\
