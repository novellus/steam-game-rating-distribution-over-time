    review: "I've only played \"Forest Woodman\" for one hour and if I can tell you\
      \ one thing its that this game is GENIUS.\n\nSo let me explain myself and my\
      \ whole story about this masterpiece known by the generic name \"Forest Woodman\"\
      \ (I mean wtf even is a woodman). When I first saw this game under the \"New\
      \ and Trending\" steam category I instantly fell in love (could this be the\
      \ next extreme truck simulator?) and it was 15% off making it only $2.54, I\
      \ knew at that moment \"THIS IS EPIC\". It was an impulse purchase I had watched\
      \ the trailer and even though the game didn't have guns (eww) I knew its potential\
      \ was at least 100 and I bought it.\n\nWhen I started downloading it I found\
      \ out it was about 2 GB (to put it into context that's like 16,000,000,000\u202C\
      \ bits!) and after about an hour on hotel wifi, it had finished downloading.\
      \ When I first tried launching it it gave me the error \"An error occurred while\
      \ updating \"Forest Woodman\" (missing executable)\", and whilst that might\
      \ through off your average layman, I'm whats considered a computer wizard/genius\
      \ and I went directly to the games files and launched it from there. \n\nWhen\
      \ I first launched it I was instantly impressed by the main menu, there were\
      \ 4 buttons one of them called (Meee) and when I clicked it it made some sort\
      \ of cow noise (it was a weird cow idk how to explain it) and I spammed it for\
      \ a solid five seconds. After that I clicked the button called \"Loading\" and\
      \ my game crashed. Soon after I clicked the \"New Game\" button and loaded right\
      \ in. I really don't want to spoil the game for you but I drank some Vodka went\
      \ outside and did some farming. When I used my hoe (hehe) on the carrots they\
      \ disappeared with an extremely satisfying noise and I moved on to exploring.\n\
      \nThe controls are a bit weird but nothing game breaking, \"tab\" is map (for\
      \ some reason) and \"I\" is inventory (in what universe >:( !!!). When I opened\
      \ my map I instantly say this map that had X's and O's, the first thing I did\
      \ was go towards an O (the O's were bigger so why not) and I saw these weird\
      \ fly's (mosquitoes) and I started hitting them with my hoe (hehe), they weren't\
      \ that hard to take down and most of their attacks missed but then I heard some\
      \ behind me and I got trapped and died. That was extremely scary and the way\
      \ the game builds and atmosphere is incredible I was on my toes the whole time\
      \ watching out for even scarier monsters (haven't found any yet but I've only\
      \ played for an hour).\n\nWhile the games graphics might be considered \"lacking\"\
      \ to most, I actually found them to give the game a certain ambiance that was\
      \ actually really unique. The mosquitoes are really detailed and scared the\
      \ crap out of me when I first saw some. The grass is a bit lacking because some\
      \ is located on paths (that never happens irl) and it didn't really seem to\
      \ go with the ground.\n\nMy main criticisms to the developer are the fact that\
      \ I get a massive lag spike every 10 minutes or so which has made my take damage,\
      \ and that my game crashed in the main menu when I clicked the \"Loading\" button\
      \ (it should be called \"Load Save\"). \n\nOverall I found it extremely fun\
      \ to play with friends watching and I would legitimately recommend it from my\
      \ current experience (multiplayer would really suit this game I feel) and that's\
      \ about all I have to say for now, peace out fellow PC gamer's, may your frame\
      \ rates be high and your feet warm."
