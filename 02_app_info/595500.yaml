      yet! An ancient terror has emerged from the depths of the ocean. Merga, a water
      dragon from Avalice''s oldest and deadliest war, has been freed from her crystal
      prison as a consequence of the Kingdom Stone''s destruction. War is imminent
      once again, but this time, the heroes are split between sides. As friendships
      are tested, will the girls stand united when Bakunawa rises?</i><h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul
