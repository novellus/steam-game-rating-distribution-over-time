So. you will need to change your resolution to the lowest settings or the screen will be tiny.  For windows (and the computer illiterate) follow these instructions- *right click* on desktop, select \"screen resolution\", *click* \"resolution\" drop down, set resolution to 800-600 or whatever your screen preference happens to be.\n\nI originally wanted a newly developed kid's typing tutor with updated graphics or the Spooky typing tutor from the 90's.  Since there have been NO newer kids' typing tutors, and the classic Spooky typing tutor are nowhere to be found for sale (unless I go to an unfamiliar site and pray that the \"free\" downloads aren't malware).   So, we were \"pushed\" to try this tutor out.\n\nAs for the game itself, my kids like it.  And better yet, I am very pleased with it. The kids seem to be able to stay focused long enough that they appear to be learning something (considering their ages 5/7 yo).  With how cartoony it is, it is perfect for what it is meant to do; keep younger kids focused just long enough to learn a little bit each computer session.  Even though we had no other typing tutor options for the kids, I think this tutor was done well enough that I certainly recommend it. It met and exceeded my expectations.\n\nThere are a couple of glitches in the game.  But once we identified them and figured them out (ex: there is a glitch in the \"help\" section), we have been able to work around them without it interfering with the game.\n\n","timestamp_created":1608521760,"timestamp_updated":1608521760,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0MfXwfYCePjtuwI="}
