Very flavorful, fun, and exciting with very dynamic graphics.\n\n[u]Biolab[/u]\nNice and quirky with a fun skillshot, but one of the modes is an auto-win.  The table is also a little congested, yet on the simple side.\n\n[u]Rome[/u]\nHas great flow to it, along with a great theme.  Visually engaging.\n\n[u]Secrets of the Deep[/u]\nThis table is hard as balls.  But, it also has a lot of very fun features and gadgets, looks gorgeous, and feels great when you pull off its modes.  I can't stop coming back to it.\n\nOverall, this pack is a no-brainer at any price.  Buy it!","timestamp_created":1500103086,"timestamp_updated":1500103173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uLzHot0Cf7j/fw=="}
