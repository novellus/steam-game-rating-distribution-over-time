    about_the_game: Have you ever dreamed of becoming an astronaut? Do you love space
      and watch every new mission to Mars? You've seen the moon a hundred times through
      a telescope, but you've even never dreamed of being on it?<br><br>There is a
      chance! In this project you can become an astronaut on the first moon base in
      human history. You can drive a rover, do some jobs with drilling devices, figure
      out how solar panels work and walk on the moon surface.<br><br>The first in
      human history fully operational lunar base could be built on the surface of
      the Moon by 2038. In this VR glimpse into the future, you will see how it might
      look and find out what kinds of jobs the cosmonaut living there will perform.<br><br><img
