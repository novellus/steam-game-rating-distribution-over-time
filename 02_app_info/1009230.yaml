    review: 'Another Zombie game that is so bad you would not play it even if it was
      free.


      The Good:


      1 - It did load and work on Linux.

      2 - Frame rate was ok.


      The Bad:


      1 - Zero Game play other then run around the map shooting zombie''s, no mission,
      no nothing, maybe a wave survival with out the waves??

      2 - Running is more like jogging, this guy has a death wish for sure.

      3 - You have to be walking to reload and you have to freak out on the reload
      key, say goodbye health.

      4 - All these buildings but you cannot go into any of them???

      5 - Loads more problems and game play issues i could list for ever.


      I love game''s with Zombies but this is another bad example of how not to make
      a Zombie game, Asked for a Refund.'
