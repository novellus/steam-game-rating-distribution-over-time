    review: "Story/Plot:\nTwisted: A Dark Fairytale is a visual novel where you take\
      \ on the role of Sage (you can choose the gender).  Sage flees from the only\
      \ home she's known, the Village, into the woods after discovering a growing\
      \ blackness on her body.  However, the woods are far from safe as she comes\
      \ across the Twisted, individuals who've succumbed to the same corruption that\
      \ inhabits Sage.  In your travels, you will come across a couple individuals\
      \ who may strongly influence your decisions (positively or negatively) and affect\
      \ your ultimate fate.\n\nIf I had a complaint here it would be that I couldn't\
      \ turn off some of the world-building critical part of my mind.  As an example,\
      \ it is mentioned that the Village is walled off, and no one leaves unless exiled.\
      \  It also mentions monster attacks during the day which caused me to think\
      \ 'so how do these people eat?  If they get attacked as soon as they leave,\
      \ that leaves farming out.'\n \n Visuals:\nAs a visual novel, don't expect to\
      \ see a large variety of characters or backgrounds.  However, the \nOne thing\
      \ that will stand out is that Sage, as well as other characters are essentially\
      \ anthropomorphized deer.  They walk on two legs, are covered in fur, and have\
      \ antlers.  This might turn some people off as they prefer normal humans, but\
      \ I didn't mind it.  \n\n Gameplay:\nThe only gameplay you really in Twisted\
      \ is through your choices.  At moments of the story, certain actions and decisions\
      \ appear.  As such your choices do matter for Sage's ultimate fate.  The Steam\
      \ page itself says there are two diverging storylines, but there are some variations\
      \ as well.  Perhaps you don't win a certain person's heart, but stay as close\
      \ friends...that sort of thing.\n\n Sound/Music:\nAs a visual novel, Twisted\
      \ has a limited soundtrack that I did like.  While it isn't something that I\
      \ want to listen to outside of the game, I'm just glad that it wasn't anything\
      \ that made want to turn the volume off and listen to a podcast.  \n\nThe same\
      \ goes for the sounds effects.  While not common, when they do appear they are\
      \ used to great affect like the sound of someone running through the grass,\
      \ given an additional edge for what is meant to be a chase scene.\n\n Difficulty:\n\
      This game is about as easy as visual novels get.  You make a choice, and see\
      \ what happens.  The only difficulty I found was if you decided to get all the\
      \ Achievements.  There are only a small handful of nodes which really change\
      \ things, so fine-tuning your decisions to get one of the more elusive achievements\
      \ might be tough.\n\n Extras/Achievements:\nThis game doesn't really have many\
      \ extras, but does have a decent number of Steam Achievements for those so inclined.\n\
      \n Recommendation\nWould I recommend the game?  I actually would, though it\
      \ is a bit on the shorter side (roughly 40,000 words).  At that word count,\
      \ some people might find it tough to justify spending $9.99 on the game.  In\
      \ a case like this, you might want to wait for a sale.\n\n"
