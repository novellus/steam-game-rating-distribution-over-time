    review: 'Sounds are normal except for the sound of footsteps in the [b]snow[/b]
      (all KSE_Footsteps_Ground_Snow* files).

      When we walk in the snow, it crunches, and does not make the sound of a wooden
      floor!

      If you want to hear how the footsteps really sound in the snow, find them in
      another DLC - Modern Day SFX.

      I needed exactly the sound of footsteps in the snow, but it is actually not
      in this package.'
