      \ each display. ;No matter which monitor you are working with - the following\
      \ Windows 7, 8 Taskbar features will be available anywhere:<br><ul class=\"\

      \ groups </li><li> Recycle bin on the taskbar </li><li>and much more </li></ul><br><strong><u>Multi-Monitor\
      \ Gaming</u></strong><br>Gamers will appreciate several features of Actual Multiple\
      \ Monitors that were developed specifically for enhancing multi-monitor gaming\
      \ experience, making it more attractive and convenient: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"\
      ><li>Ignore Deactivation - prevents the game from being minimized. By using\
      \ this feature you can play your favorite games on one display and stream, surf\
      \ web, watch full screen video, and etc. on others. </li><li>Lock Mouse - locks\
      \ the mouse pointer in a specific window or monitor preventing it from leaving\
      \ a game </li><li>and many others.</li></ul><br><strong><u>Multi-Monitor Wallpaper</u></strong><br>Using\
      \ Actual Multiple Monitors, you can set up any kind of Desktop's background\
      \ on multiple displays:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Single picture stretched\
      \ over the entire desktop</li><li>Individual picture on each monitor</li><li>Individual\
      \ slideshow running separately on each monitor</li><li>Web slideshow from Google\
      \ Image Search or Flickr</li><li>Flexible picture positioning (center, tile,\
      \ stretch, proportional stretch, crop to fit)</li></ul><br><strong><u>Additional\
      \ Title Bar Buttons</u></strong><br>Be saved from routine tossing of windows\
      \ between monitors - new buttons in each window's title bar give an instant\
      \ access to advanced window functions and let apply them in a single click:<br><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/241680/extras/MoveToMonitorButton.png?t=1454604493\"\
      \ />- move a window to another monitor</li><li><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/241680/extras/MaximizeToDesktopButton.png?t=1454604493\"\
      \ /> - make a window span the entire composite desktop</li><li> and many others.</li></ul><br><strong><u>Custom\
      \ Hotkeys</u></strong><br>Hotkeys is the tool of professionals, and Actual Multiple\
      \ Monitors supports them in full. Most of program functions can be activated\
      \ via hotkey, and you can customize the key combinations at will. Moreover,\
      \ you will be able to add your own hotkeys for some window operations.<br><br><strong><u>Desktop\
      \ Divider</u></strong><br>Divider allows you to divide the entire large desktop\
      \ or each monitor into several non-intersecting areas (tiles). If you put a\
      \ window into one of such tiles, the window will expand up to tile's borders\
      \ only. You can create as many custom tile layouts as you need and activate\
      \ them on the fly as circumstances require.<br><br><strong><u>Window Snapping</u></strong><br>If\
      \ you prefer arrange your windows manually, Actual Multiple Monitors will help\
      \ you make it faster and more accurate by snapping a certain edge of the dragged\
      \ window to:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>desktop or monitor boundaries</li><li>other\
      \ windows (both from inside and outside)</li><li>custom virtual grid with a\
      \ defined cell size</li></ul>Also, you will get a Windows 10 Snap Assist feature\
      \ and an improved version of the Windows 7 Aero Snap feature: now it works on\
      \ edges between monitors.<br><br><strong><u>Multi-Monitor Screen Saver</u></strong><br>Actual\
      \ Multiple Monitors gives new abilities for screen savers (even those that don't\
      \ have native multi-monitor support) - you will be able to:<br><ul class=\"\
      bb_ul\"><li>stretch any screen saver over the entire desktop </li><li>put individual\
      \ screen saver onto each monitor</li></ul><br><strong><u>Desktop Mirroring</u></strong><br>Mirroring\
      \ is a special function that allows observing a certain window, monitor or a\
      \ custom part of desktop in a separate window on another monitor. It can be\
      \ useful in various specific situations:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>you need\
      \ to clone the primary displays to two or more additional monitors </li><li>you\
      \ need to control what happens on another display but it's out of your sight\
      \ (monitor turned to a client, TV in another room, etc.) </li><li>when you give\
      \ a report or presentation, you can work with materials on your main display,\
      \ mirroring its necessary part only onto the projector for your listeners </li></ul></p><br><h1>About\

    review: "[b]UPDATE 07/10/18: I have just tested with Windows 10 and it appears\
      \ that all the issues have been fixed.[/b]\n\n[b][strike]DISCLAIMER: RIGHT NOW\
      \ (18/10/15) THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH WIN 10\n[/strike][/b] \nTHIS MAY HAVE BEEN\
      \ FIXED WITH RECENT UPDATES, PLEASE CHECK FOR YOURSELF.\n\n[b]NOTE: The other\
      \ highly rated review is over a year old meaning that some of the negatives\
      \ of this software have been fixed. Before you decide not to use this software\
      \ based on the reviews please download the trial and try it out for yourself\
      \ as many problems may be fixed.[/b]\n\n[i]Before you buy this, check out the\
      \ free trial on the Actual Multiple Monitors website: [/i]\nhttp://www.actualtools.com/multiplemonitors/\n\
      \nReally useful piece of software to use if you have 2 monitors. It combines\
      \ a lot of useful features such as allowing you to do stuff on your second monitor\
      \ when you\u2019re in a game in your first monitor without it minimizing and\
      \ having hotkeys which allow you to arrange your windows.\n\nThe UI isn't all\
      \ that great but it has some features which it's competitor Display Fusion doesn\u2019\
      t have such as the option to have new windows open in the display which your\
      \ cursor is in (which I really miss)\n \nIt\u2019s a really good application\
      \ and if you have 2 or more monitors you should give it a try.\nIt also works\
      \ with start button mods for Win 8, such as Start8.\n\nI no longer use AMM as\
      \ it doesn\u2019t work with WIN 10 but if it did then I wouldn't have switched\
      \ to Display Fusion.\n\nFeel free to message me on Steam if you have any questions\
      \ about this program\n\nIf you are looking for a multiple monitor program for\
      \ Windows 10 then I recommend Display Fusion, you can find it on Steam."
