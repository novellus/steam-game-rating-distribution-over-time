    review: "do NOT buy that sh.t \n\nwhy ?\n\nextract from EULA :\n\n\"Material is\
      \ used as is, and not edited in any way.\nMaterial is not recreated in a different\
      \ style by another artist.\nMaterial is not used in adult-only content.\"\n\n\
      ok... this DLC is useless.\n\ndon't buy it... it exists only in order to promote\
      \ the other gamze \"Deathsmiles\"\n"
