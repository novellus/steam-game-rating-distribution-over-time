    review: Very cool app. Can't think of another way to go to the edge of our solar
      system with the NASA Pluto probe. It ran smoothly on my (very strong) PC. I
      guess the download is large because it includes real data from the NASA mission
      and the actual surface of Pluto in full detail. I learned a lot about Pluto.
      I love it, and it's hard to beat the ($0) price.
