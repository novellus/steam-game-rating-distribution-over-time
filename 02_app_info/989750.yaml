      \ fight back or give up her dream of becoming a lawyer in Helsinki.<h2 class=\"\

      bb_tag\">QUOTE</h2><i>&quot;The clouds appeared like soft, battling marshmallows\
      \ in the bright Finnish sky. From her seat on the train rushing through the\
      \ fields, Lottie favored the smaller clouds and wished they would win over the\
      \ larger ones. As if the battle of David and Goliath could still be a possibility\
      \ in today\u2019s competitive world. She clasped her thick travelling journal\
      \ against her chest with unbridled emotions, her thoughts wandering to the past.\
      \ After a demanding university education, she had finally graduated and acquired\
      \ a law degree. It hadn't been easy, and at times she had thought of dropping\
      \ out. Her father often told her, &quot;Nothing in life worth having comes easy&quot;.\
      \ He always used a tone of authenticity, but she felt he probably got the quote\
      \ from an Instagram post. As she stared out of the train window remembering\
      \ those words, nostalgia ran through her body and gave her a faint shiver. In\
      \ her mind, the faces of the people she loved appeared from the shadows. Her\
      \ close family, her good friends... and others who still found a place in her\
      \ thoughts...even after so many years...Heading to Helsinki by herself, Lottie\
      \ felt a sense of gladness which went beyond words. Before she\u2019d left home,\
      \ she\u2019d drawn her dark eyeliner perfectly and wore her favorite wool scarf.\
      \ Today, tomorrow, the day after, and forever after, she needed to make the\
      \ best impression she could possibly make. During her last semester, a recruiter\
      \ from a big law firm had contacted her to offer an internship in Helsinki.\
      \ As soon as she had hung up the phone, she had bought her train ticket.&quot;</i><h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>Sit back and follow Lottie's journey in\
      \ this colorful, family oriented, visual novel.  <br>Befriend a group of local\
      \ artists and learn to live with new roommates.<br>Participate in the narrative\

    developer_response: Thank you for playing Life in Helsinki. Every chapter you
      finish unlocks the next chapter. Did you play all 7 chapters? It should take
      you a few hours to go through the game.

    review: A mini-visual novel about a girl whose big dreams clash with reality.
      Cute art, nice writing, but really short (I completed it in a lunch break).
      Also, the story isn't really finished.  IMHO the title is a bit misleading,
      I was expecting a LOT more information on Helsinki, but hey, that's what Trip
      Advisor is for, innit?
