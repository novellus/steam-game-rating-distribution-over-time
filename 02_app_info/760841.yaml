    review: "It has some level immersion but there are many illogical stuff in the\
      \ systems and the way its configured.\nIf you really are a beginner and not\
      \ willing to pay much, this product may be for you. \nI find landing quite challenging\
      \ using this sim, manual handling of this aircraft is very fun as I seem to\
      \ struggle a little more.\nYes, I prefer its flight characteristics over its\
      \ systems and autopilot, obviously. \nAgain, if you're a beginner and actually\
      \ willing to learn airbus systems and procedures in decent detail, get Aerosoft.\n\
      Aerosoft, you can trust that the shown procedures are accurate and is the best\
      \ intro and entry level into airbus.\nFor experts, of course the only solution\
      \ is the FSLabs A320, preferably in Prepar3d v4 (or greater).\n\n"
