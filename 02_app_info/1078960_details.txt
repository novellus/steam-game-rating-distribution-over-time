Unfortunately, Nino was cursed at the start of his journey. His lifespan was now presented by a few dozen fruits, which will be gradually consumed over the next three days.

For example, when Nino gains the fire immunity talent, the player should choose to use “self-burn” cards more, which sets both Nino and his enemy on fire, to increase the payoff, since Nino is now immune to fire damage. Another example would be combining the using more water-based attacks after gaining the Electric Shock talent to increase Nino’s damage output.<br><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1078960\/extras\/fusion.gif?t=1598776731\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat System<\/h2>Nino’s Isekai uses an Active Time Battle system, which JRPG fans will be very familiar with.
