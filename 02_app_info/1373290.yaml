    review: 'interesting puzzle game, a couple of weird / very annoying bugs if you
      play with mouse only though [spoiler](I assume there''s only bugs when playing
      with mouse since that''s what I did the whole way through)[/spoiler]. they definitely
      needed to playtest this a little more with mouse, that''s my take on it. Sometimes
      currently-dragged dice weirdly cancels being dragged and you involuntarily pick
      up another dice from the right-hand selection instead, other times one out of
      a group of dice or just a single die gets weirdly still-slightly-large and slightly-not-in-the-grid
      when put down, like the animation got suspended before it ends.


      still fun, and what else would you expect. it has an endless mode though, and
      setting up combos there is super satisfying.'
