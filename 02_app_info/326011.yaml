    review: "Well this was an unexpected little gem for me as I've never really bought\
      \ anything from Fastline Simulation. \n\nAs for the obvious part the pack contains\
      \ ZCA Sea Urchin wagons with EWS branding with livery variations while also\
      \ coming in an clean and weathered appearence. They come with different loads\
      \ and even the empties have a liittle bit leftover load in them. \n\nAn unexpected\
      \ surprise is you get an extra free pack with this add-on. This conains Temporary\
      \ Speed Restriction 'TSR' warning boards, portable AWS magnate and warning lights\
      \ for scenario making but to top it off is that the manual also provides a few\
      \ links that shows you how to use them correctly.\n\nCertainly a worthwhile\
      \ buy.\n"
