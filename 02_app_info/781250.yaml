    review: I couldn't believe it when I found it! Yes, ratings will be skewed in
      by that nostalgia. All the good, the bad, the funny and all the annoying gameplay
      elements have been preserved and restored exactly how you remember them. I would
      love nothing more than to see a modern developer remake and/or reboot this IP.
      The closest thing I can think of that this is like, would have to be Westworld--the
      other parks, not the wild west park. The story is still quirky & unique and
      the scope is still ambitious, I can only imagine what this gem could blossom
      into with some modern TLC.
