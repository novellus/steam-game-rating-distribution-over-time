    review: "Like most great RPGs, the story is the best part of NO LOVE. It\u2019\
      s very interesting and a good look into the mind of the game\u2019s creator\
      \ Wallace Lovecraft. The core loop of the game is to explore an area, then do\
      \ a boss fight, then watch a cool cut scene. You\u2019ll meet an interesting\
      \ cast of characters with some funny quirks, that feel true to real people.\n\
      \nGrinding for Exp seems pretty optional if you have a good grasp of rpg mechanics,\
      \ but I found myself grinding some random encounters while looking for secrets.\
      \ The secret areas had additional cutscenes, definitely worth seeking out. \n\
      \nIn the early game I found myself equipping my characters for physical attacks\
      \ since MP is limited and spells have long cool downs. But as you level up and\
      \ get more spells, and thus magic attack based loadouts are more viable. But\
      \ I still felt like I would waste turns having to use a weak physical attack\
      \ well waiting out some cooldowns. In the late game you are basically forced\
      \ to use magic attacks.\n\nThe final aera felt like a bit of a slogg, just walking\
      \ through a long maze and repeating the same fight over and over. There was\
      \ a patch to make that part a bit easier, but the maze is still quite a bit\
      \ long. Story wise it makes sense, you\u2019re in a dangerous place and it\u2019\
      s probably not supposed to be fun. But once you\u2019re past it, it\u2019s onto\
      \ good times and a great ending.\n\nIn a world of games made by committee, NO\
      \ LOVE stands out as a game by one person, and their thoughts on the world.\
      \   \n"
