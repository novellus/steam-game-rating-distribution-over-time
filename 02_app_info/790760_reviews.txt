If you’re looking for something simple to burn money, and time on I suggest the copious amounts of other cheap games on steam that are substantially more polished and are designed to waste time. This game doesn’t have much to offer. It tries to stand out by being like doodle jump except if you had full control of the character and the game was infinitely more complicated by the poor design of the developers. Sometimes you’ll be playing the game and it just crashes. My friend has a frequent crash whenever he goes to a certain part of the level. The developer responded to my original shorter review where I brought this up by saying it’s intentional- which is questionable design. The game’s sluggish controls, in combination with not being able to see the poorly placed platforms above you don’t help. I’m fine with difficulty but these all seem like taking the pis$ to try and supplement some difficulty or depth as far as the gameplay goes, but it just doesn’t work.\n\nIn its current state, it doesn’t have a lot and it doesn’t seem like it’s ever going to move forward from its current state. I agree with one of the other reviews here that stated that this is the kind of stuff that should be separated from legitimate projects.\n\nAlso, the developer had a great dig at my VAC ban. If only I could get VAC banned from Space Chip… (edited entire review cuz dev shit on me lul)","timestamp_created":1584823062,"timestamp_updated":1590288304,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1585764731,"developer_response":"Hi Rehger. Althought I don't trust in the profiles which have multiple VAC bans on record as you profile has to.  Thank you for your review despite you just played 0.1 to Space Chip.\n\nAbout the crashes and the controls, they are difficults at the beginning but you are in space without gravity, for this reason I wanted the player didn't have all the control althought It's possible to have it.\n\nI understand and accept you don't like the game but in my opinion you kicked Space Chip too much."}],"cursor":"AoJw+LikovICfofv+QE="}
