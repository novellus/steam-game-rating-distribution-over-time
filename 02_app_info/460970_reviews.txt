You can summon 3 stationary heroes, your towers.  Warrior, archer, and bomb thrower.  Each with their limited abilities.\n\nThe thing is, this all happens EXTREMELY fast.  You can go through a whole level in what seem like seconds.  Strategy of going into a room and putting a warrior at the door is about as much strategy as there is.\n\nOkay concept and fun enough for an hour maybe.  Unless you love action extremely fast games.   Neither of which I associate with dungeon crawlers or tower defense.","timestamp_created":1598750705,"timestamp_updated":1598750773,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493150681257247925","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48Jm+nvQCe5/RngI="}
