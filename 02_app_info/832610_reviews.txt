This game really needs some work. The options you have are sound volumes, nothing else. Stats really don't seem to do anything. Aiming is pointless (there's a pun), because even clicking directly on any mob, you tend to miss and shoot into a bush or wall. If you get this game for free, go ahead and give it a hot second, otherwise bypass this one.","timestamp_created":1596464583,"timestamp_updated":1596464583,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537820935249328613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lYqt2vMCcJeUmQI="}
