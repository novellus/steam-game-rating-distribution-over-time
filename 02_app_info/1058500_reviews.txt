I played for 20 or so mins, couldn't figure out how to transform or do much of anything. The response time is sooo bad, When u do a jump u need to wait for a long animation to finish before u can move and the FBI is also overpowered, even tho u play as a robot, they do around half ur health in a couple of seconds. It also has a deception symbol in the mini map, idk what the point of linking this with transformers is, because they are great and this game is mega trash. (at least its only $1.50)","timestamp_created":1599002613,"timestamp_updated":1599002613,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550226449966430664","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40PL+pfQCdOienwI="}
