    review: "[h1]It's not like FTL[/h1]\n\nPeople love FTL because of its challanging\
      \ yet rewarding gameplay with interesting RPG elements and fighting mechanics.\
      \ \n\nHalcyon 6 didn't manage to accomplish it, Firstly, fighting is unreasonably\
      \ slow, not challenging and not rewarding even at higher difficulty levels than\
      \ normal. Secondly, leveling up characters isn't satisfying, because nothing\
      \ really changes except for you get a few more abilities and then you upgrade\
      \ them.\n\nBefore you say \"well, getting more abilities and upgrading them\
      \ is character progression by definition\". Yes, but in practice, it doesn't\
      \ matter here. Game bugged out for me once and I entered a fight without my\
      \ character, so I only had my ship's basic abilities (as if, the ship was flying\
      \ by itself). And I won, and it was an easy win. See my point? Character progression,\
      \ while being a neccessary element of the game, remains pointless in practice.\n\
      \n\n[h1]It's not like XCOM[/h1]\n\nPeople love XCOM because of squad customisation,\
      \ base development and interesting tactical turn-based fighting. \n\nIn Halcyon\
      \ 6 base-building Is good, actually, no major complaints. A bit tedious to navigate\
      \ through at times, but nothing game-breaking. \n\nSquad customisation and tactical\
      \ fighting is not present though. I played with 2 ships for 5 hours straight\
      \ because frankly, getting more characteres to run new ships (as well as building\
      \ those new ships) is resource-consuming and there is no real need for it in\
      \ the first place since fights are very easy anyway.\n\nIn XCOM you just cannot\
      \ get by with a small group of troops: you constantly need more, you want to\
      \ upgrade your squad, you want to try different combinations and see what works\
      \ best. In Halcyon 6 rolling with Engineer + Scientist + Tactician is your best\
      \ bet and it's obvious even before you get into your first fight (3 classes\
      \ - 3 available slots... hmm what do I choose?)\n\nAnd once you get in a fight,\
      \ you don't need to plan out your actions, because, for starters, it's not really\
      \ possible due to RNG and enemies acting in an unpredictable fashion. And secondly,\
      \ you will win the fight easily anyway so why bother.\n\n\n[h1]It is more like\
      \ Darkest Dungeon[/h1]\n\nIf you've played Darkest Dungeon, you probably know\
      \ that it starts fantastic, addicting and all-around fun only to turn into a\
      \ grindfest after the first 20-30 hours of gameplay. Well, that's actually pretty\
      \ much how Halcyon 6 is like, except for instead of 20-30 hours of fun you get\
      \ around 2-3 hours of fun. \n\nIn Darkest Dungeon you upgrade your base and\
      \ your \"squad\" inbetween going to various missions similarly to what Halcyon\
      \ 6 is all about. Except for, in Darkest Dungeon you have way more classes to\
      \ choose from and you have various dungeons with different enemies to explore\
      \ and loot. \n\nInstead of various dungeons Halcyon 6 offers you to fight off\
      \ same goddamn aliens that keep swarming your colonies over and over again.\
      \ And they don't even drop loot! It is a chore and the game doesn't even try\
      \ to make it fun. You also have Pirates attacking your base from time to time,\
      \ which is not really that different from aliens though.\n\nIt gets a bit different\
      \ when you get onto story quests, but the proportion between fights with aliens\
      \ / pirates / other factions is ridiculous. I remember only 1 fight with another\
      \ faction from my 6 hours of playtime. ONE. I wish I could go off and explore\
      \ other factions more, but upon return I would have found half my colonies to\
      \ be destroyed or occupied by aliens, so that wasn't an option.\n\nAlien invasions\
      \ are simple: they open up a portal, immideately send one or two fleets to a\
      \ local colony and then they keep doing that until you destroy the portal. So\
      \ you fly over, destroy the portal, then fly around cleaning up the mess they've\
      \ made, then fly back to base only to realise they have opened yet another damn\
      \ portal and, yet again, are already swarming your colonies.\n\n\n[h1]Rinse\
      \ repeat, rinse repeat, rinse repeat. Forever.[/h1]\n\nIt's so sad. The game\
      \ has great promise to it. Most flaws I described when comparing Halcyon 6 to\
      \ FTL or XCOM are completely fine because regardless of them the game has it's\
      \ own charm. \n\nAliens though.\n\nI hate aliens. I wish there was a mod that\
      \ allows you to tweak the time inbetween alien attacks because it's just unbearable.\
      \ You keep flying around your Faction cleaning up alien fleets over and over\
      \ again. Fighting them takes a load of time and gives completely zero joy.\n\
      \n\n[h1]A few kind words about the game[/h1]\n\nThe game is not terrible, in\
      \ fact, it could be great!\n\nI really liked that you can have different characters\
      \ of the [u]same class[/u] and they would have different backstories, different\
      \ unique abilities and personal traits. You have a wide variety of ships to\
      \ choose from, which is also great.\n\nThere is a number of factions/races that\
      \ you get in contact with, they all have their own style of comunication and\
      \ actually say interesting stuff followed by well drawn animated portraits you\
      \ see on the telecomunication screen. You can choose how to answer to them and\
      \ from what it seems, this impacts on how they treat you in the future.\n\n\
      After you've developed your base enough, you can actually automate the resource\
      \ gathering process using drones (many people complained about having to manually\
      \ gather resources over and over again). I wish, you didn't have to manually\
      \ install drones though, makes zero sense, but that's besides the point.\n\n\
      \n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nIt saddens me that developers put so much time into\
      \ the game to recieve so many bad reviews by unsatisfied players, because the\
      \ game actually could be truly amazing. \n\nHalcyon 6  just needed a bit more\
      \ polish before release or a nice patch that fixes game-breaking flaws. The\
      \ basis for a great game is there, too bad it was ruined by simpliest things.\
      \ There really are not too many major issues in the game.\n\nUnfortunate part\
      \ is, even though the number of said issues is not great, their impact on the\
      \ gameplay is."
