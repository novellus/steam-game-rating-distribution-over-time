    short_description: Exploding Babies is an absurd and chaotic shared screen arena
      blaster/party game for up to four simultaneous players. Enter a post-apocalyptic
      world where human babies are pitted against each other as part of a slowly unraveling
      intergalactic conspiracy to breed alien superchildren.
