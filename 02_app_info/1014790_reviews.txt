I don't normally play puzzle games, but I find myself saying, \"alright, just one more level, then I'll put it down and get some work done.\" The first few levels are deceptively easy. Then they get trickier, although always well designed so you get that satisfying \"aha!\" moment when you figure it out. I've put more time into the mobile version, but after playing the PC version I prefer its keyboard/gamepad controls. The mobile's touch controls work great; I'm just more of a keyboard person. If you're looking for an addictive, casual puzzle game that you can play in short bursts, this is a really good one.","timestamp_created":1559676419,"timestamp_updated":1559676419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u6/9kesCdNrfwgE="}
