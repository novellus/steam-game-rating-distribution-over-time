I really like the dystopical look and the comic book art style. Episode 1 & 2 are quite short and the story remains relatively flat, but I still found it exciting and would have liked to see more of it. Unfortunately it doesn't look like there will ever be a third, final episode... \n\nEpisode 1 is free to play, so everyone can easily take a look at the game. I recommend Episode 2 for everyone who can live with the fact that the story has no conclusion, but because of the short playing time I would rather buy it in a sale if possible.","timestamp_created":1605385402,"timestamp_updated":1605445436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.610220849514007568","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpqiA5vUCfJyyrgI="}
