    review: 'This game should be getting more praise, it''s like the dark souls of
      shooter, very hard, long stages and bosses at the end of each one, you have
      unlimited continues so it''s totally doable to beat the game you just need to
      learn patterns and not suck :P


      Graphic are hand drawn with animations for each ship and the music is just fantastic!
      each stage has it''s own song and they should release it in some form cause
      it''s that good.


      For the price I really recommend it, you can''t go wrong here, I do wish the
      stage were a bit shorter and the game a bit more balanced (the first stage might
      be the toughest one in the game) but overall it''s very good.'
