      \ /><br><br>Caribbean Odyssey is the first installment of a long tale that tells\
      \ a compelling &amp; epic story of the legendary character, Captain Henry Morgan.\
      \ The story begins at Port Royal in 1655, where Henry Morgan comes to see a\
      \ mysterious woman named Merry Carleton. Henry Morgan had just previously returned\
      \ from Panama, where he was sent by the current Governor of Port Royal, Sir\
      \ Thomas Modyford. Captain Henry successfully crushed the Spanish Army and laid\
      \ the capital under siege for weeks. Eventually the Spaniards were forced to\

      \ City.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/414500/extras/ridable.jpg?t=1541730183\"\
      \ /><br><br>Governor Sir Thomas Modyford was a trusted fellow of the British\
      \ Crown and was known for his cunning and greed for gold. He sent Henry Morgan\
      \ to Panama because taking over Panama City would open the doors for the Royal\
      \ Navy to strengthen its stronghold over the open waters. Unfortunately, in\
      \ a cruel twist of fate, the Spaniards and the British Royal Crown had already\
      \ signed a peace contract before Henry Morgan\u2019s conquest. As a result,\
      \ Henry Morgan\u2019s actions are decreed as piracy, and the Royal Crown declares\
      \ him as an outlaw and places a hefty bounty on his head. The cunning Governor\
      \ Sir Thomas Modyford saw an opportunity to at once please the Royal Crown and\
      \ feed his greed by agreeing with the Spaniards to go on a joint expedition\
      \ to hunt down the mysterious and rumored City of Gold in exchange of taking\
      \ down the outlaw who single handedly took out the Spanish forces in Panama.\
      \ Now Captain Morgan is caught in the cross hairs of the Crown\u2019s Justice\
      \ and the vengeful Spaniards. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/414500/extras/cinematics.jpg?t=1541730183\"\

    review: 'An interesting idea, but this game falls very short. Bad voice acting,
      terrible costumes (Why are there fully armored knights in the 18th century?),
      poor controls, no menu system, ok graphics, odd level design, large spinning
      item drops... basically, a very rough entry into game making.


      Better design, better voice acting, and better research into the period would
      make this a much better game.'
