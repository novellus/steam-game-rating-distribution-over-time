This is my life’s work and I am extremely proud of it. From the start, the game has received mixed reputations of being a laggy buggy mess, and that's fair. It was. This project has been a learning process for me and I can say confidently that I am much better at my job than I was in the past. Over the last 2 months I have learned so much when it comes to game development. Something in me just took over and my brain turned into a sponge. I learned how to code, I dug into the core of the game to find the main issues that would break the player’s experience. We all know what that is; game breaking bugs, unbearable lag, and a horrible multiplayer experience. But through these years of learning as I go, throwing a hail mary, and hoping for the best, literally dedicating my life to this. So many of you have seen the same vision that I have. Thank you, and I hope that this is the update that can really get the game to where it should be. At this point, I can confidently say that EmergeNYC is, without a doubt, the best Emergency\/firefighting game\/sim out. There have been many respectable attempts like Notruf 112, “Firefighting Simulator” which hasn’t posted a word since 2017, Into the flames, which is promising but still is years behind.
