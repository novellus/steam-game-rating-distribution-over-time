I'm definitely not great at MFL. Love playing the game, but I lose to the CPU every now and then. Last night, I entered hell mode.\n\nDue to shoddy coaching and generally not caring about the score, the Full Metal Mayhem (piloted badly by me) are down 21-14 with 1 second left in the 4th quarter. Razors kickoff...one thing I do very well is kick returns. So they kickoff...I return for a touchdown! Overtime, right? WRONG. Ref calls a nonsense penalty on my team, rekick, run back for a TD! It's time for overtime baby, but no, the [BLEEP]ING REF CALLS IT BACK. OK NOW DO AGAIN, KICK TO ME, I SCORE AGAIN BUT WHAT'S THIS? ANOTHER [BLEEP]ING PENALTY.\n\nI tried to go back and play Dirty Tricks>Kill the Ref but I can't find that option. I return another [BLEEP]ing kickoff, then resign myself to fate and just get tackled. \n\nIf it were any other game, there would be a hole in the wall because I would throw my controller through the wall. But, it's the MFL and I'm sure I'll find more interesting ways to fail.\n\nOh and DAT GUILLOTINE...well worth the purchase.","timestamp_created":1580064375,"timestamp_updated":1580064375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472440958023071289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jaDL8e8CdvKl7gE="}
