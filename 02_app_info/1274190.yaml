    review: 'Okay, this is kusoge, but the good kind (i.e., I just was VERY entertained
      streaming it for about 40 minutes)

      Its a horizontal shmup, but:

      1. Your hitbox is the ship''s cockpit, so somewhere in the front, not centered.

      2. Powerups drop randomly

      3. Soundtrack is stock GMidi (I haven''t heard this in a looong time!)

      4. If you die, you restart the entire stage

      5. It crashed to desktop when dying the 2nd time at stage 4 boss, that seemed
      like a fitting end!


      Its hilarious.'
