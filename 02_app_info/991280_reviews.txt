This game costs about as much as a can of soda (maybe less depending on where you live or if you get it on sale) Will you get more enjoyment out of this game than you'll get from a can of soda? Yes, definitely. Does the game have some issues? Also yes, the primary complaint from others is about the controls, which are admittedly a bit awkward (and weirdly tied to the graphics settings) but I would not say it makes it unplayable in any way. The default camera, which is an outside view makes it look as if you're banking when you're actually rolling, which makes it a bit difficult, but switching to cockpit view makes everything much more clear and easy. Graphics are decent, there's some nice plane models. There seems to be a backstory which isn't all clear, but in any case, the game is mainly about just jumping into the action. Anyway, again, less than the price of a can of soda. Definite recommend.","timestamp_created":1593553960,"timestamp_updated":1593553960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxPfNg/MCdrfgkQI="}
