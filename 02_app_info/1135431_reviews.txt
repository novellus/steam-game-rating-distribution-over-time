It handles amazing, its the single best car for C class. I haven't tried A class because of the only problem with this car, the gearing. Its a 4 speed which means its very long and vague in this game. A snappier 5 speed would make this THE car. Paint schemes aren't exactly what you want if you enjoy motorsport correct paint schemes but you can make it work.\n\nOther than that i could give less of a shit about the Hot Rod or Lawnmower V2. Solid 2/10 for value for me but i can see others getting a kick out of it. The Beamer made me buy it.","timestamp_created":1607193088,"timestamp_updated":1607193088,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgIqLmvYCfMnItwI="}
