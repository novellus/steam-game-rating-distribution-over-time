      \ /><br><br>Goblins of Elderstone brings a unique and chaotic twist to the city-building\
      \ genre. It is more than just a city builder - it\u2019s a Goblin Tribe Simulator!\
      \ In Goblins of Elderstone, you will nurture your tiny clan as it grows to become\
      \ an awe-inspiring tribe, capable of standing against the other races and, perhaps,\
      \ even the gods. Rule over the chaos and feed the growing goblin war machine\
      \ by raiding dungeons and villages. <br><br>The gameplay is inspired by the\
      \ Anno games, Banished, Stonehearth, Rimworld, and the Settlers series, but\
      \ it is still very much its own legend. We love goblins, and believe that they\
      \ are underrepresented in games. They deserve a city builder of their own! We\
      \ have so many great ideas to add to the genre, and we would love to share the\
      \ experience with you during Early Access. We hope you agree that goblins are\
      \ awesome and don't always have to be the villains - unless, of course, you\
      \ want them to be!<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/693580/extras/Steam_banner_thegame.png?t=1608257716\"\
      \ /><br>In Goblins of Elderstone, the choice is yours. You can use your wisdom\
      \ and industrious nature to create a trade empire. You can be the divine chosen\
      \ one and lead your tribe to glory through the power of your faith in the gods.\
      \ You can be a conqueror and show the world the might of your goblin forces.\
      \ This is your tribe, and it is whatever you make it!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/693580/extras/Steampage_seasons.png?t=1608257716\"\

      \ /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Free-form city building - Goblins don\u2019\
      t much like orderly straight lines, so there\u2019s absolutely no way they\u2019\
      ll use a grid when building. They are rebellious, but creative. As a result,\
      \ buildings go up wherever desired, but neat little pathways and bridges will\
      \ always be built alongside them to ensure they\u2019re properly connected.\
      \ <br></li><li>Large resource and crafting tree - With over 30 different resources\
      \ that can be gathered, crafted, traded, or stolen, your goblins will always\
      \ have plenty of work to do. As a result, it\u2019s worthwhile to invest in\
      \ a few Enforcers to ensure they keep at it!<br></li><li>Clan, World, and Divine\
      \ politics - Use a combination of fast-talking, gift-giving, violence, and just\
      \ the right amount of threats to keep your clans in line. Failure to do so will\
      \ likely result in a fair amount of murder and potentially the destruction of\
      \ your entire village. However, diplomacy doesn\u2019t stop there. Other races,\
      \ and even the gods, can be convinced to do your bidding.<br></li><li>War, Trade,\
      \ or Faith - Whether you choose to trade in violence, commerce, religion, or\
      \ a combination thereof, the world will be shaped by your actions in some way\
      \ or another. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/693580/extras/Steampage_king.png?t=1608257716\"\
      \ /><br><br></li><li>Scout, Raid, Trade, or Pilgrimage - Goblins aren\u2019\
      t really the patient, caring type. That\u2019s why they\u2019re better at setting\
      \ fire to farms than actually growing anything. Therefore, as your tribe grows,\
      \ you will need to send special teams of goblins out to explore surrounding\
      \ areas in search of wealth and glory. How you deal with what you find is up\
      \ to you. Will you raid and pillage the region, trade with other cities, or\
      \ send Spiritual Treks out to holy sites to gain favor with your gods?<br></li><li>RPG\
      \ story moments - Elderstone is never a dull place. There are many unique tales\
      \ to unravel in this twisted land. Deal with traveling strangers, evil overlords,\
      \ cunning dragons, and even benevolent gods. With the writing talents of Edwin\
      \ McRae backing the project (writer on Path of Exile, Bloodgate, and other amazing\
      \ games), you know you\u2019re in for quite the ride. <br></li><li>Defend your\
      \ tribe - Danger lurks around every corner. Defend your tribe from roaming monsters,\
      \ pesky adventurers, and enemy raiding parties. Do a good enough job, and you\
      \ can even retaliate with your own!<br></li><li>Friends and foes - You share\
      \ this land with a multitude of other races. Squishy humans, stuck-up elves,\
      \ grumpy dwarves, and smelly orcs are all out there somewhere. It\u2019s probably\
      \ best not to outwardly display your disgust with them, though, as that tends\
      \ to start war. If you\u2019re willing to put up with them, and maybe exchange\
      \ a few pleasantries, you could make some friends.  <br></li><li>Interesting\
      \ characters - It\u2019s not unusual to run into a few strange individuals as\
      \ you explore the world. They all have their stories and motives. Some seek\
      \ adventure, some may request a helping hand, and others might just be in the\
      \ market for a new goblin tribe to enslave. Be ready for anything. <br></li><li>Total\
      \ world domination - Become the ultimate ruler of Elderstone by controlling\
      \ critical regions on the map. Fill empty dungeons with your warriors to protect\
      \ their riches from thieving adventurers, leave trade envoys in neighbouring\
      \ towns to expand your trade empire, and pray to the gods at monoliths to bring\
      \ destruction upon your enemies.</li></ul><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/693580/extras/Steam_banner_music.png?t=1608257716\"\

    review: This is a great game with what seems like a dedicated dev team. It definitely
      has it's bugs and quirks (some can be pretty frustrating) but the aesthetic
      and charm definitely outweighs the downsides. I bought this game a long while
      back and decided to revisit it. A lot of the huge game-breaking issues that
      drove me nuts have been polished out and they've added a good amount of content.
      I only wish more people played it so the wiki would be filled with more helpful
      info because I still find myself being confused by some aspects of the game.
