    about_the_game: "<strong>Tank Crew \u2013 Clash of Prokhorovka</strong> is an\
      \ entirely new and challenging way to enjoy the <i>IL-2 Sturmovik: Great Battles</i>\
      \ series from a different perspective! <br><br>Tank Crew is a new ground-breaking\
      \ tank simulator that allows you to experience WWII from inside one of ten legendary\
      \ WWII tanks and battle enemy armored units for control of the village of Prokhorovka\
      \ and the surrounding area during the battle of Kursk in 1943. In the largest\
      \ mechanized battle of all time, you can command your tank crew in both single-player\
      \ and multiplayer environments and battle the enemy in intense missions and\
      \ grueling combat. Maneuver your tank to find the enemy\u2019s weak-spot while\
      \ trying to keep your own tank\u2019s vulnerabilities from being exposed. One\
      \ carefully placed round is all it takes to decimate your crew and destroy your\
      \ tank!<br><br>Tank Crew contains ten famous tanks and armored vehicles that\
      \ you can drive, shoot and command in virtual combat alone or with friends.\
      \ Tank Crew also comes with a map of the Prokhorovka sector of the Kursk salient\
      \ which includes the Prokhorovka village and surrounding countryside. The topography\
      \ is taken from satellite data and painstakingly reproduced to accurately reflect\
      \ the battleground as it was in 1943. Houses and buildings in the village are\
      \ destructible and no match for your tank. You can also knock over trees as\
      \ you battle your way to victory. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467120/extras/Tank_Pic_for_Steam_Description.png?t=1606499244\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Several Ways to Play</h2>You can choose several ways\
      \ to play Tank Crew in either single-player or multiplayer modes. We have designed\
      \ Tank Crew from the ground up to take full advantage of all our mission design\
      \ logic and multiplayer capabilities of the IL-2 Sturmovik simulation engine.\
      \ You can operate the tank yourself or have friends join your crew and each\
      \ person perform another vital function as driver, gunner, machine-gunner or\
      \ tank commander!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Quick Mission Support</h2>If you just\
      \ want to jump into a tank and start shooting, we have several tank skirmishes\
      \ available in the Quick Mission Builder. These skirmishes are a great way to\
      \ hone your tank combat skills before you tackle objective-based single-player\
      \ missions or intense multiplayer missions. And if you own any other Great Battles\
      \ title, you can also use play tank skirmishes on other maps, not just the Prokhorovka\
      \ map.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Two Historical Scripted Campaigns</h2>If recreating\
      \ history is interesting to you, we have built and included two historically\
      \ based Scripted Campaigns that tell the story of the battle for the Prokhorovka\
      \ sector \u2013 <i>Breaking Point</i> and <i>Last Chance</i>. <i>Breaking Point</i>\
      \ showcases the Soviet side and <i>Last Chance</i> recreates the German experience.<br><br>Each\
      \ campaign is ten missions long and highlights the tactical and strategic reality\
      \ of the battle. German tanks are fewer, but extremely deadly and Soviet tanks\
      \ are more numerous but outgunned in a one on one fight. It\u2019s a fascinating\
      \ experience and since we have taken great pains to build these tanks to match\
      \ their historical counterparts, you will quickly learn what these brave soldiers\
      \ knew in the real battle - not all tanks are created equal! However, with great\
      \ skill and bravery, you may be able to survive to fight another day!<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Single-Mission Scenarios and Support</h2>Tank Crew includes ten fast\
      \ action missions that allow you to familiarize yourself with each tank and\
      \ learn its driving and gunnery systems while blasting away enemy units. Ten\
      \ more custom scenario missions feature each highly detailed tank and send you\
      \ on a mission to confront the enemy and accomplish the objective.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Multiplayer Missions and Support</h2>Tank crew also includes three\
      \ specially designed Co-Op missions that you can play with your friends as either\
      \ part of the same tank crew or as enemy combatants. <br><br>We have also included\
      \ two \u2018Tank Dogfight\u2019 multiplayer missions that you can host as your\
      \ own server or join other servers and battle your friends in a pure test of\
      \ your armored combat skills.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Community Content Support</h2>As\
      \ with all IL-2 Sturmovik: Great Battles series titles, Tank Crew supports content\
      \ created by the community such as skins, missions and campaigns. Tank Crew\
      \ fans are already creating additional skins and missions for you to download\
      \ and enjoy. You can download our Photoshop templates and create your own paintjobs\
      \ or build your own missions using our powerful Mission Editor. Much content\

      \ Crew is compatible with all the other Great Battles series titles such as\
      \ Battle of Stalingrad, Battle of Moscow, Battle of Kuban and Battle of Bodenplatte.\
      \ If you have these other titles you can use your Tank Crew tanks in any mission\
      \ or server that is designed to include tanks from Tank Crew. This is especially\
      \ common on multiplayer servers that want to include a combined arms approach\

    review: "[b]To save your time I'll simply put it like this[/b]\n[i]As of December\
      \ 2020:[/i]\nSimply want to ejaculate to beautiful tanks? Get this!\nActually\
      \ want to use them and play some hours? Stay away.\n\nDont get distracted by\
      \ the big amount of positive reviews. They're simply focussing on the fact that\
      \ its \"the first modern tank sim\". They disregard its (lacking) features and\
      \ simply recommend it for the thing it tries to be, not what it is.\n\n[b]Its\
      \ more like a WW2 Tank Viewer and Tank Ballistics Tester[/b]\nWhy? Because the\
      \ Tanks (behavior, interior etc.) and ballistics are superior to every other\
      \ game, while other content simply sucks\n\n[i]Before I continue, most of the\
      \ negative points are focused on Singleplayer, some of the following points\
      \ can simply be ignored when in Multiplayer.[/i]\n[i][b]And before you ask,\
      \ no, its not worth getting it for MP only. [/b][/i]\n\n- No Career Mode (only\
      \ some scripted campaign which arent that good) and way too few missions\n\n\
      - The quick missions are just head on head duels\n\n- Most of the time its you\
      \ who is doing EVERYTHING, driving, shooting, spotting, range finding. The friendly\
      \ AI (no matter if crew or other Tanks in platoon) are almost completely braindead.\
      \ They do not report enemies, their reaction time is terrible and their formation\
      \ discipline is non existent (and they also like exposing their side when in\
      \ a firefight)\n\n- The commander of your tank doesnt even bother to spot or\
      \ range targets for you, but if youre the commander and you tell the gunner\
      \ to engage an enemy, he immediately knows the distance. What the actual fuck.\
      \ And yet the AI handles it like it was nothing. Their range finding is almost\
      \ spot on. Usually the first shot (seldom the 2nd) lands 5m around you, and\
      \ the next one hits your tank.\n\n- You feel alone all the time. Also the Key\
      \ Bindings are overcomplicated. Especially the command system for the commander.\
      \ \n\"Bruh its a Simulator\" isnt enough. Some Actions should & must be minimalistic\
      \ like simply TALKING TO THE DUDE WHO IS AT YOUR LEFT FOOT THROUGH INTERCOMS.\
      \ Or opening your hatch and peaking with binoculars.\n\n- You always must fully\
      \ expose yourself if you want to look with the binoculars. No option for simply\
      \ peaking out with them. The commander role is worst and least effective of\
      \ them all.\n\n[i]Small Unimportant negative point is the lack of official skins.\
      \ Yes, its up to the community again[/i]\n\nThe devs really wanted to extend\
      \ their area from aricraft to tanks and suddenly realized, its almost too much\
      \ for them. Their engine and maps are perfect for Air combat but doesnt fit\
      \ Tank Warfare. This \"project\" is/was a high risk/high outcome trial. So its\
      \ a 50/50 chance they'll turn this into a great modern tank sim, or a cemetery\
      \ for the hopes of tank enthusiasts."
