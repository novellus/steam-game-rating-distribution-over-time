    review: 'I recommend this because I have used it and found it situationaly appealing.


      -This pack in particulaur has a very solid earth and aquatic theem, with a small
      "dark" sub-set. It would be quite good in an underground cavern setting (earth-themed
      monsters and some dark critters with some underground lakes.)


      -Some of the 50 monsters are (as you can see in the first screenshot) repositioned
      variants. This is convinient artisticaly when trying to make a troop look good
      but means that you are not getting 50 unique monsters per se. (there are about
      11 repositioned variants.)


      -I prefer event-driven battles to random encounters and should have considered
      that when buying it. Any character sprites or faces for these battlers would
      have to be made custom by the buyer. I would like to stress that this is not
      a fault on the part of the artist providing this pack, and I was not expecting
      character sprites or faces to be provided.


      (note: 0 hours on record is deceptive. Hours are not recorded on this as it
      is a DLC and not a program or even a patch for a program. It''s artwork.)'
