    review: 'AC: Chapter 2 was far more interesting than the first chapter. The story
      does much better than the first but the gameplay still lacks in creativity.
      Although, I did enjoy some puzzle elements in this chapter. I still am of the
      opinion that younger audiences would enjoy this much more.'
