    detailed_description: <h1>How is this different from the web game?</h1><p>Prosperity
      started off as a text based web game that I developed in 2014. Over time, the
      web version of the game diverged a great deal from my original vision for the
      game. Many of the things I wanted to do became unrealistic due to the limitations
      of the game's architecture and planning.<br><br>As a result, the PC version
      available via Steam is very different but keeps many of the same core concepts.
      Additional details can be found at our subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProsperityGame/comments/8pgita/difference_between_steam_version_and_web_version/"

    short_description: Take on the role of leading a camp of weary peasants, make
      strategic decisions to fight for survival against the elements. If you're capable,
      the camp will grow into a settlement, and then a hamlet. Do you have what it
      takes to grow it into a city?
