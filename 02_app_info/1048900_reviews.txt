It's a point-and-click hidden object game?\nLook, I don't usually leave negative reviews, but I just feel like this is one of those games that you play maybe once and never again.  It's quite dated compared to modern HOGs.  Sometimes the scenes are too dark to see all the objects properly.  I had to use the hint button too many times.  We don't learn what The Fog actually is, only the effect it has.\nThis kind of game has been done better, with a more moving storyline, better graphics, and interactive maps.  The map doesn't even label the separate places, so you have no idea where actions can take place.  At least one of the mini-games was too complicated to work out, and there are no guides, so I had to skip it.  And when skipping it, it didn't show me the solution so that I could remember for next time.\nI'm not sure when this was originally made, but if you're going to buy it, do so when it's cheap.  And, like I said, there are better HOGs out there with more emotional impact, like the Nevertales series.","timestamp_created":1609405643,"timestamp_updated":1609405643,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j6eD3PYCdpeGvwI="}
