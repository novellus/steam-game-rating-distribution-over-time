      smaller fish to grow in size, but make sure not to get eaten by other, bigger

      of room-scale VR. Munch is an exceptional experience at the bottom of the ocean
      where every motion and action feels natural and intuitive, without causing motion
      sickness. Immerse yourself in the world of Munch!<h2 class="bb_tag">VR is for
      everyone</h2>Munch is a game that virtually anyone can enjoy. It's as easy to
      learn as it is challenging to master, and will always keep you on your toes
