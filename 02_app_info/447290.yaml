    about_the_game: <strong>REDEEMER</strong> is an intense Brawler where you will
      punch, hack and blast your way through enemies using fists, hammers, fire arms
      and even the environment. It grabs the genre by the throat and drags it into
      2017 in brutal style by adding a deep melee combat system and numerous unique
      types of kills. Redeemer is the brawler for those who love brawlers and have
      been waiting for a modern take on the genre!<br><br>Play as Vasily, an elite
      operative who once worked for one of the biggest Cybernetic Weapons Manufacturers
      in the world. Officially working in security, you were tasked with infiltration,
      assassination, extortion and even torture. When eventually the corporation decided
      to turn you into one of its cyborg soldiers, you manage to narrowly escape to
      a secluded monastery deep in the snowy mountains. <br><br>For 20 years you tried
      to find peace and harmony amongst your fellow monks, but you are still too haunted
      by your murderous past to find either. Now after all of these years the corporation
      is finally closing-in on your location, and in so doing they have given you
      one last shot at redemption.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Intense
      Top Down Action:</strong> Take out enemies using a wide selection of fire arms

      skills to beat down your opponents using a collection of brutal fighting moves,

      Use three different types of kills to mercilessly eliminate enemies. Sneak around
      levels undetected to silently perform graceful stealth kills, or use the very
      environment to dispatch your opponents using environmental kills by smashing
      their skulls, impaling them and setting them ablaze in flames (many more options
      available). Utilize your combat prowess to beat down your opponents enough to
      enable you to perform savage execution kills that will have you reaching for
      the screen capture key. <br></li><li><strong>Parry System:</strong> Defend yourself
