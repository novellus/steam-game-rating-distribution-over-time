But towards wave 200 and so it becomes apparant that this needs to be buffed slightly, since the clicking damage you have is not really high anyway but at the start of the game. Overall id say its currently not worth the price-tag because of how useless it is end game, but for supporting the company who create the game id say this is the best fit for this right now.","timestamp_created":1511066611,"timestamp_updated":1511066611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548872172832489014","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ409Wl6d8CePDViwE="}
