      cabinet and cartridge games from the 70s and 80s? Ever wanted to experience
      the intense action from the point of view of the hero within the game? Now you
      can, in VIRTUAL REALITY.

    review: "[h1]Updated Review 2/14/2019[/h1]\n\nI still stand by my original review.\
      \ However, the fact that it's been in EA for this long without an update makes\
      \ me have to knock it down a bit. It still is super fun & challenging, but the\
      \ lack of updates and the grinding involved make me now say buy on deep, deep\
      \ sale but then get an awesome game & deal. See my video review & gameplay here:\
      \ \n\nhttps://youtu.be/UmxiFMFAlnA\n\n[h1]Original Review Below[/h1]\n\nI can't\
      \ believe this game got a 90% discount and is currently $1.19 USD on the Black\
      \ Friday deal.  It is so much fun.  And it's actually one of the best wave shooters\
      \ in VR currently.  It stands out in a very crowded genre for VR.  I know this\
      \ may sound like heresy to some, but I enjoyed RetroGunX VR way more than I\
      \ ever enjoyed Space Pirate Trainer (although maybe that's because I only started\
      \ VR this past summer so I'm late to the VR world when SPT was THE game to play).\
      \  [spoiler] by the way, I do think SPT is a good game, just not as good as\
      \ this one [/spoiler]\n\nSo what makes RetroGunX VR so special?  I'm glad you\
      \ asked or at least read it out in your mind and didn't know you were asking.\
      \  Well, let me tell you the answer.  This game is special because each wave\
      \ is unique.  This isn't some flying drone flying around at varying speeds and\
      \ aimlessly at times and each wave just brings more of them.  That stuff don't\
      \ fly in this game.  Each wave introduces a new enemy type that does very different\
      \ things.  Each enemy moves differently and has different attacks and attack\
      \ patterns.  \n\nThis game is not about climbing leaderboards (although it does\
      \ have them).  It's about progress.  Finishing the game.  In a way, it's like\
      \ Galaga but unlike Galaga or classic arcade games,  Those had endless waves\
      \ of repetition, where it was about faster and more.  This is about each wave\
      \ bringing a new challenge.  I would put this game up there with Blasters of\
      \ the Universe.  For $1.19 it's a must buy.  \n\nSale Price Rating 10/10.  Normal\
      \ Price Rating 8/10."
