It has a small amount of charming pixel art and  a good UI. \n\nBecause it's simple it relies on the core gameplay to be fun, but unfortunately it's not. The primary issue is that there's a long cooldown period in between shots which ruins the flow of the action. The zombies also have annoyingly small/awkward hit boxes which causes you to miss often which then triggers another painful reload. \n\nThere's also no animations for enemies being hit or when you reload which is annoyingly unsatisfying.\n\nThe game might be more fun with later power ups and monster types but I just didn't want to play for that long.","timestamp_created":1507478533,"timestamp_updated":1589519330,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579065322875976563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrYWvi/ICf7vbhwE="}
