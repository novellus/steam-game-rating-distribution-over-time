      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat does &quot;filter-focused&quot; photo editing mean?\
      \ It means that CameraBag Photo has the advanced tools you need to make your\
      \ images look just how you want, but in an interface that makes it incredibly\
      \ easy to re-use the styles you develop as custom filters. Or to start with\
      \ existing presets to emulate classic film stock, or to batch apply the same\
      \ style to hundreds of photos. It means that CameraBag is built from top to\
      \ bottom to help you develop a unique photographic style that is distinctly\
      \ your own.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe\u2019ve designed CameraBag Photo to sit in\
      \ the sweet spot of photo software: it\u2019s much more versatile and powerful\
      \ than cheesy \u201Cone-click\u201D filter apps, but much lighter, quicker,\
      \ and more intuitive than bloated traditional \u201Cpro\u201D photo software.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nCameraBag's interface is focused on building up a series of\
      \ image adjustments (or loading existing filters made up of a series of adjustments)\
      \ and tweaking them as needed. You can easily see every adjustment you've applied\
      \ to your image in the bottom tray, adjust their controls, reorder or delete\
      \ them, or save what you've got as a new filter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey Features<br\
      \ />\r\n- 150+ built-in high-quality adjustable filters<br />\r\n- Full suite\
      \ of 30+ photographic tools, including advanced curve editors<br />\r\n- Build\
      \ your own entirely new filters from scratch or from existing filters<br />\r\
      \n- Elegant, modern interface<br />\r\n- Innovative tools not found anywhere\
      \ else, such as CameraBag's curve-based color corrector<br />\r\n- Fast image\
      \ processing via the revolutionary Analog Engine<br />\r\n- 32-bits-per-component\
      \ color depth<br />\r\n- Entirely non-destructive editing process<br />\r\n\
      - Easy layering of filters and adjustments<br />\r\n- Quicklooks and previews\
      \ for fast decision making<br />\r\n- Watermarking and custom image-based borders<br\
      \ />\r\n- Batch processing<br />\r\n- RAW format support<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      CameraBag Photo is the newest version of CameraBag (the previous major release\

    review: "***Update:\nAfter I downloaded the beta (in options from steam) it now\
      \ works.  I still love this progrem.  Its not my go to to finish a photo, but\
      \ to have some great presets for filters, its phenomenal to get some extra versions\
      \ of a picture.  \n\n***UPDATE:\nI used to love this program to get some filters\
      \ and extra edits..  It had some great fine tuning tools, but it constantly\
      \ crashes and is unusable.  I'm really disappointed, used to be great.\n\n****Orinigal\
      \ review:\nI got CB Photo on an 80% discount because I had CB2.  So far, a nice\
      \ UI improvement and alot of control over your editing.  Will this replace photoshop,\
      \ paintshop pro, affinity, or others.  No.  How I use this program:\n\nI edit\
      \ my photos and touch them up with PSP or Affinity and get them to a nice \"\
      traditional\" look for my clients.  I will then take the final edits and open\
      \ them into CB Photo.  I then add extra filters, adjustments, and colors to\
      \ give it a more \"creative and artsy\" feel.  The process is really quick and\
      \ effective.\n\nThis program does have a lot of cool features about it.  It\
      \ doens't do everything, but what it does do, it does great.  It has a lot of\
      \ filters with previews.  I really like the fact that everything that can be\
      \ edited can be done so with exactness.  There are sliders and scales for all\
      \ the adjustments and edits so you can fine tune your photo to your hearts desire.\
      \  \n\nAs I said before, it does a great job getting some extra filters and\
      \ adjustment to my photos.  Ive seen in some review that people have had trouble\
      \ opening their files, but I have had 0 issues.  I have all my photos in JPG\
      \ and RAW format.  I've never had an issue."
