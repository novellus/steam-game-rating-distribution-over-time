    about_the_game: "Barney is down on his luck. He has lost his job and now it looks\
      \ like he might lose his one true love too. It is time to take matters into\
      \ your own hands. Do you have what it takes to save the day?<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThis game aims to combine the feeling of early 90's Point and click adventure\
      \ games with children's games of the same era. While looking like a children's\
      \ game, it has a story and characters that are more suitable for an adult audience.\
      \ <br />\r\nThis is a retro style point and click adventure game. The graphics\
      \ and sound are designed to be minimalistic, with pixel art / &quot;low resolution&quot;\
      \ graphics and simple sound effects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith its retro pixel\
      \ art graphics it tries to bring the feeling of classic Point and click adventure\
      \ games. This is combined with the look of children's games, with a cartoon\
      \ environment and big characters. It has a simple UI with controls that hopefully\
      \ is easy to understand even for someone who has not played a game of this type\
      \ before.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is an Indie game without any financial backing."

    review: "[b][i] You should not have to work THIS hard for a piece of dick......or\
      \ SHOULD you??? [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Who [/h1]\n\nBarney's Dream Cruise was published\
      \ and developed by Gubbi Games. You may recognize this company from other such\
      \ blockbuster titles such as: ...Barney's Dream Cruise....The Demo.\n\n[h1]\
      \ What [/h1]\n\nis the game about? So you play as Barney, a broke-ass dude who\
      \ has the hots for his neighbor, Donnie. However, he has competition in the\
      \ form of Michael. An individual who has similar hole interests and is significantly\
      \ financially better off. So what's a guy to do? Well, the obvious thing, obviously.\
      \ Steal stuff and use your welfare check to frame the cock blocker so you can\
      \ have a hassle free bee line to the bunny's hunny-hole.......wholesome....??\
      \  I gotta tell you...if the only way to get this bunny's attention is through\
      \ money, then, you're doomed, buddy. You're broke. I mean, directly after the\
      \ opening once you see you're living conditions, the screen should've faded\
      \ to black which should've been followed by a gunshot sound and a game over\
      \ screen with a smiley face. Not only that but he's a rabbit. Rabbits and foxes\
      \ are natural hoars. If they wave at you congratulations; you just contracted\
      \ about 15 different, new, and fun forms of herpisyphahepatitus. The lagomorph\
      \ desire from this guy is so strong; you'd think he was a rejected Beastars\
      \ character. Terminal diseases aside, this a dark humor point and click misadventure\
      \ game.\n\n[h1] Where [/h1]\n\ndoes this game go wrong? It's point and click.\
      \ This can be a chore. Even my favorite point and click was a cast-iron bitch\
      \ because some sequences were a bit too cryptic and this game is no different.\
      \ No shame in admitting that I used the walkthrough. No shame in my game. I'm\
      \ not about to give myself a migraine on a game where my sole purpose is to\
      \ play hop on pop with a rabbit.\n\n[h1] Why [/h1]\n\nYeah...why? Bitch, I dunno.\
      \ It's kinda funny. It's not breathtaking but it may be worth a play. MAYBE.\
      \ Personally, there are some jokes in this game that I really appreciated after\
      \ the game was completed and I did some \"research\". I get it....I get it.\
      \ \n\n[h1] How [/h1]\n\ndoes it fare? It will, sadly, become forgettable but\
      \ I did enjoy it I'm not gonna lie. I don't think that this will be as widely\
      \ appreciated as it should be especially when you consider the fact that quite\
      \ a bit of the humor will probably be missed or completely rejected. \n\n[h1]\
      \ Is [/h1]\n\nYeah, totally. I mean, the audience for this is niche, but luckily\
      \ I qualify for that audience so bully for me. The typical point and click \"\
      isms\" are here so you shouldn't be too disappointed. If you go with a very\
      \ light disposition and open-mindedness I think you can have a bit of fun with\
      \ this one. If not....well....I mean....you played a game about a dog sabotaging\
      \ a fox (?) so he could bang a total sub dude rabbit.....yeah.....go ahead....critically\
      \ analyse this, I'm sure you totally won't look like a douche. No seriously,\
      \ your academia is critically needed."
