    review: "This is actually a super fun little Christmas game. There's not really\
      \ much to it. You basically just pick out the packages that the elves want you\
      \ to put on the sleigh to get ready for Santa. If you go into it just expecting\
      \ a simple seek and find game I think you'll find some enjoyment in it. It's\
      \ clearly meant for children but I imagine some adults might like it too. There\
      \ are 3 different levels (the larger the number, the larger the level and the\
      \ more packages you need to find). I went through all 3 levels and I enjoyed\
      \ the game for what it was. If you're on the fence, I have a video series I'm\
      \ working on for this game. Currently there are 2 videos and there will be at\
      \ least one more before the series is finished.\n\nEDIT 11/12/2020: I ended\
      \ up only keeping the first video up on the channel so I that's all there is\
      \ right now. I actually am #1 on all 3 leaderboards for this game as of today.\
      \ If you're looking for a neat little game for the kids for the holidays, I\
      \ still recommend this. It was a lot of simple fun. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr-XbtNpYfM&list=PL08FwntTpxPASyImRfiCWYuYQ17Tb0mW4"
