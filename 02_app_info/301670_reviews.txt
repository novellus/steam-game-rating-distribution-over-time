With dark and alien architecture, a strange world that is barely introduced before you are dropped down into it, and a compelling frame of a story. \n\nHowever, Steam is selling a product that is outright broken on modern systems. Menus where your cursor is invisible, meaning saving, loading and then exiting the menu you opened is a test of patience, a horribly flickering quest log, and crashes to desktop from launch. Salammbo: Battle for Carthage is a game I bought ages ago and had finally been hoping to get stuck into. Unfortunately for me, I left it too late, meaning I can't get a refund. \n\nI have myself tinkered to get other games running before on Steam. Many older games simply come with no compatibility options, and you are forced to tinker with stuff just to get it playable. Older games on Steam seem to have Bethesda's ethos - that is, the consumer will fix all the problems for us. Except we're expected to pay money for this stuff. If we paid for a disc that was scratched and broken, we'd be frustrated and annoyed with whoever supplied us a disc that clearly wasn't working. Really inexcusable. \nSadly I couldn't even find this available for purchase on GOG. If you are keen on buying this game, buy it with the knowledge you'll have to do some fixing of your own to get it working on a system that's remotely modern.","timestamp_created":1606514788,"timestamp_updated":1606514788,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.625688672065734863","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6sjvhfYCccn8swI="}
