If you haven't already, please try removing the game and reinstalling it, and I am releasing a patch after updating unity to it's latest version but if this still doesn't help all I can suggest is refunding.\n\nHowever I did encounter a similar hanging on start up problem earlier in development, however in my case this was due to my GTX 1070's imminent death after it started occasionally blue screening a month earlier when playing the Witcher 3. After the card stopped working completely and I started using the cpu's onboard graphics the hang on start up no longer happened. If you are also having odd problems with other games or occasional blue screens this may be the cause. \n\nI sincerely hope this isn't the problem you are facing."}],"cursor":"AoJw97G/g+QCdJONowE="}
