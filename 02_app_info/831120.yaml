    review: '[h1]Overview[/h1]


      If you haven''t played any of the other games in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i],
      then stop reading and go play them!  But for those of you who already know what
      the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] is about, the game obviously takes place in Maggie
      Dale''s second year at the Gail Pilgrim Space Academy where there''s more academic
      life and the usual snooping and getting into trouble that''s endemic of youth
      culture, but this time, Maggie has unwittingly unleashed the full potential
      of her mind, discovering fascinating facts about some of her fellow cadets.
      Gail Pilgrim, as expected, is still the adventuress at heart despite living
      a comfortable life as Chancellor of the academy that bears her name and Ambassador
      of the Galactic Union, and sets out to conduct an internal investigation of
      the Space Wardens on Union Station in the Alpha Centauri system after receiving
      a tip from the villain in [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Year 1[/i] that there''s
      corruption within the Space Wardens who apparently don''t seem to be any better
      than the Jovian Astrolaw Commission the Space Wardens replaced.


      [h1] Graphics and Sound[/h1]


      No different from [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Year 1[/i].


      [h1]Positives[/h1]


      The classes featured in [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Year 2[/i] make this the game
      with the most replay value of any game in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i], and
      is further helped by the fact that the player can earn a much larger number
      of achievements by using different methods for two of the classes featured.  There''s
      also a hands-on learning experience that makes for a great scene, proving that
      education sometimes can be fun!


      Consistent with [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Year 1[/i], Maggie can respond to
      her instructors with humorous answers to their questions. (This is at the expense
      of getting a lower grade, so players are advised to save their games before
      Maggie goes to class.)


      [h1]Negatives[/h1]


      As with most games in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i], trying to write about negatives
      in the game is a prime of example of trying to grasp for straws. The worst things
      that can be said about [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Year 2[/i], is that the story
      is far too good for an indie game made with the [i]RPG Maker[/i] engine. (The
      [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] should have been made into a AAA game a long time
      ago!) Players will not be able to express their fervor for [i]Space Pilgrim
      Academy: Year 2[/i] by crafting badges for their profile.


      As with any game in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] (and likely any game made
      with [i]RPG Maker[/i], the player has to be one of the chosen few people on
      Steam who have been granted the magical powers to be able to take and upload
      screenshots to Steam without the use of the Steam overlay. (Although it''s possible
      that these powers have been planted into people''s brains by a mad scientist,
      but nothing has been proven so far.)


      [h1]Conclusion[/h1]


      Apart from [i]Space Pilgrim Episode I: Alpha Centauri[/i], this author hates
      how all of his reviews for games in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] have to be
      written with ulterior motives. Do you know the saying "you couldn''t make this
      stuff up if you tried"? Well guess what? The author wrote this review in order
      to fulfill some of the criteria of Steam''s 2019 Summer Event. Besides, who''s
      going to read a review of a sequel to a game that isn''t a whole lot different
      that it''s predecessor game(s)?
