    about_the_game: "Arson &amp; Plunder is a 2D arcade/beat'em up adventure based\
      \ on the genre classics of the 90's. The classic gameplay has been brought up\
      \ to speed with the latest developments and trends! In typical beat'em up style,\
      \ playing an orc or elf you wade through hordes of enemies out to kill you in\
      \ &quot;Story mode&quot;. You can also build your up-to-4 battle squad to crash\
      \ them all with your friends in co-op mode. <br><br> The game features beautiful\
      \ 2D visuals, interactive scenarios and a humorous story. Your objective in\
      \ Arson &amp; Plunder is to survive over 25 different missions in five difficulty\
      \ levels in &quot;Story mode&quot;. While playing you can always switch between\
      \ being an orc or an elf. This element make the game especially dynamic. The\
      \ controls are always intuitive and help you to carve your way through an adventure\
      \ bursting with humor and action. &quot;Co-op mode&quot; will allow you to enjoy\
      \ all the bizarre situations with your friends. Besides, you can test your endurance\
      \ in &quot;Endless mode&quot; within a dedicated dungeon scenario, fighting\
      \ against an increasing cornucopia of enemies!<br><br><strong>Storyline</strong><br><br>The\
      \ orcs and elves of the Loidar wood have been in war since time immemorial.\
      \ But their<br>struggles have been forced to a stop because of a new and powerful\
      \ enemy: Man, a wicked race that wants to take possession of their sacred woodlands\
      \ in order to exploit all their natural resources. In view of this threat, elves\
      \ and orcs are forced to agree to a truce and to try stopping the invading forces.<br><br>They\
      \ draw up a plan to stop humans and their deforestation: to find the stationed\
      \ troops<br>near wood's region and to beat down their captain. But the region\
      \ is protected with a magic shield that can't be destroyed by brute force. The\
      \ only way to get in is to use the Milius stone, a magic stone placed in a cave\
      \ near the outskirt of the forest, that will transport whoever that touches\
      \ it to another cave placed near the human region.<br><br>This isn't the only\
      \ problem; orcs and elves agreed to a truce, but they don't rely on the others'\
      \ abilities for completing the mission successfully. So they decide to send,\
      \ on their own, a warrior of each race. Elves send Tinargey (Eternal Fire Star)\
      \ Arson, a graceful and skillful elf woman, well versed in the ancient secret\
      \ art of Fire Mastery. Orcs sent Vrok Plunder, a rough berserker armed with\
      \ a big battle axe, as lethal as his arms, legs, jaws and big hard head.<br><br>Both\
      \ warriors get into the cave from two different places, and quickly progress\
      \ to the magic stone, reaching it at the same time. The stone teleports them\
      \ to the destination cave, but the result is not as expected: the magic travel\
      \ wasn't prepared for two beings at the same time, and now the man and the fly\
      \ the orc and the elf woman are fused.<br><br>So, now there is a single body\
      \ inhabited by two beings, that learns summoning the body of one another as\
      \ they need.<br><br>Once they get used to their new body, they get into the\
      \ enemy lands, going through a near<br>deforested wood followed by a village,\
      \ finding tougher new enemies. After that, they'll go toward the mountains to\
      \ destroy the sorcerer that shielded their people out of the human territories.\
      \ Finally, orcs and elves will help our heroes to occupy the castle and finish\
      \ off the human captain in the highest tower of the palace.<br><br>At the end,\
      \ the wood is safe again, and orcs and elves can continue happily with their\
      \ bloody wars, but Arson &amp; Plunder\u2122 are still trapped in the same body,\
      \ and there's no magic powerful enough in the forest able to undo the spell.\
      \ So, our heroes must leave to a new mission towards the unnamed lands, where\
      \ it's said that most powerful wizards lives in.<br><br><br><strong>FEATURES:</strong><br>o\
