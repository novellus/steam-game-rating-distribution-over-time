    review: 'The Titan vehicles are the most fastest vehicles, However they come with
      a penalty, Atleast to me, They are terrible on Turns, Especially the airblade,


      Atom are pretty good on turns.


      It''s a overall good DLC to buy if you wish to be extremely fast at the cost
      of turning.

      Keep the good work up.'
