I think it had a different name. It has a unique art style with very high contrast and funky pixelation and color grading. I don't know what those words mean. I don't really understand the theme, something about game development. [b]Wolfenstein 3d is name dropped once, and is likely the most memorable part of the experience.[/b] I liked the last scene on the beach where the gummy bears down by the water look at you. You might also notice a certain review blurb down on the steam store page. That's me! What happened was I uploaded the viveport video, and the developer was like 'hey can you please remove it', and I demurred. Now I understand that I was in the wrong, and should have complied with their polite request. Other VR developers (3-4 at least) have clipped my youtube videos and I've gotten strikes just because I had the temerity to say that their game sucks, or sometimes that the game is good! [spoiler]To that end, fuck Yur.fit, fuck Claude Monet, The Water Lily Obsession, fuck Djinni and Thaco 35 dollar endless tutorial experience, Fuck Trauma Simulator, etc. It's like Quantum phsics where certain VR experiences dissappear when byteframe looks at them.[/spoiler] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVdBevEpJ-c","timestamp_created":1597850055,"timestamp_updated":1609827617,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.18419976532459259","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4joHN6PYCdoq5nAI="}
