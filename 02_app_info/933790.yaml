    review: "Since I can write reviews for DLC, I'm going to use my powers for good\
      \ and review this clean and complete OST.\nIt's refreshing, spirited, and nostalgic.\
      \ A bit like a grilled lime.\nBut if you just want feedback on whether or not\
      \ you should pick it up, skip to the ~tildes~ near the end.\n\nAs ever, let's\
      \ start with the bad. 2.99, huh... With that, I could probably have gotten some\
      \ nutritious food from a food truck. The quality of the food would've been either\
      \ superior or subpar. One or the other, with no room for other possibilities\
      \ in-between. Unlike that money, disappeared into my gullet, this OST will last\
      \ until my ears give out on me. So, did I make the right choice?\n\nDamn right\
      \ I did.\n\nFor one, the non-looping versions are much cleaner, audio-wise.\
      \ You'll know what I mean if you listen to a lot of music, but if you liked\
      \ the game's OST (and I loved it), you'll hear the improvements pretty much\
      \ instantly. More importantly, though, the 'full' versions of various tracks,\
      \ stitched together from their smaller component parts?\n\nWow, they paint an\
      \ audial picture that I feel like I'd missed out on.\nI had no [i]idea[/i] how\
      \ good Noa's theme was, and how it worked on multiple levels\n\nGuess that's\
      \ what I get for chasing rabbits.\n\nBut a lot of the themes (Solvant, Kowaii,\
      \ and Himitsu especially) are really enhanced through these mixes. I can't tell\
      \ you whether the cost'll be worth it to you as an individual; it'll depend\
      \ on how much you like listening to game music and Broken Minds' OST in particular.\n\
      \n~Closing thoughts~\n\nAs a guy who listens to a lot of music, though, of all\
      \ genres - yeah, I'd have probably paid 5.99 for it, no regrets. Also, worth\
      \ mentioning is that the bonus track is [b]really[/b] good, so if your'e on\
      \ the fence, you might consider that. \n\nIt'll probably come down to you, though,\
      \ like most music/bonus DLC.\nDo you want to give a bit back to the creator,\
      \ do you really like the music? If so, purchase.\nAnd if you're in a place where\
      \ 2.99 is gonna hurt, or didn't find the music as memorable, you can pass.\n\
      \nWould I recommend it? In a flash second.\n\nBandcamping this, but -\n\nFavourite\
      \ track: It's a secret!.. (28 - Himitsu)\nRunners up are Inside Her Mind and\
      \ Noa's Theme."
