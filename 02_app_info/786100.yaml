    review: '[h1]Like it''s predecessor...[/h1]


      Only that this game just starts off, where the first part of Maestro left the
      unfinished business. This part is a bit more explorative, yet it still feels
      like an unfinished part of the whole story. It offers some twists and turns,
      and some unexpected betrayal that give this story a very specific feel. Yes,
      it is better than the first part, yes, the HOG-Scenes are pretty well done,
      they are yet on the easy spectrum of the genre. So the whole series is more
      like a beginner, or starter game. The Riddles and Minigames put in here are
      pretty simple, and mostly you don''t need to skip one of them - since they are
      pretty well known, most of them at least.


      Question still is, is it recommendable. Yes, if you own the first part, and
      hate lose ends like myself, you might want to get it, yet... it still has some
      lapses in logic, which might give you a headache. I can conditionally recommend
      this game, for players who like Hidden Object games, that are more on the "Adventure
      Light" side of the spectrum. Try to get it cheap, since 9,99 Bucks is a tad
      overpriced.'
