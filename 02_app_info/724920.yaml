    about_the_game: Four cats have broken out of prison on a distant alien planet.
      They must steal a ship and escape before their suits run out of power. If only
      they could decide who should be captain. Work with and against your cohorts
      to become the captain, commandeer a new ship, and escape.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Key

      have to work together if you want to survive! Four generators need to be activated
      to power the ship, and you can't do it alone. At the same time, players who
      survive get points so if you want to win you'll have to get creative.<h2 class="bb_tag">Beautiful

      distinct and vibrant biomes on your hunt for generators and gold.<h2 class="bb_tag">Tools

      traps that lock players in place to giant hammers that launch nearby players
      away. If you're lucky you might even be able to scavenge items from around the
      map.<h2 class="bb_tag">Life After Death</h2>Even after you've been killed you
      can still put up a fight. Control the spectre of your cat after death, sapping
      energy from other players and scaring them to death!

    review: 'I wish I could recommend this game but unfortunately it is clear that
      it has very little to offer at the moment. I really like the style and characters,
      but there really isn''t depth at all. Also, it is pretty buggy at the moment.
      Maybe one day this could be a cool game, but thus far it seems the devs may
      have abandoned the project. RIP Starcats, I love you RealCat.
