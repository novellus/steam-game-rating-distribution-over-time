    review: 'Edit: I was angry after playing this game because it was so bad, resulting
      in an aggressive review. Now, a day later, i calmed down and changed a few sentences.


      My opinion didn''t change though: This game is terrible and way overpriced.


      Let''s go through it step by step.


      No options menu. You can neither change mouse sensitivity, nor resolution, nor
      the volume of music and sounds.

      When i loaded into the game, the camera was spinning around in circles. I had
      to disconnect all controllers and restart the game (going back to the main menu
      and starting again didn''t help) to make it even work. And you cannot look down
      or up all the way. It seems the character has a stiff neck or some other kind
      of disability.

      In addition, the turquoise dot that is supposed to be the cross-hair sometimes
      moves along with the mouse movement. And when you press the action/interact
      button, you interact with the object the cross-hair is pointing on, not with
      the object in the middle of the screen.


      The visuals are awful. There is basically no lighting, all assets, including
      the walls, are self-illuminating - with the exception of the walls in one "dungeon".
      The town is lit and objects outside still throw shadows, but without a visible
      light source, and most objects look like they were placed randomly. The characters
      are nightmare creatures. They look like they escaped the drawings of a 6-year-old
      child, and the animations are just as bad. At least enemies have decent pathfinding.

      The hitboxes are an issue, too. You can look down enough to see that there is
      0.5 yards or even one yard empty space between you and an object and you cannot
      move closer to it.


      Speaking of boxes, moving boxes are a big part of this game - if only you could
      pick them up. No, you have to push them around by running into them, which is
      very clunky and frustrating. You can do it with your "weapon", too, which seems
      like it''s supposed to be a magic staff shooting magic balls, but you are limited
      by a very slowly regenerating mana pool.

      One character asked me to bring her a light crate. And for that, she allowed
      me to enter her home. That is completly implausible.

      I mean, it''s supposed to be an RPG, right? So, what is that character''s motivation
      to allow the cleric to enter her house? And if it''s because "he''s the trusted
      town cleric" - why wasn''t he allowed to enter her house before? In addition,
      why does that trusted town cleric steal the silver cutlery in her house (which
      was lying on the floor and weirdly "hidden" behind some crates, yeah, that''s
      totally where everyone whould store their silver cutlery, right)?

      An other character lost the keys to his house. If you find them, he''ll also
      let you go in without any hesitation and take whatever you want. One of the
      most important thing of an RPG is having believable characters. Sadly, the characters
      in this game are the opposite.


      It''s not only the characters that make no sense. The entire architecture of
      the village and the houses are also implausible. The houses are way bigger from
      the inside, and for some reason, people like to put a lot of crates into their
      houses, placed at weird positions. But a place to eat or to cook is missing
      everywhere.

      And btw, the developer loves labyrinths. 80% of the time i spent playing this
      game, i was in a labyrinth, and each labyrinth is bigger than the entire town.

      Do you know even one good game with labyrinths in it? I don''t. And there is
      a reason for that. First off, they are extremly easy to do. I drew labyrinths
      when i was at school. And secondly, it''s extremly boring to navigate through
      them in a game because you see the same textures and objects without much variety
      for quite some time. And this is the main content of this game.


      Twilight on Yulestead has a story, but there wasn''t much thought put into it.
      Apparently you play as a character who has knowledge about an artifact, and
      that character and his town were cursed because he didn''t want to hand it over
      to some powerful countess. But you, as a player, don''t have the knowledge how
      to get that artifact, so you, playing the cleric with the knowledge, have to
      get that information from a random NPC.

      What?

      Player guidance and story telling is basically non-existant, the whole plot
      it told with a message on the loading screen and one or two text boxes in the
      game.


      There are many more little things wrong with this game, but this review is very
      long already. Hopefully the developer will take some of this as feedback to
      improve themselves - a lot. I got the feeling that they are missing knowledge
      about the basics of game design. I''m even doubting that they have played many
      games themselves. Or they did and lack the skill of analyzing why other games
      work out.


      Sadly, i don''t think you can improve this game enough to make it even worth
      two dollars. If it was just 50 cent, i wouldn''t have cared. But for 10$, i
      had to request a refund.'
