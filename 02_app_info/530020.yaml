    review: 'This is a great indie gem if you''re someone who likes the top-down gameplay
      style of the 2D Zelda games, like Link to the Past, Link Between Worlds etc,
      which also happens to be a sequel to the (mostly) great Teslagrad.


      [h1]Gameplay[/h1]

      World to the West takes place in an open, metroidvania style world, where you
      slowly gain access to more of the map as you unlock the 4 characters and upgrade
      their powers.


      The gameplay is more complex than other reviews have given it credit for. Like
      Zelda, most of the game is spent solving "puzzles", but these aren''t necessarily
      in your face puzzle rooms like Teslagrad. Generally you know you need to get
      from point A to point B, or find an item in point B, and to do that you need
      to solve some subtle environmental puzzles using the 4 characters (or a subset
      of those). The complexity comes from the way the developers nave cleverly spread
      abilities over all the characters, so that there is some overlap of some abilities,
      and other powers are unique. To solve these puzzles you generally need to find
      the one character or sequence of characters that have the abilities you need
      at the time.


      In addition to the main storyline, there are a [i]lot[/i] of collectibles to
      find: 36 scrolls, a similar amount of health upgrades, and then maybe 100 money
      chests strewn around the map. These were my favourite part of the game, not
      only because I''m a completionist, but also because these allowed the environmental
      puzzles to shine: you really have to think about how the spaces are designed,
      and which parts stand out as something that can be exploited by a given character.
      In addition, the game has save points which serve as fast travel spots. Others
      have complained that each character must individually find these to enable teleporting,
      but I think this is a clever addition to the game that in some cases makes you
      solve the same environmental puzzle in 4 different ways in order to access all
      the treasures available to each character in each area.


      The combat was entirely serviceable for those used to Zelda''s combat: each
      character has a main attack button along with up to 3 other abilities that might
      have some combat application. Combat comes into focus during some interesting
      boss fights and certain arena fight gates, but is otherwise not a huge portion
      of the game.


      [h1]Music[/h1]

      I found this game''s music to be diverse and interesting. No particular track
      was so good that I would buy the soundtrack, but I remember enjoying it as I
      played!


      [h1]Story[/h1]

      At face value, the story was very bland: four heroes are prophesied to be able
      to beat the bad guy and his plot to destroy the world, so they have to find
      key items to stop him. Pretty uninspired. On the other hand, it was a nice opportunity
      for the devs to explore the interesting cultures present in the world of Teslagrad,
      including the mind-controlling Mesmer, the engineers from Motorland, the electric
      Teslamancers from the first game, and others. However, the game isn''t set in
      any of these countries. The Mesoamerican-inspired native people of the titular
      "West" have a pleasantly developed history, but the game seems to sideline them
      for some reason, and decides that the (white) foreigners need to save their
      country for them, which is a bizarre decision that could so easily be avoided
      by including them in the playable party, as well as coming up with a better
      reason why they can''t save themselves except for "prophecy". So story is probably
      the game''s weakest part.


      [h1]Graphics[/h1]

      World to the West has simple but cute graphics. They''re not amazing, and aren''t
      awe-inspiring like Teslagrad, but I really have no issue with them. Check out
      the screenshots to see what I mean


      [h1]Linux[/h1]

      It supports Linux! And it runs without issues! Great job, devs!'
