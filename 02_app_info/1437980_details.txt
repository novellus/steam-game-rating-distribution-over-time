Her game theory is unparalleled and her loyalty is hard won but eternal. Many dwarves disapprove of her vocation, considering espionage and assassination to be very un-dwarvenly. <br><br><strong>The Defender<\/strong>, our final hero has always put his clan before all else. A traditionalist, he understands the strength of teamwork but is extremely stubborn and carries an air of righteousness that can come off as pompous and, at times, even naive.","about_the_game":"Cyber Forge is a top-down adventure with real-time tactical combat, team-based puzzles and RPG elements.
