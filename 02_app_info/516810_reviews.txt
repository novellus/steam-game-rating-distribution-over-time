I've only played the first 20 minutes so far but I really like it so far. It may be a little cheesy looking compared to what is available on the big consoles, but it has its own charm. The controls are very easy to pick up; which is great for a PC gaming noob like myself. I would certainly recommend this game to anyone considering it. It's a fun little game with an intriging story behind it. I actually WANT to find out what's happened to the guy's family!","timestamp_created":1511217674,"timestamp_updated":1511217674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8fbl7d8CcY7qiwE="}
