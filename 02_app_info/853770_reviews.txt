But those levels are too short. I was able to clear all of the levels in just under two hours. While that's fine for a game in early access, it doesn't  justify a >10 dollar pricetag. Not to mention that it lacks a certain polish. The boss fights, for instance, can freeze you in the intro as the boss whales on you. Throwing items is wildly inaccurate, especially considering that they may bounce on imaginary surfaces and fail to hit their target.\n\nThat being said, it shows real promise. Even though it took me two hours to finish everything, I was happy throughout the entire two hour experience, being soul-crushed when I realized it was over. I would absolutely love to recommend this game, but I would recommend waiting on it until it hits version 1.0 and has a significant number of levels or it goes on sale for less than 10  dollars.\n\nThis review was written on January 5th, 2021. It'll probably change as more levels are added and the game hits a state of completeness that can hold up a 15 dollar pricetag.","timestamp_created":1609840735,"timestamp_updated":1609840833,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4nrb/6PYCet7TwAI="}
