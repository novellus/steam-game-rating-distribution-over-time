The soundtrack is available in high-quality MP3, FLAC, and M4A; you get access to great pieces of artwork that you can easily use as wallpapers; AND a PDF going over how AwSW came to be the way it is now. Again, I highly recommend this to those that want to give Saunders extra support :).","timestamp_created":1604255682,"timestamp_updated":1604255682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3eHFwvUCdsrPqwI="}
