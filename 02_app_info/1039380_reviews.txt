You are the bunny. The game is the same as the old tried and true parking game that comes in 101 variations, only a little different. You have to get your car to the other side of the parking lot by kicking it, while moving other cars out of the way by kicking them.

Absolutely!","timestamp_created":1582928251,"timestamp_updated":1582928251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h4n4xvACcZuT9QE="}
