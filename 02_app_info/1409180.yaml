      /><br><i>Of Mice and Moggies</i> is a smart puzzle game, where you play a cat
      that tries to catch various animals. The levels can look simple at first, but
      require you to constantly find new ways of combining the animals and objects.
      We put an emphasis on puzzles that are solved by being smart, instead of having
      a &quot;stupid&quot; difficulty through a huge numbers of moving parts.<br><br>You
      can build your own levels with the same tool we used: the ingame level editor.
      The levels can be uploaded and made available for other players to enjoy, just
