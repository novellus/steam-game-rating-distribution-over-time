Secondly, leveling up characters isn't satisfying, because nothing really changes except for you get a few more abilities and then you upgrade them.\n\nBefore you say \"well, getting more abilities and upgrading them is character progression by definition\". Yes, but in practice, it doesn't matter here. Game bugged out for me once and I entered a fight without my character, so I only had my ship's basic abilities (as if, the ship was flying by itself). And I won, and it was an easy win. See my point? Character progression, while being a neccessary element of the game, remains pointless in practice.\n\n\n[h1]It's not like XCOM[/h1]\n\nPeople love XCOM because of squad customisation, base development and interesting tactical turn-based fighting. \n\nIn Halcyon 6 base-building Is good, actually, no major complaints. A bit tedious to navigate through at times, but nothing game-breaking. \n\nSquad customisation and tactical fighting is not present though. I played with 2 ships for 5 hours straight because frankly, getting more characteres to run new ships (as well as building those new ships) is resource-consuming and there is no real need for it in the first place since fights are very easy anyway.\n\nIn XCOM you just cannot get by with a small group of troops: you constantly need more, you want to upgrade your squad, you want to try different combinations and see what works best. In Halcyon 6 rolling with Engineer + Scientist + Tactician is your best bet and it's obvious even before you get into your first fight (3 classes - 3 available slots... hmm what do I choose?)\n\nAnd once you get in a fight, you don't need to plan out your actions, because, for starters, it's not really possible due to RNG and enemies acting in an unpredictable fashion. And secondly, you will win the fight easily anyway so why bother.\n\n\n[h1]It is more like Darkest Dungeon[/h1]\n\nIf you've played Darkest Dungeon, you probably know that it starts fantastic, addicting and all-around fun only to turn into a grindfest after the first 20-30 hours of gameplay. Well, that's actually pretty much how Halcyon 6 is like, except for instead of 20-30 hours of fun you get around 2-3 hours of fun. \n\nIn Darkest Dungeon you upgrade your base and your \"squad\" inbetween going to various missions similarly to what Halcyon 6 is all about. Except for, in Darkest Dungeon you have way more classes to choose from and you have various dungeons with different enemies to explore and loot. \n\nInstead of various dungeons Halcyon 6 offers you to fight off same goddamn aliens that keep swarming your colonies over and over again. And they don't even drop loot! It is a chore and the game doesn't even try to make it fun. You also have Pirates attacking your base from time to time, which is not really that different from aliens though.\n\nIt gets a bit different when you get onto story quests, but the proportion between fights with aliens / pirates / other factions is ridiculous. I remember only 1 fight with another faction from my 6 hours of playtime. ONE. I wish I could go off and explore other factions more, but upon return I would have found half my colonies to be destroyed or occupied by aliens, so that wasn't an option.\n\nAlien invasions are simple: they open up a portal, immideately send one or two fleets to a local colony and then they keep doing that until you destroy the portal. So you fly over, destroy the portal, then fly around cleaning up the mess they've made, then fly back to base only to realise they have opened yet another damn portal and, yet again, are already swarming your colonies.\n\n\n[h1]Rinse repeat, rinse repeat, rinse repeat. Forever.[/h1]\n\nIt's so sad. The game has great promise to it. Most flaws I described when comparing Halcyon 6 to FTL or XCOM are completely fine because regardless of them the game has it's own charm. \n\nAliens though.\n\nI hate aliens. I wish there was a mod that allows you to tweak the time inbetween alien attacks because it's just unbearable. You keep flying around your Faction cleaning up alien fleets over and over again. Fighting them takes a load of time and gives completely zero joy.\n\n\n[h1]A few kind words about the game[/h1]\n\nThe game is not terrible, in fact, it could be great!\n\nI really liked that you can have different characters of the [u]same class[/u] and they would have different backstories, different unique abilities and personal traits. You have a wide variety of ships to choose from, which is also great.\n\nThere is a number of factions/races that you get in contact with, they all have their own style of comunication and actually say interesting stuff followed by well drawn animated portraits you see on the telecomunication screen. You can choose how to answer to them and from what it seems, this impacts on how they treat you in the future.\n\nAfter you've developed your base enough, you can actually automate the resource gathering process using drones (many people complained about having to manually gather resources over and over again). I wish, you didn't have to manually install drones though, makes zero sense, but that's besides the point.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nIt saddens me that developers put so much time into the game to recieve so many bad reviews by unsatisfied players, because the game actually could be truly amazing. \n\nHalcyon 6  just needed a bit more polish before release or a nice patch that fixes game-breaking flaws. The basis for a great game is there, too bad it was ruined by simpliest things. There really are not too many major issues in the game.\n\nUnfortunate part is, even though the number of said issues is not great, their impact on the gameplay is.","timestamp_created":1486274947,"timestamp_updated":1609943589,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":66,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.772966265678405762","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iLSH7PYCf7OrcQ=="}
