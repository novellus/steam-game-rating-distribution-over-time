What I was able to play, it would be a good game.  Not worth the money, no response from the devs to problems.\n\nIt turns out that the game can not run full screen, and it defaults to full screen mode.  You have to start the game go into options disable full screen mode and exit the program.  After that it will play correctly in a window.","timestamp_created":1601170109,"timestamp_updated":1602334366,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk8OkifUCcaappAI="}
