    review: I hesitate to recommend the game  I fully enjoyed it for a long time and
      then I got to the place where you use a pump handle to fill a watering pot and
      I had the same problem that a few others complained about. I wore out my fingers
      doing a fast and faster tapping on my keyboard to fill the pump and it would
      never go all the way to the top and finish the full pot.  So, up until that
      point which is not extremely far from the end, I really liked the game.   The
      only other thing is the English wording in their conversations is weird but
      easy to ignore and go on with the game.  I could not find a fix or suggestion
      about getting the water pot to pump full so I guess this is another game I cannot
      finish....not the first game like that either.   Good game except for the above.
