It was also impossible to complete the advanced tutorial stage because it would crash after prompting you to run from a fight. A couple of times, the name of a location on the map would show up as \"undefined.\" The game doesn't know how to handle a 4:3 display, showing a complete mess of graphics in the \"offscreen\" portion at the bottom of the screen. Additionally, boss patterns seem to get messed up and use the \"offscreen\" portion of the screen as an acceptable location to jump to. Changing to windowed mode doesn't fix any of this, and in fact doesn't seem to do anything besides give the window a title bar. All of this less than an hour into the game.\n\nThe developer promised in forum threads that they'd look into fixing some of the bugs almost a year ago, but never did. Maybe it's more functional on consoles or mobile, but definitely not on PC. For now, just skip it.","timestamp_created":1533922878,"timestamp_updated":1533922878,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566895425319671631","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo7S7kuUCfr2EqAE="}
