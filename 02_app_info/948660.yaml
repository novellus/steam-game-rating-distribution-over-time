    review: "Ignore my time played, as I played this for free on the X Box gamepass\
      \ and beat the game with the true ending.\n\nFun retro styled RPG from Kemco.\
      \  It is like most other Kemco released RPGs in that everything is pretty generic\
      \ and looks like it could have been made with RPG maker.  \n\nYou go around\
      \ the world, recruiting party members, trying to beat the big evil of the game.\
      \  You get three party members, but each of them can have 3 companions with\
      \ them, for a total of 12 members in the party.  \n\nDuring combat you can have\
      \ a party member and all their companions attack or you can use a party member\
      \ skill.  Note that if you use a skill from one of your party members, all your\
      \ other members of that group will do nothing for that turn.  That said you\
      \ best bet is usually to attack every turn with every character.  This will\
      \ get you through most of the game, as the game is really easy.\n\nA big talking\
      \ point for the game is the 100 party members you can collect.  This is done\
      \ in a suikoden style with you traveling around and talking to people.  Some\
      \ join right away, and some demand items or you to complete a quest or have\
      \ some required stat.  9 of the people you recruit can be assigned to your party\
      \ and another 16 can be assigned to two support squads that enhance you party\
      \ abilities.\n\nAs far as extras, there is a crafting system, where you sacrifice\
      \ unwanted weapons to make a weapon more powerful, a battle arena, a treasure\
      \ chest dropping mechanic where you have to wait for a chest to open, an extra\
      \ dungeon, a secret ending and a shop where you use tickets and currency you\
      \ get from battles (not gold a different most likely premium at one time) to\
      \ buy rare and powerful items.  You can see from this and waiting for some chests\
      \ to open that this game was intended to have optional purchasable currency,\
      \ most likely when it was on mobile, but here you do not have the option to\
      \ purchase extra currency.  \n\nThere are extras to purchase, like extra XP\
      \ and damage, but honestly the game is so easy you will not need them.\n\nTook\
      \ about 10 hours to beat the game and see the true ending, so it is a quick\
      \ play.\n\nAll in all an inoffensive game.  I would rate average if I could\
      \ but since nothing is bad about the game I will give it a thumbs up."
