As you can probably tell I had the SNES when I was a kid.\n\nI want to recommend this because I loved this in the 90s and I love Dredd but I'd say steer clear.","timestamp_created":1609632073,"timestamp_updated":1609632073,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40ojj4vYCdZjzvwI="}
