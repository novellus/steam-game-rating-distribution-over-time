The game was developed by ERS Game Studio and published by Big Fish Games Studio.\n\n\"Music of Death\" is the first episode of \"Maestro.\"\n\nSince this is a collector's edition, it comes with extra features that are not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are two different difficulty game modes to choose from: Regular and Expert.\n\nThe notebook keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events and clues.\n\nThere is no map in the game. The player has to remember where to go in the game.\n\nThere is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place to make it stationary.\n\nThe hidden object scenes consist of the following: Traditional word list. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interactions.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.\n\nSince this is a collector's edition, there is a bonus chapter, but it can be accessed only after the main story is completed.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThere are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Soundtracks; Concept Art; Wallpapers; Screen Saver and Game's Strategy Guide. Most of these extra features can be accessed only after the entire game is completed.\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1547241281,"timestamp_updated":1599943669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56884235143661499","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40N6EwvQCdeyMuAE="}
