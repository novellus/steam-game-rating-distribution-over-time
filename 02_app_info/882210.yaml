    review: '[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38287655-Prof.Vaharrak/]Prof.Vaharrak''s
      Curator Group - Almost 30 years of gaming experience at your service[/url]


      Simple, addictive, fun tower defense.


      No crazy excessive requirements to finish the game, just complete the level
      regardless of HP left on your castle.


      You unlock helmets for your character just by playing.


      In-between levels you gain skill points which you can use to improve your strength
      (hit harder), your agility (move faster around the map) or your towers. These
      are never too restrictive on what you can or can''t do, it''s very unlikely
      you will mess up at any point.


      You can build towers where trees exist on the map. These are for the most part,
      generously abundant and approppriately placed. You can improve towers just by
      standing on them and waiting for a bar to fill up. Depending on the type of
      tower (i.e. arrows, bomb, anti-air) you may improve attack rate, range, power,
      etc., allowing for experimentation and flexibility. Towers cost money which
      you get from clearing a wave (mostly) and defeating enemies (less so, but still
      will net you an extra tower or two at the end of a level).


      If things get dicey you can also directly attack enemies (and dodge-roll between
      them to avoid damage and collect the coins they drop) although without some
      improvement on the skill point tree it won''t be a solid tactic, and takes more
      of a secondary role during levels.


      Very nice music, visuals are clean and clear. It''s very relaxing and pleasant,
      few games strike me as such, much less tower defense ones. Made me like it a
      whole lot more than I expected.


      Glad to have picked it up and very recommended for anyone looking for a casual,
      light-hearted and fun tower defense.'
