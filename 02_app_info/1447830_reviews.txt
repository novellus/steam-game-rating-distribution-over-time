The developer of this does too and it shows! It feels great, plays great and I just love it! Super easy mod support as well! I have modded in the MW2 soundtrack and now it feels even better! <3\n\nIt is one of those games I just got an instant crush on, exactly why that is is hard to explain but I will try to give some pros and cons on why.\n\n\nPros:\n+ A very present Mechwarrior 2/Mech sim retro feel, but with modern fps controls (similar to Mechwarrior Online)\n+ Lots of options for loadouts for the mechs with 3 Chassis available, lots of weapons and weapon group settings.\n+ You can target specific parts of the enemy mechs and blow the off! \n+ Great mod support!\n+ Engine is open source!\n+ More content is coming!\n+ Multiplayer! Coop and deathmatch!\n+ Friendly developer (discord link in the steam forum)\n\nCons:\n- Feels a little bare bones, but the developer promises more content in time!\n- HUD can sometimes feel a bit cluttered\n\n\nThe developer has also said that the game can be used as plattform for anyone who wants to use it to make more content. Mechwarrior 2 total conversion when? ;)","timestamp_created":1608825514,"timestamp_updated":1608854114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60000002384185791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7bHLy/YCcr3nvAI="}
