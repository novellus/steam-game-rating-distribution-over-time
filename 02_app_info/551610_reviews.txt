This game is dead. No reason to review it at the normal price. No, what you want to know is what I wanted to know. Is this game worth getting at the deep discount price of $2.49 USD or lower? The answer obviously depends on you.\n\nFor me, it was worth it. The bots aren't half-bad, especially on the hard difficulty. I had fun playing 4 v 4. There's Team Deatchmatch, Domination, Deathmatch, and Gun Game. Gun game doesn't work without another player online so good luck with that mode. Domination does work, but it's a little buggy as the enemy team seems to always cap the flag on their end of the map, even if there's nobody near the map. So you have to stay right on it if you want it to stay capped. TDM is definitely the best mode for this game.\n\nThe AI is not the best, but it does a decent job of killing you for any mistakes you make. Sometimes they will just stand there and not notice you are right behind them. However, they do a decent job of overwhelming you. Spawns are pretty bad in this game. You can spawn with enemies right behind you and you'll die within a second. However, it works both ways as enemies can spawn right in front of you for easy kills. \n\nThe locomotion is absolutely the worst thing about this game. It does have full locomotion and snap turning so you'd think it wouldn't  be so bad. However, it uses the grip button in the direction of your controller to snap turn in that direction. Eventually you get used to it, but it's still not good. \n\nI really didn't notice any major bugs / errors. I think the game frame rates drop the longer you play the game and there are intermittent & sudden frame rate drops, but it otherwise usually runs at 90 fps even on my 1060 GTX. The graphics are okay. The sounds are okay. Game is the definition of mediocre. And while there is a nice variety of maps & themes for those maps for this price range (11 maps total), they are all square based in their layout, which is disconcerting. Some are smaller than others though.\n\nSo should you spend $2.49 USD on this game? Well, maybe. If you like playing solo and just want a casual match against bots then this game may be for you. I had almost 2 hours of fun and although I will probably never play this game again, I feel I got my money's worth already.\n\n[b]Sale Price Rating 5/10.[/b]","timestamp_created":1582519287,"timestamp_updated":1582520308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwkvLjuvACfK6g9AE="}
