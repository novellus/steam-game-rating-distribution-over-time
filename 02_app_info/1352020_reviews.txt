There are plenty of places where you can get stuck and have to restart the level, but it is fine. I have to say that the spy interrogation chamber was by far the most difficult for me. The final level feel like nothing in comparison. Maybe that could be adjusted? Also, things to consider, laser sights, I think I would enjoy it more knowing where my shoot is aimed to. Also, not been able to walk... not funny, sometimes feels unnatural having to relocate with the hooks while a few steps will do the trick.","timestamp_created":1609798265,"timestamp_updated":1609798265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ioXd5/YCep3DwAI="}
