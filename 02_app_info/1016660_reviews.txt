Things has improved a lot and I'm impressed one dev has managed this. \nI haven't played enough lately to make a decent review, but I'll keep what I wrote ten months ago. Then you can all buy thye game, play a bit less than two hours and compare your experience with my experience ten months ago. Then you can decide for yourself if you think the dev is working hard on his game and if you want to support him. I think he does and I think you should.\n\nOk, I'm aware that the dev has made a lot of warnings about not to buy the game,  unless it is only for the purpose of supporting the game because it is early access. Fair enough. And that was why I bought the game. But, I also bought it, because he says he has worked on the game for two years and he estimates one year or less, will be enough to finish the game. He also says, that this part of the game is almost finished, and he will soon start working on more content.\nThis part of the game is not almost finished! It is very barebones. It still needs a lot of work! Hitboxes are all over the place, if  in some cases exsisting at all? Crabs! I'm looking at you! If you try to kill a chicken (these are FAST chickens) you can't. Because if you try to corner it against the lake, it will just jump into the lake and disappear. Same goes for rabbits. If you try to corner them up against a tree or a rock, they run  right through the tree or the rock. There are a lot of these things. no need to go into them, because it is early access and is to be expected.\nWhere I'm going with this, is that I don't think that most ea indie abandonware is from scammy devs. I think they are from devs, who's dream of making a great game, has made them bite more than they can chew. I'm afraid this is the case here. I'm not saying this game will not be finished, I hope it will, but in a year or less? No way! 2 years? I doubt it. 3 years? Perhaps.\nIt is one man making an open world game. Not a hack them down game, but a game with all the complexities of a survival game. And if this is all he has to show after 2 years in developement, how can he believe that he will be able to finish it in a year or less?\nThe game looks ok for very early pre alpha. So if you have the faith and the patience, please support the game.\nI'll be back in 7-8 months, and if the dev proves me wrong, and the game is almost finished by then, i'll most humbly bow my head in respect and change my review to positive.","timestamp_created":1564310805,"timestamp_updated":1593456438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507698178291320801","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1565242295,"developer_response":"Challenge accepted. \n\nPS, Chickens and rabbits are meant to be killed with a bow or magic spells with range, which is why you can't corner them.  They aren't meant to be cornered and beaten with melee.  Anyways, thanks for trying my game and sharing your thoughts but most of what you spoke about is either intended for reasons you did not yet reach, or has been fixed already.  Also keep in mind that the game in it's current state is also given for free to anyone who wants to try it without supporting the game.  I mean, you can literally hop in discord and download the same exact game (currently) for nothing, so everyone should be fully aware of the exact state of the game before buying, which is the only reason I am offering the ability to support development by purchasing on Steam.  While you may already be aware of this, I wanted to mention it for anyone who may read this review and not realize that fact. \n\n That being said I understand your frustrations and also appreciate your feedback as I will no doubt work on the things that bother players the most because I take player feedback very seriously. \n\nStop back in 7-8 months and I have a feeling you will enjoy the game quite a lot more. Until then, take care and happy gaming. \n\nCrow"}],"cursor":"AoJwr/XZgPMCf/OjzwE="}
