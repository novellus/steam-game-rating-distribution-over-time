    review: "I know the real Svalbard well; I used to live in Longyearbyen. So, I\
      \ was quite keen to get this DLC, even though it is a bit expensive.\n\nThe\
      \ landscape of the archipelago has been done well, and the DLC interfaces with\
      \ the TerraMaxx scenery, including the season textures: summer/winter/deep-winter\
      \ (note: the TerraMaxx software is sold separately, and not via Steam, either).\
      \ There are a small number of airstrips and helipads about the area. Ny \xC5\
      lesund is modelled, with the NMA VLBI radio dish and rugged landing strip. There\
      \ are also others: Pyramiden, Barrentsberg, etc. (atlhough I don't have real-life\
      \ experience with those to comment). However, the main interaction point for\
      \ Svalbard is Longyearbyen.\n\nThe airport is good. The layout is fine and the\
      \ terminal is well modelled. The little details are there too, including the\
      \ [i]\"Gjelder Hele Svalbard\"[/i] sign outside the terminal with directions/distances\
      \ to various places. That sort of detail is cool, and not obvious... you'd need\
      \ to know to go look for it.\n\nWhat is [i]not[/i] good is Longyearbyen itself.\
      \ This is the settlement near the main airport (ENSB, the only commercial airport\
      \ in the region). There are a few buildings modelled in the DLC. But there are\
      \ very few buildings in Longyearbyen in real life, so not modelling them, and\
      \ relying on the ground texture is simply not good enough... especially given\
      \ the settlement is very close to the airport. The uncorrected ground shadows\
      \ also look wrong; especially given the low sun elevation at those latitudes.\n\
      \nThe DLC has the UNIS building, but much of the rest of the area is missing.\
      \ For example, the historic Taubanesentralen (which is very prominent and sits\
      \ on the edge of the nearby mountain). The senteret is very poor. Further afield,\
      \ some of the surrounding buildings are included (e.g. the SvalSat ground tracking\
      \ station), but many are missing (such as the mines or the road up Adventdalen).\
      \ The DLC costs quite a lot for this limited level of detail, even if it was\
      \ on sale. It sort of feels unfinished (but if it ever gets patched up, I'll\
      \ re-consider this review).\n\n[b][u]Summary[/u][/b]\n\nIf you're a \"sandbag\
      \ pilot\" (takes off, sits on autopilot, lands, repeats) who is just collecting\
      \ world locations, you're not going to get much out of this expensive DLC. If\
      \ you know Svalbard, and want to fly Longyearbyen, Ny \xC5lesund, Pyramiden,\
      \ etc., for the sights you know, you'll probably find it disappointing."
