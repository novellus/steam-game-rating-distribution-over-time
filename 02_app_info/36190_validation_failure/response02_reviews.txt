So no actual game playing yet! Mostly just troubleshooting..... Really want to play though, it's a lot of fun!\n\nOk, lots of thanks to Aknuk (which was originally posted by Karra90), Apple Juice, moosepower91, and swordthief ! ! !\n\n Just to clarify, in steam right-click on the game, select Properties\nLocal Files, select Browse Local Files, this takes you to your file location on your computer. \nSingle-click to highlight game. In the Menu Panel you'll see Manage, Application Tools option; click on Application Tools, then select Troubleshoot compatibility.\nRun the Troubleshooter, it'll give you the option to select Recommended Settings (which I did for this game), it will also ask if you want to save those settings, which I did after testing to see if it worked. It also offers display options which I chose for Cake Mania 3, which played well, but was offset on the screen.\n\nThanks to the above for the help!  this is a time management game that start out simple and increases in pace!","timestamp_created":1604691342,"timestamp_updated":1604724904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhNrD0PUCc7DfrAI="}
