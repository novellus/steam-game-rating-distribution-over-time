    review: 'Many RPG Maker 2003 games have been in development (and temporarily abandoned)
      for more than 15 years. Now that games like "Ara Fell" have proven that people
      are willing to pay money for these games (if they''re good enough), all the
      stragglers have begun to crawl out of their holes, trying to fulfill their childhood
      dreams. Some amateurish projects better remain unfinished, though; unfortunately,
      this game is one of them despite some visible effort.


      Bottom line: Unless you''re in desperate need of another classic old school
      RPG Maker 2003 JRPG, I can''t recommend this game. There are far better games
      (for free) out there (check out "Theia: The Crimson Eclipse", for example).


      The story is presented in the most boring way possible (just read the pseudo-epic
      babble on the game''s store page and you get a glimpse of what I mean), and
      the developer fails to make the party members and antagonists appealing and
      interesting. There''s too little dialogue of relevance, and all events leave
      open too many questions (maybe the developer forgot that the player doesn''t
      know as much about the game''s universe as he does). Just being able to present
      one''s lines without too many spelling and grammar mistakes doesn''t make one
      a good writer. Some of the party members even get awkward exposition info dump
      flashbacks right at the beginning. Yeah, I want to travel with you and fight
      by your side, and I want to get to know you better, but that doesn''t mean you
      have to tell me your life story after we''ve just met. Without their not very
      relatable back stories, though, all party members are blank slates and utterly
      interchangeable.


      Unfortunately, the ATB (Active Time Battle) system only features a press Enter
      wait function, not a fully automatic one, so that battles feature even more
      button mashing. While weapons and shields incorporate certain elements and status
      conditions, none of them are explained (there''s an in-game manual that should
      cover them, but it doesn''t work as of writing this review). None of them matter,
      though, if the player takes the time to acquire the powerful arena weapons (early).


      The current level cap of 25 is way too low (RPG Maker 2003 allows up to level
      99), I reached it (after a bit of grinding) after the second dungeon. Why develop
      a classic old school JRPG with this engine and then cripple the expected meaty
      hardcore experience? I mean: When I see all these elemental skills that can
      be bought at the Mages Guild, it''s perfectly natural wanting to acquire them
      as soon as possible if this task only requires reasonable effort. Why should
      I expect to reach the peak of fighting prowess after slaying a few slimes, pigs
      and brigands? To make matters worse in terms of balance, many enemies have a
      low chance of dropping "Herb Satchels". Opening one randomly provides the player
      with up to three Herbs of one type, all of them permanently raising certain
      categories of stats, including the Golden Herb which raises all stats by two.
      Due to the random nature, abusing save & reload can easily provide the player
      with enough Golden Herbs to become practically invincible, and then the arena
      offers an even easier way to obtain an unlimited number of Golden Herbs. I''m
      not complaining per se; I like abusing save & reload and getting stronger in
      general. But why cap the level at 25 and then let the player run wild with abusing
      Herbs? I can''t wrap my head around this sort of contradictory game design.


      While the dungeon design and the mapping are tolerable (despite some glaring
      obstruction mapping errors), towns suffer from "big map syndrome", featuring
      large, irrelevant areas (with many buildings that can''t be entered), offering
      nothing to explore, with too few NPCs (compared to the towns'' size) that also
      have nothing interesting to say. Some buildings can be entered, but shops are
      menu-based. Sleeping at an inn spawns the player on the top floor instead of
      near the entrance. Inconsistencies and inconveniences like these ones permanently
      annoy the player. While I don''t criticize developers for mostly using the resources
      provided by the software (RTP - Runtime Package), since that''s what the software
      is there for, the lack of custom resources doesn''t help to mitigate the aforementioned
      issues.


      Speaking of exploration: Most objects can be examined, but identical objects
      all show the same evented message and contain nothing. That means you get the
      same message (and find no items) no matter which bookshelf or jar you examine.
      This design choice is terrible, since the pure existence of these messages compels
      the player to examine all objects nonetheless, despite there being nothing to
      find, and the messages are meaningless and don''t incentivize the player when
      they''re all the same and don''t yield any items. To make matters worse, the
      third dungeon suddenly forces the player to examine all objects to advance,
      and one riddle even expects the player to examine a certain object from a specific
      angle, while only providing a very vague hint about that ("greeting the sun"
      or something like that, meaning to face east). Seriously, I love examining objects
      and finding hidden items in JRPGs, yet I would prefer the complete absence of
      object descriptions/events over this player expectations betraying mess.


      I usually don''t write reviews for games I haven''t completed yet, but it''s
      very unlikely at this point that I will change my opinion, because the game
      is simply a too generic and ham-handed representative of the genre.'
