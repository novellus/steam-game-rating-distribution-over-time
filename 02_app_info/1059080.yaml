    review: Honest;y not bad. I'd say just buy it as the demo just let's you go on
      an eternal loop on the first course and the four levels were honestly fun. It
      was pretty enough and you can certainly catch some sweet air or leave the map.
      Think of it like a sandbox with a mission to get home. Eventually. Would be
      great to be able to go slower without mashing the w, but other than that it
      was fun.
