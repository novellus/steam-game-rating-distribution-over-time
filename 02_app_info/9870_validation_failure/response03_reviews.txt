All the original cast came in to do voices, so that already is a huge plus. The game play is pretty basic but it has some nice visuals and references to the movies. Overall it is a pretty successful licensed game in a sea of bad ones.","timestamp_created":1454160844,"timestamp_updated":1606763832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrMyljfYCc8rDTw=="}
