    about_the_game: Simultaneously a love letter to and a parody of classic role-playing
      games, Sojourner is the retro RPG that the world has been craving, but just
      didn't know it. By gracefully mixing modern gameplay elements with a familiar
      retro aesthetic, Sojourner features everything that you loved from the 8-bit
      RPGs of your childhood and leaves behind everything you didn't. Drawing heavy
      inspiration from NES classics like Mother (Earthbound), Dragon Quest, Final
      Fantasy, and Legend of Zelda, while bringing in an original style and quirkiness
      all its own, Sojourner is a glorious blend of the old and the new, making for
      a very playable, very fun adventure for anyone who is a fan of the classics
      or simply a fan of RPGs in general. <br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Embark on

    review: Solid, solid, solid NES-style JRPG. It's big and has many secrets and
      isn't too bad on the grind scale. Totally worth 5 bucks!
