      notes: There is no serious mature content in the game, it's just the title has
        the word "Naked" and the characters are not wearing any clothes (But no private
        parts are displayed).

    review: not playable. The second the game starts he falls on his face!!! Game
      doesn't even give me a chance to learn what the buttons are! Then game over............................................
      game over = main menu buttons are now locked and no longer selectable. They
      just stop work. Also, the game crashed... okay... I go back to the steam window
      click the "play" button wait for the game to reopen and....................
      "MENU BUTTONS ARE LOCKED" so I close the game, reopen the game "MENU BUTTONS
      ARE LOCKED AGAIN" wtf????? this game is broken............ very very broken!!!
      Its not playable AT ALL. Especially if I don't even have a split second (NOT
      EVEN A SPLIT SECOND) to learn what the damn buttons are before the dude falls
      on his face again its like the second the level starts I die!! WTF!? AND OMG!!
      I will redo my review when I get the time (AFTER I recheck the game and find
      these severe problems are fixed). Thanks.
