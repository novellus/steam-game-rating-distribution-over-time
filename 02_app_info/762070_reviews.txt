Some cards will give you prestige. Every action phase has an aditional prestige bonus. Settling planets will reduce the cost by -2 for example for 1 prestige, exploration will let you draw 6 cards and keep 2 for 1 prestige etc. It's not a new mechanic, it just adds more bloat. Another feature here is the new search action phase which can be selected once per game and let you search for a specific card. \n\nBottom line is, there are too many bonuses and cards. It's much harder to chase strategies. Cards are also cluttered with symbols now due to the additional prestige bonus. It feels like it's designed for more than 4 players in mind while the game's player limit is 4. This expansion doesn't make sense, the elegance is lost. Rebel vs Imperium is the way to play the first arc in my opinion. A big thumb down, avoid.\n\nNote: This expansion requires Gathering Storm and Rebel vs Imperium.","timestamp_created":1606778405,"timestamp_updated":1609972144,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+Kr07PYCf4KPtgI="}
