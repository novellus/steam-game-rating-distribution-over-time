The rulebook is well designed, yet it took me a sample round to understand what it wants to tell me. After that round one knows how to play and the mixture of duelling and poker make for a kind of intense gameplay!\nWhat can you expect for that price? The surrounding is well designed (you basically play on a train in the desert), and so is the game itself. What it doesn't provide is any kind of scripting like auto setup/deal/etc., but since it is not a micromanagement game you barely need those anyways (even better for rewind/save and load).\nAlso, the table could be bigger, maybe with working drawers (Which the table has by design, they just don't work) to place the player mats on.\nAll in all I can recommend this game, at least give it a shot, yeehah!","timestamp_created":1591782290,"timestamp_updated":1591814400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgIXiz/ICcOicjQI="}
