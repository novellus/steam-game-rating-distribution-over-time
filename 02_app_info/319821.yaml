    about_the_game: "Old spacesailors tell the tale of Jotunn Sk\xF8lldir, who was\
      \ banished from his homeworld and carved a path of destruction through the galaxy.\
      \ Worlds that fell victim to his rage were swallowed by lava or entombed in\
      \ ice, leaving none alive. Supposed to wield both fists of undying flame and\
      \ the cold of an eternal winter, Jotunn Sk\xF8lldir truly is one of the last\
      \ remaining legends of the galaxy. Those who have witnessed the destruction\
      \ left behind by him are never the same.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC contains\
      \ a custom skin for Sk\xF8lldir in Awesomenauts. You need to have Sk\xF8lldir\
      \ available as a playable character in order to access the skin in-game. Owning\
      \ this skin will also unlock the special portrait for use in-game. The skin-design\
      \ and sound effects vary depending on whether the player is currently playing\
      \ for the Red or the Blue team, with Jotunn Sk\xF8lldir assuming his fire-form\
      \ in the Red team, and an ice-form in the Blue team. The Jotunn Sk\xF8lldir\
      \ skin does NOT have a unique voice over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJotunn Sk\xF8lldir\
      \ was designed by community member CrimsonYeti for the Design-a-skin competition\
      \ and was chosen by the community as one the runner-ups to Grim Genji from more\
      \ than 250 submissions!"
