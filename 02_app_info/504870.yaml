    reviews: "\u201CHere's what Paizo reviewer ENDZEITGEIST says about A8: Search\
      \ for the Tri-Stone: &quot;Just when I thought I knew what to expect at best\
      \ from Adventure A Week, they pull this one out of their hats. Let me spell\
      \ it out for you: This is as of yet by far their best module - from the awesome\
      \ puzzles (that should stupefy no player, but be fun and come with DM-aids to\
      \ help stuck players) to the iconic dungeon and sense of ancientness, I can\
      \ find no weakness in the narrative or the module's overall presentation. In\
      \ fact, I was positively blown away by how neat and concise the narrative is\
      \ presented.&quot;\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.paizo.com\"\
