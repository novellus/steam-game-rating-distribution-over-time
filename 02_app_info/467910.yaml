    review: "EPOCH is a fascinating game.  It's one of the first RPGs I've ever played,\
      \ and beaten.  I got it several years ago back when literally nobody had heard\
      \ of the game - which, let's be real here, that's *still* true even to this\
      \ day.  But that's a shame, because it really is a cool, mysterious, great game\
      \ with intriguing story, few but endearing characters, wonderful pixelated graphics,\
      \ and challenging fights all throughout, from Ry the Dark Warden 30 seconds\
      \ in to [spoiler] Rios the Creator [/spoiler] at the end.\n\nYou can play as\
      \ one of several different races, from the traditional dwarves, elves, and humans,\
      \ to more original ones, such as the aquatic race of the  Ghroulians or the\
      \ mystical automatons called Cogsmen (I think that's what they're called? Idk\
      \ it's been awhile since I played).  Each race comes with a special ability\
      \ that helps you out in some way throughout the game, though I'm gonna be honest,\
      \ some abilities are straight-up better than others.  For example, as a Ghroulian,\
      \ you start the game with the ability to swim, which you would otherwise get\
      \ around halfway-ish into the game.  It nets you some cool stuff that you wouldn't\
      \ get until later, but once you hit the point you'd normally get that power,\
      \ it becomes obselete.  \n\nWhat's not obselete, though, is the gameplay and\
      \ story.  The story is very mysterious, and you never really put the whole thing\
      \ together.  You can figure out most of it through item  descriptions and character\
      \ dialogue, and the final words of the now-deceased souls you collect on your\
      \ adventure.  The game is quite like Dark Souls in this and other ways, or so\
      \ I've heard.  It features many deities, ancient castles and other locations,\
      \ temples, and other such things.  Magic is quite prevalent, allowing you to\
      \ use all sorts of runic spells to blast away your foes.\n\nWhich brings me\
      \ to combat, which is pretty cool.  You get two hands, which you can use to\
      \ either wield a pair of one-handed weapons or a single two-handed weapon. \
      \ You can dodge-roll, parry, jump backwards, sprint, and do other fancy maneuvers.\
      \  Combo these with powerful weapons and spells to get the edge on your enemies.\n\
      \nThe bosses are pretty hard, especially the ones not directly in your path\
      \ (another Dark Souls trait).  But I love the challenge, and have beaten every\
      \ boss multiple times over.\n\nSo yeah, love EPOCH, it's got awesome artwork,\
      \ interesting story, good combat, all the stuff you could want out of an RPG.\
      \  Lots of bugs, though, which is what makes me give it an 8.5/10\n\nP.S. DON'T\
      \ waste your time with the successor, Nother.  It's super laggy, even on a decent\
      \ computer, and the story makes NO sense.  Graphics are bad too."
