    review: 'The pros,

      -The devs care and will listen to the communities suggestions.

      -active discord for getting games going and learning.

      -Community made maps with more and more being made so its never boring.

      -If you want a map, make it! It really isnt very hard and can be super fun!

      -Easy to get going and play, but has a high skill cap so a lot of fun to learn
      mechanics and tactics!

      -Fast paced, one hit one kill gameplay (my opinion these are the kind of games
      i like).

      -many more


      The cons

      -Small player base but is growing.

      -not much else honestly.


      Like i said earlier the devs are constantly taking community feedback and informing
      the community through discord of changes and updates (https://discord.gg/FYuBpu).
      Started playing early development around October 2019 i believe and have had
      fun watching it grow. Haven''t been able to play much because of school but
      still recommend it when people ask for VR shooters!'
