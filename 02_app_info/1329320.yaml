    review: I find this game very frustrating as the loading is slow and the controls
      choppy.  This is not a point and click game.  It is a WASD game.  I have gotten
      to the 5th level and am about to abort continuing this game.  My blood pressure
      can't take it.  This game may be good for younger adults with good hand coordination.  I
      am older and enjoy point and click.  I do enjoy puzzles, but, not puzzles like
      the ones in the 7 doors.  I got this game on sale so I am not to disappointed
      as opposed paying full price.  This game has good graphics  and is short.  I
      had to play with the lowest graphic level as loading was unbearable long. I
      have a AMD A10-7800 with RAM 12 GB.
