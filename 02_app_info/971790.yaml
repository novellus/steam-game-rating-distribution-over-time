      \ /><br><br><i><strong>Darkness Among Us</strong></i> is a brand-new Chapter\
      \ for Dead by Daylight, which includes a new Killer, a Survivor and a Map. Purchasing\
      \ the Darkness Among Us DLC will unlock its new Killer, new Survivor, and an\
      \ exclusive item for the new survivor.<br><br>The everyday contains many hazards.\
      \ But the comforts of routine shroud the unfathomable risks of a threat so intimate,\
      \ so familiar, that it can only be seen in hindsight. A disturbing, violent\
      \ force could be raging within the people closest to you. Darkness is among\
      \ us, every day.<br><br>The raw cravings and impulses of adolescence are powerful.\
      \ The desire to belong can be just as unbelievably strong. When three teens\
      \ get involved with an impulsive mastermind, they discover an addictive kind\
      \ of freedom. Together, they spiral out of control and become the wrong kind\
      \ of crowd, The Legion, leaving no rule unbroken. The Darkness Among Us chapter\
      \ includes Frank and Julie as playable killers.  <br><br>Jeff Johansen was invited\
      \ to take a trip down memory lane when his past caught up with him. He returned\
      \ to his hometown, ready to face everything he had been forced to leave behind.\
      \ But the familiar isn\u2019t always safe, and it\u2019s never too late to be\
      \ in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/971790/extras/Darkness_Killer_header.png?t=1585947985\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> The Legion</h2>Frank\u2019s future was as bleak as\
      \ his childhood was miserable. To break free from his boring, aimless life in\
      \ Ormond, Frank manipulated a group of friends and led them to break every rule.\
      \ The Legion is a group of agile Killers able to catch Survivors off-guard with\
      \ their power, Feral Frenzy. The <i>Darkness Among Us</i> chapter includes Frank\
      \ and Julie as playable killers. <br><br><br><strong>The Legion\u2019s Power:\
      \ Feral Frenzy</strong><br><br>Violent impulses are within us and building incrementally,\
      \ for some, to a tipping point. They were a plain group of friends until they\
      \ met Frank, who turned them into a Legion. Now they draw power from the thrilling\
      \ insane freedom of not abiding by any rule but their own. <br><br>The Legion\
      \ use their power, Feral Frenzy, to hunt down their victim. When activating\
      \ Feral Frenzy, The Legion enter a deadly rage allowing them to sprint and vault\
      \ over pallets at the cost of lowered senses.<br><br>- In Feral Frenzy, hitting\
      \ a Survivor afflicts them with the Deep Wound status effect which slowly but\
      \ surely bleeds them dry if they don\u2019t mend.<br><br>- Hitting a Survivor\
      \ while in Feral Frenzy replenishes The Legion\u2019s entire power gauge, and\
      \ triggers Killer Instinct, an ability that helps locate other Survivors nearby.\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Artist with a Heart of Gold</h2><br>Born and raised\
      \ in Ormond, Alberta, Jeff Johansen grew up as a quiet, only child with an aversion\
      \ for large crowds. During high school, his anxious temper was mislabelled as\
      \ shyness, which he covered up with a tough, stoic persona that intimidated\
      \ bullies and teachers alike. <br>At home, he collected heavy metal vinyl albums.\
      \ The evocative symbolism on the covers inspired him to make art of his own,\
      \ which helped him cope with his parents\u2019 constant fighting. <br>After\
      \ his parents\u2019 divorce, he was forced to move with his mother to Winkler,\
      \ Manitoba, miles away from his hometown\u2014and his dad. In Winkler, Jeff\
      \ was more isolated than ever, except for art and music. His solace came shortly\
      \ after graduating high school when he started working at a local bar with live\
      \ music. He found a roadie gig shortly after and left Winkler for good. <br>After\
      \ an incident at a concert, he reoriented himself and started designing labels\
      \ for microbreweries. He led a quiet, simple life brewing beer, designing tattoos,\
      \ and making art for bands he liked. <br>All until one morning, when he got\
      \ a phone call from Ormond saying that his father had passed, leaving a few\
      \ things to sort out. Jeff returned to the home he left behind, but he should\
      \ have never looked back.  <br>Jeff\u2019s personal perks, Breakdown, Aftercare,\
      \ and Distortion, allow him to break hooks, cooperate with other Survivors,\
      \ and conceal his aura from The Killer.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/971790/extras/Darkness_Survivor_Perks_header.png?t=1585947985\"\

      \ Survivors. Existing links will not be replaced until they are removed. If\
      \ you are hooked by The Killer, all your existing links with other Survivors\
      \ are removed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Distortion</h2>You start the Trial with 3\
      \ tokens. When your aura would be shown to the killer, the perk activates and\
      \ a token is consumed. For a limited time, while the perk is activated, your\

      \ includes an exclusive item: Jeff\u2019s In the Shadow of Death shirt, only\
      \ available as part of the DLC. <br>Please note that this item cannot be purchased\

      \ /><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Map: Mount Ormond Resort</h2></strong><br><br>Welcome\
      \ to Ormond, Alberta. Population: six thousand ninety-three. Surrounded by an\
      \ impressive mountain range, Ormond\u2019s ski slopes showed promise for a lucrative\
      \ coal mining venture. The environmentally controversial nature of the project,\
      \ however, brought the enterprise to an abrupt stop, which left deep scars on\
      \ Ormond\u2019s landscape and population. The hollowed summit of Mount Ormond\
      \ now looms over desolate patches of dead trees, a soulful, deforested graveyard\
      \ where gangs and teenagers go looking for trouble. Some people say that the\
      \ mountain hides a darkness, a bottomless hole from where no one can return.\
      \ The abandoned ski facilities still remind the inhabitants of a past that never\
      \ was. It is a place of broken promises and devastated nature. The stale air\
      \ worsens during winter, when the rough winds drape a heavy blanket of isolation\
      \ over the bleak landscape.<br><i> \u201CThe town will leave you with a deep\
      \ sense of peace. Yet, few ever return.\u201D </i>"

      notes: 'Dead by Daylight is an action-horror game in which players engage in
        multiplayer matches as either a killer or one of four survivors. Survivors
        emit splashes of blood when attacked and leave pools of blood on the ground
        when injured. As the killer, players must find the survivors, from a first-person
        perspective, before they escape each level. Killers can use various weapons
        (e.g., chainsaws, cattle hammers, bone saws) and/or hang survivors on meat
        hooks to kill them. Killers can also perform various finishing attacks (e.g.,
        throat ripping, disemboweling, chainsaw impalement) to kill wounded survivors;
        in rare instances, red chunks of flesh are depicted during death animations. '
