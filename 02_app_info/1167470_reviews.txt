Honestly, I would have enjoyed the story if the plot synopsis had been even a slight bit accurate. \"Fighting circuit in a video game-esque world\" would have been enough on its own; but you tried to sell it as some epic, dark-action type story - which it plainly isn't. It feels more like what a teenager thinks is an underground fight club adventure.\n\nHell, even if it turned out to be a parody, I still would've enjoyed it if the stats system wasn't a clunky mess with no clear objective on how exactly to build it or use it. Tried to build an all-muscle and endurance character. Lost every match. Tried a charmer and an intellectual; lost most every match. Tried mixing different stats; lost most every match. What am I doing here, exactly?\n\nIn short; cool concept, funny jokes/self-parody, but terrible execution.","timestamp_created":1588873929,"timestamp_updated":1588873929,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56619715690612793","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4koSR+PECfZSfhgI="}
