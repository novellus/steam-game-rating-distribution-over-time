    review: "Okay, I'm gonna do something I don't normally do, and write a review\
      \ before playing this game to its conclusion. I just can't help myself, I feel\
      \ inspired. Or, in Motte-speak: \"Help myself I can't, I feel inspire.\"\n\n\
      \   The first problem with this game is the apparent lack of anyone on the design\
      \ team who can speak English. This I don't mind, but surely someone in their\
      \ broader social circle could have offered to do a quick proof-read of the game\
      \ before releasing it commercially to the world at large?  \n\n   Hell, they\
      \ could've asked the average six year-old on the internet. Pretty sure THEY\
      \ would've worked out by now that \"Maids are fight each other but suddenly\
      \ stopped and tremble in the presence of Sarah\" isn't a proper sentence. You\
      \ do get used to it, though; we've all seen the Star Wars films, after all.\
      \ It's just a shame that Yoda-speak isn't exactly conducive to maintaining a\
      \ mood of spooky unease. But this is hardly the game's biggest impediment to\
      \ greatness.\n\n   The 2D, top-down perspective in a horror game is a brilliant\
      \ idea. And when this game gets dark, and the flashlight comes out, it's definitely\
      \ some eerie shit. But in broad daylight the character animations look, well,\
      \ about as good as those in Hotline Miami.  \n\n   The only thing is, Hotline\
      \ Miami was an incredibly fast-paced, splatter-happy ode to visual crudeness\
      \ and uber-difficulty which seemed to know precisely what it was trying to achieve.\
      \ Which WASN'T \"scaring\" you...which, granted, this game still does surprisingly\
      \ well at times, mostly on account of the aforementioned flashlight effect and\
      \ the frankly awesome soundtrack. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that the\
      \ super-disturbing soundtrack pretty much SAVES this game at times.\n\n   What\
      \ about the gameplay, you ask? Well, it's nice enough, especially if you're\
      \ a fan of action-adventure orientated \"survival horror\" games of the Silent\
      \ Hill / Resident Evil ilk, as I surely am. But there's a LOT of back-tracking,\
      \ and after a while you get good enough at simply AVOIDING the endlessly-respawning\
      \ nasties, and the combat is mostly a case of finding one good, accurate spot\
      \ to stand and mashing the mouse buttons.\n\n    I even managed to kill the\
      \ first Boss with a baseball bat, 'cause I haven't yet managed to pick up a\
      \ gun despite all the bullets I'm now carrying. I mean, I keep killing bad guys\
      \ carrying guns which they shoot at me, but for some reason my character seems\
      \ uninterested in picking any of these pistols up. I assume I haven't missed\
      \ an all-important gun placement elsewhere, but I'm not even sure it matters\
      \ if I have, since I can apparently kick Boss butt well enough with a melee\
      \ weapon. \n\n   Just in case it's sounding like I'm not digging this game,\
      \ let me assure you that I actually am. And I'm assuming it's not gonna be the\
      \ longest game in history, so I probably WILL see it through to its conclusion.\
      \ \n\n   What am I gonna find there? Well, probably nothing too great story-wise,\
      \ 'cause despite some early promise the story seems to be getting sillier by\
      \ the hour. But it's got mood aplenty, despite the aforementioned problems,\
      \ and the moth-y motifs and mysterious island setting certainly make for good\
      \ horror fodder. \n\n   I think it might be overly generous to say that this\
      \ gets three-quarters of the way to its potential, but let's be nice and say\
      \ it gets two-thirds of the way. Hence the number below, slightly rounded up\
      \ in the interests of encouraging future product from these admittedly promising\
      \ designers. \n\n   Happy bug-swatting.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10."
