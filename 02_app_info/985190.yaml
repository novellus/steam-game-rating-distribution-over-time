    review: 'The entire franchise features awesome music.

      Johannes Aikio did a really good job for sure.

      He really put a soul into those lovely games.

      And the third game has the best soundtrack.

      I truly enjoyed the music of this great game.

      Sure, it''s a broken game, but I don''t mind it.

      I enjoyed the game and I did like the music.

      Therefore: Here''s a positive review from me.'
