I will leave glitches and bugs out of this review as it is early access, and believe me that's being generous since there are ample!\n\nStory: There is none, no lore, no letters / tapes / npc's to talk to to gain any backstory or relevance to a plot. No tutorial, no commentary, not even a short cutscene, NOTHING. I guess we just pretend there is an epidemic.\n\nGameplay: Shockingly bad! Glitches and bugs aside, you are places in a tiny map where you can drive a truck and sometimes find cars with spare parts. You can put planks of wood and metal rods in the back of your truck, offload your truck at a small outpost and that is it! There is no crafting, no progression, no end game, and nothing else to do. I have collected every resource in the game and offloaded it, and nothing happens. \n\nGraphics: Uglier than a spade fetus.\n\nReplayability: None whatsoever, seriously there are far better games out there for less.\n\nAccuracy to the developers description: The developers said this game is \"fully playable\" this is a straight up lie since you cannot end the game, progress, build anything, craft upgrades, change vehicles, or anything worth your time. Simply pick up wood and rods, put them in your truck, and offload them.\n\nValue for money: Terrible, you should not buy this ever.\n\nStill don't believe me? Go over to my Youtube channel Jack Dawleaf, or just type into the search bar of Youtube Transit - Do not play this game! and you can see gameplay for yourself.\n\n0/10 \n\nThis was either made to lure in people for a quick cash grab, or the developer has released the early access of this far too soon. Either way I can't believe they have the audacity to charge money for this. It's not even suitable for demonstration purposes. I would be ashamed to release this in its current state if this were my product, let alone ask for money.\n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1590963479,"timestamp_updated":1590963479,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.617682933807373047","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4nYS0tvICfbS9iwI="}
