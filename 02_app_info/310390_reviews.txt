This game is one of my favorites in a row with Eador Genesis, Heroes III and Civilization V.\n\nAt a scratch: Game is turn-based hex strategy sandbox. You are playing as a chief of general staff. You can decide what basic units to research and produce, how to combine those units into divisions. It is also you, who leads these divisions into the battle. Sounds like more or less standard, right?\n\nLooking like one of many this game feels special. I mean not special features and abilities or special mechanics. Playing experience does have a unique flavour, because first of all, this game de facto introduces tactics, operational and strategy level of warfare.\n\nTactics means that different landscapes are good to attack and defend, every unit is good against some others and is obsolete for different ones, division composition really matters (how many infantry should you place into tank division? Does it matter, are you attacking through plains, paddies or forest?)\n\nOperational level includes division cooperation. Those good in attack should attack, and those good in defense should cover them. Versitiles will be average on both. Flack should cover land formations, fighters should follow bombers for protection. You definitely will need reserves, or will eventually run off \"ready to fight\" divisions. Standard stuff, but it has a big depth here.\n\nAnd the best of it - strategic level - includes deep breakthroughs, encirclement operations, shore landings, bombing to the ground enemies production sites. \n\nSome core mechanics, you should know: unit counters and division composition, readiness, logistics. First is similar to any strategy game. Readiness concept is more or less standard  too. It means that consecutive battles will drop your division readiness and it would be weaker in combat to some (in this game MUCH weaker) degree. These two mechanics define tactics and operational level gameplay. \n\nThe last but not least is logistics mechanics: all your units in all divisions need supply from head quarters. You need to produce and distribute supply, If there is no supply, divisions will suffer readiness drop. Sounds easy, but has dramatic consequences. If your army was cut off from \"motherland\" you are in trouble. One or two turns, and ALL of encirclement units will lose 30% of their combat potential each turn down to only 10%. In no other game saw the same: you may struggle in tactics, take losses, even lose some ground, but after one successful strategy cut off all goes upside down and the whole enemy front disappears like a rabbit in a hat.\n\nThe game has deep and complex mechanics, so your learning curve would be long and sluggish. At some degree the game is intuitive (a miracle for such a deep and logical wargame). Tanks are good against infantry, but suffer from anti-tank guns. Hills and forests provide good entenchement, artillery barrage before an attack is a good idea etc/ But you will need a lot of time to master the game and to combine these simple principles into your indomitable blitzkrieg.  \n\nNow for the more obvious contra's. Game is somewhat ugly. Only 2D, schematic drawings, crude buttons. I don't care all about that in such a game, but have to admit that. The AI is also not good (still. there are a lot of games with much worse). It is... \"artificial idiot\" with ridiculous bonuses on top of it. Good player still overcomes him with ease (if not on a plain with a lot of resources, where AI simply overproduces beyond any reasonable level). In PBEM game man-with-man the game will shine at best.\n\nSo, if you like strategy sandbox with deep mechanics and good replayability or do have a friend, with whom you are ready to play a pbem strategy game, this game is for you definitely. If you seek for more or less modern graphics, competitive AI and historical accuracy, this game may disappoint you. ","timestamp_created":1608476618,"timestamp_updated":1608476642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrbmrwPYCcevcuwI="}
