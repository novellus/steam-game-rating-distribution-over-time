      evil she unleashed three years ago.<br>Now, nearing the end of her quest, she
      arrives in the villages just outside the fortress, where monsters ravage, young
      women are being raped and men are being slaughtered. Armed with her trusted
      Shield Blade, Mirenia is so close of undoing the mistakes of her past. Will
