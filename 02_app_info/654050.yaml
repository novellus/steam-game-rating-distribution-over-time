    review: "Jydge, Jyry, Execytion...  Your all in one, in this cyberpunk shooter.\
      \  \n\nJydge is an amazing game.  It is one of my favorites.  You play as the\
      \ Jydge, a cyborg swat officer designed to handle any situation through the\
      \ use of cybernetic enhancements and your trusty \"Gavel\".  You can choose\
      \ from an array of modifications for the Jydge, and multiple firemodes, specials,\
      \ and mods for the Gavel.  Strategically choose these to complete the objectives\
      \ of the mission.  The price of failure is death.\n\nThere are four difficulties.\
      \  Normal, Hard, Grim, and Nightmare.  Each difficulty not only has harder bad\
      \ guys, it has slightly different objectives, making it not only a greater challenge,\
      \ but also fresh game play. \n\nThe game fits nicely into the company's lore\
      \ for their games.  The graphics are decent, but the soundtrack is great.  Lots\
      \ of synth punk.  \n \nOverall, Jydge is one of the best games I have played.\
      \  Always a challenge, always fun. Shout out to ErikaUnlimited for the wonderful\
      \ guide she made. If you need help with any of the achievements her guide is\
      \ the place to go. Give it a thumbs up.\n\nHave fun, and good luck.  You'll\
      \ need it.\n\nZattmann"
