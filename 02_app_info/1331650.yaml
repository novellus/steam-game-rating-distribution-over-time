    review: 'This is a game that is very heavily inspired by the mobile game "Dungeon
      Raid" (my personal favorite of all time tbh, rip 32-bit support), so if you
      know what I''m talking about you already know if you''ll like the game or not.


      For complete newcomers (aka most of you), the game has a simple premise: match
      tiles and collect loot/do damage. It isn''t the Bejeweled type of matching however;
      you draw a line between similar types of tiles and collect every tile the line
      goes through. You can continue the line in any direction as long as there''s
      another tile that can be matched with it. It''s not a very "puzzle-y" type of
      match 3, but a strangely compelling type. In terms of what your brain has to
      do, you can''t completely zone out, but you can play effectively while paying
      attention to a movie or something on the side. Of course, you can focus entirely
      on the game as well, and that can lead to clever plays that make/break the run.


      The game has a roguelike structure, where you level up throughout a short run,
      and get permanent unlocks that show up in other runs. I personally think the
      acquisition of Tentacles (the main currency for unlocking new things) is on
      the slow side, but the unlockables aren''t necessary to have a successful run
      so I don''t mind it as much. My biggest gripe has to do with the unlockables
      that are gained through treasure chests, as they''re random and sometimes you
      won''t get what you need until much later on. As an example, the last two classes
      were locked for me due to requiring you to get certain items unlocked from the
      chests, but those two classes were the last things I unlocked due to the random
      order. Again, you don''t really need the unlockables, and arguably the starting
      gear is the strongest apart from one or two pieces, but variety really helps
      in a game like this.


      As for cons, this game has very similar cons to its source inspiration. Truly
      "insane" runs require specific setups, and you won''t get anywhere near them
      if you try to diverge due to some glaring (at least from what I can tell) balance
      issues. Notably, the active skill Treasure Hunter and passives that accelerate
      gold/armor/exp gain are the main culprits. Regardless of what build you try
      to go for, you *need* to accelerate the speed at which you level up you and
      your gear if you want to have any chance of keeping up with the enemies (especially
      if you go for hard mode at every option). And Treasure Hunter is almost a necessity
      as you can easily double or triple your gold gain throughout a run, and gold
      can be used to get all 3 of the juicy passives. To make matters worse, some
      of the permanent unlockables *also* boost gold gain, meaning that gold is the
      de facto resource to funnel as much as possible. Also, apart from some things
      being OP, some things are very UP as well. For one, many active skills simply
      pale in comparison to alternatives; usually the skills that do direct damage
      and skills that are overly situational. For upgrades, some are simply worse
      than others, either because of weak scaling or simply being inferior; sneak
      attack vs. base damage is a good example of this, as both are almost always
      offered at the same values and sneak attack only helps you for one turn vs.
      base damage''s continuous value. You can argue that you need "weak" options
      to dilute the item/skill pool, but I''d rather buff the enemy''s overall strength
      and make every option viable. Some of the enemies are clearly stronger than
      others as well, but I assume that this is intentional to an extent; the only
      suggestion I have on this point is making enemies that have stat-related abilities
      scale more effectively by making the abilities affect stats as a percent instead
      of a static +1, as when you end up fighting enemies that have double/triple
      digit stats, they basically have no ability.


      That being said, balance issues aside, the gameplay loop is *great*. Just like
      the game that inspired this, it''s a game you can sit down and play for hours
      just because it''s relatively simple but has room for creativity, and the constant
      upgrading/fighting/looting/matching feels great. Additionally, the presentation
      makes the game feel better to play too, as everything you do has a nice visual/audio
      effect associated with it that breaks up the otherwise bland (in a good way)
      screen. You can just get into a state of flow with how clean everything looks
      and feels. Also, the Steam version of this game has cross-save support with
      the mobile version, so you can take this game on the go where its casual but
      deep nature truly shines. Games tend to be fairly short (maybe 5-30 minutes
      or so?) although they can go on for a long time if you have an insane run (my
      longest is about 3 hours long!), but regardless, the game has a save and quit
      option so you''re never going to lose a run because of time constraints.


      TL;DR look into the free (with ads) mobile version of this game and/or Dungeon
      Raid to get an idea of how the game works, and if you can get past a relatively
      slow progression system and the preview you got seemed to appeal to you, you''ll
      enjoy the (great) gameplay loop that''s very easy to learn and has a decently
      high skill ceiling, albeit a few balance issues that I''m sure will be ironed
      out.'
