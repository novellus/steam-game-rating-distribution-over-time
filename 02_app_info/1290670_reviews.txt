The effects when pieces of the environment explode or chunks of stonework come crashing down causing clouds of dust are simply stunning! In fact, everything about the game is visually stunning.\n\nI've never played a platform game before in which the enemies can pursue the player up and down ladders. That's quite novel. The levels are somewhat like a puzzle in that you have to destroy the right bits in order to reach places and make the right slabs of stone fall in the right places to form stepping stone through the route. You can try a different route on the same level. Learn by your mistakes.\n\nThe music is really good and the sound effects are good. Excellent attention to detail.\n\nI have only played for a short while but enjoying every intense, blood-spattered minute of gloriously joyous destructive fun. I just don't want it to end!","timestamp_created":1598476465,"timestamp_updated":1598476465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tuanlvQCd6b6nQI="}
