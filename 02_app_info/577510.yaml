    short_description: The barrier is shattered, and Ten Tails appears! With unfathomable
      power in its attack, it sends shock waves through the air! Kurama takes the
      lead and tries to go on the offensive, but is helpless against Ten Tails' immense
      strength. Soon both Kurama and Gyuki exhaust their chakra and fade away.
