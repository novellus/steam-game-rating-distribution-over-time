    review: "Honestly, the only reason I bought Season 4 was for just one pinball\
      \ table.\n\nI'm not the biggest fan of pinball, but when someone introduced\
      \ me to (an actual) Addams Family Pinball table, I was instantly hooked.  To\
      \ this day, I'm always on the lookout for a decent Addams Family Pinball table\
      \ when I'm traveling to different cities, pizza joints, and arcades.\n\nPros:\n\
      -REALLY fun to play with the voices, effects, and variety.\n-This is the TOP\
      \ selling pinball table of ALL TIME, with over 20,000 sold!\n-Actual real voices\
      \ of the late Ra\xFAl Juli\xE1 and Anjelica Huston!\n-Two extra flippers that\
      \ provide extra skill shot challenges.\n-Starting skill shot is actually repeatable\
      \ once you figure out the pullback amount needed.\n\nCons:\n-No \"saved ball\"\
      \ if you lose your ball too fast.  But this feature was introduced in later\
      \ years (with newer table designs).\n-\"The Power\" (spinning magnets) under\
      \ the table is really aggravating.  But there is a way to get around it if you're\
      \ patient.\n-Inversing the key controls for table bumps only seems to work on\
      \ the horizontal axis.\n\nTips:\nIf you're playing on your TV or big screen,\
      \ ensure that the TV is set on \"Game Mode\".  This will reduce the screen lag\
      \ significantly.\n\nThis Season 4 Pro Pack was available for less than ten dollars\
      \ during the Summer 2017 sale... awesome deal!\n"
