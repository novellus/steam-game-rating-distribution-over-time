    about_the_game: "In this simulation it's all about global conflicts. Try to stay\
      \ alive and play enemy countries against each other. Decide the right politics\
      \ at the right time and your country will prevail.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The\
      \ world descends into World War III. This is your time to lead the Illuminati\
      \ lodge to world domination. Select a country and influence its politics. Make\
      \ it the only survivor and your lodge will prevail!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      Select one of more than 50 actual countries with different attributes like infrastructure,\
      \ population, military force or stability and make it the dominant force in\
      \ the world. Improve relations, blackmail other leaders, nuke enemy countries\
      \ or try to fight terrorism.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFive different scenarios:<br\
      \ />\r\n-World War Zombie: Survive the war AND the zombies. Stop them from spreading\
      \ or infect other countries to ensure their downfall!<br />\r\n-Kim Jong's Nuclear\
      \ Mayhem: North Korea actually IS the superpower it always claimed. Find allies\
      \ in the world and prepare for the ultimate battle!<br />\r\n-Conquer the World:\
      \ Demonstrate your military superiority by conquering every country of the world.\
      \ But beware - the enemy empire has plans of its own.<br />\r\n-My Own Country:\
      \ Create your own country from scratch and show the World that you still dominate!<br\
      \ />\r\n-The Almighty Sandbox: Play with unlimited resources and change your\
      \ country while playing to experiment with the simulation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\n**Disclaimer**<br />\r\nThe game doesn't accurately  represent the\
      \ real world. I took some creative freedom to change the geography and values\
      \ of some countries to improve the simulation, gameplay und user interface."
