Only the Dream-engine gets loaded in but the so called SASL (plugin thingy to get things working for this airplane) isn't there when I check in the plugin menu. End result is the airplane is flyable BUT the speedometer isn't working, you can't click any of the switches and the custom menus for this airplane just aren't there (seen them on the net, they include opening of cargo doors and such). Even checked on the SASL in the folder files and it's there alright...but it won't load.\n\nANOTHER THING: Had the exact same problem with two Carenado aircraft. In their case I had to unzip two zipfiles and arrange the files myself...THEN their plugins loaded. But no such zipfile for the DHC-2. What to do?!\n\nMy final verdict: This is not a working airplane and there's no way right now to fix by myself.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE!!!\nRead somewhere else about the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010  x64 Redistributable Setup - so I downloaded it, installed it...NOW EVERYTHING WORKS!!!\nAnd this airplane is AWESOME!","timestamp_created":1455634376,"timestamp_updated":1455635736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519572913646697998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3NSp9dICeOWJUQ=="}
