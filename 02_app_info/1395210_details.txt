SOLAS’ glyphs each have a unique shape and profile, and there are customisable contrast settings, making it accessible to colour-blind players.<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1395210\/extras\/image.png?t=1604942388\" \/>","about_the_game":"At its heart, SOLAS is a beam deflection game.
