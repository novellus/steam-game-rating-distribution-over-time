This game has a few different people that you have to solve their problems so their souls can move onto the other side. The voicing of the characters is excellently done to suit each one.  Brilliant game play (even though I got lost a few times). There is a strategy guide that you can use if you want to (I did because I got lost). Great game and well worth the money.","timestamp_created":1607037526,"timestamp_updated":1607037526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/9O5lfYCdPyNtwI="}
