    review: "LOVE THIS GAME :)\n\nI heard about this game from youtuber 8BitRyan a\
      \ long time ago. I finally found and tried this game\nIt is such a awesome FNAF\
      \ like game. ITS NOT like FNAF at the same time, very unique and scary. I am\
      \ not too into horror games but I love this one. \nMy two complaints:\nHopefully\
      \ in the future there can be a sensitivity setting. For me the sensitivity started\
      \ extremely high. I had to lower my DPI to compensate (no worries though)\n\
      Also I feel that the nights are a little bit too long. But either way awesome\
      \ game"
