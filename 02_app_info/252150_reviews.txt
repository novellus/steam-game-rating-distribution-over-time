Grimm is crude & rude and not for little kids, so Momma's don't put your kids in front of the CPU for some GRIMM Entertainment until you've screened it yourself - he's bloody fearsome sometimes and just plain hilarious and nasty the rest of the time!  This is a side reel type game and hand drawn, based on the GRIMM Story Books but put into video game style.  The tasks aren't as easy as they look. I used the mouse/keyboard.  If they allow a controller now that would be easier. Sometimes it may seem abit repetitive at times but just wait a tic and that will change!  Have a good time, I did for over 300 hours! â™¥ Mom","timestamp_created":1607163943,"timestamp_updated":1607163943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hfObmfYCede7twI="}
