    review: "It's a good DLC, the campaign adds a different perspective of the game\
      \ compared to the other ones.\n-Adds 3 dinosaurs to the collection and a interesting\
      \ mechanic based on the food for hervibores, each one with his preferences of\
      \ plants.\n\nJust gonna add 2 tips: \n-save in differents save slots, because\
      \ if you screw it, you will need to play it all caimpaign from the start.\n\
      -if you play slow... i just gonna say \"save the dinosaurs with more lifespawn\"\
      \ but dont panic, is not that hard, since the lifespawn reset to 0 when you\
      \ transport them to the other island."
