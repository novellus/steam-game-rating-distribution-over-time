All other games work flawlessly so can't imagine it's a sound card issue. I would like to recommend game but until I get feedback and a fix from developers I'll say be very weary of purchasing this game. I'll keep you posted if I ever hear anything back.","timestamp_created":1420172862,"timestamp_updated":1594324635,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41+nJmvMCfMTGNA=="}
