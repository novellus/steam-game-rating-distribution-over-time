      \ /><br>Developed by Slovenian gunsmiths, the Virant is the go-to rifle for\
      \ varmint control and target shooting. The .22LR\u2019s low recoil and superb\
      \ design makes this rifle a perfect starting point for people learning the basics\
      \ of shooting.<br><br><strong>Small Game Hunting: </strong><br>In addition to\
      \ it\u2019s low recoil, this semi-automatic rifle allows you to fire multiple\
      \ small rounds, making it a great choice for rabbit hunting and target practice.\
      \ Perfect for Jackrabbits and other small game, the Virant is not used to hunt\
      \ larger animals. <br><br><strong>Sight Compatibility:</strong><br><img src=\"\

      \ /><br>By default you can use the Virant\u2019s iron sight: However, for improved\
      \ aiming at a distance this rifle supports multiple scope attachments: Red Dot\
      \ Sight, 1-4x24mm Rifle Scope, 4-8x42mm Rifle Scope, and 8-16x50mm Rifle Scope.<br><br><strong>Klasika\

      \ /><br>With 165 foot-pounds of draw weight, this precision-crafted crossbow\
      \ sports enough power to take down even the largest game animals. With a beautiful\
      \ woven carbon fiber barrel, a built-in rope-cocking device, and a 4-arrow quiver,\
      \ the Crosspoint CB-165 is ideal for short-range hunting.<br><br><strong>Hawken\

      \ /><br>This premium scope is designed for crossbows shooting 300 feet per second\
      \ or faster. With three duplex crosshairs and variable zoom settings up to 5x,\
      \ this is the perfect crossbow scope for any situation.<br><br><strong>Range\
      \ and Power:</strong><br>The Crosspoint CB-165 Crossbow is more powerful and\
      \ offers greater range than any other bow currently in the store. However, as\
      \ with everything in hunting, it\u2019s a trade-off. This crossbow is rather\
      \ large and heavy, requiring significant space in your backpack. Additionally,\
      \ reloading the crossbow is slower than most other weapons so make sure you\
      \ make each shot count!<br><br><strong>Classic, Arctic, Dark Star &amp; Warden:\

      \ src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/766870/extras/recurve_model.png?t=1591969060\"\
      \ /><br>In Chinese mythology, when 10 suns rose from Earth and turned the world\
      \ into a barren wasteland, the archer Houy shot down 9 of the 10 suns, leaving\
      \ only the last one. This bow takes its name from that myth. Based on the designs\
      \ of traditional Chinese Qing recurve bows, the Houyi Recurve Bow has ample\
      \ penetration power and can take down medium game at short ranges.<br><br><strong>Spook\
      \ fewer animals in your surroundings:</strong><br>This recurve bow gives you\
      \ an unparalleled advantage compared to rifles, handguns, shotguns or even crossbows.\
      \ When taking a shot, the longbow is much quieter and will spook a smaller number\
      \ of animals within a limited radius. But as always, this  is a trade-off; although\
      \ the longbow is currently the quietest weapon in the game, it offers limited\
      \ range compared to many other weapons. <br><br><strong>Hidden Dragon, Moonlight,\
