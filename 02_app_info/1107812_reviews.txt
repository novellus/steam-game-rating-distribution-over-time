I was worried they'd get my state wrong, or it would be riddled with bugs (and we ALL know what I'm talking about), or something along those lines.\n\nI have to say, I ran one mission (KC - Topeka) and almost immediately declared this one of my favorites, if not my absolute favorite DLC for this game. I probably took a million screenshots. The scenery was intricately detailed; it FELT like Kansas (which I know is a little boring for most, but Kansas has a very simple, farm-land beauty that you have to live around to appreciate). The slow, powerful build-up of speed, the screech of the brakes, the scream of the horn (by the way, the sounds in this DLC are just fantastic)... From the mission I ran, I already know I'm going to love the others possibly more than any other DLC I've purchased. I feel like they did my state justice and did it beautifully.\n\nNaturally, since it's Train Simulator, there are bugs. Can't lie. I get docked points for \"speeding\" when I am CLEARLY not speeding, etc... You know the drill. I pretty much expect it on most maps at this point... As always, I know I'll probably have to run each mission a couple (or few) times so I can work around the bugs that pop up. But I guess that's life. But you know, I won't mind running these missions a few times.. I can genuinely say the trains in this one are among my absolute favorite (and that even includes that high-speed ICE train in... oh, what was it, Germany I think?)\n\nOk, a little bit wordy, I know.. But this DLC deserves it. I normally wait for DLC's to go on sale for $10-$15.. I got this one on sale for $25... if I had to do it again, would I? Oh, in a heartbeat. To be honest I might be tempted to pay full price.\n\nVerdict: If you're looking for bug-free, look elsewhere. (Heck, if you're looking for bug-free, play another game.) If you like the fast trains, this one probably isn't for you. If you like hills and valleys, nope (it's Kansas, where they calibrate all levels). If you want flat-land, farm-town, towering-grain-elevators, tree-spotted country beauty and stupid-big, ultra-powerful, super-noisy trains carrying dozens upon dozens of ultra-heavy train cars... Well, you better snatch this one up.","timestamp_created":1600629919,"timestamp_updated":1600629919,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40cm+1vQCdJiGowI="}
