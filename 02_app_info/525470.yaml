    review: "I would have to say this DLC is a really good one in my opinion. SGB\
      \ is new if you didn't know and has very little assets to begine with.\nThat\
      \ being said the DLC is a little bundle of relief the assets are of quality\
      \ and worth it becouse you get alot more materials to work with when creating\
      \ your game.\n\nPros- More assets and terrain to work with in your SGB project\
      \ which is a releif\n      Quality assets you can tell they really tolk some\
      \ time and effert into puting the \n      DLC together.\nCons- Only one vehical\
      \ design for the cars the other car models are just painted diffrent\n     \
      \ No 2D graphics for the 8 modern character models.\n      \n"
