It's a great party game and can even get pretty competitive.\n\nThe party feature seems to be broken though. I can only get friends to join my match from a custom game screen not the main screen where it claims to allow parties to be made. From the main screen, trying to join a party results in being stuck in a loading screen forever. Only way to exit that screen is to force quit the game and restart. Once that issue gets resolved, this game will be 100% recommended!","timestamp_created":1606749000,"timestamp_updated":1606749000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlILtjPYCeK7wtQI="}
