      on various missions to the Hubble Space Telescope. Fly the shuttle in a full
      landing simulation based on real physics and flight dynamics. </h2><br>Choose
      your landing site, weather conditions and approach difficulty. Explore the Galaxy
      with 3 remarkable visual experiences and witness a full Shuttle launch from
      the pilot seat. <br><br>568 kilometers above us, the Hubble Space Telescope
      circles the Earth. For almost 30 years, this observatory has helped us explore
      the solar system around us and understand how galaxies and planets form. Now
