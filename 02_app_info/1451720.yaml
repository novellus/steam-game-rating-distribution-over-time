    developer_response: "Thank you for the positive feedback! \nI would just like\
      \ to clarify that it is possible to open all the boxes around a number, if you\
      \ have flagged the correct number of mines around it: click both mouse buttons\
      \ on the number (left + right mouse buttons) and it will work ;)"

    review: This is a good minesweeper game with good levels and a custom level editor.
      The only 2 downsides I see is other minesweepers let you select the number and
      if you flag blocks around it once you select the number it clears the surrounding
      blocks if the flags match the number exposing the unmarked blocks/bombs, this
      one does not. The other being a quick play button that would just generate a
      classic square level with a difficulty option, from what ive seen this can only
      be achieved by going through custom level and changing the amount of bombs and
      cluster. Other than that it is one of the best minesweeper games out there better
      than the most recent microsoft version which is covered in ads.
