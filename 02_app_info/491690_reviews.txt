If you're looking for a rootin' tootin', bullet ricocheting, Indians vs. cowboys in rediculous shoot-outs type of movie, this probably isn't for you. If you like mysteries and a light horror aspect, you'll probably enjoy this. Even though it isn't the best movie I've seen, the acting seems spot-on, and it leaves you thinking after it ends. All things considered, solid movie, but not your typical western.\n\n(P.S. Look at the horse on the right in the second picture.)","timestamp_created":1474007379,"timestamp_updated":1474015693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jNGLmdcCeJ6uYQ=="}
