The third one is an excellent boss. The areas and equipment from this pack are top-notch, though, full of puzzles and mechanical fun. This was originally the first DLC pack for Dark Souls II, and it remains one of my favorite DLC purchases.","timestamp_created":1608932969,"timestamp_updated":1608932969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4opn4zfYCcpqXvQI="}
