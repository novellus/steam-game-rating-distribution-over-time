How can you justify 3$ or 1$ for so little content ?\nConsider tropico 4 as an incomplete / unfinished game, unless you buy the whole pack of dlc. \nIf you can have the Collector's bundle (that include the 11 DLC) for a good price, then take it, this is a good game. If you buy the each item at full price, then you are a moron.","timestamp_created":1609331045,"timestamp_updated":1609331045,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qN7m2fYCfKjhvgI="}
