TBH for me its was much more of a head scratcher than anything else.  It was hard for me to really find and keep up with any real kind of story line, as there seemed to be several all playing out at once, with a steady rush of decisions to make on things that arnt really fully fleshed out enough to know exactly what you are making the decision about, nevermind guess as to what sort of out come any decision will have (in advance of making it that is, everything gets wrapped up in the end, even if you have know idea what you were doing as you played)\nAll in all i tend to like the works of this particular Developer, even if alot of them leave me feeling a bit confused as to WTF i just read ; )  The characters are always interesting, and some are always just Over the Top, bringing a good amount of laughs to be had along with some serious subject matters that get meta'd in.  Also [strike]not sure if this is a first for this Dev or not but[/strike] there is a non binary character to get to know in this story, which caught me off guard cause I thought \"he\" was kinda interesting and spent a good deal of time getting to know them, even after they corrected me about my miss assumption.\nAll in all i'd have to honestly say this is a really bad dating sim, as there is no scene that plays out other than the person you ask out on the date saying yes (or I guess no if you choose someone you didnt get rep up with?), it literally just jumps to the end of the game.  Which honestly was even more disappointing than the usual, jump to a scene somewhere with the whole group in a party setting, with a few unique moments/lines with your \"date\" this dev/publisher usually has in their games.  I was hoping since they were selling this one as an actual Dating Sim, and nothing else, that they would have put some real effort into your chosen relationship with these strange and whacky characters (who are strangely overly deep when you least expect it).  But alas that is not this game.\nSo if your actually looking for a Dating Sim I'd say this is a hard pass, but if you like crazy settings and interesting / bizarre characters that leave you trying to figure out whats going on and whats Being Said, go for it!\nedited 11/02/2020 after speaking with a dev and finding out that the afor mentioned non binary character was not the first one to appear in their works.  Still bonus points imho for continued support and inclusiveness in their games.","timestamp_created":1604223234,"timestamp_updated":1604380083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580989837646484375","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1606686952,"developer_response":"You are right, though, that this was the first time we directly mentioned they were Enby.
