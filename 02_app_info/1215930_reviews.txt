It has no traditional gameplay, no quests, no puzzles. And it's not very long either. It is about experiencing .. small, sometimes intense and surreal scenes. Some are disturbing, others are quiet and relaxing. And that is it. It's different yes, but in a very positive way.","timestamp_created":1583354755,"timestamp_updated":1583355203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42+HU0/ACetWP9gE="}
