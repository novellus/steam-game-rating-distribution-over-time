It's very old school: just one hidden object scene after another, with a few easy puzzles thrown in along the way. However the interface is clean, the HOG scenes were fun and relaxing to complete, and the story is decent. Four hours is the right length for this type of game. I'll give it a mild thumbs up, especially if you can get it cheap during a sale.","timestamp_created":1603431038,"timestamp_updated":1603431038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww//7qfUCfuTGqQI="}
