It's an older VR title so don't expect anything too crazy. I thought sitting in the living room and watching the TV was more interesting than being in the rocket...but that's just me.\n\nThis might not be a bad introduction to VR experience for some people you want to show off your kit to. Maybe better for someone who likes educational/experiential things more than games or cartoons.","timestamp_created":1608353536,"timestamp_updated":1609474266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuYqJ3vYCce6suwI="}
