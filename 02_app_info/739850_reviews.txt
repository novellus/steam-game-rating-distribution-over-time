Over-priced at $1.99, might be worth it for a quarter. \nAnimation is poor, and the main conceit is a a four sided map, which is more irritating than interesting as you constantly have to rotate it to see what the heck is going on. \nStrategic options are minimal, a very simple path, and no pathing. No tactical options, like spells, everything a TD game should have, this one lacks. \n\nGetting my money back.","timestamp_created":1606252924,"timestamp_updated":1606252924,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxtGI/vUCevSnsAI="}
