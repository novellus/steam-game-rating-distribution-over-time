    review: Excellent pack of battlers and a great edition to any japan themed game.
      I was really pleased with the high quality of these monsters and there are  a
      lot of famous Japan favourites from all kinds of wonderful folklore. I'd love
      to see a second pack created if you were going to make an entire game which
      was japan themed. However, for games which use a japan zone this is ideal. There
      are plenty of classic boss monsters to be used as well as great designs for
      your normal encounters. With a bit of knowledge of japan folklore you can create
      some amazing boss fights from a great selection of well known yokai from Japan.
      Really love this set and I highly recommend it.
