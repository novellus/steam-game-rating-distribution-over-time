The game is still in early access, so i didn't really expect anything that's perfect. But after playing for a couple of hours, this game is pretty good. The developer fixes the bugs you report mostly within 24 hours after submitting, and gladly accepts new feature requests. The game still has some flaws, like for example, you don't actually have to go to the jobs, you just click on a car and fastforward, but that will hopefully be better in the future, because as i said, it's in early access. I'm mostly waiting for Multiplayer/co-op, since the developer said that that will probably be a feature in the future. I must say the driving physics are a bit wobbly, so there might be room for improvement on that side.\n\n\nEdit: Game has not been updated for almost 2 years, so consider it abandoned. Game is currently full of bugs and hardly functions. Developer has promised for over 2 years that the game will be updated which hasn't happened, he says he is currently reworking the entire game, he promises a release date and when that date eventually comes we don't hear anything from him.\nAll in all, good game.\n\n2/10","timestamp_created":1546435256,"timestamp_updated":1598514045,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4hJS3l/QCeLqhtwE="}
