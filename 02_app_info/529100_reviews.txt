Really needs a good proofreading. I commented in the bug thread in the discussions long ago with some appropriate fixes, and it doesn't seem like they were implemented so not sure what the blocker is. If the game got a solid spellcheck, I don't think I'd have any other complaints. Really enjoying the story itself so far.","timestamp_created":1609803474,"timestamp_updated":1609803729,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hvHx5/YCedfFwAI="}
