    review: "$ENTO - SNIPER REVIEW\n\nDelta Force: Black Hawk Down\n\n8/10\n\nDelta\
      \ Force: Black Hawk Down has some of the best single player missions for snipers.\
      \ Equally important the sniper rifle load out is very good too.\n\nBlack Hawk\
      \ Down's single player missions for a sniper. There are a total of sixteen missions\
      \ set during the Somalia Civil War of the 1990s. (The game is a homage to the\
      \ film of the same name). At the start of every mission the player will be briefed\
      \ on what the objective is. Missions objectives range from neutralizing the\
      \ terrorist in a town, to assassinating Mohammed Farrah Aidid. For all the missions\
      \ the player can choose a sniper rifle for their primary weapon. Most of the\
      \ single player missions are based on true events, that is what gives this game\
      \ a little more respect. Also there is nothing more satisfying that being a\
      \ Delta Force sniper landing in the L.Z in a Black Hawk helicopter. \n\nBlack\
      \ Hawk Down's sniper rifles, sidearms and other accessories. There are a total\
      \ of five sniper rifles in the game. M24, M21, Barrett M82, PSG-1 and a McMillian\
      \ MCRT (which looks like the M24). The M24 is my favourite, I pretty much played\
      \ all the single player missions with this sniper rifle the first time. My only\
      \ negative critique of the sniper rifle is that all five sniper rifles have\
      \ the same cross hairs. The sniper rifle can be chosen for the primary weapon,\
      \ for the player's secondary weapon, a sidearm is available. Only two hand guns\
      \ are available; the M9 Beretta and the Colt M1911 (this is too do with the\
      \ realism of trying to keep it P.C wit the Delta Force of the 1990s). As for\
      \ accessories, there are two types of grenades; frag and smoke. There are also\
      \ rocket launchers and even a claymore, if that is your thing. \n\nSo if you\
      \ are a gamer who wants to be a Delta Force sniper, and land in a Black Hawk\
      \ helicopter in the war zone in Somalia. Then Black Hawk Down is for you! Just\
      \ try not to pay attention to the budget graphics. For example, the enemy A.I\
      \ is the same character mod."
