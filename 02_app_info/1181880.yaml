      \ warfare and a burning passion is what I sing. In this fantasy RPG inspired\
      \ by both ancient western literature and contemporary media, you play as Princess\
      \ Vendra Thetis, one of the two royal twins of Draknus, and travel the provinces\
      \ of the kingdom in order to secure stability for the lands, which have been\
      \ blighted by the destabilization efforts of the kingdom\u2019s ancient and\
      \ hated enemy, the Malhepteon. Fight and watch how Vendra develops into a person\

    developer_response: I'm glad to see that you are enjoying the game! Thank you
      for the feedback. As such, there has been a recent update to add 5 more music
      tracks to non-boss encounters, picked at random. Hopefully this will help you
      feel that the battle music is less repetitive, as you should be hearing the
      original battle music 1/6th of the time now on average.

    review: Having a lot of fun with this! Got it during a sale but I'd say it's well
      worth the full price. My only gripe is that the battle music loop is a little
      repetitive, but that's easily dealt with by turning down the BGS volume.
