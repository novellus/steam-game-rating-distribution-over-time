The XP faces and Busts are partially custom with XP style in mind. the only MV compatible thing in this pack is the VXACE sv battlers. everything else was just not. A waste of money even on sale. All i can take from this is the sv battlers, but without the characters or faces its useless. I wish i didn't buy this crap,","timestamp_created":1593110765,"timestamp_updated":1593110765,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.614657878875732422","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43KOz9vICcJWPkAI="}
