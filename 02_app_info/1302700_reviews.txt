And when I say this is an rpg, well, lets be honest...there really is no role to the role playing here. Perhaps I'm missing something here but you basically hit explore and go fight poorly drawn random enemies with absolutely no plot, no story, no substance to speak of. Then you eventually get money to buy new skills, equipment, and classes, I guess. That seems to be it. Perhaps there's more to it...I doubt it though. If this is really all there is, I am sorry to say I don't think this is even worth the relatively cheep $4.99 it is currently priced at, unless you just want something to waste your time on. Just endless grinding with nothing more at all. Its like a quarter finished game. Add a game world with active NPCS, quests, and interactivitiy, and this game could be salvaged...but yes, at present, do not bother with it is my advice. There are far better rpgs with real role playing out there.  Sorry if this review came out a bit harsh, but this is my honest take on this game.","timestamp_created":1590370396,"timestamp_updated":1590370396,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574963986873626709","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9szdpPICdOiMigI="}
