It's short, strategic, simple, yet compelling. VR games often fall into this arcadey vibe, but I love that this two-minute drill football simulation is both twitchy and strategic. At higher levels it for sure gets harder, though it doesn't turn completely impossible.\n\nBeing able to draw up (or tweak!) plays doesn't sound like a big deal on the back of the box, but man it provides a huge amount of depth and replay value. \n\nLove it, strong recommend.","timestamp_created":1603508759,"timestamp_updated":1603508808,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlNWkrPUCc7feqQI="}
