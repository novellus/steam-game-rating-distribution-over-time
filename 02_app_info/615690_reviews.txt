There are only two play modes:  timid or gangbusters. Since i have some experience, i chose the latter. \n\nWhen the game first opened, i had to use the arrow keys and space bar, but then the mouse control kicked in. It took me a while to understand most of the damage symbols used during fights, so that was a challenge in itself.\n\ni enjoyed the dystopian sci-fi theme. There is colorful, profuse bleeding during fights and dead bodies, esp in the first location, but the curse words are not prolific. Pristine's attributes are unveiled in a teeny bikini at times.\n\nThe game held my interest, and I got stuck only in one area, probably because I decided not to draw a map for it. Being methodical in looking for exits got me thru.\n\nThe dialog is very easy to read and graphics are good. If there are secret rooms, I didn't find any.","timestamp_created":1602092586,"timestamp_updated":1602092827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.610200345516204834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l5CLgvUCday6pgI="}
