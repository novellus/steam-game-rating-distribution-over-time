    review: 'The last of the games of this series available on Steam (as of 2020/11).  Worth
      playing, but not as engaging as the first four.  The art is still lovely, although
      the scenes are all night / underground to suit the setting.  The game is uneven
      - some aspects are well done, while others fall short (see below).  I feel as
      though there could have been more to the story, and I''m sorry to be done the
      series.


      Pros:

      - customizable difficulty settings

      - interactive map

      - variety of HO scenes

      - variety of puzzles

      - attractive artwork (though it does feel very dark compared to other entries
      in the series!)

      - bonus chapter


      Cons:

      - story is difficult to follow and doesn''t feel connected to the other games
      in the series

      - story feels unfinished or rushed

      - the Elven princess has wooden, mechanical voice acting, and doesn''t fully
      understand what she''s reading

      - the puzzles/ games aren''t as good as in previous entries; some allow a choice
      between hard/ casual, but others vary a great deal between too easy and frustrating

      - the in-game achievements are very basic (the prior games either didn''t have
      them, or provided a special room)

      - the collectibles (stamps/ seals) aren''t very interesting and most of them
      cannot be missed (maybe in hard mode?)


      [b]Overall:[/b] This game doesn''t live up to the entertainment and story value
      of the others.  That said, it''s still an okay game with nice art.  Get it on
      sale and in the bundle.  I still recommend the series as a whole.'
