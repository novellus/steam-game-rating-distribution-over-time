    review: Picked this up during the Summer sale. 74 cents? Totally worth it. Have
      played 74 cents worth of game already. Graphics vary between decent and entertainingly
      horrible. Random encounters can be a little annoying, but it's got the feel
      of an old school nintendo rpg and the learning curve is very easy. Would recommend.
