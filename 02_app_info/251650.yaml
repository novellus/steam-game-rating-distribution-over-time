    review: "Ok, so I have played at least 60 different games during quarantine and\
      \ finally got around to playing this one. Let me just say this is probably one\
      \ of my favorite games this year. From the art style to the music, this game\
      \ was really great! The game plays like Pikmin but with a zombie take on it\
      \ and I absolutely loved the settings. The characters were really great, I was\
      \ actually invested in each of them and boy does this game get dark at spots.\
      \ There is a mixture of humor within the game as well to keep it going and there\
      \ are several references to 80s stuff which was fun to find. \n         The\
      \ gameplay was pretty clean with maybe one major bug where I lost control of\
      \ my character after what seemed to have happened when I resurrected a dead\
      \ person just when a cutscene was taking place. Other than that, it was excellent\
      \ performance wise through the rest of the game. I found the combat to be really\
      \ easy though until maybe 2 spots later in the game but I didn't have any issues\
      \ controlling my zombie army. The game also throws minigames in between portions\
      \ of the story as you go from the past to present and I like that addition.\
      \ Quite frankly, I didn't want this game to end but I plan on playing it again\
