It reminds me of a lot of gamemaker games that I was obsessed with in my youth.\n\nThe game itself however, is suprisingly deep. Each unit has a type and a list of techniques and these techniques take time to pull off. But here's the catch: you can pay action points to speed it up. You'd think you'd be constantly doing that but action points are shared between the whole team and they are also used to move your units and spawn new ones.\n\nDid I mention that some units can transform into different forms? Each form is its own beast: different sprites, different techniques, and they can even change movement methods (flying, swimming).\n\nI look forward to what this game will bring to the table as time goes on.","timestamp_created":1603400426,"timestamp_updated":1603400426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57364344596862793","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwoZyHqfUCfNG/qQI="}
