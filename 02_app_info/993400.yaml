    review: "Finding Summer will take an eternity.....\n\nTried to gave this a chance\
      \ and wanted to like it. The game is just too frustrating.\nThe game has 3 basic\
      \ controls, LEFT/RIGHT, JUMP, and SWITCH (LMB or CTRL key).  It was nice a surprise\
      \ to find the CTRL key works instead of the LMB for SWITCH). Jumping on the\
      \ same platforms over and over or trying to do \"U\" movements is where this\
      \ game struggles. Once a level is completed, it does feel as if a major chore\
      \ has been accomplished!\n\nPROS\n*  Beautiful world graphics and atmosphere\n\
      *  Beautiful music composition\n*  Completing a level feels like a monumental\
      \ accomplishment \n*  Adorable main character \n*  Unique front/back platform\
      \ gaming thru a switch feature (LMB or CTRL key)\n\nCONS\n* Awful controls -\
      \ expect to do impossible movements with no on screen hints\n* The front/back\
      \ level switch is gimmicky and leads to frustration at many times during a level\n\
      * Buggy - Fell into a \"cloud void world\"  where nothing can be done but stare\
      \ at clouds!\n* Buggy - Around level 5 every game death results in 2 game deaths\
      \ instead of 1 \n* The levels progress to insane difficulty needing to JUMP,\
      \ MOVE and SWITCH at he EXACT right time\n* Doing levels over and over to snag\
      \ that strawberry!\n* That lava, that AWFUL lava!!!\n* Checkpoints are level\
      \ based only, each level will start at the starting point of that level \n*\
      \ You will curse this game!"
