Rockstar Games currently feel threatened that this game will make more sales than their upcoming release of Grand Theft Auto VI.\nWhy in the world would you want to shoot up police officers and run over hookers with your car, when you could play some f***ing monkey slap? \nThis game 'slaps' hard. The storyline was written by Stan Lee and the music composed by the great Hans Zimmer. \n\nYou have no time to lose! Play now!","timestamp_created":1609409539,"timestamp_updated":1609409539,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.58050847053527832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u5WS3PYCedWHvwI="}
