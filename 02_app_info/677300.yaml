    review: "Ghosts of Miami is a fantastic game with a unique premise. A mystery-solving\
      \ game (where the main shtick is finding missing persons rather than solving\
      \ murders) where you also get to date people, all wrapped up in an 80's aesthetic?\
      \ I was sold, and the game delivered. \n\nIn terms of overall aesthetic, the\
      \ game is lovely on all fronts. Like, that opening animated sequence?? Absolutely\
      \ gorgeous, I watched it pretty much every time I booted the game. The art is\
      \ colorful and a delight to look at; it does a great job of capturing the look\
      \ and feel of 80's anime, and all the characters are expressive and distinct.\
      \ Even the loading screens for when you travel between different areas have\
      \ these really cool pixel animations. There's a lot of neat CGs too, I REALLY\
      \ wish the game had a CG gallery!! Some dateable characters had more CGs/events\
      \ than others though so kinda sucks if you liked, say, [spoiler]Richard[/spoiler].\
      \ In terms of music, the soundtrack is catchy and filled with 80's synth. It's\
      \ great to listen to and effective at building up emotion and atmosphere. I\
      \ sort of wish it was included as DLC so I could buy it or something, I can't\
      \ seem to find it anywhere online. \n\nThe game really shines in its story and\
      \ characters. Everyone is fleshed-out, complex, and interesting. This is especially\
      \ the case for Chelo, our protagonist \u2013 she seems very realistically flawed,\
      \ but still compelling and relatable. It's rare to see a dating sim or VN protagonist\
      \ who is little more than a stand-in for the player, let alone a fully-developed\
      \ character in their own right. I loved learning more about each and every character,\
      \ choosing different dialogue options or different routes to solve a case, just\
      \ to see what they would say and what kind of insight that would give me about\
      \ them. Pieces of dialogue that just seem like throwaway lines can actually\
      \ end up being really meaningful. Even the dateable characters I wasn't personally\
      \ interested in, I still liked seeing their different routes and how differently\
      \ they interacted with Chelo. I actually really appreciated the fact that interacting\
      \ with the romanceable characters actually HELPS to solve cases rather than\
      \ hinders; they weren't just a distraction from the plot, they're actually well\
      \ integrated. I sort of wish there was another case or two besides the game's\
      \ five, just so I could see all these characters interact a bit more. \n\nOne\
      \ thing about this game that actually surprised and impressed me is the amount\
      \ of historical references it contains to real events from the 70's-80's. Besides\
      \ the more well-known stuff like the rise of Fidel Castro or the War on Drugs,\
      \ the game not only mentions things such as the Mariel boatlift, or the Escobar\
      \ family, or the Iranian revolution, (all of which I knew little to nothing\
      \ about) it also incorporates the impact of these people/events into the characters\
      \ themselves, their lives and motivations. I thought this was incredibly fascinating,\
      \ and it even made me pause the game occasionally just to google this stuff.\
      \ I feel like I actually learned something. The 80's setting isn't just for\
      \ the aesthetic; the dev team must've done a lot of research. \n\nUnfortunately,\
      \ the game has its flaws too. My biggest issue with the game involved its mechanics;\
      \ it doesn't have options to adjust text speed, or quicksave, or skip previously-seen\
      \ text, or to press the scroll wheel to get a full look at the game's art \u2013\
      \ and all of this stuff is pretty standard to have for VNs, so I didn't get\
      \ why this game didn't have those! Lacking these options made the experience\
      \ more frustrating than it needed to be, especially when I wanted to replay\
      \ and see different routes/dialogue options. (Note: pressing the ~ key on your\
      \ keyboard will skip text much faster than continuously jamming your space bar,\
      \ but it [i]will not[/i] stop at unseen text). I also didn't really get why\
      \ [spoiler]Luci and Richard's[/spoiler] routes aren't available from the start?\
      \ You have to replay the whole game just to get their routes, [i]and[/i] you\
      \ can't solve the final case without doing [i]both[/i]. Like, I enjoyed learning\
      \ about these characters through their routes, but all that replaying \u2013\
      \ especially when you don't have a reliable way to skip seen text \u2013 got\
      \ really slow and frustrating, and I wanted to solve that last case, dammit!\
      \ Oh yeah, and the loading screens have some cool pixel animations but when\
      \ you're trying to replay routes like that it just slows things down more. \n\
      \nMy other biggest issue is that sometimes it was hard for me to understand\
      \ the dialogue. The slang played a part of it (I'm not very good with slang\
      \ in general, moreso if any of it was specific to an era/city I never lived\
      \ in) but sometimes the dialogue was just...confusingly worded? Like two characters\
      \ will be having a conversation and it just doesn't seem to flow logically.\
      \ One example that comes to mind (and this isn't a spoiler) is when Chelo first\
      \ meets Tala and asks for her help with a case, Chelo says something like \"\
      I appreciate your honesty\" and Tala suddenly goes \"You should, I'm Iranian\"\
      \ and talks about her dad and the Iranian Revolution. It just.... didn't flow\
      \ very well. Or, occasionally characters will just ask or say something really\
      \ vague, and it isn't really clarified, and then I just have no idea what the\
      \ hell they're talking about. The dialogue is perfectly fine for the most part,\
      \ but in some moments it just left me scratching my head in confusion. Your\
      \ mileage may vary on this point. \n\nThe game also has the occasional spelling\
      \ error, glitch, or grammar mistake. Sometimes the game can't also properly\
      \ keep track of its timeline (i.e. it acts like you haven't talked to character\
      \ X when you actually have). Fairly minor stuff, but still frustrating. \n\n\
      Bottom line though? Ghosts of Miami is great. Despite my bitching about its\
      \ flaws, I still really enjoyed playing it and I wholeheartedly recommend it.\
      \ Honestly? the worst thing about it is how [i]hecking underrated[/i] it is."
