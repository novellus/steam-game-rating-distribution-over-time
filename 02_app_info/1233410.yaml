    about_the_game: <strong>MicroWorks</strong> is a fast-paced online party game
      centered around microgames - simple tasks with very minimal time to complete.<br><br>Players
      are lumped together in the nexus tower, where they compete against each other
      to climb the scoreboard and emerge victorious with the highest score by the
      end of the game. <br><br>Score is earned by successfully performing microgames
      - smash an object, jump over laser beams, reach the other end of an obstacle
      course, solve a math equation - throw a watermelon at your opponents? The list
      goes on and on, and the faster you perform, the higher your awarded score.<br><br>At
      the end of each game, there is one final obstacle players must face - the boss
      stage, which is a slightly bigger game worth a lot more points. The perfect
      opportunity to flip the tides of war.<br><br>MicroWorks is fast without pause
      - microgames will keep coming at you consecutively as they become increasingly
      faster with each one. Keep up with the tempo and outrun your opponents to win!<h2
      class="bb_tag">FEATURES</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Over <strong>50</strong>
      microgames, each with different variations - totalling in over <strong>200</strong>
      ways to be tested on the battlefield!<br></li><li> At least <strong>15</strong>
      boss stages.<br></li><li> Multiple gamemodes such as <strong>Scorematch</strong>,
