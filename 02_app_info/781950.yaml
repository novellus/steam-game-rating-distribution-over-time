    about_the_game: Galactic Delivery is an ambient relaxing game. Designed for you
      to listen to chill music while delivering packages as an intern. In this game,
      you'll choose how many packages you want to deliver for the day, and as you
      make your deliveries you generate revenue. At the end of your internship, you'll
      be evaluated to see if the company will hire you on as full time. At this point,
      you can choose to continue playing as an employee.<br><br>As you visit different
      planets, you'll meet all sorts of different alien races. Some of them are strictly
      business, and sometimes they'll want to chat with you a bit. When visiting these
      planets, you'll have the opportunity to buy goods at current market value. As
      the game progresses the market value will change, giving you a chance to sell
      at a profit at the traveling bazaar. You'll also be able to pick up side quests.
      These will not be mandatory to delivery, as they aren't assigned by your company
      in the morning. Just a great way to make a little extra.<br><br>Every day during
      your internship, you'll unlock a new song to play on your radio. By the end
      of your internship, you'll have a whole album to swap through. Picking the song
      you like most while doing your daily deliveries.<h2 class="bb_tag">Feature Highlights</h2><ul

    review: "I had the pleasure of playing this game over the last two weeks.\n\n\
      The game's title serves as the perfect forecast to what to expect in the game\
      \ play. With that said, I personally prefer games with more content and a longer\
      \ amount of game play.\n\nI was hoping for more to do with the random items\
      \ you can buy from random planets but all and all, it's a short, simple, and\
      \ sweet game. \n\nI have to say the pixel art in this is so beautiful and the\
      \ soundtrack  is very nice and relaxing.\n"
