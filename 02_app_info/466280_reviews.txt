The only real bug is the occasional enemy flying straight up into nothingness. It runs fine and the partial controller support may as well be listed as full controller support since everything functions well as far as I know of.\n\nThat said, this game just doesn't really have anything of interest to me. The shooting is meh, your enemies are just a bunch of cubes that zerg you while you shoot them down.  The \"puzzles\" are more along the lines of either get through timed obstacles to reach things to unlock doors or go across a bunch of timed platforms that lead in different paths until you find the right path. \n\nIt all feels very lackluster, even falling to your death is just a slow fall down and then the music does a mini fade out and resets. I mean, at least give me some kind of sound when I fall off.\n\nI was expecting something more musical or rhythmic like beat hazard or crypt of the necrodancer but honestly the background sounds pretty awful half the time and beside some obstacles that move and make a sound when they move there isn't really much rhythm required. \"Player generated procedural music\" hasn't really seemed to be a thing yet, especially if you consider that the maps are all predesigned levels and you can't input music I'm not entirely sure how \"player generated procedural music\" would even be possible beside the sound of you shooting enemies.\n\nThe game description on steam talks describes the setting as a place where \"the most peculiar and unfortunate of events have occurred.\" But beside the plot actually written in the steam description there isn't much to find. In the game itself all I could find were these nodes in game which would open an image with some pictures and some stuff that's supposed to be alien language or something.\n\nAll in all, couldn't keep my attention in any way, so not recommended.","timestamp_created":1471646097,"timestamp_updated":1602109845,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.460590332746505737","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44IXMgvUCecK5Xw=="}
