    short_description: Only brought to life by scarce sparks of Color, the bleak,
      grey Void is a peculiar place. The player gets to explore it, get to know the
      Sisters, Brothers, and other weird creatures inhabiting it, and learn the ways
      of Color, harvesting it and drawing sigils that change the world around them.
