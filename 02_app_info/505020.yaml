    about_the_game: Build, climb, explore and fight back against a robotic threat
      in an open-world persistent MMO created from the ground up for VR. This is the
      world of <strong>Neon Exile</strong>, a world where your actions matter because
      anything you build, craft or even drop, will persist in a single shared multiplayer
      instance of this groundbreaking dystopian world. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/505020/extras/NeonExile-LeapToMesa-01.gif?t=1569621329"
      /><br><br>Will you explore the wasteland in search of enemy bases or will you
      stay back to defend your base from attacks? Will you collect valuable resources
      or will you build structures to expand your territory? In <strong>Neon Exile</strong>
      you choose your own path, whether you want to join a team or play by yourself,
      the live simulation will always be there, shaped by the players.<h2 class="bb_tag">Early
      Access</h2>The initial early access release of Neon Exile will be a slice of
      the game to showcase the mechanics, multiplayer systems and a taste of the environment.
      We are focusing on the building mechanics and the multiplayer technology before
      diving too far into content at this stage. As the multiplayer server backend
      is key to the growth of Neon Exile, this will be the most important system to
      build a good foundation. We will start small with a limited concurrent player
      count and expand as we iron out issues and develop server stability. <br><br><img

    review: Very high potential, active Devs that actually play their own game,  and
      it's pretty fun! Only complaint is the lack of players, but the Devs host missions
      that act as community play nights.
