If you can look past the graphics, you basically have a campaign in the same vein as something like IL-2 where you have a real sense of being a participant in a much grander campaign than you're witnessing firsthand. This is a game that revolves around critical choices, and this adds a level of authenticity I wasn't expecting. The first time I realized this wasn't a cute little tank game was when I was trading AP rounds with some German tanks in the open deserts of Tunisia when my main gun went down for the day, forcing me to make the decision of allowing my wing tanks to finish the fight or retreating before we took casualties. I opted to stay put and fight it out, which prompted two enemy Stukas to dive-bomb my position and kill my driver outright and wounded my loader, critically. As the tank filled with smoke and flames my TC hammered the enemy with suppressing fire and the gunner did his best to pull the loader to safety as the enemy continued to fire on our position, hitting my TC and killing him dead right there in the hatch. In just the nick of time the gunner ejected, hoping to assist the loader from the exterior. The fire was really burning by then, and I should have made the gunner run to safety (but no man left behind!), so he tried (and failed) to pull the loader from the open hatch as the stores of HE rounds ignited and sent my boys straight to hell. 10/10 will probably get hurt hundreds of more times before I am done with this game, well worth the $8, I wouldn't have been mad if I had paid $30 or more, and this dev has earned my respect for life.","timestamp_created":1609893227,"timestamp_updated":1609893227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4n6XH6vYCeszuwAI="}
