It's a bit fragile and doesn't stack up well against higher tier ships. Same tier, it can be a real bully.\nSomeone threw all their guns on a small ship and added torpedoes for giggles. It's always an entertaining game in this boat.\n\nThe torps reload fast, so you're always going to have them as an option.\n\nDo not run to the front line, you'll get decimated. This isn't a tank, it's a low level gun spammer.\nPlay midfield, support the front, use cover. Pick on isolated targets, bully destroyers, set things on fire, and just keep\nshooting. That's the appeal of this ship, it's all guns, just keep shooting, but don't get shot (too much).\n\nDo not go broadside to the opponent in this ship. Never do that. Use your angles, reverse if you have to, just never show your side unless you're 100% sure you're going to secure a kill.\n\n","timestamp_created":1604298774,"timestamp_updated":1604298774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw35Lqw/UCfaveqwI="}
