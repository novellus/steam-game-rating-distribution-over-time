    about_the_game: <strong>Evil Park</strong> is an atmospheric horror game, based
      on simulating obscure situations of distress, insecurity and anxiety. The narrative
      is presented in a conceptual way, and it is up to each player to interpret the
      events individually. There is no default protagonist. You will be in control
      of yourself (first person), being represented by the game. The dirty and blurry
      look is inspired by snuff movies and low budget classics. The gameplay follows
      a simple and objective line, being based on exploration, collection of items
      (randomized) and survival. Your enemies will be murderous hunters of humans,
      masked lunatics, thirsty for violence, who will do everything they can to make
      sure you don't escape. <strong>EP</strong> is an audiovisual focus experience,
      an obscure stroll in the heart of a dark, isolated and mysterious region.
