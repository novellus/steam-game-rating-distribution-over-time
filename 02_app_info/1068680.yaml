    about_the_game: '<i>Looking Back</i> is an autofictional game that takes you,
      the Player, inside of Kris''s life as a PhD student. Appropriating the classic
      J-RPG style with a Choices Matter twist, it is a parts exploration, parts visual
      novel game, in which you must carve your own path toward the destruction of
      the ultimate boss monster that haunts your everyday life: your Thesis. It lurks
      in your bedroom and fills you with anxiety, but before fighting it, you must
      make sure your Mental Health, your Energy, your Skillfulness, your Wits, and
      your Endurance are high enough to tackle this challenge of a lifetime and finally
      obtain that degree! However, the way to become stronger is not by gaining experience
      grinding on endless hordes of monsters. Rather, you improve your stats by exploring
      and making decisions, building relationships with people around you, and altogether
      attempting to improve your everyday life. Simple things like choosing your dog
      to be a German Shepherd instead of a Cocker Spaniel, or difficult decisions
      such as saving one of two friends, <i>every choice matters</i> and affects your

      to modify some memories at the cost of some Mental Health points. Memory shards
      even allow you to go through certain dream sequences, embodiments of your subconscious.

    review: "This game was packed with so much!\n\nLots of tender moments but also\
      \ sobering moments. It's a rollercoaster of emotions with lighthearted conversations\
      \ along the way. MANY MANY MANY hidden secrets! Talk to everything you can!!\
      \ Note, decisions are permanent so for optimal gameplay make multiple save files!\n\
      \nLots of deep topics that we should all be aware of and considering in our\
      \ daily lives and things we easily forget that this game reminds us of. Many\
      \ cathartic moments for those of us who grew up in adversity but also the satisfaction\
      \ of completing the game and showing those who doubted you that you could finish\
      \ what you set your mind to! Very self-empowering and definitely recommend multiple\
      \ playthroughs for when you miss anything! \n\nBig shoutout to the game creator\
      \ who exposed his life to the public through this irl experience-inspired game\
      \ but it's a huge reminder to us all that our experiences are unique but we\
      \ all share similar end-products to those experiences. Highly recommended!"
