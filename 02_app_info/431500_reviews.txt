Beneath the horror exterior lies the most satisfying fighter I've played in recent memory.\n\nThe high quality motion capture is crisp and fresh, the audio makes you feel as if you were taking a ghastly punch with each each hi-fi umph. Hopefully DLC comes out soon because the few fighters i nthe game already are good, but after a while the game leaves you craving more. 8/10","timestamp_created":1487745853,"timestamp_updated":1487745853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":12,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61151653528213501","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45ISkstoCca7mcg=="}
