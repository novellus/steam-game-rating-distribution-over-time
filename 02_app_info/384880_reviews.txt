Basically you play for 10 minutes until it does that or you get bored since all the cases make no sense and just repeat. I would request a refund but I paid less than $2 for it so not even worth the headache. Just save yourself 10 minutes and go play something else. I think this game has potential if the developer cared about it. Still missing several things so I don't think it'll be updated again at this point","timestamp_created":1609192932,"timestamp_updated":1609192932,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqvDX1fYCdp6fvgI="}
