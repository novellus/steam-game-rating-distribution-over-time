    review: 'I just finished the game yesterday and I had fun with it.

      Hardly anybody seems to have played this game and that''s a shame because it''s
      a solid collectathon platformer.

      Really loved the colorful environments and gimmicky sound design.


      80 levels is just the right amount for the game to be a good length, especially
      since it is way more challenging than the childish design make it look. It starts
      pretty easy in the 1st world but the challenge ramps up pretty fast after that.

      Many opponents to defeat, no deaths challenges, bonus super gems. There is quite
      a lot to do if you want to beat the game "100%".


      The handling (mainly the jumps) is a little floaty but you get used to it. The
      only complaint I would have is that the jump is not a reflection of how long
      you press the button. It is a fixed height, which adds to the general challenge
      of the game, but you get used to it too.


      So overall, especially for the price, I would definitely recommend this game
      to anyone, I really dug it myself. It may look clunky and childish but it is
      way more competent than expected. But the very slick designs and colors were
      a plus in my book. At least it''s a change from all the pixel art games that
      we see coming these days.


      On a side note: I feel like this game would make a pretty good speedrun because
      there''s actually different routes you can take to beat a level. Plus you can
      make several categories in the game like no deaths runs (which would be no joke),
      100%, any%...'
