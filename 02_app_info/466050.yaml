    review: This game follows the same plot of getting locked in the cemetery. You
      have to set right the wrongs so the lost souls can find peace before you may
      leave. Another excellently put together story. This game has not only an map
      it also has a strategy guide (which can be handy).  The letter from the developers
      is, I think a very nice touch.(thank you devs) The bonus game takes up right
      where the main story leaves off. The puppy games are cute and can also give
      you some practice if you so desire. I enjoyed the game immensely. Thanx
