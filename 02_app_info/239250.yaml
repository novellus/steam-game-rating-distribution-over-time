    review: "The single most frustrating game I have ever played.   It could have\
      \ been excellent but those stupid, awful stealth missions which were not only\
      \ not fun but painfully bad.\n\nSneaking around some horned dude who can one\
      \ shot you if he finds you and practically teleport to anywhere you are so it\
      \ makes the mission a complete dice roll... And then you fight him if you complete\
      \ the stupid, boring, awful stealth mission.  \n\nAt which point he can no longer\
      \ one shot you ??? WTF??\n\nSeveral missions throw brand new dynamics at you\
      \ that are completely retarded and not remotely fun.\n\nSome of the game was\
      \ really fun to play but getting through all those god-awful missions only to\
      \ reach the woefully bad ending makes it seem like a giant middle finger."
