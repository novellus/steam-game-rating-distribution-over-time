    review: Don't understand why you have to pay to unlock DerQ2 Shina in DerQ2 but
      if you want to camp and have additional dialogue with Shina during your journey
      you NEED to pay for this. Her maid attire looks great and fits the setting rather
      than the World's Odyssey avatar they throw at you. The new dialogue is the best
      part of this dlc and should have been advertised. Talking to Shina is funny
      and enjoyable. She even has new updated victories with the girls! Worth the
      buy. Though it should have been in the main game..
