    review: "This is a very simple and very basic top-down / twin-stick shooter with\
      \ no controller support in a veritable ocean of top-down / twin-stick shooters\
      \ that do have controller support... and do this sort of thing ten times better.\
      \ Sure, it's solid and works fine; will run on a potato and might even entertain\
      \ you for a few minutes... but - feels as generic and as dull AF. \n\nIf you\
      \ want a game like this, where swarms of enemies come at ya in their droves,\
      \ you could do a lot worse than pick up something more exciting like Assault\
      \ Android Cactus, Crimsonland, Nex Machina, Tesla Vs Lovecraft or even Nation\
      \ Red. Even Serious Sam's Bogus Detour (with its dodgy controller optimisation)\
      \ or Iron Fisticle/Crypticle do a much better job.\n\nThank You.\n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvvMSERiysrh0aUgU7T09TA/videos]\
