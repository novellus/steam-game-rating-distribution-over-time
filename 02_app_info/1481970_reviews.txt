Honestly what are 5 $ \n(3 chocolate bars ... woow) \nSecond, I want to point out a few comments that claim that everything is so expensive in the game.\n (Seriously ... there are enough games where you have to pay more, sometimes real money, which is in the 3 to 5 digit range.) \nThat should be enough for now. For my part, I will keep playing this game. And I'm already looking forward to all new updates etc. the possibilities are endless. Praise to the developer or developers. \nI couldn't do that.\n\nBesides, the dev said that he is going with realism in the game and it's not finished yet. Let's give him some time to see what he plans to do.\n\n\nYes, yes, I know....\nWe live in a society that wants to have everything ready now and immediately, and preferably yesterday. This is a world sickness and it keeps getting worse.\nJust ... be patient.\n","timestamp_created":1608280590,"timestamp_updated":1608280590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw68i/uvYCdaiRuwI="}
