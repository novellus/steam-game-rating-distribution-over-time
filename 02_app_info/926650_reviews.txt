It has a good amount of content but two glaring flaws that have never been addressed. First is it does not allow you to transfer resources between the SS and Army factions, even when it is clear your army needs to resources far more than 2 SS units since you will spend almost all the points in some levels. The second major issue is what seems to be a glitch or bug that has never been fixed where your air units never seem to follow you from scenario to scenario, meaning I have to waste precious resources purchasing new air units in almost every level. Without these glaring issues fixed I would have to give it a No Buy!","timestamp_created":1608390751,"timestamp_updated":1608390751,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sebjvfYCd666uwI="}
