The flipping mechanics can be a little wonky at times, but it's a unique spin on platformers and does it very well. If you like getting lost in puzzle games (and in my opinion these are pretty hard spatial, sometimes time-based puzzles) this is  the game for you! Also, the graphics are beautiful and the story is pretty weird but cool.","timestamp_created":1508733315,"timestamp_updated":1508733315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492049634456634521","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4++zgo98CfcuLiQE="}
