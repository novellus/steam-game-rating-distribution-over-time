    developer_response: "I would like to clarify that the crash was not due to the\
      \ game itself but rather a known issue that Steam has, and they have a support\
      \ page for it here: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9764-IJVM-3291\n\
      \nAs well, the Exit button will be implemented in the next patch. It has not\
      \ been implemented yet because after multiple alpha tests there was not a single\
      \ mention of it being a problem. \n\nThis game is still in Early Access and\
      \ I enjoy hearing from the community on suggestions for how to improve it."

    review: "NOT RECOMMENDED - Rating 10%.\nReasons : Steam Integration Problem, Big\
      \ Nightmare.\n\nThis RPG Maker game is so badly integrated in steam that it\
      \ is a nightmare.\n\nYou can launch it the first time.\nHowever, once you launch\
      \ it, there is NO implementation to allow you to exit from Heaven and Earth\
      \ title page.\nThe only way is to force close the window for Heaven and Earth.\n\
      When you do that steam still think that the game is running and it continue\
      \ to run infinitely.\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1215481143\
      \  \n\nYou cannot relaunch the game because you get a steam error that says\
      \ Heaven and Earth is running.\nYou cannot logout of steam because steam will\
      \ ask you to exit from Heaven and Earth.\nYou cannot exit from Heaven and Earth\
      \ because the game window has already been CLOSED.\nYou can use windows task\
      \ manager to abort Steam Client Bootstapper, but when you relaunch steam, Heaven\
      \ and Earth is still running.\nYou cannot get a refund because the game has\
      \ been running for days and there is no way to stop it from running. Steam shows\
      \ Heaven and Earth as running for 12 hours when I only played 5 minutes and\
      \ exit. Wow !!\n\nWow this is such an implementation nightmare that I do not\
      \ even know how to rate this game.\nIt is a NO RECOMMEND for me, even though\
      \ I am a huge fan of RPG Maker games and own several hundreds of them in my\
      \ library. This is also the very first time that I buy a game that has NO exit\
      \ button."
