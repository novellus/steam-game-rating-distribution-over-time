Turns out it's good! A bit harder than the main campaign, which is in itself already quite hard.\n\nIt offer a nice challenge for new and veteran players, with uniques mechanics to it's zone, and a few notable levels. It's sadly only the size of a quarter of the main campaign, but that's fine, it gives just more of the same old Runbow experience.","timestamp_created":1567392393,"timestamp_updated":1567392393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507638990879058838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48rz39+wCerfE0QE="}
