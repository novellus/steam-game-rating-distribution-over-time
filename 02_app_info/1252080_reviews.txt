I'm in two minds about this, on one hand it doesn't matter that much since you'll still hear what you get in the game, but part of me wishes that the tracks were the full versions.\n\nThis isn't really a big deal-breaker though, but it does contribute to me knocking a few more arbitrary points off the score. The full length versions of the songs can be heard on Spotify (or bought [url=https://www.wyczarovane.com/merch-merkfolk-c-34.html]here[/url]) anyway.\n\nOtherwise, this collection is a predominantly melancholic, and at times rousing (especially the Merkfolk tracks) collection that thematically fits the setting and mood of the game at any given time VERY well.\n\nTrack picks:\nMerkfolk (Merkfolk)\nWe're in it Together (Carlos-Filipe Alves)\nThe Burden of The Crown (Carlos-Filipe Alves)\nPoludnica (Merkfolk)\n\n[h1][b]8.5/10[/b][/h1]","timestamp_created":1584021350,"timestamp_updated":1608992872,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.628861486911773682","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5Nrcz/YCeLvQ9wE="}
