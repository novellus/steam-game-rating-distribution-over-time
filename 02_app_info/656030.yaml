    review: 'As someone who thoroughly enjoyed the Redwall books when I was a kid,
      I was naturally interested in playing this game when I learnt of its existence.
      Played through it over on Youtube, so for anyone wanting to see a sample of
      gameplay before deciding whether to buy, here''s a handy link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrfcfzsmoU&list=PL05Yc3_TEBpPeXinXRdPCIZYhRjiRE7La


      Graphically, this game isn''t amazing by today''s standards - but it still looks
      pretty and is generally nice to look at (there are some beautifully artistic
      static images that do come up at certain points in the game, though). The sound
      design''s fine in my eyes, and the voice acting has a certain charm to it. The
      Lost Legends of Redwall also has a story that could have come straight from
      one of Brian Jacques'' books, so the devs have certainly done a good job of
      capturing elements of the ''Redwall feel'', to put it that way.


      Granted, it''s not a very long game, but I have to commend the devs for some
      of the ideas behind it. The scent mechanic really is an interesting idea, and
      I can''t think of many other games that use something like it (certainly not
      as a core gameplay mechanic).


      In short, I''d be very interested in seeing where the devs take it from here.
      Given the title of the game, I''m guessing they intend to do more instalments
      and develop a series? If so, consider me interested.'
