These tablets and the letters themselves are duplicate to find. They're very light on lore as is the story. I, for one, couldn't tell you coherently what transpired during my playthrough. [spoiler]It seems like you get condemned for breaking a rule, that wasn't of your own accord, so you end up taking down the system at your last stand. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/537430/discussions/3/1291816880501459911/] This post is a much better alternative to interpret.[/url][/spoiler] \n\nYou get 3 weapons; tesla, flamer and a nail gun. Eventually finding an alternate fire upgrade, which is some kind of AOE burst. Those are satisfactory. \nDeadly fauna as well as your enemy variants will be more susceptible to certain weapon.\nThe enemy and level/story pacing design scream half-life to me.\n\nPerformance will dip at times but it's nothing major. Particularly the starting area is the worst it was for me.\n\nOnce you embrace the [strike]initial jank[/strike] complete experience jank it could be good. Overall I fuchs with it. \nChances are if you enjoy a game like Agony, you might like this. It's not as good tbh\n\n*Turn off the music, there's only one horrible combat track in there that doesn't fit in with the atmosphere at all. It will play every time you shoot at something and it dies.","timestamp_created":1601868866,"timestamp_updated":1610015971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516806721687316895","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ468Kb7vYCesr6pQI="}
