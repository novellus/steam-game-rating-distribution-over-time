    review: "Timers (with time not changeable - the game has no options) combined\
      \ with slightly laggy mouse input (including mouse movement - needed to move\
      \ to other letters), make this game  - which can't be resized - and which has\
      \ no difficulties to choose from, fairly unplayable & very unfulfilling.\n\n\
      Also uses some VERY obscure words - Maguey and Drupes, anyone?\n(I feel this\
      \ would be okay in the hardest difficulty setting, if it had them - but not\
      \ in the default/only difficulty)\n\nUnless the game gets updated with timer\
      \ settings & difficulty added, \nAvoid!"
