      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Dynamic and Intelligent</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Vehicles\
      \ and Cargo</strong><br>The success of your company will depend on good planning,\
      \ and we give you the tools for it. Simutrans can have buses, trucks, trains,\
      \ trams, ships, airplanes, monorails, maglevs and any other vehicle that goes\
      \ through air, land or water. Choose them wisely and transport the immense variety\
      \ of cargo each pakset has to offer, from passengers and mail to raw materials\
      \ and consumer products.<br></li><li><strong>Cargo has Destinations</strong><br>Simutrans\
      \ citizens and products don't simply jump in your vehicles and go to wherever\
      \ you send them. They actually have individual destinations: people want to\
      \ check out attractions, go shopping, or visit friends. Products also have their\
      \ destinations - factories have contracts with each other and they won't sell\
      \ or buy from anyone else. If you don't give them the possibility to go where\
      \ they want, they simply won't use your transport company.<br></li><li><strong>Complete\
      \ the Chain</strong><br>Transporting products not only gives you money, but\
      \ makes the economy roll. As you transport products between factories, they\
      \ start producing and selling. Every factory receiving the materials it needs\
      \ starts producing new goods letting you connect more and more factories across\
      \ the region.<br></li><li><strong>Influencing Cities</strong><br>Your transportation\
      \ affects city growth. Every unit of anything you transport will affect the\
      \ nearby cities making them grow and prosper. Sometimes cities will create new\
      \ attractions and places of interest, which attract a lot more passengers. Or\
      \ maybe your service may attract new industries, that give you even more opportunities.\
      \ But not everything you do leads to good things - as cities grow more cars\
      \ are on the roads, and you will end up trying to deal with the traffic. What\
      \ you do shapes the future.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Control and Customize</h2><ul\

      \ style. But if you are, you'll enjoy all the options and ways to change the\
      \ game.<br></li><li><strong>Build Your World</strong><br>When you create a new\
      \ game, don't expect it to be a fixed world. You can shape the world to suit\
      \ your needs, build roads, factories, houses, and buildings, raise and lower\
      \ the terrain, create rivers, lakes, and seas, or beautify the world by planting\
      \ trees.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How Do You Play?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"\

      \ a private online or LAN server.<br></li><li><strong>Hardcore or Casual?</strong><br>You\
      \ can challenge yourself in a normal game, trying to make your company successful\

    review: "Ein Wirtschaftssimulator der alles Richtig macht: Sich aufs Wesentliche\
      \ zu konzentrieren, die Wirtschaftssimulation in gro\xDFen massstab, ohne den\
      \ PC durch unn\xF6tigen graphischen Schnickschnack ans Limit zu treiben.\n[h1]Simutrans[/h1]\n\
      + Sehr viele Verschiedene G\xFCter (dadurch sehr complex)\n+ Gratis und ohne\
      \ Werbung\n+ Stra\xDFenbahn f\xE4hrt in der Mitte und blockiert keine Stra\xDF\
      enfahrzeuge\n+ Betriebskosten pak abh\xE4ngig pro km und/oder pro monat\n+ Multiplayer\n\
      + Industrievertr\xE4ge (Ab- und Annehmer gebunden)\n+ Instandhaltungskosten\
      \ die zum Planen BUS-systeme zwingt\n+ Leistung: Riesige Karten mit Millionen\
      \ von Fahrzeugen aber kaum PC Auslastung, Multiplayer is etwas fordernder\n\n\
      - Keine Kontrolle der (ab-)zuladenden G\xFCter in kombi mit Industrien verteilen\
      \ die G\xFCten an alle Vertragspartner ergibt totales Durcheinander ( Soll:\
      \ A->B->C; A->D->E, Ist: A<->B<->D<->C<->E )\n- Stra\xDFenbahn ist wie Zug einspurig\
      \ und wartet bis der Weg frei ist (kein Sichtfahren)\n- \xFCberholen so gut\
      \ wie unm\xF6glich (Chris Sawyer's Locomotion hat beste implementierung die\
      \ Auch bei mehreren Fahrzeugen hintereinander funktioniert)\n- Kein Verteilen\
      \ der Fahrzeuge einer Linie (durch fehlendes \xFCberholen wird schnell: \"alle\
      \ in einer Reihe\", \xFCberf\xFCllte haltestellen und dann leere)\n- Balancing\
      \ nicht immer gut, [b]Pakset abh\xE4ngig![/b] (einige Ausreiser wie eine Dampflok\
      \ die 72\u20AC/km verschlingt aber nur 3 waggons ziehen kann die nur max die\
      \ h\xE4lfte wieder einnehmen)\n- Anhalten nur \xFCber Umweg mit offenen Fahrplan\n\
      - Nicht immer gen\xFCgend Strom um alle Industrien zu versorgen\n- Keine Inflation\n\
      - \"Trial and Error\" Scenarien (Workshop Tutorial)\n- nur wenige Industrien\
      \ k\xF6nnen sich vergr\xF6\xDFern, Industrien veralten nicht, Industrien machen\
      \ nicht dicht.\n- nur sehr veraltete guides und ein Handbuch das nix im detail\
      \ erkl\xE4rt\n- nur sehr viele pixelige paks (unter 192x), wenige detailreiche\
      \ (192 oder 256x paks), und gar keine HD paks (\xFCber 256x)\n- men\xFC-f\xFC\
      hrung etwas umst\xE4ndlich/veraltet\n\n[h1]Pakset[/h1]\nVer\xE4ndern den Ort\
      \ bzw Geschichte mit anderen Transportmitteln (Balancing) und Anfangsjahren\
      \ (Wann erste Fahrzeuge bzw Industie erscheint), sowie das Aussehen\n\n[h1]Simutrans\
      \ Extended[/h1]\nRealistischeres Spieleerlebnis\n+ Euklidische Entfernung (Manhattan\
      \ Distanz bei Simutrans)\n+ alles hat Instandhaltungskosten \n+ Klassen und\
      \ Komforsystem\n+ Wege mit max Achslast, Ausdauer und Erneuerungskosten\n+ gro\xDF\
      e Stationsabdeckung (aber Fu\xDFweg hin wird mitberechnet)\n+ autoload last\
      \ save\n\n- nur zwei 128.paks derweil (GBR und SWE) und Japan 256 (nur manuel\
      \ beziehbar)\n- nur nightly (\xFCber updater beziehbar)\n- bugs: \n        \
      \  * userdata save absturz; workdir save funkt\n          * Display settings\
      \ werden jedes mal resetet"
