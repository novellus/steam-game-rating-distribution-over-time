Use the right stick to fire a reflect beam that is ever so satisfying; it bounces multiple times off of walls to allow you to create a zig-zag beam of terror. You'd think you can mow through enemies with ease with the laser, but enemies take multiple hits before dying so there's a bit of challenge.\n\nThe game is fast-paced, levels are short and so are the boss battles. There is a good amount of creativity in level design; the developer chose to create a short game with creative levels instead of a longer game with repetitive, drawn-out levels. There are no power-ups but you can transform your mech into a jet with a stronger straight-firing horizontal beam. You also have a CPU sidekick that shoots almost at the same rate as you. With your meter full, you can join forces with the CPU to unleash a super-powerful beam.\n\nThe art is minimalistic and rudimentary at times but quite decent. Music is okay.\n\nIt's a great 15-minute diversion for a busy dad like me.\n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1554951235,"timestamp_updated":1554951235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.610027849674224854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ425yUheoCc46BvwE="}
