That itself is already quite frustrating.\n\nThen, the levels are badly designed. In particular, the traps are set in such a way that, for most of them you need to execute an almost perfect jump, which is, well ... look above. Plus, given that you cannot see that far away, you will most likely fall and die without time to react (small saw trap, enemies killing you instantly by touching you, ...).\n\nAlso, the AI of the enemies is really bad, and you cannot avoid the bullets that are fired at you. I mean, for some of them, you can try and succeed (but not for all of them), and you will need to focus a lot for that.\n\nIn addition, the boss fights have literally zero interest. You can either try to fight them in a fair way, and die because you cannot dodge enough bullets and survive before killing them, even with the healing boxes. Or you can jump on a mid-platform, be safe and shoot them to death from there, which is not interesting at all.\n\nLast but not least, this game has some technical issues. For instance, I had another Steam game opened (to drop Steam cards in the meantime), and while The Christmas Gifts was in full screen and I was playing it, the other Steam game was taking into account all of my inputs ...\n\nSo, to put it in a nutshell, this game brings a good amount of frustration and close to zero fun : save yourself some time and money, do not play it.","timestamp_created":1608932675,"timestamp_updated":1608932675,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ424n3zfYCcYeXvQI="}
