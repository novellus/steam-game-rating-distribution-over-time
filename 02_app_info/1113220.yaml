    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">STORY</h2>The story of the game is based on
      sci-fi novel &quot;Frango Anomaly&quot;. The hero is a human clone who escaped
      from space pirates. The first location is asteroid FA-17, colonized a couple
      of millennia ago. The mining of crystals is still ongoing, but... right now
      crystals are dropping in price. If it weren''t for the convenient location for
      the transshipment base, the asteroid would have been abandoned long ago. However,
      entire areas of the asteroid have already been abandoned. Life here moves at
      its own pace and by its own rules.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1113220/extras/Sketch11.gif?t=1609759536"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">STYLE</h2>Absolutely all the graphics in the game are made
      using the characters that could be typed on the keyboard. To be more precise,
      the characters from the ASCII table from the 32nd to the 126th character are
      used.<br><br>The texts in the game are localized in several languages and may
      contain characters, not from the authentic range. However, these characters
      are not involved in the design. Graphics are ASCII only.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1113220/extras/Sketch14_620.gif?t=1609759536"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">LOCATIONS</h2>The location &quot;Asteroid FA-17&quot;,
      in which the spaceport is located, is currently under development. It will be
      possible to move to neighboring planets and stations from the spaceport. You
      can move to another location at any time if you will have the necessary resources
      and skills. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1113220/extras/Intercaption2_620.gif?t=1609759536"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">BOSSES AND NPC</h2>The game has a large number of neutral
      and hostile creatures. Neutral characters can provide information, upgrade skills,
      and craft items.<br>Caution, some neutral characters can become hostile.<br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">SKILLS</h2>One of the advantages of clones is that they
      can be trained in various skills almost instantly. This requires a neuroprogrammer.
      This is a device that can change the structure of brain neurons. Also, a person
      or other creature with the appropriate skill is needed. In the current version
      of the game, the following skills are available:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Life
      force<br></li><li>Inventory space<br></li><li>Radiation resistance<br></li><li>Holding
      breath<br></li><li>Melee weaponry<br></li><li>Thrown weaponry<br></li><li>Plasma
      weaponry<br></li><li>Piloting<br></li><li>Hyperspace<br></li><li>Navigation<br></li><li>Hand-to-hand

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">BUILT-IN GAMES</h2>The game world contains computer terminals
      with built-in games. Each game can bring the player an in-game currency.<br><br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">COLOR MODES AND FONT</h2>You can choose one of eight retro
      color modes in the game options: True Color, three monochrome modes, 16-color
      mode (DOS / Mac), 2-bit and Game Boy mode.<br><br>Also LED font mode is available
      in options. In this mode, each pixel of each character is separated from neighboring
      ones.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1113220/extras/Sketch7.gif?t=1609759536"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">CURRENT STATE OF THE PROJECT</h2>This is the current state
      of the game, which I update often. Added a new item / resource - updated. A
      new boss appeared in a new location - updated. New music, new game modes, etc.
      About two hours of gameplay are available in the location &quot;Asteroid FA-17&quot;
