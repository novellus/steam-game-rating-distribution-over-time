    about_the_game: At some point in your life you've tried to move objects around
      with your mind, right? Some of you may even still be keeping the dream alive
      hoping that some day you can do just that.<br><br><strong>The wait is almost
      over</strong>, in Combat Tested you can fully realize that dream, and more.
      Playing the game you'll have full control over a range of special abilities
      designed to make you feel like a badass. You have telekinesis, allowing you
      to pick up and throw objects and enemies. There's stasis, a power that lets
      you freeze objects in mid-air for a short period of time. You can freely teleport
      around for fast movement. Then there's 3 super abilities, these can only be
      used when your Infusion stage is at 1 or higher. To increase your Infusion stage
      or I.F. stage for short, you drain I.F. containers that can be found throughout
      the lab.<br><br>If you like super powers, you probably like swords as well.
      So you'll get those too, two actually. These are no regular swords though, they
      have been infused with *something*, and as a result they can cut through anything.
      These swords are linked to your being, allowing you to materialize and dematerialize
      them at will. This means that you could throw them at an enemy to cut them in
      half from far away, and then materialize them back in your hands.<br><br>These
      tools will come in handy working your way out of the underground research lab
      you are being held in, but you must figure out how to utilize them to their
      maximum potential, or things may not end well for you.
