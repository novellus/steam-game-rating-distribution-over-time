      \ in RUNE II: Decapitation Edition.  Gather the resources to create it!<br><br><i>Ah,\
      \ greetings, Viking. Gather round whilst I tell you of the mythical dragon armor\
      \ that can be claimed by the most formidable warrior in RUNE II: Decapitation\
      \ Edition. <br><br>Many moons ago, back when gods like Thor and Odin walked\
      \ among men, there came whispers from a land that meets the Sky, of a large\
      \ beast swooping among the clouds and snatching children from the ground. A\
      \ brave warrior named Gunnar heard these stories and decided that he would travel\
      \ there to slay the mighty beast. Many protested, saying that this dragon was\
      \ too powerful for even the mighty Gunnar to slay, but he accepted no assistance.\
      \ Now, the name Gunnar means \u201Che who stands alone,\u201D and he knew it\
      \ to be his destiny to rid the land of this cursed monster. <br><br>While many\
      \ different accounts of the great battle exist, one must be careful not to trust\
      \ Elders with their dirty old Scrolls. What we do know is that at sundown on\
      \ that first day, Gunnar disappeared through the smoke and haze into the dragon\u2019\
      s cave with his mighty sword, Skull Cleaver. For two days and two nights, the\
      \ battle raged on inside that cave and on that final day, Gunnar emerged, covered\
      \ in blood and worn, with the head of the dragon grasped firmly in his fist.\
      \ He dropped to his knees and cried, \u201Cfor Valhalla!\u201D before succumbing\
      \ to his mortal injuries. The corpse of the dragon was dragged out and returned\
      \ to Midgard to honor all that this brave warrior sacrificed. <br><br>The dragon\u2019\
      s corpse was rid of his scales and forged in the fires deep within caverns of\
      \ Hel's precipice, reinforced by dark and forbidden runic magic, and assembled\
      \ by undead Draugr smiths from ages unknown. This Legendary Dragon Armor was\
      \ made for worthy Vikings to wear in honor of Gunnar, the slayer of dragons.</i>"
