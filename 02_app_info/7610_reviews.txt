Once fixed, it seems pretty stable and hasn't crashed once. This game is about as easy to approach as your average strategy game and can quickly demand the same time commitment as well. It's fairly easy to spend an afternoon just playing this game without realizing it (I have a physical copy as well so my Steam playtime doesn't reflect my total playtime).","timestamp_created":1609907374,"timestamp_updated":1609907374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+6D96vYCfvvzwAI="}
