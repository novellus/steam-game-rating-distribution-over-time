    about_the_game: This game is based on some dreams that always appear during the
      period of fighting with depression. The impression of some dreams is fragmented
      and remains in the memory. Finally, they are combined to form this unique world
      - the dream of Black Crow. There is a devil in everyone's heart. It's a fantastic
      and sad journey. When the spirit is on the verge of collapse, it is difficult
      to distinguish the dream from the reality. Maybe the dream will be better and
      more real than the reality. Maybe the dream will be a hellish scene, which confines
      but protects the heart.<br><br><strong>Challenging dream world, born to death</strong><br>In
      the dream, explore in the gloomy and dangerous spiritual world, through many
      obstacles, find the nightmare in the Black Crow's dream, and destroy them. Finally
      face the heart of Black crow. It is not terrible to die in a dream. What is
      terrible is the cycle of despair.<br><br><strong> Action Elements and Skill
      Choices </strong><br>Flexible action mechanism, so that the protagonist can
      fight freely, whether it is dodge or counterattack, can be handy. Rich skill
      combination, let the protagonist have more expansibility and fighting possibility.
      Explore dreams to acquire more skills, explore more skill combinations, and
      combine action mechanisms to find more effective ways to fight.<br><br><strong>10
      elaborate boss Wars</strong><br>There is no doubt that this will be the climax
      of the action role-playing game. The 10 well-designed boss have different identity
      background and unique fighting style. Use your ability to find the most effective
      way to destroy boss. Finally, face the heart of the black crow and save him
      from the gloomy heart.
