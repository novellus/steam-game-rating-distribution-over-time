      \ stunning Pacific Surfliner\xAE LA \u2013 San Diego route for Train Simulator\
      \ takes you through some of the US state\u2019s most stunning scenery, past\
      \ golden beaches and into sprawling cityscapes.<br><br>The 128 mile route between\
      \ California\u2019s two largest cities first saw Pacific Surfliner\xAE services\
      \ in 2000, and today carries more than 2.8 million passengers annually. Amtrak,\
      \ Metrolink and Coaster services can be seen regularly on the route, which also\
      \ hosts a varied mix of passenger and freight operations.<br><br>Starting out\
      \ in downtown Los Angeles, Pacific Surfliner\xAE services depart the art deco\
      \ Union Station before heading into the city\u2019s commercial district and\
      \ extensive freight yards, heavy with intermodal traffic both day and night.\
      \ After Fullerton (a well-known spot for railfans), the line passes the imposing\
      \ Angel Stadium, home to Major League Baseball\u2019s Los Angeles Angels of\
      \ Anaheim.<br><br>Many of the stations along the route are unique in style,\
      \ including San Juan Capistrano, most notable for its central basilica forming\
      \ part of the station building and level crossing that traverses the platform\
      \ itself. Heading south, the route runs single track from San Clemente Pier,\
      \ and at the same time hits the golden coast of California - the stunning beaches\
      \ and spectacular sunsets are just a small part of the appeal of this beautiful\
      \ route.<br><br>As the route heads inland at Sorrento Valley, trains climb the\
      \ challenging Miramar Hill, famed for its long incline and a serious trial for\
      \ even the most powerful of locomotives. At the peak of the hill, the track\
      \ divides and passenger services begin their approach to California\u2019s second\
      \ largest city and Union Station, nestled between the city\u2019s grand skyscrapers\
      \ and the southern terminus of Pacific Surfliner\xAE services.<br><br>Included\
      \ with this route is the full Pacific Surfliner\xAE consist, headed by the EMD\
      \ F59PHI diesel locomotive in Amtrak livery. The F59PHI class was built between\
      \ 1994 and 2001, and are a popular sight at the head of many US passenger trains.\
      \ A driveable Cab Car also allows authentic operation of the Pacific Surfliner\xAE\
      , as the train runs as a push-pull service due to there being no turning facilities\
      \ at either end of the route.<br><br>The interesting mix of lazy Southern California\
      \ shore towns and oceanside single-track railroading, semi-mountainous regions\
      \ and busy suburban junctions, spectacular scenery and atmospheric night lighting\
      \ make the Pacific Surfliner\xAE LA \u2013 San Diego route the perfect challenge\
