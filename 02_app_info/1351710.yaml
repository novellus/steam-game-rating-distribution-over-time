    about_the_game: 'Wake up from your eternal sleep and vanquish powerful enemies
      while wielding a multitude of weapons, shields, and magic abilities.  Harness
      the <i>Chaos Energy</i> from your foes and increase your power to help you in
      your quest.....<br><br>The first official title to be released by ShenaniganZ
      Studio, Chaos is a solo-developed 3rd-person Action RPG set in an unknown time
      where the world is wrought with creatures from your worst nightmares.  Carve
      your way through manifestations of chaos energy and stop the cult of the nameless
      god from waking the dark entity and ending reality as we know it.<br><br>This
      game is a nod to a specific group of successful/popular genres and draws obvious
      inspiration from the many elements and themes they portray.  It features a unique
      story based loosely on an obscure Lovecraftian-horror short story with some
      minor twists and additions to the mechanics of a typical souls-like.  As a solo-developed
      project by a less than skilled programmer who also lacks anything remotely close
      to artistic ability, on an almost non-existent budget, much of the artwork and
      assets featured in the game are community contributions via asset stores and
      individually contracted work.<br><br>The game features simplified 3D Action
      RPG elements, such as a leveling and resource management system, with the highlights
      of a souls-like melee and magic ability combat system as well as full gamepad/controller
      support with a custom 3D cursor.<br><br>I am patiently waiting and am appreciative
      of all player feedback that I can use to make this game more enjoyable.  Thank

    review: "I'm only 3 hours in the game now when i'm writing this, so it might change\
      \ when i beat it (if i beat it of course)\n\nSo first impressions were not really\
      \ good to be honest but it's also because i'm used to play with medium or high\
      \ settings as my computer is not a beast. The textures were a bit poor and unpolished\
      \ so i tried the \"ultra\" settings and it was much better.\nEven though i had\
      \ to turn it back down to \"high\" when i reached the prison because the game\
      \ was lagging A LOT ! But it might come from my machine, maybe.\n\nThe controls\
      \ and the combat feel slow and clunky, it took me some time to get used to it.\
      \ I was actually about to rage quit when i encounter the Cyclop. And then i\
      \ tried again, 2 more times and understood the mechanics and got him. So i thought\
      \ \"ok, let's continue and see\"\n\nRight now i just killed the 3rd boss and\
      \ i'm getting used to the gameplay and rythm of the whole thing.\n\nSo basically\
      \ i thought it was hard to get into as i was expecting some Dark Souls like\
      \ experience and in a way it is a bit like Dark Souls, with less polish of course\
      \ as it's made by one guy only and not a whole team\n\nI want to say thank you\
      \ for doing this, thank you for the effort and congrats for your work.\nIt's\
      \ not perfect, it's note quite done yet but i'm enjoying this.\n\n\n\nI guess\
      \ i'll send an email to the dev with some stuff that i noticed that could (i\
      \ guess) easilly be fixed.\n\nEDIT : i just beat the game after 10 hours roughly\
      \ and i have to say i really enjoy playing it until the end. I got more and\
      \ more into it and i didn't care anymore about the unpolished aspect and other\
      \ issues. \nI'll play NG+ now and try to get the last achievement i guess. Thanks\
      \ for your work ! Keep on doing it !\n\n"
