Today we will be looking at the cosmetic DLC “Servo Commissar-Skull” a little flying skull with a Commissar Hat and a “Cigar” in the mouth.  Cosmetic pets are no stranger to ARPGs but is this one worth the $2?  Let’s find out.\n\nSummary Execution:  The little skull does exactly what the other ones do, flies around and sometimes circles other NPCs without really doing anything but having them look at him.  There are no voice lines, no buffs or really even any lighting effects.  Really I find such a potentially flavorful pet to be a bit disappointing.\n\nOverall, I’d skip this unless you are just a completionist and much have all the DLC.  If that is the case then wait for a sale or grab it in a bundle.  Such as shame I’d love a mechanical voice Commissar yelling at me constantly.  Enjoy!\n","timestamp_created":1590535958,"timestamp_updated":1590535958,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563758373260498047","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw35XVqfICdPHAigI="}
