      \ /><br><br>NoReload Heroes is a chaotic co-op party shooter for up to four\
      \ people. You play as a team, fighting your way through randomly generated rooms\
      \ filled with various types of enemies, picking up insane magitech guns on the\
      \ way. Shooting stuff up is simple and hilarious, but only the best of teams\
      \ can make it all the way back to the evil they created.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >FIVE-SECOND LEARNING CURVE</h2><br>Almost anyone can play NoReload Heroes,\
      \ from the newbie to the seasoned gamer. No matter how many times the newb dies,\
      \ they can always be revived, as long as at least one of you stays alive. On\
      \ the higher levels, it will not be so easy... Still, you only use a couple\
      \ of buttons, and best of all, no need to reload! Simple but intense, laugh-out-loud\
      \ fun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UNIQUE GAMEPLAY SESSIONS</h2><br>Randomly generated\
      \ levels, 70+ unique magitech weapons, 43 enemy types and 3 bosses will give\
      \ you a different gameplay experience every time. There's no way you could meet\
      \ every enemy type during one session, we've made sure of that. Can you ascend\
      \ through the maze-like construction to defeat the evil AI you have created?\
      \ Work as a team to stay alive, or it\u2019s back to the bottom floor with you!<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">DIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY</h2><br>Squeeze onto a couch with\
      \ your buddies or play together online. If someone's late, they can use hot\
      \ join to jump in at any point. No friends? No problem. Online matchmaking will\
      \ find you some. NoReload Heroes is paced for conversation and designed for\
      \ social situations, like parties and game nights. We want people to be happy\
      \ together!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/806770/extras/characters.png?t=1524823399\"\
