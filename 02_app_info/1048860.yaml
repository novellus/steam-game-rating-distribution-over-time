      is your story...</h2><br>An ice planet called Iclantia is dying. The civilization
      inhabiting the planet are highly advanced, but not able to stop the coming catastrophe
      that will wipe out their civilization. What we know from historians is that
      in an effort to save their dying planet, the Iclantians created what is known
      as Comets.<br><br>The Iclantians crafted these time capsules of rock and ice,
      mixed with technology, to form pods to launch into space. Once discovered, the
      pods open to reveal a treasure within. They contain the heritage of their civilization:
      From technology, to history, toys, art, and even weapons.<br><br>Players find
      their place in a cluster of suns known as the Rimshot Galaxy. You start in the
      Remnos system which is home to a variety of alien species. The Remnos system
      has prospered from the discovery of the comets. <br><br><strong>Protagonist
      of your own Story</strong> - Crypterion brings you into the game as it''s main
      character. You can customize more than your hair and eye color. What are your
      likes and dislikes? Have you had a traumatic past experience which has shaped
      who you are today? NPC''s will recognize these characteristics and respond to
      them. It''s like the character creation system in Conqueror A.D. 1086. We take
      a streamlined approach and ask you some questions. Crypterion also keeps track
      of any battle scars or physical appearance changes that happen to you.<br><br><strong>Business
      Simulation</strong> - Do everything you can to run or ruin your business: Trade
      in goods, invest in the stock market, go on T.V., participate in auctions, buy
      and run a small business, fill your treasury to the brim, or spend every penny
      (cryptos) you earn.<br><br><strong>Story Events</strong> - Most events take
      place randomly though a card system. During the main story you will come across
      events that are more elaborate in the way they play out. NPC''s will talk with
      you and you''ll be able to build relationships. The conversations will have
      branches and different abilities can be gleamed from them.<br><br><strong>Officers
      (Companions)</strong> -Companions are NPC''s you meet under unusual circumstances
      that drive the story forward. It''s more appropriate to call these officers
      companions because of the relationships you build with them. ---- <i>Building
      a company takes years to accomplish and it will be nice to have someone that
      shares your burdens, watches your back, and grows along side you. </i><br><br>By
      learning the laws of business you can succeed. Money is everything and you''ll
      need it to survive. Over time, you will unravel the secret and the lies behind
      the comets.... and maybe... you''ll become an even greater power than the Iclantians.
      <strong>Every time you play, it''s different.</strong>'

    review: EA game so review can game. SO far it basic trading sim with some very
      lovely graphics interesting storyline. I wonder how the title system power will
      grown a change during the game.  I want to see about the small business grown
      but otherwise great storyline so far.
