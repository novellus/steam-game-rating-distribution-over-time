    review: "I saw that this game had low reviews: so I felt bad for it.  As I started\
      \ playing it, I realized it was optimized for mobile as well, so that made more\
      \ sense as to where all the reviews may have went.  That aside... the game is\
      \ actually: GREAT!  Yeah!  It made me feel like a really good RPG player lol.\
      \  The tutorial teaches you only one button (Hah!  For PC).  Easiest tutorial\
      \ ever!  There is even an MP3 player function in this game to listen to some\
      \ fun tunes!!!  \"Survive the Night\"  was my favorite!  It was a must listen\
      \ to everywhere the characters went.  So you know that OST/Music are fun to\
      \ listen to.\n\nThe characters are appealing.  All of them.  Every NPC has their\
      \ own dialogue as you explore more and more areas.  Gameplay is turn based,\
      \ with no need to put points into stats (phew!) and skills come at certain levels.\
      \  It all may seem odd at first, until you get used to it.  Enemies DO level\
      \ with you, but eventually you will see the strategy behind everything.  The\
      \ bank feature is a nice touch!  You can also level your gear and weapons and\
      \ you are going to need that generous bank feature.\n\nAs you progress, the\
      \ enemies have extremely high HP bars.  I thought I was doing something wrong,\
      \ but then I figured out that DOT damage is VERY important.  :)  Thanks to that\
      \ I was able to beat the last boss!  That boss was tricky and gives an image\
      \ of impossibility... until you actually try and succeed!  Nice touch!\n\nNo\
      \ game is perfect by all means and that's good.  I really like the bug that\
      \ actually ends your battle early, even thought you just cast one spell.  Also,\
      \ the starting spell of \"Professor\" reads:  \"Hits two random enemies\". \
      \ It hits one enemy twice.  Sometimes the enemies manage to attack through \"\
      stun\", so I am guessing they have a halved resistance to it?  Oh well. \n Those\
      \ aren't big at all and you will still have plenty of fun figuring out what\
      \ the spells do and how they should be used.  Apart from everything else as\
      \ well.\n\nOverall lots of fun and amusement was had.  I am really glad I got\
      \ to play this game.  Thank you for making it... for us to enjoy!!! :D =) :>\n\
      \nP.S.  There isn't a long story, but you will feel like you did a really good\
      \ thing for making everything and everyone feel good at the end."
