After I played that part I immediately bought all the other episodes. The second episode on the other hand... It wasn't bad or anything, but in comparison to the first it was slow. Which isn't a bad thing necessarily but...  in comparison it felt a bit weird to me.\n\nAnd then comes Episode 3: [i]Chaos Theory[/i], this is once again an [u]amazing[/u] chapter in the saga. Now that Max and Chloe are really coming together and bonding again the girls are finally ready to try to find out what's been going on around Blackwell academy. And the new chemistry between them is very well shown within this episode, everything just feels much more natural all of a sudden. And the pace is also raises a nudge ;)\n\nGet ready for Max to discover an even [b]bigger[/b] mystery than \"merely\" being able to rewind time, but always be careful what you wish for because... you may just get it!\n\nAn easy 2 thumbs up for me. I finished this episode way too quickly and I was very much tempted to do an immediate replay.","timestamp_created":1577055018,"timestamp_updated":1577104929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589084804058074951","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ju6xme8Cd++b5gE="}
