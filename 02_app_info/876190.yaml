    review: 'This game is an incredible experiment, you are not playing football,
      you are living it! A lot of citation from litterature and history of football.
      This game talks about football not only as a sport but as a philosophy because,
      as Mourinho said:

      "who knows only about football knows nothing about football".

      And this is true because this game has an excellent narrative'
