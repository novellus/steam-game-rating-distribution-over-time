    review: Pretty good game, I don't like you have to constantly have to buy vehicles
      every single time you use them(special vehicles), but the game's dead now I
      think as of 2021 where it has been out of early access for a bit I'm pretty
      sure, but it's pretty fun, I have a lot of good memories of this game I just
      hope that the creators make another one to try to reboot the community.
