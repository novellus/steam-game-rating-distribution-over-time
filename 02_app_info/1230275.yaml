      \ and it was decided to build a stop-gap solution which could be known as the\
      \ InterCity 125. As the name suggests, it was intended to build a train that\
      \ would operate at 125 mph, and in fact they would go far beyond that, setting\
      \ the world speed record for diesel traction at 148 mph.<br><br>The \u201C125\u201D\
      \ entered service in the 1970s, and set the bar for long-distance services that\
      \ remains unmatched to this day. After working hard for over 40 years, many\
      \ HSTs have now been retired from mainline use but still soldier on where necessary.\
      \ The latest mass-retirement took place on the East Coast Main Line, where the\
