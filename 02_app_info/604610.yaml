    review: 'On one hand, using the DLC characters for Arcane Raise locks you out
      of the items for the tutorial. On the other, it''s the only way to get a 4th
      character in your party, thus making it a fairly big powerup. Also, the DLC
      characters are mutually exclusive, which is hilarious given that the only "reasonable"
      way to buy them is a pack with all of them.


      Anyway this stock art lady replicates your second-slot character, but starts
      4 levels higher. Or like one fight''s worth fairly quickly, so whatever. Spellblade
      is a decent class to have a duplicate of, but really, there''s hardly any mechanics
      worth engaging with. It''s the one I ended up going with on my very short and
      successful run, though?


      Meh.'
