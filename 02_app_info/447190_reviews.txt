It is a basic, fairly sweet, occasionally steamy VN. The love interests seem to be fleshed out a lot better than the MC, which I suppose was deliberate on the part of the developers.  However, I felt left wanting to know more about Shiori other than the fact she likes to read, cook, and gets ridiculously over-the-top embarrassed at nudity and sex talk, so much so that one would think she'd been a nun in a past life.  Part of me was unsure why all these urbane, accomplished men were so taken by her other than the fact that she was a pretty young thing who happened to show up at their sausage-fest bar one day. \n\nSo, while not overly compelling, it was cute and a pretty enjoyable way to pass some time. I'd recommend picking it up next time you see it on sale.","timestamp_created":1609707961,"timestamp_updated":1609707961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qseE5fYCcfmYwAI="}
