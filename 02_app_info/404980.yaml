      Dash 9 upon its debut in 1993. The design has since proven popular with North
      American railroads. Because of more stringent emissions requirements that came
      into effect in the United States on January 1, 2005, the Dash 9-44CW has been

    review: I decided to jump on this product because it was only $6 and I am working
      on a CNW route right now. I am in love with this engine it is better than I
      could have asked for.... with ONE excpetion. I cannot use the whistle without
      the bell automatically activating? I hit the horn button and then the bell activates
      which could be useful if you are at a crossing, but I hate it when I am doing
      shunting moves and use it for starting and stopping, having to turn off bell
      each time.
