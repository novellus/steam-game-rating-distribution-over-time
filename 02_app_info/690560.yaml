    about_the_game: I Am Overburdened is a silly roguelike with a fun twist to the
      tried and true classical formula. The player takes the role of an artifact hunter,
      who has a surprisingly large carrying capacity, embarking on a quest to search
      through dungeon after dungeon for mystical artifacts and answers, in a world
      where magic has long been forgotten...<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/690560/extras/SummaryFeatures.png?t=1561491323"

      /><br>What is this 20 slots, 100+ unique artifacts RPG nonsense?<br>Simple,
      your &quot;hero&quot; does not get more powerful magically by beating some orcs
      to death and he is not a wizard either. In the world of I Am Overburdened the
      art of magic wielding was lost, but legendary artifacts and relics retained
      their power. If you equip these you become stronger, sometimes immeasurably,
      and you may even learn reactive skills and otherworldly abilities, but no sane
      person wears two pants...
