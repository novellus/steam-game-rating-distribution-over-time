Mind maps can be useful as a form of note-taking, studying, project planning, brainstorming, and more. Traditional mind maps are two dimensional but Noda intuitively adds a third dimension thanks to the power of natural input via the Rift and Vive.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.roadtovr.com\/noda-mind-mapping-tool-spatial-thinking-vr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Road to VR<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/578060\/header.jpg?t=1603388187","website":"http:\/\/noda.io","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel i5-4590 equivalent<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 8 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> NVIDIA GTX 970 \/ AMD 290 equivalent<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 11<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 100 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"Copyright Coding Leap LLC","developers":["Coding Leap"],"publishers":["Coding Leap"],"package_groups":[],"platforms":{"windows":true,"mac":false,"linux":false},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":1,"description":"Multi-player"},{"id":27,"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer"},{"id":35,"description":"In-App Purchases"}],"genres":[{"id":"4","description":"Casual"},{"id":"23","description":"Indie"}],"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/578060\/ss_d44d07c41a06a8147e3c9cd745b90509e977db87.600x338.jpg?t=1603388187","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/578060\/ss_d44d07c41a06a8147e3c9cd745b90509e977db87.1920x1080.jpg?t=1603388187"},{"id":1,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/578060\/ss_d203d03dd387bddcdb87c7d59e035d4fcf43256e.600x338.jpg?t=1603388187","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/578060\/ss_d203d03dd387bddcdb87c7d59e035d4fcf43256e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1603388187"},{"id":2,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/578060\/ss_5229a30ce916c89161527d92259c1e7221042bdc.600x338.jpg?t=1603388187","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/578060\/ss_5229a30ce916c89161527d92259c1e7221042bdc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1603388187"},{"id":3,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/578060\/ss_2bb0fc5ae9fb1b4f55f590ccc725f9a827341efa.600x338.jpg?t=1603388187","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/578060\/ss_2bb0fc5ae9fb1b4f55f590ccc725f9a827341efa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1603388187"},{"id":4,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/578060\/ss_28c8403471866ab747d35f6604f9e7419f21ddea.600x338.jpg?t=1603388187","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/578060\/ss_28c8403471866ab747d35f6604f9e7419f21ddea.1920x1080.jpg?t=1603388187"}],"movies":[{"id":256743722,"name":"Launch","thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256743722\/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1552510859","webm":{"480":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256743722\/movie480.webm?t=1552510859","max":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256743722\/movie_max.webm?t=1552510859"},"mp4":{"480":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256743722\/movie480.mp4?t=1552510859","max":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256743722\/movie_max.mp4?t=1552510859"},"highlight":true}],"release_date":{"coming_soon":false,"date":"Oct 22, 2020"},"support_info":{"url":"http:\/\/noda.io","email":"contact@noda.io"},"background":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/578060\/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1603388187","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null}}}}
