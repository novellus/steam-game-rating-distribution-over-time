    review: "This episode has you learning more about Charlotte\u2019s past, and possibly\
      \ about the nature of her ultimate fate. As in the previous episodes, you experience\
      \ this strange and sometimes horrific world she inhabits through her unfailingly\
      \ joyous eyes, though things are different this time around. One thing that\u2019\
      ll stand out is the increased amount of graphic imagery, which is just one of\
      \ the ways that this game is more intense than the previous I suppose. Like\
      \ its predecessors, it has a some puzzles thrown in to spice things up, they\u2019\
      ll make you think but aren\u2019t too difficult or illogical. \n\nAs usual,\
      \ the star here is the engaging, symbolism-laden story and the characters it\u2019\
      s told through. The game also has a wealth of nice art, making it nice to look\
      \ in both pleasant and unpleasant times. It also has nice music.\n\nA very interesting\
      \ experience that still left me even more confused than its predecessors, I\
      \ would highly recommend it! \n"
