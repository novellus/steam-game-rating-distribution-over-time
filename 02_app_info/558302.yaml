    review: I'm glad I waited to finally get into the game.  New races are fantastic.  Well
      voiced and full of charisma.  I wish every game had the budget to voice characters
      as well as this.  Get it in the multipack for $10 as opposed to individually
      to save money.  I'm just going to cut and paste this review for all 3 since
      I really think they all go together.
