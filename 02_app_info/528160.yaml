      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Description</h2>Solstice Chronicles: MIA is a top down
      shooter in which players control the difficulty by managing their threat level
      through special skills.<h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2><i>In a dead colony, a corporate
      marine is left far behind enemy lines. With an unlikely help of an insurgent
      drone, he faces the battle for survival against an army of murderous, mindless
      mutants... and worse things.</i><h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>
      Master fluid twin-stick combat to blast through waves of mutants on Mars.<br></li><li>
      Use your drone''s abilities tactically, weighing the risk and reward of decisions
      that drastically change the threat you face.<br></li><li> Decide between scavenging
      for supplies and upgrades in the face of the oncoming menace, or pushing forward,
      potentially unprepared for the enemies still to come.<br></li><li> Decimate
      the mutant onslaught with upgradeable weaponry, including shotguns, rocket launchers,
      and more, as well as special Heavy weapons, like the autocannon and flamethrower,
      which will obliterate everything in their path.<br></li><li> Develop your own
      skill tree from across four classes--<strong>Assault</strong>, <strong>Demolition</strong>,
      <strong>Hellfire</strong>, and <strong>Terminator</strong>--to become the ultimate
      instrument of destruction.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Universe - The Red Solstice</h2>The
      Earth was overrun by STROL virus. What little was left of man kind colonized
      Mars, and established a society ruled by powerful corporations. But Mars isn''t
      welcoming, and a violent storm threatens to tear the colonies apart. In a race
      against time, both the corporation and insurgents will stop at nothing to find
      the cure and reclaim the Earth. As the virus inevitably spreads through Tharsis
      colony, the players must fight the mutants, the storm and the odds to find the
      cure before it''s too late.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/528160/extras/mia1_nooverlay.jpg?t=1588581392"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Developer Note</h2>We from Ironward want to take a different
      approach to twin-stick shooters. We learned that tactics can be great in our
      first game The Red Solstice, and we''re trying to add a bit of that tactic into
      Solstice Chronicles: MIA, we feel that if players prepare themselves, the reward
      will be much more satisfying.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/528160/extras/fundedwithfig.png?t=1588581392"

      Its crowd funding campaign succeeded with 103% of its goal and was supported

    review: "I have to say, I really enjoy this game. It's a simple top-down shooter\
      \ and has a good controller setup (xbox 360 controller). The upgrade system\
      \ is simple enough and the mechanics are fairly smooth. I wish I could get it\
      \ to run at a higher frame rate but it's locked at 62 fps for some reason I\
      \ can't figure. I also wish it was clear how much health I have before my suit\
      \ fails but basically if you get caught in a corner you're toast so I tend to\
      \ live/die by that rule. \n\nGot it on sale and was definitely worth it. I don't\
      \ see a ton of games in this genre worth playing these days and this one was\
      \ what I was looking for."
