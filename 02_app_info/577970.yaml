    review: maxx is so rigged its actually unbearable its worse than anything else
      ive ever experienced. its actually worse than zonk knuckle. its a command grab
      from hell. I have actually become a Them's Fighting Herds player because i hate
      humanity. If i get hit by that mediocre command grab one more time I'm going
      to eat the intestinal lining of a small seal. maxx is what happens when a demon
      cums into a sock and leaves it under its piss covered sheets for two years.
      I hate you
