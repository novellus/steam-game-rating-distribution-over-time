(though you get to use one as well, so fair enough.) most pool occupants get along fine, others obliterate whoever they bump into, not just the player. further obstacles include gusts of icy wind (or something) every few turns, freezing whoever's in the way for a bit, and representatives of wildlife, such as jellyfish or crabs crabbing around.\n\n[b]various items can be used to your advantage[/b], or disadvantage, as the case may be with 'attachments' that make you take up multiple tiles as soon as they're picked up. took a while to get used to moving with them. some other things are activated or have to be used immediately as well (e.g. the lifebelt), while others can be picked up and used whenever with space or by clicking them. it's worth noting that items block most enemy movement, so choosing the right time to grab them can be the key to success, and don't be afraid to touch the fishermen's bait (not a euphemism).\n\n[b]inventory space is limited[/b] and attempting to grab an extra item will make it disappear, but [b]using an object doesn't count as a turn[/b]. throwable items need a target within range, and hurling stuff around is not only necessary but also fun. who wouldn't want to stun people by throwing a beach ball at them? not something to try in real life, they might drown if they lose consciousness, but it's fine here. other items let you skip a turn or move two tiles at once, as long as it doesn't involve turning a corner, and so on.\n\n[b]100 levels[/b] in 7 chapters, often spanning multiple screens, and [b]all of them are unlocked from the start[/b]. as much as being able to jump around within a chapter is always a plus instead of getting stuck on that one level, it's obviously wiser to go more or less in order and not swim too far ahead. [b]multi-part levels have to be done in one go[/b], which is a problem in my opinion, mostly because the way it's handled here. moving from one pool to another acts as a checkpoint, so [b]failing a screen only resets to the beginning of that section[/b], but pressing 'r' to restart puts you back to the very beginning, same as quitting a level. reset happens immediately after a mistake and [b]there's no undo either, making things unnecessarily frustrating[/b], especially on busier levels with a lot going on. re-doing a dozen or so moves there involves a lot of waiting around.\n\nbesides [b]the titular goal of swimming out[/b] (taking as long as you want, both in terms of time and turns), there are often [b]other things to thrive for[/b], like getting all the stars from hard-to-reach places, completing the level within a certain number of turns, not getting caught by elemental forces, avoiding item use, etc. in case of an optional turn limit a move counter will appear in the corner. [b]goals don't all have to be fulfilled during a single attempt[/b], but stars and items are consumed by some of the other swimmers if they get to them before you.\n\nthe number of objectives are denoted by dots on the level selection screen, one representing the main goal, others the optional tasks, but unfortunately their nature is only revealed while playing a level, and not even automatically at the beginning, gotta click the dots in the lower right corner or press 'o' (esc doesn't close this window, only another click or pressing 'o' again). [b]not only does the level select screen lack crucial information, but none of the goal stuff or hotkeys (besides space) are mentioned anywhere in the game.[/b] and while space works for level selection, enter doesn't.\n\non the upside, [b]the presentation is simply fantastic[/b]. clean, great-looking 50s-style graphics (might be the 60s, what do I know?) with very brief but nicely done cutscenes between levels, some soft background music and a variety of sound effects for ambience. windowed mode only with a fix-sized window, sound on/off and music on/off, no volume settings, so there's room for improvement here as well.\n\nthe puzzles are solid and get really tough down the road if you go for the bonus goals, providing many hours of challenging gameplay. [b]it's an excellent game at a good price, but not without issues[/b], so it's not as strong a recommendation as it could be. still, it's worth taking a dip, the water's lovely, and [b]there's a demo[/b] to try if you need further convincing.","timestamp_created":1605402449,"timestamp_updated":1605402499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571010589599609375","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+8Lc5PUCe8y3rgI="}
