    review: 'Score: 3/10 - AWFUL

      I got this as a freebie with Shadowgate (2014 version). I remember enjoying
      Deja Vu as a kid on my 8-bit Nintendo, so I was curious how the Mac version
      compared. Unfortunately, I didn''t have much fun with the Mac version, and it
      certainly didn''t seem like a game that has aged well. It didn''t even have
      any music.
