Quick breakdown of the aspects that made me turn it off:\n\n[list]\n    [*] Recycled interiors with minor changes, lot's of locked doors\n    [*] Quest log with little detail about where you originally picked up the quest and not enough motivation to revisit every location asking around\n    [*] Short storyline dialogue among party members and long-winded lore found on the bookshelves\n    [*] No leveling up, instead you grind to buy new equipment and grind to buy potions that add extra stats to your party members\n    [*] Each time you equip something you have to reselect a character and then a slot and then equipment again, it backs you out each time (it's nitpicky, but annoying if you want to equip multiple things in one go, which you are often doing)\n    [*] Little motivation to utilize the games magic system, I was able to fight my way through using melee alone.\n    [*] Sometimes checking fireplaces and pots yields items or \"kupons\", but most times it yields the same canned responses over and over again. Of course in the first house I tried checking the fireplace and it said \"They will probably light it later at night\" it felt like flavor text. After the twentieth house it was annoying. \n[/list]\n\nI do like the art, and the mapping isn't too bad either. The party members were diverse and while they weren't very deep, they weren't flat either. If I had the time to sit down and play from start to finish I might enjoy it more but I found myself frustrated with the quest log being too ambiguous. When you only get a few hours a week to spend on gaming, it's not fun to backtrack for sidequests and find out the reward was a magic item you don't even need to use.","timestamp_created":1578425385,"timestamp_updated":1578425385,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560513556003570557","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4goDfwO8CdZDH6gE="}
