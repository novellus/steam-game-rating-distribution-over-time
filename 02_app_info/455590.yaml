    review: 'I will be honest: I did not expect to suck that hard at this game. I
      am playing for two hours now, trying to beat my girlfriend''s highscore, which
      she set after her very first run. And finally, finally I catched her up. I am
      still stucking in level 1 but YES, I''VE BEATEN HER HIGHSCORE! Hotline Miami
      hard game? Check this, it will show you a new definition of what ''hard'' means!
      Well... there is still the possibillity that I am just sooo bad at this... no,
      that seems wrong (I did much better with ''Daddy Long Legs''), it must be the
      game.


      [strike]This game[/strike] Level 1 is good and fun and recommended, I''ve bought
      Clumsy Runners due to its pixelart (love it), its soundtrack (love it) and because
      it is fucking... cute (I don''t say that often). And I don''t deny my purchase
      so far. Well the downside is, if you are bad at the game you won''t see much
      of it. Controls are customizable, I''ve tried different key setups, tried one
      finger, two fingers, one hand, two hands, failed with all of them, in the end
      my only change was to put ''standing up'' on space as well.


      Today evening there will be a moment of pride, me saying to my girlfriend ''Believe
      it or not but I''ve beaten your highscore!'' Probably she will smile and say
      ''Give me five more minutes with the game please...'''
