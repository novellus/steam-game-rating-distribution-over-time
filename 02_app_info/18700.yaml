    reviews: <strong>PC Gamer UK (9/10)</strong><br>There are plenty of eye-catching
      games, and there are some games that genuinely innovate. This indie project
      manages to do the impossible and combine the two. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/and-yet-it-moves/review/and-yet-it-moves/a-20090428153911483088/g-2009042815119824089"
