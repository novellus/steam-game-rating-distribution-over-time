I know it says BETA on it, but it's on steam as a regular release, and it's simply not ready. The game world has promise but it needs A LOT of work. Platforming seems floaty and imprecise. Combat is clunky and unsatisfying. The sound effects are low quality and ineffective.  And there are bugs. I literally got  stuck because I jumped out of bounds looking for secrets and had no way back into the level, Not to mention the game is incredibly short.  Right now, it's just not worth playing.\n\n\nEdit - Now that the game is fully out, I can safely say that I do NOT believe this game is worth playing.  Basically, nothing was fixed from it's early access/BETA release to it's full release. Poor combat, poor level design, poor sound design still plague the game. Sure an extra two levels were released but they aren't any better than the rest of the game. Not worth your time or money.","timestamp_created":1570068146,"timestamp_updated":1609198956,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3u3u1fYCeI2z0wE="}
