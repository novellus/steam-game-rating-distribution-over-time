    about_the_game: Anomalies may be a game, then again it may not.  One user described
      it as <i>&quot;A million musical leeches, waiting to suck the serotonin from
      my brain.&quot;</i><br><br>Another said <i>&quot;I don't even know what to say
      about this one. It honestly freaked me out a little.&quot;</i><br><br>A particularly
      enthusiastic user stated <i>&quot;Wish I had some kind of supercomputer to push
      the limits on this thing... I'm pretty sure it would reveal the secrets of the
      universe.&quot;</i><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/546780/extras/Animated_Branding_001.gif?t=1572573733"
      /><br><br><strong>A Fine Art Game</strong><br>Anomalies is an experimental generative
      art game.  There are no levels, points or objectives.  It is a &quot;game&quot;
      in the loosest sense of being an amusement or pastime, an interactive piece
      of audio-visual, virtual sculpture, which one can tinker around with and explore.<br><br><strong>Generate
      and Explore</strong><br>You can randomly generate the anomalies, or you can
      change the anomaly's parameters manually with a series of sliding dials in order
      to tweak your creation.  Use the controls to explore Anomalies, and the unique
      sights and sounds they generate.  <br><br><strong>Sights and Sounds</strong><br>Anomalies
      are both audio and visual phenomena, the parameters that effect one effect the
      other. Some are strange and discordant entities, while others are symmetrical
      and harmonious. All the images and &quot;songs&quot; you hear in the demo video
      were produced through the program's algorithms. <br><br><strong>Other Options</strong><br>Using
      a built in screen capture button, you can collect snapshots of your handiwork.
      Use it as desktop wallpaper, or share it with your friends. If you want to revisit
      a favorite anomaly, you can also save it and load it again later. There is also
      an auto timer feature that cycles through anomalies automatically, allowing
      you to sit back and enjoy the show.<br><br><strong>Experimental</strong><br>I
      call Anomalies &quot;experimental&quot; because of the way in which I developed
      it.  I started with a simple idea - &quot;what would trees look like if they
      grew in space?&quot; - and began to create fairly simple, branching structures.  Once
      that was working, I thought about different colors and textures.  Each stage
      brought new questions and possibilities - &quot;what if they move or wiggle?  What
      it they make sounds?  What if they produce flames or particles?&quot; - and
      so on, until I arrived at what you see in the program.  So I had no idea what
      it would end up like when I started it.  Though I have moved on to other projects,
      I still think about more possibilities for Anomalies.  I do hope to be able
      to return to working on this program at some point, but I will not give any
      promises right now...

      \ dismembered skeleton of some vast, spacefaring beast - a thorny, plantlike\
      \ entity that waved gently in the solar wind - a whirlwind of oddly flattened\
      \ stones - an enigmatic alien pyramid that glowed red like some infernal forge\
      \ - a colony of twisting worms flitting to and fro, occasionally meeting nose-to-nose\
      \ as though exchanging information  I'll be coming back to Anomalies. It's not\

      An enigma? Or perhaps .. an Anomaly? Anomalies may be a game, then again it
