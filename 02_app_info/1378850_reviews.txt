One of his former students made this as a project for HIS class with his father. I kept my standards low with that knowledge, but the game's unfortunately bad even by those.\n\n-The window formatting is hot garbage on any resolution besides the max; the screen just crops out, rendering some menu buttons unusable on a low-enough setting.\n-The combat is way too unfair even on Easy. I only made it as far as the third major \"boss\" in the game before dying, on my FIFTH TRY. They also show an intro (as well as admittedly-funny names and grave pics), but never where they come from. I usually just resort to button-mashing in their general direction when they're already on me.\n-Visuals and audio aren't the best. I mean that as in; they seem to be patchwork. Just stock assets slapped on there without enough care, and sub-par voice work. This is a minor gripe, though.\n-THE WORST PROBLEM: ABYSMAL FRAME RATE!! Because you're essentially FORCED to play at max resolution, even if on Windowed mode, my game only consisted of (est) 3-5 FPS. The button-mashing was caused by that problem, and I couldn't properly see where I was going or what I was doing AT ALL.\n\nAs a fellow Game Design Major, I WANT to like this game, even if it's just a college project. And I hope the student got a good grade on this. But as a marketable game, this is an absolute joke. The guy definitely has admirable passion, but REALLY needs to get more experience before he can even HOPE to put something on Steam properly. Good thing it only costs $3 USD, so it's not much of a waste.\n\n1/5 Stars from me. I wish the guy luck in his career, but PLEASE REFINE YOURSELF BETTER FIRST!!","timestamp_created":1604184476,"timestamp_updated":1604184476,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlpG2wPUCfc61qwI="}
