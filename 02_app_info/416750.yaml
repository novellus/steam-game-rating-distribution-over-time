    about_the_game: "Our story begins with the death of Gustav Platte, your father\u2019\
      s older brother. In this world, he was a strong and dour man, who had seen much\
      \ of the world and partook in his fair share of sins. None will dare to guess\
      \ what awaits him in the next world. Through the many festivities he participated\
      \ in he never seemed to revel in them. His eyes held a heaviness only matched\
      \ by the weight of his flail. Some joked that this heaviness suggested the man\
      \ had passed through Iron Forest. And at times it was hard to say, whether they\
      \ were jokes at all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe tale begins with a death, but it\
      \ will not be last before the story\u2019s conclusion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGustav\u2019\
      s estate was divided in accordance with his will. Felsen Castle and the adjoining\
      \ villages passed into your brother\u2019s ownership. Other relatives partitioned\
      \ the estate of Ludahof, the land and a fortune worth several thousand guldens.\
      \ You, however, inherited just a sword and a small casket. You opened the latter\
      \ to find two objects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe one was a metal oak leaf similar\
      \ in size to a real one. At first it seemed a decoration to you but you knew\
      \ the difference between silver and steel. The edge pierced your hand and you\
      \ wondered who would make a decoration that could wound? Curious, you scrutinized\
      \ the leaf closer. The veins were were so thin, its folds and imperfections\
      \ so true to life. The spots and the play of shading was unlike any engraving\

    short_description: You won't find Iron Forest on any map. Not because it doesn't
      exist. But because those who have been there choose not to allow any cartographer
      to pen their route.

    review: 'Absolutely beautiful story. The rest of my opinions on this game are
      in my main game review so concerning this scenario only:


      I thought it was the best of all the stand alone scenarios the game has. Leave
      it for last, if you intend to play them all. There is something about this game
      that makes an emotional impact that very few other games make. To me at least.
      Its just a roller coaster of emotions.  Don''t wanna spoil that bit though.
      But really, you go in expecting one thing and then...


      One of those wow-what-did-I-just-play games. Oh hell.. HUGE spoilers ahead:


      [spoiler]You set out for the iron forest and all the time I was expecting it
      to be a physical place. And the game was rolling and rolling and I kept wondering
      when I''ll get off the map. There is just one map. I don''t know at what point
      it hit me that maybe the ''iron forest'' is just an allegory (??? wrong word
      maybe. I suck at lit) At any rate then toward the end after -I SAID HUGE SPOILERS-
      after I bled to save my three brothers and then lost two off them, I''m standing
      waiting for the battle of my life and the incoming army is described (with pretty
      words that I lack) as an iron forest. It was perfect. And then your only remaining
      brother challenges the bad guy and DIES. And do you know what I was doing? Healing
      and changing equipment! Cause I was dead in the water and it felt so much like...  yeah,
      like I watched the kid die and could do nothing. It was perfect. And when in
      the end you finally get the arrowhead that has been lodged and paining you through
      the game removed and you open the handkerchief and its an iron leaf. DAMN! Yeah!
      Perfect![/spoiler]'
