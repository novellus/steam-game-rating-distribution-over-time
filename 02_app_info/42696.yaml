      \ <strong>Modern Warfare\xAE 3</strong> DLC Collection launches with all-new\
      \ Multiplayer/Survival Mode Maps, Special Ops Missions and the debut of Face\
      \ Off maps. Totally new to the franchise, Face Off distills all the fun and\
      \ intensity of multiplayer into a new breed of 1 vs. 1 and 2 vs. 2 close combat.\
      \ In addition to this all-new game-play experience, Collection 2 deploys with\

      \ Suspended in the air one thousand feet up, you'll battle more than altitude\

      \ and withstood the ravages of time but now they'll face your deployment. Test\
      \ your skills\u2014and the ancient monks' craftsmanship\u2014with your arsenal\

    review: If you're an achievement hunter/completionist then you'll need this to
      finish the achievements for this game. This DLC adds some more Singplayer/Co
      op content which is the only reason I recommend it, but only if you can get
      it for cheaper than it's default asking price on Steam.
