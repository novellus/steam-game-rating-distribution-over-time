    review: 'I''ve heard Murray''s work before - they were brilliant, and this one
      is no exception. You can really hear the care and detail that goes into every
      note. It''s something you''d expect from a high budget motion picture.

      Usually you can tell if instruments in songs are using samples, but this one
      sounds like a legitimate Erhu being played. At this price I felt like I was
      ripping him off. Nice work, Murray!'
