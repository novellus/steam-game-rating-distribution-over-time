So, If you have a spare time, try the other ones too! The first in the series, is Other Age which is free to play, the second one is Other Age Second Encounter which is available also available in steam and in their main store. The only relation of the game on the previous series, is that they are all  parody dating sims, nothing more, nothing less. So you don't need to play the other games to in order to catch up in the story. Relationship-wise, this game has actually a little connection in the \"Present\" in Area-X. Hint: School Uniforms!\n\nAs of now, I complete the whole game and I enjoy the experience\n\nRatings: from highest to lowest.\n\nCharacters (9/10)\n\nThere is not a single character that I hate in this game, I love them all! But to be honest, I prefer the some characters over Manly, the protagonist. However, Manly's character traits blends well with everyone. To put it simply, Manly makes the other character shines more when she is around with them. After unlocking, the extra, I read on the character's profile, then eventually laugh hard when I found out God's interest is censored*. Well, it is hinted on the game what his interest is, it is indirectly revealed in some hidden events. Be sure to check it out. Based on my gameplay this is how rate them. God >>> Rian > Johnny > Muki > Jaki > Manly> Maki >> Doki > Myu-Myu. Most of the charcters has the tendency to be a stalker.lol \n\nStory (9/10)\n\nThe mixture of the most cliche and most impossible things to happen is a perfect touch to create a new storyline, the only thing to complain is how short game's story is, but compare to their other games, this is actually longer.\n\nDifficulty (8/10)\n\nIn order to achieve an ending you need to meet a certain stat and amount of affection in your chosen character. There are hidden events that only appear when you reach  a certain amount of affection. Compare to the previous series, this is easier , but still hard. There are a few minigames that torture my brain. (I'm talking to you Crossword and Sudoku. The most painful part of this, is that I don't know how to use skills in this mini games, because I discovered it so late). I am really proud that I finish all of the levels in the minigames, it was so worth it!\n\nConcept (7/10)\n\nStat-raising is not new to me anymore but adding minigame with it, is great and increase the challenge of the game.\n\nSaving Slots 6/10\n\nSaving slots is a Big Yes! I have play their previous game and most of it has no saving system, so I was glad to have them, but I still need more saving slots. Saving is really crucial in this game, so I recommend adding more in the future, if it is not in this game, put it on your future Projects.\n\nArt 5/10\n\nThe art is cute, but as I progress, and finally get an ending I was disappointed that even the ending CG art is still a chibi. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against chibi art but I prefer their usual arts rather than chibi. I don't know If it is just me, but I feel that they insert lesser effort for the event CGs in this game compared to their previous ones. Other than that, character designs is unique and beautiful while the backgrounds are gorgeous, I personally like the design of heaven realm.\n\nLastly, I recommend this game to someone who is patient, enjoys challenging minigames and for the ones who enjoys their previous games.","timestamp_created":1556657099,"timestamp_updated":1557979047,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.669669151306152344","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xbSy3+oCe5SmwAE="}
