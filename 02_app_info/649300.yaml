    about_the_game: "Wisdom of War is a real-time strategy game with unique style.\
      \ The one side needs to collect resources, develop economy, build up defensive\
      \ and offensive architecture, set up powerful attacking troop and destroy enemies\u2019\
      \ all buildings to obtain final triumph.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDifferent from general\
      \ real-time strategy game, the game only needs to operate a hero for various\
      \ activities. This greatly reduces the demands for hands\u2019 operation speed\
      \ in traditional real-time strategy game so that players can focus on strategy\
      \ application. The game contains many strategies, requiring players to choose\
      \ different strategies according to each other's development.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nAnother characteristic is that, it combines elements of comprehensive arrangement.\
      \ Since the movement of hero and various operations take some time, it is necessary\
      \ to arrange various activities as a whole to achieve highest efficiency.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 5 categories of resources available for collection\
      \ and the methods for collecting various resources are different. Some resources\
      \ will only be obtained by destroying enemy\u2019s troops.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nPlayers can build up over 24 kinds of different buildings and some even carry\
      \ two different auxiliary buildings. Because the functions of auxiliary building\
      \ are different, but the quantity is limited, players need to consider about\
      \ constructing what kind of auxiliary buildings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnemy\u2019\
      s AI carries certain randomness and each game in the same level will experience\
      \ different processes. It means that plays shall play to the score rather than\
      \ adopt fixed strategy each time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game contains three\
      \ modes : encounter mode, conquer mode and online mode."

    review: 'Way too slow. Buliding anything takes forever. Every enemy unit/building
      has a million hp and your units do no damage. You control one unit who has to
      do EVERYTHING: gathering resources, building, researching tech, reloading towers,
      deploying armies, launching missiles, repairing, etc. For each of those, you
      have to physically go to that building, pause the game, access the control hub
      for that building, and then do it. And it even pauses if you try to alt-tab
      to do something else while you wait for e.g. a building to finish. Also, info
      about units and structures is severly lacking.


      It feels like the sort of game you''d create in a college programming course.
      Should''ve gone in early access at least to get feedback from people.'
