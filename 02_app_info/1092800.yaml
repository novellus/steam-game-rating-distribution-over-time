    about_the_game: <strong><i>Summit of the Wolf</i></strong> is a poignant point-and-click
      narrative adventure presented in the visual style of graphic novels.  Created
      by a two-person husband-and-wife indie development team, it features both fantasy
      and real-world segments.<h2 class="bb_tag">STORY</h2>After falling asleep in
      her warm bed one night, twelve-year-old Ophelia wakes up in an ethereal garden
      with no memory of how she got there.  After speaking with a mysterious goddess
      named Adena, Ophelia sets out on a personal journey to find the fabled Summit
      of the Wolf, whereupon she must uncover the tragic real-world events that led
      to her arrival in this fantasy realm.  Will Ophelia complete her quest, or will
      she succumb to the many dangers she must face along the way?<h2 class="bb_tag"></h2>Meanwhile,
      in the real world, Ophelia lies comatose in the hospital, and a sympathetic
      nurse attempts to uncover the truth behind the tragic events that led to her
      life-threatening injury.  Ophelia's parents insist that she fell down the stairs
      in the middle of the night...but can they be trusted, or are they hiding a dark
      secret?<h2 class="bb_tag"></h2>At its core, <strong><i>Summit of the Wolf</i></strong>
      is a game about trauma and its psychological effect on children.  Inspired by
      true events and written by a medical professional (and fellow survivor), <i>Summit
      of the Wolf</i> endeavors to shed light on the topic of child abuse by showcasing
      the emotions that are experienced by a young girl as she makes the transition
      from victim to survivor.  While the game does not shy away from the darkness
      of the topic, the tone is ultimately positive and, hopefully, both inspiring
      and empowering.<h2 class="bb_tag">GAMEPLAY</h2><strong><i>Summit of the Wolf</i></strong>
      is a cross between a traditional 2D point-and-click first-person adventure game
      and a visual novel.  It is presented in the visual style of graphic novels and
      focuses on exploration and narrative. Explore the world by navigating from scene
      to scene. Separate inventory, map, journal, and character screens are available
      at the push of a button. All standard adventure game mechanics are present,
      including locations to explore, items to collect and use, characters to meet
      and interact with, and puzzles to solve--all without any major pixel hunting!<h2

      notes: Summit of the Wolf explores themes that some may find disturbing and/or
        may not be suitable to younger audiences, including STRONG references to child
        sexual and emotional abuse.  There are also depictions of suicide.  While
        nothing is gratuitous and the tone is ultimately positive, we do not shy away
        from the topics.  Discretion is highly advised.  If you have any questions
        or concerns about the game's content, please do not hesitate to contact us.

    review: "[h1]A EXTENDED REVIEW ([b]ENG/GER[/b])[/h1]\n\n[h3][u]Eng:[/u][/h3]\n\
      \nAt first I was very hesitating to get this game because of the art style but\
      \ I got it recommended and gave it a try which I surely dont regret.\nIt took\
      \ me an hour to get used to it after which I really started to get into the\
      \ story and enjoyed it.\nStill the non fluid camera movement made it for me\
      \ sometimes hard to watch.\nBut thats actually were all the negativity ends.\
      \ Well for me atleast... the story has still a long way to go.\nI love how u\
      \ have this 3 realities. The story she gets forced into by a wild beast while\
      \ she is really just in a dream doing what its supossed to do and help her to\
      \ process.\nAnd on the other side we have this very clear showcased disturbing\
      \ reality.\nIts very noticable that its not our journey. We in the third perspectiv\
      \ have the full extend while we only can watch and hope from scene to scene\
      \ that she also will gain full concionous.\nAnd when the borders finally blurred\
      \ I'm glad she decided differently from princess Ilo while I think it would\
      \ be bad to judge any side on their decision as both deserve respect.\nSo all\
      \ in all it was a very [i]enjoyable experience[/i]. Okay that was a lie its\
      \ pretty disgusting when the final barrier fades away and you remember that\
      \ this is daily reality. And that is the beauty of this gmae.\nA part about\
      \ in our firefighter training is the confrontation with what will await us when\
      \ the pager doesnt read \"test\".\nProblems doesnt need to be tackeld only by\
      \ the ones confronted and thats why I have to recommend this.\nI'm glad this\
      \ medium does exist and can give us feeling for it so we can understand that\
      \ its important to watch out for those vunerable.\nOpening our eyes is always\
      \ the first step to an better future so lets all just take a moment and remind\
      \ us that every of us can do a change with just looking out for each other like\
      \ the nurse did for her.\nSo if you read to this point know its your turn for\
      \ training.\n\n[h3][u]Ger:[/u][/h3]\n\nDa ihr bereits hier am lesen seit habt\
      \ ihr schon teilweise Interesse gezeigt. \nLasst mich diesen noch weiter f\xFC\
      ttern. Ich habe ungef\xE4hr 9 Stunden mit diesem Spiel verbracht und bereits\
      \ nach der ersten Stunde war ich in dieser Geschichte gefangen.\nOhne zu spoilern\
      \ kann ich verraten dieses Spiel hat einen starken Bezug zur wirklichen Welt\
      \ bez\xFCglich mentalen Leidens und dessens Konsequenzen und Verarbeitung.\n\
      Es ist eine Reise durch das Leben eines Opfers, dass sich entscheidet und im\
      \ Grunde schon selbst entschieden hatte, dass es sich nicht ihrem Schicksal\
      \ beugt und kein Opfer bleibt.\nDiese Reise wird einen tats\xE4chlich sehr kindlich\
      \ beigef\xFChrt, denn es ist nicht unserer Reise. Es ist ihre und wir sind jediglich\
      \ die Zuschauer.\nWir werden zudem auch noch mit alternativen Entscheidungen\
      \ konfrontiert mit solchen Ereignissen umzugehen. Davon hatte mich eine tats\xE4\
      chlich \xFCberrascht. Nach dem Film The Autopsy of Jane Doe dachte ich ich w\xFC\
      rde nie so blind sein wie der Vater im Film aber das Spiel hat mich vom Gegenteil\
      \ \xFCberzeugt.\n\xDCberzeugt ich muss mehr auf das achten was um mich herum\
      \ geschieht.\nUnd das ist die wahre Sch\xF6nheit dieses Spiels.\nEine Konfrontation\
      \ und gleichzeitig eine Lehre aufmerksam zu sein und nach einer besseren Gesellschaft\
      \ zu streben.\nSpieletechnisch waren da einige R\xE4tsel die Spa\xDF gemacht\
      \ haben. Als Mathematiker bin ich sowieso ein fan von R\xE4tseln.\nDie Grafik\
      \ wird einen nicht umhauen aber definitiv auch nicht verscheuchen.\nLeider muss\
      \ ich sagen manche Sequenzen sind teilweise stotternd. Das ist dann etwas schwer\
      \ zuzuschauen aber das ist jetzt auch nicht der Gro\xDFteil des Spiels.\nAlso\
      \ wenn ihr Geschichten und Emotionen in Spielen m\xF6gt holt es euch.\n\n\n\
