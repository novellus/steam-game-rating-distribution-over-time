It reads like a love letter to HP Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe. It's a compulsive read for sure. What I particularly love is how this story ties into the events of Caliban Below... there are things here that hint at the VR experience, but the two together are really greater than the sum of the parts.  It's clear that Blackthorn has huge ambitions for storytelling, and if they succeed in bringing this project to fruition in totality, it will stand a chance of defining the genre.","timestamp_created":1541401451,"timestamp_updated":1541401451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.582309544086456299","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n/Or8eYCf/2KrgE="}
