In the first case you start with no clue on the whole story, but as you progress the game becomes more fun (also a lot of inside jokes help to make it more fun to keep playing). I love puzzle games so I recommend this game to others who also like similar games. \n\ntip: it took me quite some effort and random clicking before I found out I could combine items and what to do with them. I recommend giving more clue's about this ;-)\n\nThumbs up for an original and suprising story!","timestamp_created":1594649549,"timestamp_updated":1594649549,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jKOhpPMCeIWElQI="}
