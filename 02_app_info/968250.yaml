    about_the_game: "<strong>King of Retail</strong> is a store management simulation\
      \ game, where you, as the owner of a new store, must make the right decisions\
      \ to make your store thrive and bring you the big bucks. Can you handle the\
      \ pressure, or will you fail miserably in a big bankruptcy?<br><br>As the owner\
      \ and manager, you have a lot of daily responsibilities:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Choose the direction of your store</h2>Should it be a Shoe Store for the fashionable\
      \ type, an Electronics Store for your everyday needs, or a giant Hypermarket\
      \ that sells a bit of everything? Not everything will work. Trying to sell high-fashion,\
      \ high-priced items in the poor part of town will not generate endless queues\
      \ at your register. Will you try to dominate a competitive market, or go in\
      \ a new direction?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Control the flow of goods</h2>A lot of\
      \ things need to happen before an article gets taken home by a customer. First,\
      \ you must select and order the goods. Then, you need to make sure you have\
      \ storage space available so that you can receive and handle the delivered articles.\
      \ The sales area must have the right displays and shelving to showcase and make\
      \ the articles sell. Building a good relationship with your suppliers is critical\
      \ to being able to sell your more exclusive items. Oh, and by the way, which\
      \ article should be the first thing your customers see when they enter your\
      \ store? First impressions count! So will you go with the bulk selling jeans,\
      \ or the hyped-up silk shirt?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Attract more customers </h2>Build\
      \ a strong reputation with your customers, and make your store the most popular\
      \ one in town. A good marketing campaign, along with happy customers, will work\
      \ wonders for your income. But don't oversell your store and its items. If you\
      \ can't deliver what you promised, the customers will leave the store dissatisfied,\
      \ and nothing ruins a store quicker than unhappy customers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Customer is King</h2>Create an enjoyable atmosphere for your customers to shop\
      \ in, and theme your store, so they will know it is YOUR store they have entered.\
      \ Make sure they receive the help they need, and that the lines for the registers\
      \ don't grow too long. Manage the in-store marketing, so that both the fashionistas\
      \ and the discount-hunters know where to go and which article to pick.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Manage your personnel</h2>The more successful your store becomes, the\
      \ busier you\u2019ll get. At some point, you will have to hire more staff. Find\
      \ interesting candidates among the applications. Conduct interviews, get a feel\
      \ for the person and decide if they match the role you had in mind for them.\
      \ Negotiate their salary and hire them. Keep them happy, and make sure they\
      \ are not overworked. A great working climate results in strong dedication.\
      \ But you still need to sort the slackers from the workers. Invest time in the\
      \ right persons, and train them to become better so when you need a stand-in\
      \ for yourself, when you move to the next store, you can pick from your home-grown\
      \ talents.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Optimise the store</h2>The difference between\
      \ a good store and a great store is in the details. Optimise your stock by removing\
      \ poor-selling articles, and ordering more of the good ones. Make sure your\
      \ inventory doesn\u2019t run out but make sure you don\u2019t order too much\
      \ either. Optimise the prizes to increase your revenue. Find the customer patterns\
      \ and adjust the opening hours accordingly. Plan an efficient staff schedule,\
      \ so you don't pay people for doing nothing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Corporation\
      \ Mode</h2>Control multiple stores in various parts of the city. Adapt and buy\
      \ the right articles for the locals. Expand your headquarters and evolve your\
      \ concepts. Find the right managers, and ensure that you make the right investments\
      \ at the right time.<br><br>Are you ready to take on the challenge?"
