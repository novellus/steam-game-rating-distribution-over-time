    review: "God, I'm only half an hour in and bored out of my mind.\n\nGoing into\
      \ a digital world, everyone cares about idols, nothing happens in the story,\
      \ etc.\n\nLike, this is some record breaking levels of awfulness.  I got it\
      \ for the cute girls tbh, and I'm disappointed.  \n\nYou think they would try\
      \ to put a somewhat decent story in here but it's just a vapid excuse to have\
      \ a couple of JPGS of the cutely drawn girls.\n\nThis is legit worse than Sakura\
      \ Spirit.  At least stuff actually happened in that game.  here, it's dull,\
      \ boring, and awful.\n\nIf I had paid full price for this, my head would have\
      \ exploded. Getting the trading cards for this game and then never turning it\
      \ on again.\n\nAvoid this game like the plague."
