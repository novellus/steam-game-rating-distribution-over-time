    review: 'Well, the game is really enjoyable, despite costing a fortune in it''s
      early access stage.


      Pros:

      + good music.

      + good combat and overall mechanics,

      + challenging challenges.

      + high scores & weekly feats.

      + has level editor.


      Cons:

      - characters most likely will not be voiced.

      - still in development (needs more levels/adventures).

      - expensive.

      - crashes to desktop occasionally.

      - single player forces keyboard controls.'
