Maybe it's just personal preference, but I often felt like it cut straight to the drama without easing us in first. I prefer Clannad, but this is still a good story. \n[spoiler]Kyousuke is best boy.[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1609798351,"timestamp_updated":1609798400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgMfd5/YCcaPDwAI="}
