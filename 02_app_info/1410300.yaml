    review: "This is a great party game for rock-blasting retro space fun.  I love\
      \ the drop in/drop out feature and the massive number of gamepads supported.\n\
      There's also a bit more to it than you might expect:\n  Several ships to choose\
      \ from, each with their own unique style\n  Bring dead allies back to life\n\
      \  Collect space dust to power up\n  Collect debris from destroyed alien ships\
      \ to unlock new ships and upgrades\n\nPlay it now!  you know you want to."
