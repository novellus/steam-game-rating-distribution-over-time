[/h1]\n\nThis VR experience only lasts about 1-2 minutes long in total, and there is very little to engage with. For the most part, you're just looking at your surroundings and watching all the so-called \"hyper realistic\" animation while you're standing still in a barrel as a clown pushes you through the circus tent on a cart. \n\nThe only three notable gameplay features consist of shooting at moving targets with cork revolvers, killing black widow spiders with strongman mallets, and holding up a flaming hoop for a tiger to jump through. After that, there's a fart joke where the clown breaks wind as a cannon fires confetti, and then he fans the smell around like a total jackass. Then the experience wraps up with a dreadful motion-sickness-inducing sequence that consists of the clown growing into a giant, picking up the barrel while you're still in it, swinging you around while laughing, and then finally [b] swallowing you whole. [/b]\n\n(For the record, I'm not saying that this conclusion made me feel motion sick in particular; I'm saying that this could honestly make anybody feel motion sick, what with all the dangling movement from being swung around in the air. Even iron-stomached VR veterans would find this sequence slightly disorienting.)\n\nDon't buy Lost Circus VR unless you plan to refund it once you finish, or are patient enough to wait for further development updates, because there's barely any content or replay value to it at the moment. Sure, it has a retail price of only $5, but you can get a lot more fun out of other cheap games like Among Us or even Five Nights at Freddy's for just $5. Or if that isn't a fair comparison to this VR title, there are plenty of games like The Lab, Rec Room, and VRChat that are available to download for free and have more content to enjoy.\n\nI certainly anticipate continual production on this game beyond the prologue, because right now I can't recommend buying this after [strike] playing [/strike] standing around in its current early access stage.","timestamp_created":1609106402,"timestamp_updated":1609260216,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw7MXY1/YCccvyvQI="}
