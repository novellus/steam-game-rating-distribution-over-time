I enjoy it thouroughly as a fun casual game but its far from a substitute from real volleyball\nTheres only 4 players on a team\nNo roles (Setter, libero, middle blocker etc) which leads to situations where im expecting to get set to and then the ball suddenly gets received to me for me to set. If you have aim assist off setting can be a real pain. \nNo rules so rather frequently a receiver will set straight into a front row player from the back row\nAs many flaws and bugs as it has... I still do very much enjoy it and reccomend it to anyone looking to play some volleyball during the quarantine we're currently in.","timestamp_created":1609364049,"timestamp_updated":1609364049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4xtHk2vYCdPnzvgI="}
