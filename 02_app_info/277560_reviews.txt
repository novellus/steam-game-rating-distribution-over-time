The entire game is like this and it's played completely straight. \n\nIf that setup doesn't give you a chuckle, this is not the casual puzzle adventure game you're looking for.\n\nThe bulk of the gameplay consists of playing look n' find in the background art as you do literal chores for the monks and villagers.  Eventually by doing this you arrive at puzzles which range from bad to moderately challenging.  Myst it ain't, but the simplicity of the puzzles rhymes with the absurdity of the plot.\n\nI paid $1 for this on sale, but I'd have paid full price if I knew I was striking comedy gold.","timestamp_created":1607492422,"timestamp_updated":1607492422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl/mAo/YCcKWquAI="}
