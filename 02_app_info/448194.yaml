    about_the_game: "The DB BR 101 is a classic among the modern electric locomotives\
      \ of Germany, with heritage spanning some of the nation\u2019s most revolutionary\
      \ designs and continuing the honour by working throughout the Deutsche Bahn\
      \ network every day. Partner Programme Developer Virtual Railroads brings this\
      \ classic locomotive to life in a true expert simulation of the class as it\
      \ joins the Pro Range line-up for Train Simulator.<br><br>In the early 1990s,\
      \ a majority of Germany\u2019s express passenger services were undertaken by\
      \ locomotives that date back to the 1970s including the DB BR 103 and DB BR\
      \ 120. Both once-revolutionary locomotives had more than outlived their purpose\
      \ where they were now hauling heavier trains than they had ever been designed\
      \ for, this resulted in a lot of damage over time with increasingly poor reliability\
      \ rates and maintenance costs. Germany was in desperate need of a new express\
      \ passenger locomotive.<br><br>Following the reunification of Germany, the newly\
      \ formed Deutsche Bahn AG (DBAG) went on the lookout for designs, with many\
      \ manufacturing companies bidding for the deal. There were over 30 designs in\
      \ the second phase of bidding some of which were quickly eliminated, in particular\
      \ the non-German manufacturers. One company in particular, ABB Henschel, didn\u2019\
      t even have a design ready to show, but more of a concept known as the eco2001.\
      \ The eco2001 was basically 2 modified DB BR 120s, with changes to various components\
      \ that massively increases the reliability of the locomotives.<br><br>In 1994,\
      \ DB signed a deal with ABB which would develop into an order of 145 locomotives\
      \ the following year, with the first locomotive completed and displayed in the\
      \ Orient Red livery by July 1996. Around this time, ABB had merged with AEG\
      \ to form ADtranz, this was beneficial because it meant the future DB BR 101s\
      \ would be built quicker in multiple locations. Different components were built\
      \ at a variety of facilities, with the final assembly taking place in Poland.\
      \ The first DB BR 101 officially entered service in February 1997.<br><br>The\
      \ DB BR 101 was designed and procured to be an efficient, high speed passenger\
      \ locomotive and is capable of achieving this in part due to the carefully structured\
      \ sloped front and rear of the locos. This slope may look extreme in places,\
      \ but it optimises streamlined efficiency to its maximum especially when compared\
      \ to its cost-effectiveness. The slope is also designed not to disrupt the flow\
      \ of air between the rear of the locomotive and whatever it may be hauling.\
      \ The DB BR 101 was also designed with bogies derived from the ICE series, as\
      \ a basis for potential speed modifications in the future, as fast as 250 km/h.<br><br>All\
      \ 145 locomotives were completed by 1999 and entered service hauling express\
      \ passenger services across the Deutsche Bahn network including the likes of\
      \ the Nuremberg \u2013 Munich High Speed Line where the 101s operate the fastest\
      \ regional service in Germany at 200 km/h. All the DB BR 101s are based in Hamburg\
      \ where they receive their periodic safety checks and maintenance, they were\
      \ originally based in Frankfurt, but with the rapid increase of the various\
      \ ICE series\u2019 and push-pull operated consists, they were moved to Hamburg\
      \ despite the amount of driver training that would require, the 101s sometimes\
      \ visit Nuremburg for major maintenance works.<br><br>The basis of the DB BR\
      \ 101 has its roots in some of the most ground breaking electric locomotives,\
      \ so much so it shares a lot of heritage with the popular TRAXX series of locomotives\
      \ and a variation of the DB BR 101 was ordered for a most unlikely customer,\
      \ New Jersey Transit, which in the early 2000s worked with ADtranz/Bombardier\
      \ to procure their ALP-46 and ALP-46A locomotives.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included\
