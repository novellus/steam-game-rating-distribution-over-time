    review: "Edit: Update 07/01/21 \nIt's dead Jim. Its name is now ironically its\
      \ player count\nThere were no hidden gems here, last time I played the game\
      \ had some real problems running on an ultrawide resolution and as I'd gone\
      \ over 2 hours steam wouldn't refund (despite me showing proof the game wouldn't\
      \ run properly for me and that the games support had no real answers). Probably\
      \ the only game I have ever actually regretted buying. Its a shame, the team\
      \ videos I saw made them look like a nice enough bunch of people.\n\nPopulation\
      \ Zero isn't really ground breaking with regards to in game mechanics. It's\
      \ a survival game that is far more basic with regards to building and survival\
      \ than say, Ark, Conan Exiles or even FO76. It feels a bit clunky control wise\
      \ compared to AAA games.\n\nIt's buggy, not feature complete by a long shot.\
      \ Its a multiplayer game that released without a way to join your friends in\
      \ game. The servers also seem to have a little meltdown every now and then.\
      \ But hey that's early access games all over and if you buy into EA you should\
      \ know by now what you're getting yourself in for.\n\nWhat it does has this\
      \ cool hook with the seven day reset, I think its a really neat idea and it\
      \ sets it apart from other games of this genre. Its visually pleasing and it\
      \ does posses a certain charm.\n\nIf you like games like this, I think you'll\
      \ enjoy Population Zero. I'm not going to go so far as to recommend the game\
      \ in its current state and only say you should buy it if you can cope with a\
      \ far from finished product (even possibly by EA standards) but I 100% think\
      \ you should stick it on your wishlist or follow to see how it improves over\
      \ time. I am hoping theres a real hidden gem in here."
