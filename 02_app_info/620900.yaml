      \ on playing fast, inspired by games like Nuclear Throne, Vampire of the Sands,\
      \ and Risk of Rain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou play as Nour, a witch in training\
      \ who lost her spell book while exploring a dungeon. You'll have to dodge, shoot,\
      \ cast, and upgrade your way through the dungeon's randomized floors to get\
      \ it back, but don't take it easy... the dungeon will become more alert as you\
      \ make your way downwards, making enemies fiercer and unraveling the environment;\
      \ clear floors quickly to keep your alert level in check!"
