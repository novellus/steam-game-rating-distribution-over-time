    review: "Developed and Published by Art Of Adventures\n\nTHE CARS\nThere are 4.\
      \ Two are simply re-skins of the other two. As you move up from one car to the\
      \ next there is an increase in performance over the previous ones. However,\
      \ this will depend on you using your winnings to purchase upgrades. Your damage\
      \ is reflected in a health bar, but doesn't alter the way your car looks.\n\n\
      UPGRADES\nThere are three upgrade paths. Speed, Controls, and Armor. My first\
      \ impression was that this game controls poorly, but you will see an improvement\
      \ as you upgrade Controls. \n\nCOURSES\nQuite disappointing. There are only\
      \ 3 and the designs are rather bland. Only the first track is available at first.\
      \ You unlock subsequent tracks by using your funds from your winnings.\n\nCONTROLS\n\
      This is the most  frustrating aspect of this game for me, as there is no controller\
      \ support. You must use a keyboard. Left and Right arrow keys for steering,\
      \ up arrow is for acceleration, and the down arrow is reverse. \n\nWEAPONS\n\
      You can fit weapons such as guided missiles to your car (Q key to fire), or\
      \ you can rely on your side-mounted guns. They fire automatically once you are\
      \ in range of an enemy.\n\nA.I.\nActually quite good. The enemy cars don't just\
      \ focus all of their attention on you, but the other racers as well. When you\
      \ start a race you never know how many laps there will be. Could be 1, 2, or\
      \ 3.\n\nGRAPHICS\nPerhaps acceptable for the Saturn, but not the Dreamcast (not\
      \ actually released for either console). When you launch the game you can select\
      \ windowed or full screen, and choose the resolution of your choice.\n\nMUSIC\n\
      Acceptable I guess, but no variety.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\n24. I've earned 21. Earning\
      \ them all within an hour would be doable for a better player. Actually, I could\
      \ do it in that time as well if this game had controller support.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\
      Marginal recommendation. It depends on how much the game is going for at the\
      \ time of purchase and how good you are at driving with a keyboard, and if the\
      \ number of cars (4) and tracks (3) is enough to satisfy you."
