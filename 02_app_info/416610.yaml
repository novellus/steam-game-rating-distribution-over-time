    review: 'This is a collection of interesting ideas that ultimately add up to a
      disappointing experience due to uneven level design and an obscure scoring system.
      The basic don''t-touch-the-walls gameplay works well, although with a very sharp
      difficulty curve on the first two levels. The game says it supports lower resolution
      monitors, but the level designs basically unplayable at those smaller sizes
      due to the need to navigate gaps that are a tiny fraction of the screen size.


      Each pack of 10 levels gives you a score (generally ~4-7 points) per level upon
      completion, where it seems 4=ok, 5=good, 6=great and 7=flawless. However, you
      need 60 points to unlock the next level pack -- that is, you need 10x6 (great)
      to average A/- proficiency on every level. Getting stuck on mastering even one
      level (4) can entirely lock you out of the next pack unless you collect a batch
      of 7s to overcome it. I notice that at present only 3% of players actually made
      it to the next level pack.


      Another problem is that the level designs often require a balance of speed and
      growth -- most, but not all available grown combined with as much speed is possible.
      However, the algorithm for the optimal combination is not evident. If you get
      a "5" on a level, should you get bigger and go a little slower, or should you
      try for a bit smaller and faster? It isn''t clear, so the player must repeat
      a level many times with slight variations on strategy, hoping that the final
      score will increase on one of the completions. Failing to achieve a goal is
      frustrating enough -- not knowing the goal at all is maddening.'
