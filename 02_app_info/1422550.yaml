      hemp empire from seed to sale. Have the flexibility of growing hemp on a farm,
      processing hemp into other products, selling hemp at a dispensary or do it all.
      Trade everything on the market, unless of course there's a shortage!<br></li><li>
      Planning to release on Steam for PC, Mac &amp; Linux. With the potential for
      a platform release in the future.</li></ul><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1422550/extras/ea43ce6f-5aef-41a8-9896-14675a3bbfbf_orig.jpg?t=1600743301"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Concept</h2><br>Imagine being able to start your own hemp
      company and grow it to as small or as big as you want it to be. You can start
      with growing hemp on a farm, manage delivery and logistics to sell on the market.
      Expand by opening your own dispensaries and selling your own product while still
      selling your excess on the market. Build out your dispensary, hire staff to
      manage your farm and retail establishments. Process raw hemp into other products
      like tinctures, concentrates, edibles and more. Expand your empire and go full
      seed to sale. Create trade routes between farms, processors, retail establishments
      and the market.<h2 class="bb_tag">Grow</h2>Create a grow operation and grow
      hemp indoor &amp; outdoor. Manage required materials to grow such as water,
      supplements and lighting if growing indoor. Create processor buildings on your
      farms to process raw hemp into other refined products.<h2 class="bb_tag">Sell</h2>Create
      a dispensary or a chain of dispensaries, sell your hemp products including raw
      hemp flower and refined products. You can also sell to other dispensaries that
      may be interested in your products.<h2 class="bb_tag">Trade</h2>Buy and sell
      pretty much anything on the open market. Import needed raw hemp to your processor
      buildings if your farm can't keep up. Sell excess raw hemp. We are designing
      a very flexible system that will be open for greater creativity.
