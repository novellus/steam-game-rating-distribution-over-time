    review: 'This game is really fun to play :D


      I love its tuny style and the simplicity!! The more you progress the harder
      it gets. Theres so many mechanics well thought through and so many puzzles I
      didnt think of at first. And its really fun to progress. I thought it was gonna
      repeat the same patterns, but its very diverse throughout the game!!


      It sucks that there is no exit option other than alt+f4 and no pause menu, but
      its in alpha after all, so cant complain.


      Definitly recommend this game, its really fun to play  !!!!


      Pros:

      - simplicity

      - always new patterns and very diverse

      - music/tune

      - many levels

      - fun to play


      Cons:

      - no pause menu

      - no exit option other than alt+f4'
