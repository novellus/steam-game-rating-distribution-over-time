      \ his beloved missing daughter, the divine Jade Emperor opened the gates of\

      \ so that worthy mortals could appeal to the Jade Emperor and obtain divine\
      \ powers, to aid in the search of his missing daughter. However, this gift was\
      \ exploited and taken advantage of, causing chaos in the mortal realm. The Nine\
