    review: 'The devs use that low-budget display & options prompt every time the
      game launches. You cannot see or interact with this prompt while wearing a VR
      headset, so you have to take the headset off, which interrupts the VR experience
      and inevitably screws up the positioning. No amount of resetting the view afterwards
      will fix the positioning.


      You''d think they would have maybe tried to play their own game before selling
      it. I guess not. Maybe it runs great? Who knows.'
