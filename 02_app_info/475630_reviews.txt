The concept of Crush Online is to try to combine MMOs, MOBAs, isometic RPGs and Pay To Win games into an ugly monster. The objective of the developer is to make you sign up for a VIP level 4 package so that they can milk you for all the money you have. With the VIP Level 4 package, you will gain loads of crystals that you can use to buff your character, unlock inventory slots and upgrade your weapons. There are a whole list of limitations that hide behind a paywall in this game.\n\nYou start off by creating 1 of 3 different classes, Saint, Punisher or Guardian. Each of them has a primary and secondary weapon that can be switched by pressing Spacebar. Each weapon gives them 4 different abilities that can be activated by pressing QWER, similar to MOBAs. As you level up, you can unlock a Main and Sub talent tree for your class. Moving around the map is simple, it is exactly like any other isometric RPG. Click and move. Along the way, you can even play a MOBA match for PvP, where you rush to down the enemy's tower in a single lane battle.\n\nConclusion, don't play this Pay To Win game. Hendrik Lesser, Achim Kaspers and Markus Wilding are the ones who helped publish this game. GamesinFlames is a very apt description of the games that make, they crash and burn to make short term money.\n\n[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]\n1. They Made Something\nYou can run it. Doesn't crash.\n\n[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]\n1. Pay To Win\nLet me list the ways that the in-game currency, Jewels, help you Pay To Win. 100 USD for 95 Jewels.\na. Inventory Slots\nb. Weapons\nc. EP \nd. SP\n\n2. Copied PvP Directly from League of Legends 1v1\nSeriously, it's the MOBA genre. It's trash.\n\n3. VIP 1 to 4\nYou have to pay money to get Jewels to become a VIP to get special privileges and unlock more Jewels. It's a neverending cycle of leeching.\n\n4. No Character Design\nThe classes are the 3 basic pillars, Attack, Support and Tank. Junk design.\n\n5. Red, Green and Blue Country\nSeriously? That's the best you could come up with?","timestamp_created":1486279012,"timestamp_updated":1575601210,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494857102632522583","comment_count":22,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqdDJ7O4Cc+yrcQ=="}
