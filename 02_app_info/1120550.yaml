    review: "If you love making up your own wrestlers like i do, this DLC is a great\
      \ addition to FPW\nIt has however, really really clunky to use.\n\nThe fact\
      \ that you have to use the workshop to add your created part to the game itself,\
      \ even if you don't care about sharing your creations online is probably the\
      \ worst part of this DLC. \nIt's feels backwards, and it takes forever.\nFirst\
      \ you have to make your part, upload it to the Workshop, make sure you you have\
      \ listed in the proper category, download it from said Workshop, exit out of\
      \ the game, and then boot the game back up.\nThen you can finally see your part\
      \ in the game, only to find out that its centered wrong and looks like crap.\n\
      Then you go back to your image editing software of choice to fix  it, then upload\
      \ it o the Workshop again,\nlather rinse repeat. \n\nI'm not sure what other\
      \ method they could've done, but this felt a little slap-dashed, and like a\
      \ lot of other people here have stated, you can do everything in the DLC for\
      \ free using mods.\n\nSo why do i recommend it?\nBecause despite all of the\
      \ short comings it has, it stills gives you endless potential on what you can\
      \ make,\nand you don't have to learn how to mod to do it.\nWhich is great for\
      \ people like me who don't want to get into modding all that much.\nI'll gladly\
      \ pay 30 bucks for that.\n\nAnd frankly, I don't see 30 bucks being seen as\
      \ too expensive.\npeople spend more than that on delivery food now a days, and\
      \ that's gone once it's eaten.\nThis thing you can use forever, or at least\
      \ until you die or whatever. \n"
