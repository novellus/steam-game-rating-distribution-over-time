    review: I don't think the game is bad but there are 3 big issues 1)not a way to
      keep track on what you got to do 2) no map, not all rpg maker games have maps
      but this one needs it 3) the monsters are more irritating than scary because
      they just stun lock you (even when you are in front of a door) and you are forced
      to wait till your character dies to restart, it's purly rng without any short
      of real stealth to it and it would be much better if the monsters didnt stun
      you. If the maker took some time to make an update addresing those things then
      it would be a nice little rpg horror but as it is, it doesn't justify itself
      as a paid game when there are a lot better free rpg horrors out there.You can
      easily fix this Satria, it only needs some tweaking to make it into an actaully
      enjoyable spooky game.
