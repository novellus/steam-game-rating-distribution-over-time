    review: 'Fun but short.


      Imagantive, original roguelike, kind of like Bloodbowl meets Into The Breach,
      but without the randomness of blood bowl. But there''s only 12 short levels
      and got through it in about 4 hours, though I do play a lot of roguelikes. Hope
      the devs add more content.


      Edit: My review time is because after I beat the game (which took 4 hours) I
      decided to try to optimise my team and aim to be #1 on the scorboard, which
      brought my time to 15 hours. Then every so often I played this game when I was
      feeling stressed or wanted to relax, but I dunno if everyone would do that'
