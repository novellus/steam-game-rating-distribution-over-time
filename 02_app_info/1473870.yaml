    about_the_game: "Hell Loop is a platformer tower defense game, unlike any other\
      \ tower defense game you know. You are not defending anything valuable. You\
      \ are torturing sinners who are continually marching, one by one in a long streak,\
      \ trying to evade their punishment. This game is about carefully selecting from\
      \ your available punishment tools in the form of traps and carefully deciding\
      \ where to place them. Every trap has its own advantage, every spot is suitable\
      \ for a different situation. Blood is your resource and you only have a limited\
      \ amount.<br><br>What is the best punishment? Falling into a spike trap popping\
      \ out suddenly from the ground, the good old ballista with its deadly massive\
      \ arrow, or a modern Tesla coil delivering instant electric shots to anyone\
      \ close enough? You have the options, the humans have only one hope: there are\
      \ many of them. Maybe you will be so distracted setting up the traps that some\
      \ of them will manage to escape. The halls of hell are large and it is difficult\
      \ to guard them all. The humans are also fast and your resources are limited.\
      \ What can you do with just a handful of traps?<br><br>The game is fast-paced\
      \ - but you are the manager of hell and that has its own perks, like the ability\
      \ to pause time and strategize. You are observing the situation from high above,\

    review: 'I woke up this morning, put my Christmas socks on and hit Refresh. Bam!
      Game released. Slapped that Purchase button.

      Hit play. Refreshing take on the Tower Defense genre. 11/10, would recommend.
      Play it or else, you don''t want to end up in the Hell Loop now would you?


      Peace,
