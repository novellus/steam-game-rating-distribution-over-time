      for art, or as a productivity planner for your next big video game. You can
      tweak how it looks to your liking, with themes and a variety of different visual
      options. With the plan being freeform, you can space your plan out to your liking,
      and even spread it across multiple &quot;pages&quot;, or Boards. In addition,
      projects are saved as plain, human-readable JSON files, ensuring compatibility
