    review: Just an awesome game of sudoku. Simple in design, elegant in execution,
      very easy to get into and very hard to let go of. I've played the same sudoku
      puzzles over and over again improving my times. just spectacular. Also for those
      who don't know, go to their YouTube channel Cracking the Cryptic. Highly recommended
