I was really pleased with the high quality of these monsters and there are  a lot of famous Japan favourites from all kinds of wonderful folklore. I'd love to see a second pack created if you were going to make an entire game which was japan themed. However, for games which use a japan zone this is ideal. There are plenty of classic boss monsters to be used as well as great designs for your normal encounters. With a bit of knowledge of japan folklore you can create some amazing boss fights from a great selection of well known yokai from Japan. Really love this set and I highly recommend it.","timestamp_created":1602791696,"timestamp_updated":1602791696,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6Iz1lvUCdb6JqAI="}
