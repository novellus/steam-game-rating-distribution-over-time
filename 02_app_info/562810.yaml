    review: 'This game has so much potential, the idea is great and the effects and
      the design of this Monopoly is just fantastic.


      !!! BUT:


      The community is very small therefore it is difficult to find players for a
      match.


      However my main critique is regarding controls: You can use mouse as well as
      keyboard BUT you cannot enter numbers, meaning you have to click the "+" or
      "-" button in order to adjust the desired number both in settings and ingame
      (for trades in instance). And this is actually unbelievable that a developer
      called Ubisoft publishes something like that. This issue makes playing very
      uncomfortable, annoying and it''s just inacceptable.

      I hope this will be fixed any time, so far unfortunately I cannot recommend
      anybody to buy this game.'
