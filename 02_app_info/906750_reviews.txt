The gun mechanic is so basic it hurts...  enemies come out nowhere to attack you and they explode to hurt you.  You could try your best to anticipate where the AI will be, even going slowly around corners, and then it will just hit you and explode, killing you or coming close.  If you make it to another chapter and go back to the previous chapter through a portal, it will reset all of the next chapter you just did.  This is a terrible save mechanic, and you cannot save yourself!  I cannot fathom this being a thing in a game based on slowly killing NPCs and mass exploration.  There may be a story to the game, but it's just killed by all the annoyances and basic clunky mechanics with overall poor design. \n\nIt could work, but not based on what it is.  I ended up asking for a refund.","timestamp_created":1567571626,"timestamp_updated":1567571626,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.702508866786956787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgZmj/ewCesDS0QE="}
