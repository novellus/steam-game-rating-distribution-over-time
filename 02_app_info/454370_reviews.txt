It's in EA, so take the opportunity to tell us what you've update...what you're working on...what's to come. That's part of what we love about EA titles is engagement with the dev team and experiencing a project's evolution first hand. \n\nFor god's sake, dev team, hire a community manager or something and just tell us what is going on...even if it's nothing!","timestamp_created":1529172068,"timestamp_updated":1533073763,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472636818885803223","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4q6WU+eQCfcGTowE="}
