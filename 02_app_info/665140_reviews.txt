But, unfortunately, something in this game is not good, maybe there are not enough items with which you can interact, too many empty locations, too little plot and for me was not clear what needs to be done at the end, but you can set the task of finding all evidences, it take a time. I like the idea and design in some locations and design of the main menu, but everything else does not cause a desire to return there.","timestamp_created":1564930755,"timestamp_updated":1564930755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550408720970153809","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m4nJruwCe9LdzwE="}
