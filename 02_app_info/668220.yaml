    about_the_game: Breadwinner is best described as an arcade wave sorter. You read
      that right - loaves of bread will pass you by on conveyor belts, and it is up
      to you to put them in the correct spot. It sounds simple, until you realize
      that the bread is coming from <i>multiple directions</i> at a <i>ridiculous
      pace</i>. If you want to keep up, you're gonna have to do your best - and even
      that may not be enough! <br><br>At its core, Breadwinner is an arcade game that
      takes a simple idea - in this case, sorting bread - and cranks it up to 11.
      Just sorting it isn't enough? How about if the bread is <strong>shot out of
      a freaking cannon</strong>? Or if you have to precisely throw the bread into
      a bin 15 feet away? Or if time moves only when you do? Just when you think you've
      seen it all, we pull the rug from under your feet and bring yet another twist!<h2
      class="bb_tag">Features:</h2>-<strong>Fast, frantic bread sorting action!</strong><br>-Five
      unique game modes, each with its own surprises<br>-Endless mode, which can challenge
      even the most skillful players<br>-Several unlockable breads, including R-Eye
      and Jesus Crust<br>-Compete to get the highest scores

    short_description: Fast, frantic sorting action! Breadwinner puts you in the shoes
      of a QA worker at a bakery. However, Nexcor Technologies is no ordinary bakery
      - you'll quickly find yourself overwhelmed by an absurd quantity of bread.

    review: This is one of the best games to have somebody who does not usually play
      games try out VR without getting sick. A Gateway VR game I would say.
