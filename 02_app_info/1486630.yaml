    about_the_game: A love letter to the early Splinter Cell games, Intravenous is
      a top-down hardcore stealth/action game, with great emphasis on stealth. Those
      looking for a fight will get one, and it won't be easy.<br>Sneak about, knock
      goons unconscious, lockpick your way into storerooms in hopes of finding ammunition,
      crawl through ventilation shafts to avoid your foes, or don a plate carrier
      and charge in head-first in hopes of surviving an encounter with multiple goons.<br><br>Enter
      the world of Intravenous as Steve Robbins - a man set out for revenge after
      losing his brother to low-life junkies. Delve deep into the criminal world under
      the guise of darkness or go armed to the teeth, guns-blazing, and padded with
      armor.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <strong>Old-school stealth.</strong> Your
      visibility depends on how well-lit the environment is, and every step you take
      makes noise.<br></li><li> <strong>Teeth-grinding action.</strong> Fun stealth
      gameplay does not exclude fun gunplay. Intravenous is meticulously designed
      to offer stealth for those looking for it, as well as no-brakes gunplay to those
      itching for a gunfight.<br></li><li> <strong>Reactive AI.</strong> Your enemies
      will do more than just rush straight at you. If they've found a dead body they
      will alert their friends in hopes of finding you. If they hear you sneaking
      about, they will investigate. If they see you, they will open fire. If they're
      unarmed, they will try to find their friends and warn them of you.<br></li><li>
      <strong>Capable enemies.</strong> Enemies take cover during gunfights, use flashlights
      in darkness, and radio in suspicious activity. Any misstep you make will result
      in your opponents responding appropriately.<br></li><li> <strong>Lots of weapons.</strong>
      Multiple weapons, each with their unique handling. Each works best in a specific
      situation. You're sure to find your personal favorite here.<br></li><li> <strong>Choose
      your loadout.</strong> Pick a rifle, a pistol, and a bulletproof vest to be
      ready for combat, or just a pistol and naught else, to be quick, agile, and
      silent- ready for improvisation.<br></li><li> <strong>Adapt to your surroundings.</strong>
      Shoot lights out, crawl through vent shafts, flip circuit breakers off, throw
      bottles to distract your foes, lockpick doors to find alternative ways in -
      or simply shoot the door lock out, and go in guns-blazing.<br></li><li> <strong>A
      gritty story.</strong> Steve Robbins lost the single most important person in
      his life - his brother. With aid from a mysterious person claiming to have suffered
      a similar fate, he decides it's time to take matters into his own hands after
      the police turns up empty-handed. Nothing is as clear cut as it seems to be.<br></li><li>
      <strong>Uncapped frames per second.</strong> 60hz display? Yep. 144hz? No problem.
      Enjoy the swift action or edge-of-the-seat stealth on your preferred monitor
      refresh rate.</li></ul>
