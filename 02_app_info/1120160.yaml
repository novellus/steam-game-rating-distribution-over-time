    about_the_game: "Tricky Cow is a platformer in which you have to clear all platforms\
      \ (walk or jump on them until the star is yellow; when you leave the platform\
      \ it will disappear) and get to the cowbell to advance to the next level. The\
      \ movement is like Mario but the levels are one-screen (no side-scrolling).<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nSometimes you have to think twice, or even thrice to figure\
      \ out the correct way of finishing the level. Lots of thinking and fun!<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nThe game contains 100 levels and achievements. The levels will gradually\
      \ become harder while new mechanics get introduced. Like it\u2019s predecessors\
      \ the game has all unique mechanics only seen in this release like the timer\
      \ tile. The timer tile is extra tricky because you need to be standing on it\
      \ for about 2 seconds. Standing on the tile for 2 seconds does not sound difficult\
      \ but it is when you have to dodge incoming projectiles. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      The flying spike projectiles are coming from another new tile that shoots in\
      \ different directions so be sure to deactivate those tiles fast. There is also\
      \ a trampoline that boosts you upwards without delay so having good reflexes\
      \ will come in handy. All the tiles need to be deactivated to let the level\
      \ goal appear and so you can progress to the next stage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      Do you think being a cat or a fox was to easy? Try being a cow!"
