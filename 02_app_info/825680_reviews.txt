It's actually inferior because you can't change the skin (unlike the vanilla version) and it isn't connected to the tech tree.\n\nMore importantly, My.games treats customers like cattle to be milked and mistreated in that order. (So buying from them is kind of self-destructive.) \n\nShort version: The community managers are corrupt, post factually inaccurate things they didn't actually write as their own work, and perma-ban people who correct them. \n\nCustomer service is even worse. They will lie and delete support requests in an attempt to hid their connections to the corruption mentioned above.\n\nAfter buying a LOT of DLC and putting more than 800 hours into the game (I started my own clan) I was perma-banned from the forums in a case CM abuse so blatant that Steam actually overturned it (as you probably know, Steam usually sides with the CMs if there is any ambiguity regarding a ban.)\n\nNot coincidentally, the same CM who banned me was one who had previously posted an article as his own work which contained both factual errors (claiming that the Rheinmetall 120mm L55 was invented in Korea) and sentences like:\n\n \"The K2 “Black Panther” MBT is, without any doubt, one of the most advanced tanks in the world – if not the most advanced one because, unlike so many other designs that claim to be next-gen, it can actually back this claim up with the very best technology the Republic of Korea can develop,\" \n\nwhich STRONGLY suggested that at least part of the article had originally been written by a super-patriotic Korean.\n\nhttps://aw.my.games/en/news/general/black-panther\n\nWhile I didn't mention the latter point directly, I did point out the factual errors and shortly afterwards, the CM deleted all the comments on the post as you can see here:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/443110/eventcomments/1754654019204234445/\n\nThough I did save this screenshot of myself politely correcting him because I somehow knew that he was going to try something unethical:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2126034055\n\nAfter Silent Stalker banned me and before Steam removed the ban, I went to the AW discord to ask the CMs for help where \"Soren\" gleefully banned listing \"thanks for the feedback\" as the reason for the ban. He literally didn't even pretend to have a good reason.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2127547497\n\nI then went to customer service where \"Ilya\" transferred me to \"Arthur\" who literally pretended that he had no authority (an obvious lie since Ilya transferred my case to him BECAUSE he had authority.)\n\nA live-service is only as good as the people running it and I cannot recommend any product run by such unprofessional, lazy, and dishonest people.","timestamp_created":1593567694,"timestamp_updated":1597280207,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547960281372070313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ibjU8vMCcc3lkQI="}
