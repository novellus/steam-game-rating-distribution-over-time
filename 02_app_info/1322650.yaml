    review: One of my favorite games to come out of 2020, and it might be the best
      precision platformer I've played period. There's no real gimmick, you just jump
      and walljump your way level to level collecting keys and gold coins as you go
      along. The game doesn't really need anything extra though, the simplicity of
      the controls and superb level design are more than enough. However, the game
      goes a step beyond with a polished graphical style and great sound design. If
      you're a fan of these types of games, I can't recommend it enough. A great challenge
      and easily worth the asking price.
