    about_the_game: Grotesque monsters known as Impurities reside in Magano, a realm
      parallel to the present day. Exorcists purify these evil apparitions to protect
      the people. Rokuro Enmado is opposed to becoming an exorcist, even though he
      has the talent to be one, but an oracle gives him the title of &quot;Twin Star
      Exorcist,&quot; the name bestowed upon married exorcists. Benio Adashino, the
      girl who receives the title along with Rokuro, is determined to exorcise all
      the Kegare, or Impurities, in the world. The two find themselves wrapped up
      in more and more battles together as the Twin Star Exorcists, and as Rokuro
      watches Benio fight with the wish to become stronger, he's forced to face the
      weakness he's lived with ever since the Hiinatsuki Tragedy. Now that his eyes
      are turned toward the battle again, due to Benio, Rokuro makes up his mind to
      fight as an exorcist once more, and the Twin Star Exorcists take on the most
      powerful of Kegare together!
