Could have used more polish. For example, the functions of the two action-types are not explained. There are no golf clubs to select, nor directions to aim. The mechanics of obsticles, wind speeds, and ability-skills are not explained. The system of meta-game unlocks are not explained. Also, I am very annoyed that the xbox-style gamepad controller doesn't work.\n\nIf you have the patience to look past the short-comings, then I think there is a golf-campaign to be explored. You will be limited to only one club, only hitting the ball straight ahead, and a having to learn as you go. Maybe you can even get your controller working with it. Dog Gone Golfing uses the Game Maker game engine. I tried playing this on an Ubuntu 18.10 system.\n\nI bet the designer had a lot of fun playing this game, but he seems to have had trouble figuring out how to share his experience with new players. I also had a problem with the achievements. I don't think they are working.\n\nUpdate fto review aafter playing a few hours for card-drops... I can see how this might be enjoyable for couch competition with friends. The simplicity of the controls lends itself to effortless entertainment, that would be compatible with heavy drinking. You might consider picking this up at an inexpensive sale price, if you have a bunch of controllers and have a bro-party planned.","timestamp_created":1541247752,"timestamp_updated":1607732224,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523627519607543945","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgNyTqvYCeP35rQE="}
