      /><br>After suffering centuries of war, pollution, and neglect, the dying spirit
      of Earth, known as Gaia, has called out to her last defenders in a desperate
      plea for life. Those defenders are dragons, each born from the destruction wrought
      by the human race and bound to the elemental weaves of Gaia. A savage red dragon
      may rise from nuclear fire, a shifty blue from the oil soaked oceans, a mad
      silver from the smog-filled skies, and a hungry brown dragon from the poisoned
      ground of a toxic waste dump.<br><br>It was Gaia's hope that the dragons would
      be better than humanity and help reshape the world in elemental harmony, but
      the violence that manifested the dragons also gave rise to an entity known as
      Oblivion. Called &quot;the Great Father&quot; by the dragons, his influence
      tainted the dragons at birth, driving them mad with a lust for war.<br><br>Now
      the dragons not only battle humanity, but themselves. Ruthlessly hunting for
      the dragon eggs to satiate their endless hunger for power, the dragons wage
      an eternal struggle for dominance and the very soul of Earth. Gaia has called
      out to the last guardians. She has called out to you. Become the dragon and
      conquer all that oppose you to become the chosen &quot;Last Kin&quot;, and reshape
      the fate of Earth in your claw.

    review: 'This is a great implementation of the physical card game. I had never
      played the game before this version, but after losing several fights and winning
      one, I can say that this will scratch that itch you might have to play a deep
      "RPG lite" style card game of one on one tactical combat. It will be even better
      for you if you like the theme of dragons, but anyone who likes fantasy themed
      card games should at least check out the demo to see if they can get into it.


      The rules of the game were fairly easy to learn for me, but I have some experience
      with these kind of games. But at least for me, the combination of the tutorial
      tips, in game manual, and a few playthroughs making all kinds of mistakes was
      enough to teach me the game. Then I was able to put it all together in my third
      game and beat my opponent, although that was not without using all my cards
      to my advantage and a little luck.


      And that is something I really like about this game. Even once you understand
      it and can make good use of all your cards, there is still a chance you can
      lose. You keep spending resources to attack whether you hit or miss with that
      attack, but you can increase your chances by using attacks your dragon is better
      at versus a defense the opponent is weaker at, but that is easier said then
      done, as you also have to make due with your cards in hand at the time, because
      if you wait for a certain card to come out, you may just end up discarding it
      to pay for an attack or as damage from being hit by an attack.


      All that is to say that this is a very interesting game once you learn it, and
      each game is a fun exercise in balancing building your dragon, adding to the
      attacks it can perform, and pulling off those attacks enough times to get the
      opponent''s deck and hand down to zero cards, at which time they are defeated.
      This game also creates some tense moments where even if you have a great set
      of attacks and your opponent is on the ropes, they could still win if you get
      very unlucky, but each turn you are trying to get them down to zero cards is
      a nailbiter that can go either way. Even with that, you never feel cheated when
      you lost, because you did your best, even though victory was just not in the
      cards for that game. But there is always next game, where you start all over
      with a new baby dragon.'
