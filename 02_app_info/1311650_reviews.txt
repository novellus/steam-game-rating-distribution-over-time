AI is retarded and so is the clanky controls and camera. no pause button. honestly think this is just a scam and not a serious game which will be built upon.","timestamp_created":1596879250,"timestamp_updated":1596879250,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwpfTa5vMCfOiTmgI="}
