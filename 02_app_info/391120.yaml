    review: This was obviously someones personal history, or some shadow of it. Either
      that, or someone just trying to be all edgy. I'm guessing not American either
      (could be wrong) This game feels like the person is trying to make you understand
      what it feels like to be depressed, or Angry, along with being schizophrenic,
      through scary visuals and loud noises, and an off center mouse. However, due
      to literally no explanation of controls, or what you're supposed to be doing,
      as well as mandatory HP hits for unknown reasons, the only thing this ends up
      doing is making you wanna turn it off, fortunately the game is really buggy
      so it crashed in chapter 2. Saved me from having to go through the menu to exit.
      I can not recommend anyone play this, or any dev make any more games like these.
