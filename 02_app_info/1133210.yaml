    review: "[code]Curator page here -->[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/37670120/]\
      \ DaRevieweD #29 [/url] <-- [i]New review every Sunday[/i][/code]\n\nBrian Clarke,\
      \ who used to be in AAA is now a solo indie developer; DarkStone Digital and\
      \ I just discovered him recently! His first major game was \"The Subject\" back\
      \ in 2018 and \"Inner\" was his second title being the culmination of a three-day\
      \ effort during a Twitch stream! From what I was told, this short game (like\
      \ finding a needle in a haystack in the store) will be the first in a horror\
      \ anthology series! So far all his other titles, demos are of the horror genre\
      \ and so I think I'll be seeing more of him- you should too if you're into being\
      \ scared!! Let this be a starter to his potential, shall we?\n\n\n[h1]\"Confrontation\
      \ Is Tough\"[/h1]\n\n[u]The Gist:[/u]\nPlay as an unnamed character undergoing\
      \ hypnosis as part of a treatment regimen for depression. Uncover the past and\
      \ face repressed memories in order to escape the ghost within your mind. Just\
      \ keep trying at your own pace. \n\n[spoiler] ! Do you remember if there were\
      \ any spoilers? [/spoiler]\n\n[h1][+] PROS;[/h1]\n\n[b](a) Lost Within[/b]\n\
      The gameplay is minimalistic- quite quick to master. You start out in a safe\
      \ place inside your mind and you have to explore between two dark areas. One\
      \ of which is run down with shelves and disorganized covered objects. The other\
      \ is a self-storage with locked away memories. Played out through a top-down\
      \ perspective and only your eyes will light up where you're facing. Interact\
      \ between the two areas and piece together the past! To add to the difficulty,\
      \ there's also a ghost that will hunt you down and rattle you. You can run away\
      \ until you've lost the enemy, get fatigued or return to the safe place. But\
      \ getting caught will undo any progress made!  \n\n[b](b) It Never Goes[/b]\
      \ \nThe plot is about this person who's trying to face his past and how these\
      \ memories have impacted him so negatively all this while. I'd like to think\
      \ that I have a good grip on reality but I admit I do feel overwhelmed over\
      \ some things I've done in the past. So it's a good reminder of how strong you've\
      \ been or even an actual therapy where you realize it's possible to get through\
      \ the tough times. Oh and I almost cried near the end... just wow.\n\n[b](c)\
      \ Not Alone[/b] \nWhich brings me to the moral of the story. It's a tale as\
      \ old as time and these situations met by the protagonist is one that many people\
      \ can or have themselves been into. To try to get in with the \"cool kids\"\
      \ and be the subject of the joke. To be devastated by someone's death especially\
      \ someone so dear and close to you. To (though I haven't yet :') be conflicted\
      \ when it comes to relationships and trying to make it work. There are other\
      \ situations mentioned which may seem centered on a teen but think of it more\
      \ as a stroll down memory lane. I'm starting to wonder if there are actual tidbit\
      \ moments here and there inspired by the developer's own life... Either way,\
      \ it's still very moving. \n\n[b](d) When You Least Expect It[/b] \nSo how scary\
      \ is this? VERY!! I mean, to be fair the encounters with the ghost (who's form\
      \ is never revealed till the end) are mini jump scares with the music sting\
      \ accompaniment and suddenness of it. However that's exactly the point! This\
      \ is what was alluded by the therapist- that the sheer pain can strike at any\
      \ time and impede on the recovery process. The limited field of view obscured\
      \ by darkness and the cone shape also doesn't help. Don't forget the fact that\
      \ you have to think twice before turning each corner or leave the haven. Though,\
      \ I think the most terrifying thing is when the ghost catches you. It restarts\
      \ the game sure (which is nail-biting all on its own) but it also echoes the\
      \ arduous notion that progress takes time especially ones involving mental traumas.\
      \ \n\n\n[h1][-] CONS;[/h1]\n\n[b](i) Where Do I Look?[/b] \nEnvironments were\
      \ designed to be bland and identical. Which it could have been an artistic choice\
      \ because it signifies the person's denial and neglect of the past.  But obviously,\
      \ it was because of other constraints. Regardless, it is hard to tell them apart\
      \ and you have to rely on memory alone to pinpoint where a personal effect is\
      \ along with which happening it is to be connected to. Otherwise you'll have\
      \ to constantly wander and sooner or later run into you know what.\n\n[b](ii)\
      \ You'll Get There, Breathe...[/b]\nBeginning the game, you are given a brief\
      \ introduction of what to do, sort of. What you literally have to do however,\
      \ is more complex and I spent the first hour alone thinking all I had to do\
      \ was go through each flashback. But actually, you have to go southwards first\
      \ to collect an item (out of six) strewn about and then head north to associate\
      \ it with a scene from the past.\nDoing so will give you one piece to set in\
      \ your safe haven and reconstruct your broken self. \n\n[spoiler]Each addition\
      \ will partially fix the lights in the self-storage location. As long as you\
      \ are bathed in their rays, you will be left alone by the ghost; thereby extending\
      \ the protection of the safe area. Also, you can leave the haven through either\
      \ door but in order to re-enter it- you have to come in through the opposite\
      \ side of whichever you chose to exit. [/spoiler] But the game doesn't say that!\
      \ I appreciate that it's a smart little gimmick that maybe says- only you can\
      \ help yourself but I still would have appreciated the heads up! :')\n\n[b](iii)\
      \ It's Just Too Much[/b]\nThere are several other issues involving the design.\
      \ Firstly, the stamina bar which is messed up because it doesn't regenerate\
      \ in any way unless you actually become winded. Then you have to recoup by waiting\
      \ 10+ seconds. There's also a bug where sometimes the character just decides\
      \ to sprint (I didn't), gets me worn out and then the wretched ghost appeared\
      \ out of nowhere... Speaking of which, the second issue revolves around detecting\
      \ the ghost. When nearby or facing in its direction, a static will sound and\
      \ growing stronger with proximity. However, there were times when this tell\
      \ doesn't appear at all- you can see it float away until it's off screen. I\
      \ even encountered an instance where the coast was clear but then I turn a corner,\
      \ the ghost just \"BOO\" the crap out of me leaving me no chance to run, it\
      \ was like a James Wan movie. \n\nThe ghost also sometimes ignored me like \"\
      NOPE\", perhaps it's having a bad too too? Worst case scenario is being alerted\
      \ (from across the map ) when I don't even see it anywhere so I run in one direction\
      \ only to come to face to face with it... talk about bad luck!! There was one\
      \ other issue where a chain link door just straight up blocked my path. This\
      \ occurred with some other doors too and seemingly at random. Luckily there\
      \ wasn't a chase at the time but imagine if I had been.... Finally of course,\
      \ the obligatory mention of some very minor spelling errors (which just hurts\
      \ me to my core). \n\n\n[h1]\"...It's A Start\"[/h1]\n\nIn conclusion \"Inner\"\
      , despite being a $1 game and very brief one-off (minutes at most supposedly)\
      \ experience, contains surprisingly more emotional depth and layered significance\
      \ than half of the horror games out there! The time and effort that went into\
      \ the game may not seem much but it's a true testament to the phrase quality\
      \ over quantity. The aspects of loss, struggles to fit in and down-in-the-dumps\
      \ are very relatable feelings and it could be applicable to pretty much anyone.\
      \ Sure improvements can be made to the gameplay and there could have been more\
      \ guidance by the therapist but the core message is gotten across through trial\
      \ and error! A truly underrated masterpiece that requires some sensibility but\
      \ you actually feel like you have progressed a lot over time and countless attempts.\n\
      \n\n[h1]9/10[/h1]\n\n[b]Other games include; The Subject, Our Secret Below,\
      \ Kohate and soon Mortuary Assistabt![/b]"
