I remember it was worse and more jerky, and I installed it recently and was surprised. Character surely controlls better. Anyway I don't like graphics and gameplay much.\nEdit: yeah it's still a frustrating garbadge. The main part of frustration comes from this game's slow pacing (even old good mario is faster paced game) and precise mechanics of jumping. Because of this I end up locking myself from reaching platforms several times because I throught some object on the highter platform. Or you could just throught away enemy which important to proceed to the next puzzle. This game should be called Curse of the Thousand Softlocks DX.","timestamp_created":1545158270,"timestamp_updated":1607035386,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwib+xlfYCf4DQtQE="}
