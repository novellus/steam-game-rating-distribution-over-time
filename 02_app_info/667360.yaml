    review: '[h1]Rough but decent action score-attack game[/h1]


      There are currently three [i]Hooligan Vasja[/i] games on Steam: This one, the
      original, and the [i]Halloween[/i] version. [i]Christmas[/i] and Halloween versions
      were originally DLCs of the original. Unlike [i]Halloween[/i] version, [i]Christmas[/i]
      version changes the gameplay in various ways.


      At the core, all are very similar: Vasja is a kid who runs up the rain gutter
      of houses to wreck their windows and inhabitants with projectiles. Appropriately
      for the theme, this time it''s snowballs. After a certain score, a huge creepy
      boss appears and needs to be shot down to complete the level.


      There are 5 levels, each of which introduces new enemies that only differ in
      appearance and damage their projectiles do - otherwise, each enemy works similarly,
      throwing a single object down the building at Vasja. Vasja has to both dodge
      these objects (to avoid getting damage) and the obstacles on his way, as hitting
      them even once is an insta-death. Some power-ups, like infinite fast ammo and
      kill-all rockets help on the way.


      [h1]Twist of Christmas: What''s different other than visuals?[/h1]


      [i]Christmas[/i] version is thankfully different from the other two games.


      First, it introduces another task for Vasja: You also have to deliver gifts
      to windows to save Christmas from the evil monsters who are there to ruin it.
      This introduces ''spacebar'' as another key. You lose if you don''t deliver
      for a set amount of time, and the boss appears after a number of presents instead
      of just score.


      Second, windows are no longer shields nor do they need to be broken. This way,
      it is easier to hit the enemies as you no longer need to hit the window first
      nor aim below it. Neat change for a more casual game.


      Third, the bosses are re-designed. They tend to shoot big projectiles instead
      of lots of small ones, and particularly the end boss has a new attack pattern.
      Also, they have only one hit location but regenerate health. Personally I''m
      just glad it was different to the other two games.


      [h1]Mouse controls (+ spacebar)[/h1]


      Vasja is controlled mostly with mouse. Cursor and mouse is used to shoot the
      slingshot and also control, on which side of the gutter he''s running up. Keep
      in mind that there are no gamepad or other control options available. As such,
      in my opinion these controls work just fine.


      Additionally, spacebar is used to throw presents at windows. This uses some
      sort of 2D physics, and e.g. cats (a minor enemy type) and obstacles like balconies
      block them, potentially ruining a nice delivery.


      It takes a bit to get used to everything that''s happening on the screen as
      well as aiming the gifts. Particularly, Vasja''s vertical throws are very powerful
      but oddly rather weak horizontally.


      Switching sides of the gutter is instantaneous but learning to dodge both the
      projectiles and the obstacles takes some time. After a while it becomes quite
      intuitive, although sometimes there are unavoidable attacks.


      [h1]Technically dated[/h1]


      For a game from 2017 (based on 2016 game), it is perhaps surprising that [i]Hooligan
      Vasja: Christmas[/i] runs only in windowed mode or in low resolution in fullscreen.
      In fullscreen mode, there are input-less regions in the sidebars, in a widescreen
      monitor anyway.


      I played in fullscreen because I''d imagine that clicking outside the window
      could spell death, it is fast-paced enough for that to happen.


      At least the merry music and sound can be muted from within game, and adjusted
      separately.


      [h1]Time for festivities[/h1]


      [i]Christmas[/i] version made [i]Hooligan Vasja[/i] feel fresh again. The addition
      of the gift mini-task, as well as the other tinier changes, make the game just
      as challenging as the first game, even though I already played it.


      While I had already well versed through the first game, I still spent 3.5 hours
      in the game before managing to beat the end boss.


      If you enjoyed the first game, I think you''d enjoy this one as well.
