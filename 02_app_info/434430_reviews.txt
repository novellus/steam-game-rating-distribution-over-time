The graphics of the enviroment needs an overhaul in some places, but the locations are interesting . The demo is really short, but it does give you a feel for the game, and it looks to be amasing. The place you arrive at before the demo ended left me in awe as I gazed into the darkness of one of the most interesting and imposing lcoations I've seen in VR.\n\nPlayed with Rift without any issues.","timestamp_created":1485790304,"timestamp_updated":1495660850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458358287811279297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwta2VntwCf+/ucA=="}
