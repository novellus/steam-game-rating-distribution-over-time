It's quite short and it became repetitive as I was pretty much trying to optimize stats. This looks really good with the vibrant colors and flashy vfx, but the gameplay is simple as you're really just managing your team, no other esport aspect ei sponsors, draft picking (like champs and stuff). I wish there were more things, but otherwise if you're looking for an esports manager game its ok.","timestamp_created":1598840348,"timestamp_updated":1598840348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1vOTofQCcpLungI="}
