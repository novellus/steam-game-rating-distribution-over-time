    about_the_game: "Minotaur is an adventure game set in a new world called The Universe\
      \ of Seven. Here\u2019s what we hope you\u2019ll love about it:<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\"><i>Story and characters</i></h2><br><br>Minotaur\u2019s story is mainly\
      \ focused on nine characters who come to find themselves trapped in their apartment\
      \ building. Nod\u2019s route, which is fully available in this Early Access\
      \ release, follows a synthet named Nod Pikes as he attempts to escape and come\
      \ to terms with his past \u2013 with help (kind of) from his lovely sharp-tongued\
      \ AI assistant Ollie. Just like the game overall, Nod\u2019s route has multiple\
      \ endings. We call them: wicked, sad, very sad, brutal and shocking. Take your\
      \ pick!<br><br>A couple more notes about the story:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"\
      ><li> <strong><i>All four remaining routes will be added to the game for free.</i></strong><br></li><li>\
      \ It\u2019s fully voiced over in English by a great cast.</li></ul><h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\"><i>Gameplay</i></h2><br><br>Minotaur has point and click mechanics\
      \ at its core, so we\u2019re trying to make the process of pointing and clicking\
      \ as engaging as possible. In Nod\u2019s route alone, you\u2019ll be solving\
      \ many different puzzles, fighting an ancient robot, and even climbing lots\
      \ of stairs. Hm\u2026 That last one sounded much better in our heads. It\u2019\
      s actually one of our favorite parts!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><i>Graphics</i></h2><br><br>We\u2019\
      re spending a lot of time on making the world of Minotaur feel alive and immersive,\
      \ and we think that graphics and animations play a huge part in that. Check\
      \ out our Early Access trailer \u2013 everything in it has been captured directly\
      \ from the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><i>Music</i></h2><br><br>It\u2019s good.\
      \ Really. We\u2019ve listened to thousands of tracks, and picked the best of\
      \ them for Nod\u2019s route.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><i>World</i></h2><br><br>We\
      \ often say Minotaur is a cyberpunk game, but that\u2019s just us trying to\
      \ sell it. In truth, its world is more of a science fantasy setting, and we\u2019\
      re obsessed with having it figured out down to the tiniest detail. Why else\
      \ would we make a whole website dedicated to its lore?<br><br>Are you not convinced\
      \ yet? Syl, and that was us at our best. How about trying out the demo then?\
      \ We\u2019re sure that the beginning of the story will pique your interest.\
      \ And if you get stuck, feel free to use a spoiler-free walkthrough on our website.<br><br>Hope\
      \ to see you soon in Nova DC! \u2661\U0001F427"
