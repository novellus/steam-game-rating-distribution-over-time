      \ game.  <br />\r\nThe player traverses the galaxy and in order to stock up\
      \ on fuel and equipment, has to land on every planet he passes. Each planet\
      \ has unique features - <br />\r\nsome have stronger gravitational fields, winds,\
      \ asteroids, or more inaccessible terrain. Since every level is randomly generated,\
      \ the game will always <br />\r\nkeep you on your toes. The longer your voyage\
      \ lasts, the tougher it becomes. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose between different\
      \ pilots with distinct spaceships to accommodate your playstyle. As you explore\
      \ the galaxy, you might encounter various alien creatures that will offer upgrades\
      \ and bonuses to your vessel. Be smart about your choices! Your adventure might\
      \ come to a premature end if you end up without fuel mid-flight. Discover how\
      \ long you can last in the cold vastness of space and aim for the high score!<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nCosmic Pioneer is a simple yet addictive game. There is no\
      \ big intro, no cutscenes... Just gameplay. The perfect game when you have some\
      \ time to kill <br />\r\nwhile waiting for your ranked match to start or your\
      \ raid party to group up."
