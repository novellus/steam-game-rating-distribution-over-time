I played this with a workaround to start it with Locale emulator set to chinese if not starting it with a english/foreign OS make the game crash. With the workaround steam features dont seem to work. It actually have english subtitles, all the relevant text and story elements are subtitled with a few quirks. That said even with all of this tinkering this a bizarre experience worth playing even for the gruesome art alone. \nAt its core is an indie rpg with survival horror elements and a very unsettling surreal story. There are two separate stories with different gameplay: The first involves moral choices that determine the ending and is a survival experience with rpg elements where you have to manage your health and ammo. The second is more akin to your usual rpg maker game experience but is good nonetheless.\nFor me a game where the main character is a bioengineered  half human half pig, had to figh strange monsters and is called Lunch13 is worth a playtrough and the dollar it cost.","timestamp_created":1583821566,"timestamp_updated":1583821899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z4jJ4fACf52X9wE="}
