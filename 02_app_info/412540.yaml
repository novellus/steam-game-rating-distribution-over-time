      \ /><br><br>Inspired by the classic MS-DOS game \u201CThe Beast\u201D, we have\
      \ created a game with new graphics and game modes. Playing The Minotaur you\
      \ will feel the nostalgia for those old school games where your only goal was\
      \ to get as far as possible or the highest score. The game also has full gamepad\
      \ compatibility, so do not worry if you don\u2019t like playing on keyboard\
      \ ;) <br><br>The Minotaur also includes several game modes: <br><br><strong>Arcade:\
      \ </strong><br>It\u2019s the classic mode, where the player has to fight his\
      \ way through 30 levels with increasing difficulty, including different minotaurs,\
      \ minotaur eggs, etc. <br><br><strong>Time Attack:</strong> <br>Similar to Arcade,\
      \ the player needs to finish the level all 30 levels in a certain amount of\
      \ time. Killing the minotaurs or their eggs will grant extra time. <br><br><strong>Endless:</strong>\
      \ <br>If you think you beat the game, try this mode with the endless levels.\
      \ Really, this mode never end!<br><br><strong>One Life</strong><br>You are the\
      \ untouchable human? Demonstrate that with this mode where you die by one hit.<br><br><strong>Local\
      \ Co-op: </strong><br>If you have trouble defeating the beasts, ask a friend\
      \ for help! Or a family member, or maybe even your dog can help you. Up to four\
      \ players, so the more the merrier. <br><br><strong>Local VS </strong><br>This\
      \ game mode allows the players to fight against themselves. Great for challenging\
      \ your friends and competing to be the very best, or simply relax by killing\
      \ your acquaintances. <br><br><strong>Trials: </strong><br>Players will need\
      \ to find their ways through a series of hand-made levels. Some of them might\
      \ even have only four blocks to kill the minotaurs (\u0E07\uFE21'-'\uFE20)\u0E07\
      . <br><br><strong>Level Editor: </strong><br>Tired of playing the classic levels?\
      \ Bored by the challenges? No problem, you will be able to create your own level\
      \ maps."
