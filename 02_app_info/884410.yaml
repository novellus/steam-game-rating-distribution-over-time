    review: 'One of my new favorites when it comes to the Choice of Games, whether
      they''re made directly by them or a third party. Unnatural has a great feel
      to it that reminds me of "monster a day" shows like X-Files or Grimm.


      The only part I find that hurts in the story is the world building. It''s a
      bit lacking in parts and doesn''t pull off the feel of a modern fantasy world
      that great. A solid story either way.'
