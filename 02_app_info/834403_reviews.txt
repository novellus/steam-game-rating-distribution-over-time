This is a stunning add on pack and is very detailed. I am not going to talk about the scenery very much on this review as I have explained what I think of the actual route more on my review on the GEML. The train is fabulous. It is pretty much identical to how it look in real life and the sounds are great. I have not received this pack in a deal. I have paid full price for it and I can say that it is money well spent. I have also got the TFL pack so head over there to check my review on that.","timestamp_created":1590443750,"timestamp_updated":1590443750,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp7b1pvICe7akigI="}
