Tactics were not as good as in the first part where using the Obsession meters to your advantage was necessary to win the fights by having the enemies trigger your best moves, whereas here it only unlocks another ultimate move I found myself saving for the next and then the next and the next fight.\nUnfortunately a bit buggy from time to time but usually nothing a good quickload or restart of the game won't fix, just save often, the Quicksave is a blessing for your nerves.\nOverall well worth the buy in my opinion.","timestamp_created":1605741692,"timestamp_updated":1605741692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxrjq7vUCcKearwI="}
