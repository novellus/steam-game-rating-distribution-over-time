It is a classic from the early to mid nineties. You play a French detective trying to track down the Phantom of the Opera as he strikes again a century after he committed his infamous attack on the Paris Opera House. After some sleuthing and cluefinding, he knocks you out and sends you back in time to 1881! I think I played this as a kid, but barely got very far.","timestamp_created":1606710017,"timestamp_updated":1606710052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyrjYi/YCc7vPtQI="}
