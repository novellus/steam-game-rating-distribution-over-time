I thought i'd give this version a go.  I find it way to over complicated and glitzy.  its really in your face and hard to work out unless you spend allot of time.  The original starts off very simple and you feel in control and want to develop the train network.  This one... I could not wait to turn it off.  Its aggressive and confusing.","timestamp_created":1599853643,"timestamp_updated":1599853643,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530201315879821777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z6itv/QCdL+ZoQI="}
