I was wrong. There's very few songs, and not only that, the last less than a minute. Each stage is the same song, but just a little more difficult.Speaking of difficulty,  at any difficulty other than easy or normal, you can bet you'll have a workout and sore fingers. \n\nThe key combinations are weird, and no matter how proficient you are at keyboarding or playing the piano, (which I am), this game will have you scratching your head and wishing you were Mrs. Fantastic with rubber fingers.\n\nI'd recommend saving your $10 and look somewhere else.","timestamp_created":1609344257,"timestamp_updated":1609344257,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vpGZ2vYCcarovgI="}
