You can probably guess how this would become a hassle after a few missions. \n-The way cover works in this game is frusturating\n-Your units look the same, walk the same, START walking at EXACTLY the same time, etc. This greatly takes away from the immersion for me.\n-Pathfinding, my units choose to spend 5 seconds taking turns jumping over a crate, rather than take 1 second to run around it.\n-You can flank an enemy, but unless you're almost directly behind them, your damage towards them will be as if they were in cover, unflanked.\n-A few other small problems.\n\n\nI know this is an early access game, but if its for sale, then it will be treated like a finished product.\n\nI have only reviewed this as \"Positive\" because the devs need a chance to improve things.","timestamp_created":1484983856,"timestamp_updated":1588179266,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596280813217163086","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwnY234/ECcMSPcA=="}
