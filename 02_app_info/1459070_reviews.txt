Cool armor at first but i couldnt EVEN SEE IT from soo MUCH FOG/GAMMA the game has. Everything looks GRAY ffs. Then, combat was cool but not even sounds of steel meeting steel, nothing. And to topple it not even an ESC button! wtf i mean i alted-4 the shit to close it.\n\nLooks promising tho. I'll wait for the final game. For now, a refund is in order.","timestamp_created":1609967753,"timestamp_updated":1609967753,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ48srj7PYCdrOOwQI="}
