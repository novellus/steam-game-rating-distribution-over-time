Since it was so cheap, I had low expectations. There's not a lot of content, but that's fine. The game is pretty simple, but that's fine. I would have written a positive review, except the game is broken. It's very common to set a path correctly, but the guy dies when he reaches the intersection, as though the path were set wrong. There's one mechanic in the game, and it doesn't work correctly. Not worth my money or my time.","timestamp_created":1551663081,"timestamp_updated":1551663081,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552325606346130371","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44vSUo+kCeaWfvAE="}
