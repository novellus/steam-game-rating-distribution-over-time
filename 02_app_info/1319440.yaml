    about_the_game: As part of a security force for a para-military research group,
      &quot;Project Midgard&quot;, life had been pretty easy. Just sit back, watch
      the scientists do their work, and get paid. Well, that was before they actually
      succeeded at opening a gate to hell, or connecting a portal to an alien planet,
      or whatever the hell it is they did. To top it all off, they locked up the bunker
      with you outside! Now it's up to you (and your friends) to build, upgrade, and
      explore to hold and defend the bunker for your ticket in.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul
