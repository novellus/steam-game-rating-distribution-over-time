    review: 'This software does exactly what it is supposed to do. Most software I
      come across; comes with claims of what it can do, some of which bear out, some
      of which don''t.. Usually I find myself happy if it even approaches what it
      implies it can do.

      I had seen a few tracks that looked as if they were spline created, but that
      also contained the terrain and sides of the road built exactly as far as tolerances
      and doing good UV work on them. I didn''t know what they were created with.,
      but I knew there was the possibility of good software that could do that. This
      is it.

      Build your road, add your terrain sides, or walls, and then you can go further
      and add houses, trees, grass, and on and on.

      Excellent piece of software that will speed your game making times up. Love
      it. Great job.'
