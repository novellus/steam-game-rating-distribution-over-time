This one isn't a big problem but still, if you are Detective Evans in shard collection. His cooldown for his ultimate is fine as long as the stun time in decreased.\n\n-Add a report feature. I have gotten a few people hacking in my lobbies and it's really annoying. This one is basically a must have in games.\n\n-I understand what they were trying to do with the removing stun for the fiend, but since it is a speed type it doesn't do much damage. Though the stun was kinda lengthy I think they could have just shortened the stun. They could have also done a thing where the person would be teleported back to their position after the stun.\n\n-Add a sensitivity option. I'm not even explaining this one because I don't need to.\n\n-Add steam achievements. This one isn't a must, but I'd love to have achievements based on different milestones in game.\n\n-Balance the Soul Shard amounts per wave. Sometimes when I do minigames I see that sometimes the Shards per wave go from 200-275. down to 150-125. This can kinda screw up some runs of Maze Escape and its annoying.\n\n-Fix the spacing between shards. This one also isn't too big of a problem but I hate having the spacing of shards in stranger sewers \"big rooms\" feel so slow when getting them. It sometimes makes me feel like skipping the room in total, and sometimes I skip a row of shards because its only like 8 in a row. Each one takes a second to get and if it's that much time to get a single shard that's time wasted that you could have used getting other shards. Also, sometimes I feel like the game is sometimes unfair with the very close spawn of shards. You can get like 6 shards in a second without the boost, not on a speed type, only if you have good RNG.\n\nAnyways I hope you can get these stuff sorted out. I'm not complaining about the game, I just want the game to be more balanced. I'm having loads of fun playing the game and I'm excited for the DLC stuff. Other than these problem, the game is amazing and I would definitely recommend the game. If you want some stuff that's great about the game here are few of the many.\n\n-You don't need to have the chapters to play the game with every character.\n\n-The skins are very well designed and give you a reason to keep playing.\n\n-Lobby looks incredible.\n\n-You get something for winning, and if you keep winning you can get a nice cosmetic.\n\n-Badges are a great way to basically say \"Great milestone, keep it up!\"\n\n-The tutorial is really helpful in learning what some stuff do and whats with each game mode.\n\n-The class system is pretty good despite the complaints I had above.\n\n-You aren't limited to wins if you want to get a new cosmetic.\n\n-The gachas aren't limited to skins.\n\n-The RNG factor is well balanced, and I think that depending where you are the boxes lean towards that item you need.\n\n-Collecting a box in Maze escape can be bad or good for the monster team.\n\nThese are a few of the things I found great about the game, and I'm excited to play more. Good luck Glowstick with the new updates!","timestamp_created":1607808615,"timestamp_updated":1609853158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.723086357116699219","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp7iu6fYCd9fPuQI="}
