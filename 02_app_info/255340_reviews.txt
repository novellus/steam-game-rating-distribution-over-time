The level design is nothing new, not even in difficulty, and feels shallow at this point. Overall this is an unneccesary remake of the graphics, NOT a true sequel with more interesting puzzle design. \n\nA disapointment for me who loved the first game.","timestamp_created":1609756750,"timestamp_updated":1609756750,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi9a+5vYCcIitwAI="}
