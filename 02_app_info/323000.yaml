    review: 'This game could be very good. But because some major issues it is really
      a pain.


      1) upkeep (grind fest).

      your mobile base and "turrets" cost you some money. For example you need to
      pay 20% of your income for base and 15% for your "turrets". it means that the
      upkeep for a fight is at 35% and that means that if you get 1000 gold from map
      it will be reduced to 650. The further the game you are the bigger the upkeep
      is and the more expensice the ubgrades. so basically the furhter you are the
      more gold you need but you will be recieving less. Taht means that if you need
      some money you need to play a map you can beat with "low cost". so basically
      you will be farming one map lots of times to get your ubgrades. This is not
      fun at all.


      2) Game Bug.

      When a mele mob is engaging your fortress, you stop moving. and sometimes your
      fortress dont start moving after you kill the one who stopped you. Everyone
      likes to restart map right? Because at this point there is nothing you can do.


      3) Auto aim

      Some of your turrets are "automated". They work really good... well most of
      the time. Some mobs can run away from you (for example range mobs that are to
      close to you) when they run the auto targetting wot hit it. and if your turret
      locks on that mob it will be occupied by shooting behind a mob till the mob
      wont stop or die.


      4) Progress

      game keeps your "record" in 3 categories: monster killed, gold looted and time
      needed to finish. That is theory. in practice game dont save your time stats
      (but luckly you can live without it so it;)


      5) Medals

      you can get your new fortress plans and "turrets" from 2 sources. By completing
      maps and by collecting medals. That is really great but... at some maps there
      are fiever mobs on map that you need to kill ( for example you need to kill
      120 but map offers only 100). The trick here is that some mobs are in huts.
      if you destroy that hut to fast you loose mob. So in some maps you need to wait
      as long as you can with the destruction of the huts to get more mobs. And here
      comes the bug. You wait monsters comes in mele game crashes. you dont wait mobs
      dont come out you dont have medal...


      6)Info

      some "turrets" just lack the proper info. For example "spread shot" shoots 4
      arrows and it deals x amount of damage. The question is that is combined damage
      of 4 arrows or damage of one arrow?



      The bottom line is This is a very good example of a very bad example. The game
      got great potential and it is wasted. If you plan only to simply "finish the
      game" it will be fun. If ou want to "complete the game" it will be a rebooting
      iritating grind fest.'
