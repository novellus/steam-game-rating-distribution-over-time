    about_the_game: The dwarves have abandoned the ringing forges and roaring breweries
      of Vul Buhldar, and in their absence other, less savory things of the dark have
      taken up residence. The fortress remains sealed, its locks and bridges having
      been shut in a final act of defiance from the dwarves, turning what was once
      a proud citadel into a prison of brass and hewn stone. But mankind has always
      been easily lured by the promise of the unseen, and you are no different in
      this curiosity.<br><br>A strong sword arm is not all you will need, as you must
      have the cunning and wisdom to solve complex devices, slip past traps, and decipher
      the riddles of the dwarves in order to find what they have sealed within their
      fortress... and to ensure that there it remains.<br><br><i>Balrog </i>is a classically
      inspired RPG adventure, taking influence from everything from <i>Icewind Dale</i>
      to <i>Moria</i> to create something new and inviting from the familiar old-school
      grinds. <i>Balrog </i>brings a tight and fun experience to both fans of the
      classics and new RPG players, putting its focus not on frustrating combat challenges
      or timing-based reflex but on good old-fashioned adventure and exploration.
