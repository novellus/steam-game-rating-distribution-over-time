I was very pleasantly surprised! :)\nMost of these sounds are actually perfect for the game project I had in mind. Thanks for these, Joel Steudler!\nAside from them being quality, I can say the description is accurate; you can pretty much use these for most any sci-fi project. Would recommend to anyone looking to do a sci-fi game in RPG Maker. :)","timestamp_created":1588637547,"timestamp_updated":1588637547,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568611323833465576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n6eL8fECcITQhQI="}
