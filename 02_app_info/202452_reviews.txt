Two of them were broken and couldn't be solved, while few others required some serious \"unrelated elements placement tweaking so physics of needed objects would work out better\". I also think that they could provide more interesting objectives based on how each culture celebrates Happy New Year, it's pretty much always \"everybody loves fireworks\". But eh.\n\nSo not much enjoyable for those who only want puzzles.","timestamp_created":1432380715,"timestamp_updated":1432380754,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571115255355834961","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhfmiwM0CdIPzPA=="}
