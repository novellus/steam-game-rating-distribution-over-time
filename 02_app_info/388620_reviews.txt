It started as an 8/10 game, ended as 4/10, for a variety of reasons.\n\nFirst, a few hints for new players: there are 3 hidden floors - 2 reachable with both \"up\" and \"down\" teleports and 1 reachable with \"down\" teleport only. Since you find only 1 \"down\" in the entire game (and you can't buy anymore), save it for that special level (-50) - otherwise you won't be able to complete the game. Also, you'll need at least 2 Mattocks/1 Earthquake to finish the game; either save this or Soulstones to be able to buy it. Otherwise, you'll be stuck. Also, with boss on -10, you have to kill the middle Illusionists and go circular, without any of them moving. If you kill the wrong ones, you'll be unable to kill the boss, even if you rearrange the remaining enemies properly. Don't use the first 2 temples if possible at all. 3rd temple (+8/+16) is OK, you can safely use it as you see fit; the last temple on -15 gives the best bonuses (+10/+20), so feel free to dump you gold here.\n\nNow, for the CONS:\n* extremely hard without walkthrough/hints, easy, boring and tedious with them (see above)\n* obscure enemy special abilities and items, with unclear descriptions\n* difficulty level settings that make no sense with respect to this kind of puzzle/rougelike game (no realchange in core difficulty, but instead fog of war on hard and \"endless\" yellow keys on casual)\n* no way to set \"instant fight\" and having to constantly spam space key\n* no way to set \"quick\" move (what's called \"quick\" is actually \"normal\", and the \"normal\" is \"slow\") & skipping of dialogue/fadeouts etc., making the game much longer than needed, especially for a grind game with speedruns\n* level teleport list broken, at least at my PC (scrolls around randomly, very hard to actually use)\n* obscure and unfun boss/quest puzzles\n* repetitive music, 2 channel chiptune\n* much content ripped from Tower of the Sorcerer without introducing at least cosmetic changes (some bosses & enemies are taken too verbatim IMVHO)\n* maze levels are both boring, grindy and generally lame (check how many people aced the story mode with all secrets & speedruns but still haven't even a single maze cheevo if you don't believe me)\n\nPROS\n* nice retro feel from TotS\n* quite replayable (if not taking the bugs/problems into account)\n* well, the music ain't that bad for a repetitive 2 channel chiptune\n* there's a port of the original TotS as a community mission, which even more awesome with the improved graphics and interface\n\nI bought it on 90% sale, so I won't condemn it to hell, but honestly, it felt more like a chore than a challenge most of the time.","timestamp_created":1607256971,"timestamp_updated":1607276175,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46YPInPYCfvfetwI="}
