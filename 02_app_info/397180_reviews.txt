ASW aircraft with then fly to one end of the box (could be 400mi from the ships they are protecting). \nIf the end of the search box is close, aircraft will fly to it and calmly fly around in circles as the start point continually changes location.\nMeanwhile the submarine will torpedo your surface ships.\nI can only surmise that the developers are not prepared to play the campaign (as the issues would be immediately apparent) or have broken the game in an attempt to get people to purchase the follow-up product.","timestamp_created":1591961777,"timestamp_updated":1591961777,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tp6U1PICerPLjQI="}
