If played stand alone, then the game would seem rushed and the stats gained would not be as good.  In fact, if played just stand alone, it would seem rushed and terrible.  If played with the other two games it is a lot better.  For best results, one must play with the other two games and import the character made.\n\nIf I were to say one thing about this game that does not hold up well, whether stand alone or with the other two games, it would be the tournament.  I managed to make a character with high stats and able to use most weapons.  Despite that, I lost in the second round.  I had a strength of 179, and the other person had a strength of 27.  After the roll, I lost with a strength of 17 versus the opponent's 89.  \n\nTo get certain endings. one had to craft a character all through the three games to get the stats needed to gain the certain endings.  The multi classing needed keeps from going pure one class very well, or even the way one wants to play.  To make it so that any sort of play through can get any ending, minus the obvious alignment of good or evil, is something that I find to be a bummer in and of itself.  Even so, I find it funny how one can get a 'Good' ending by being a Dark Knight with 100 percent citizen fear, all the while worshiping an evil god  and being an immortal demon.","timestamp_created":1590621527,"timestamp_updated":1590621527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vcubrPICcN7ZigI="}
