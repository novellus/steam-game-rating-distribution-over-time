      on your right!<br><br>Jengo is a point &amp; click in the purest old-school
      tradition. You know how it goes: you put your mouse pointer somewhere, clickety-click
      and something wicked happens. After a while, you begin to look for the most
      inappropriate items combination possible and test it out to see if the developers
      have the same kind of sick mind as yours.<br><br>In Jengo you play as Jeff,
      a disgruntled gaming prodigy seeking new challenges: the ultimate game, the
      one that will bring back some moisture in his eyes, and blister on his thumbs.
      Little does he know that his search will bring him to a strange, lonely place
      at the edge of the Pixelverse: Old Meta. Old Meta is a dumping ground for the
      Nobody-folk who were almost somebody - but have long lost their dreams at a
      watering hole in the middle of the desert. Now threatened by a large crack in
      the sky that consumes the land, they drink and gamble away their final days
      waiting for the end to come.<br><br>All they need is a hero... Sadly, considering
      the nature of forgotten places, no such hero ever came by, so they have now
      to settle on a gamer instead.<br><br>Powered by<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/671430/extras/MSI_logo_for_share2_1.png?t=1551699037"
