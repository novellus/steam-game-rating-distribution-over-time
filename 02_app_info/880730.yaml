    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Rocket Assault</h2><br>Rocket assault is single
      player racing/action game, that consists in completing short missions with an
      specific goal the fastest way possible.<br><br>Use boost to fly like a rocket
      and launch your rockets to blow up everything that comes in your way!<h2 class="bb_tag">How
      do I aim in the air?</h2><br>There is a dedicated button to press in the air,
      and this will slow the rotation of the car, also the camera will face the front
      of the car, this allows to make precise movements to aim and shoot with ease,
      the ideal play is to align the car on the jump and make small adjustments in
      the air before you launch the rocket, this works really well !!<h2 class="bb_tag">How
      do the rockets work?</h2><br>The rockets have a tracking system, that will detect
      any targets that are close enough, once it's locked it will try to adjust its
      trajectory and hit it, don't be fooled! you still have to aim but not exactly
      on target.<h2 class="bb_tag">Level Design</h2><br>We want to make each mission
      feel unique, and different than the one before, that's why we are trying very
      hard to come up with new ideas, and concepts that may apply to the game<h2 class="bb_tag">Combo
      systems</h2><br>in some levels the boost will be gained by destroying targets,
      the faster you destroy targets more boost will be added, if you take any damage
      or you are too slow the combo breaks, this will make the level very fast paced
      and dynamic.<h2 class="bb_tag">Boss Battles</h2><br>Imagine in front of you
      a huge ship that leaves bombs on the track, and shoots rockets at you! and to
      defeat it you have to shoot the weak points until you destroy it, is it a great
      idea or what??<h2 class="bb_tag">Aerial Levels</h2><br>Some levels will be mostly
      by air, so you have to grab the floating boost, to keep going.<h2 class="bb_tag">Bomb
      Rescue</h2><br>To complete these levels you'll have to find a bomb a take it
      to a safe area, when the bomb is on you, any small bump will detonate the bomb
      so be careful!
