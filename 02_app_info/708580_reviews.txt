I saw the film and it scared the pants off me. This game played in VR is repeating it here. Not the same story line as the films, but shaping up to be just as good.\nVery immersive. very creepy sounds in background, nice voices and soundtrack. \nSo far so good.\nSo far a thumbs up from me.\n","timestamp_created":1607602518,"timestamp_updated":1607602518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw//akpvYCcKHYuAI="}
