    review: got this to try and train my aim on m&kb as i am new to pc played ps since
      ps1 i know im trash on m&kb but this game is trash guns have excessive recoil
      no way to control it snipers wont stay ads after shots making it hard to see
      where the shot landed in order to make adjustments maybe i was expecting too
      much idk maybe im a super noob just wouldnt recommend
