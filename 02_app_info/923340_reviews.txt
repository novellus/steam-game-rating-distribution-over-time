Shame, looks great, but of the two modes of play, one doesn't work and the other is ridiculously hard. \nIn challenge mode, no monsters ever appear, making it pointless. In the discussions the developer asks and is informed that it is too hard. Sadly this discussion is from over a year ago, and nothing had change.\nAgain, a shame, it looks like it could have been quite a good game.","timestamp_created":1604727453,"timestamp_updated":1604727453,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ41LbN0PUCe4/rrAI="}
