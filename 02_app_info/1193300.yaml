      /><br><br>In 2009, two brothers, Malachai (age 5) and Ethan (age 29) Nicolle,
      created the comic book, Axe Cop. Over the years, the brothers pitted Axe Cop
      and his team of strong fighters against the most deadly, disgusting, and horrifying
      bad guys that their imaginations could come up with. In celebration of over
      ten years of Axe Cop, we are proud to present the official Axe Cop Game!<br><br>Play
      as Axe Cop and his team in this classic retro RPG! Take on challenging missions
      against his most devious enemies such as Bad Santa Claus, Dr. Stinkyhead, Dr.
      Doo doo and more! The Axe Cop Game is great for casual and hardcore RPG gamers
      alike, offering plenty of strategy, quests and story for any gamer to sink their
      axe into!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1193300/extras/AxeCop_Steam_listing_02.png?t=1608329177"
      /><br><br>After Axe Cop finds his axe at the scene of the fire, he'll meet up
      with Flute Cop and his career as the most epic hero begins. Once he recovers
      a mysterious machine, capable of turning any bad guy into a good guy, he and
      his team of heroes are convinced that they can stop all bad guys once and for
      all with it. But they must hunt down three magic gems to power it up. Along
      the way, Axe Cop will face off against his most diablocal rogues and visit some
      of the most dangerous locations from his comic book history, a volcano full
      of dinosaurs, the insides of a giant monster, even London itself! The bad guys
      are teaming up and will not be making it any easier for Axe Cop to find these
      magic stones.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1193300/extras/AxeCop_Steam_listing_03.png?t=1608329177"

      their stats on each level up.<br></li><li><strong>ABILITIES:</strong> Each hero
      on Axe Cop's team has a unique ability in the field. Axe Cop can chop and break

    developer_response: Thank you so much for the generous review! Regarding your
      negative comments, your review has encouraged some new features in the game,
      namely the lab now features a minimap that makes traversal significantly easier.
      Also at the Water Castle is a gentle reminder that Sockarang can interact with
      those song statues. Thanks again for playing and for bringing up these issues!
      We are thrilled you had a great experience playing the game!

    review: '[b]The Good:[/b]

      As someone with no previous familiarity with the Axe Cop franchise, this game
      immediately grabbed me. Wacky characters and plot points are introduced with
      no warning, but it does it in a way that feels consistent with the rules of
      this whimsical universe, and by the end it goes to great lengths to connect
      all the dots.

      The faux-retro graphics are another reason I even looked at this game. The color
      palette most closely resembles that of the Game Boy Color, but the screen is
      wider, more colors are displayed at once, and sprites are larger and more animated.
      I assume the style is faithful to the webcomic and animated series, and it does
      look great.


      The turnbased combat system has several distinct characteristics that deserve
      thorough analysis. Enemy encounters aren''t started at random, rather enemy
      sprites will spawn in and wander about and battle will only start if you make
      contact with them. Combat is turnbased, but far from generic. There''s not a
      traditional Defend command, but instead you can Charge to replenish a fair amount
      of MP. Doing a regular Attack will replenish a small amount of MP. Other Moves
      may require to use of other items (fruits) instead of or in addition to MP.
      Some Moves may cost HP. Enemies may be considered Flying and can then only be
      hit with projectiles. Machine-type enemies may be Hacked for various effects.
      Then there''s stealing items from enemies and learning their moves, and bosses
      with their own twisted rules you have to account for. Simply put, combat offers
      a lot of creative variety.


      Another factor to the balancing of combat is your stat gains on level up. In
      most RPGs, all your stats increase. In Axe Cop, you get to pick one stat to
      increase. On your next level up, the previous stat you chose only offers half
      of its value so as to entice you to spread your points around. Each party member
      has their own stat growth parameters, so they all retain their own role in the
      party . Later in the game you may find scrolls that let you increase the level
      gains either by giving a more even increase to all stats or by giving major
      increases to a character''s main stats. The choice is yours.

      Furthermore, party members mainly learn new moves when certain stats reach a
      threshold. You can check that in the Fighter Moves section on your Cellphone,
      which unfortunately you don''t have access to when you''re assigning points
      after levelling up. The game also hides some stat-boosting vitamins, and I highly
      recommend holding on to those for characters who learn moves later into stats
      they get few points from. For instance, Fire Slicer needs a bunch of defense
      but only gets one point per level whereas a vitamin would give him five points.
      And you do want to teach every team member all their moves, because they get
      a big stat boost if you manage that.


      Of course, there''s more to an RPG''s gameplay than just the combat. After walking
      for a few steps, your character will start sprinting which will let you jump
      over gaps. Every team member has their own special field ability as well; Axe
      Cop can chop down obstacles, Fire Slicer can light up dark rooms, Sockarang
      can throw boomerangs to hit switches and grab items, Ralph Wrinkles can sniff
      out hidden secrets, etc. All of this lends itself to creative level layouts
      and a team with no weak links in it.


      [b]The Bad:[/b]

      Axe Cop does not employ a "less is more" mentality to its level design. While
      the game essentially is structured as an overworld and 8 separate dungeons or
      "cases", these worlds are so large that they require multiple checkpoints spread
      far apart. The worst of it is case 3, where you''re going into a laboratory
      that is 10 floors deep. Each floor has several large rooms, and you have to
      go through all of them multiple times as you''re searching for ways to open
      the color-coded doors on each floor until you can reach the very bottom. It''s
      a massive place, and the appearance of the floors don''t change enough that
      I could create a mental map. While the dungeon crawling does get broken up by
      a falling block puzzle when you unlock the color doors, the puzzles amount to
      minutes out of several hours spent in there.


      While I can praise the music and enemy designs, the gigantic levels do them
      no favors. During the 3-5 hours I spent on case 3, there were 4 different types
      of enemy I could find; the shark bat, bear crab, military grunt, and night monster.
      That''s it. The cool features of the battle system lose all ability to impress
      or entertain when you fight the same battles a hundred times over. Also, the
      random encounters do not have their own fight music. You just keep hearing the
      dungeon music loop forever and on and on. Case 2, while a dramatic increase
      in scale from the introductory case, at least had two different pieces of music
      for indoors and outdoors, and a slight change in which enemies were available.
      Case 3 and its eye-searing neon pink tiles may be where players drop off, I
      fear. That would be a shame, because it gets better from there and case 4 felt
      especially short and sweet.


      Some of the puzzles also suffer from bloat. One example is in case 7, where
      you have to solve a 7x7 puzzle where every piece has at most three shades of
      blue and one shade of yellow. The finished image is visible if you inspect a
      picture on the wall, but you have to push several puzzle pieces away to reach
      it and you may not even see it in the sea of blue you''re in. This puzzle would
      be easy if you could click and drag pieces around, but we are confined to our
      grid-based movement and our player character occupies physical space in this
      cramped room where you can only push and drag individual blocks. It took me
      no less than an hour to solve it. Another example is between cases 7 & 8, you''re
      in a big open environment with no enemies and you''re collecting 160 bees that
      are spread out all over. Why does there have to be so many bees?


      One  positive I mentioned was that each character has a way of interacting with
      the environment that''s unique to them. From the beginning Axe Cop is joined
      by Flute Cop, and he can play a song at bear statues scattered across all worlds.
      Playing the song will trigger a change in the map, unique to each location.
      This flute ability is retained when Flute Cop turns into Avocado Soldier before
      case 2, and by case 4 he can turn into Ghost Cop to play the flute to go into
      the Ghost World. This is all fine, and the game teaches you to treat the bear
      statue as a cue to bring in Flute Cop, whatever form he is in.

      That works until case 7 where my problem lies. In order to make progress I had
      to play a song to the bear statue not as Flute Cop, but as Sockarang. Sockarang
      learns to play the guitar at the end of case 2, but in the next case the party
      is split up so he''s absent, and in case 4 we''re introduced to Ghost Cop''s
      interactions with the statues. Before chapter 7 Sockarang was never called upon
      to play, but he was repeatedly brought in to throw his boomerangs. In other
      words, the game does a terrible job at teaching you a mechanic, doesn''t make
      use of it for 15 hours, and then expects you to remember it. If not for the
      developer''s Let''s Play, I would never have figured out what to do.


      [b]The Verdict:[/b]

      All of my praise is painted in broad strokes that encompass the whole game,
      whereas my complaints are a lot more granular and nitpicky. What I see as a
      flaw in pacing feels like it comes from a place of love for the project and
      wanting to provide as much content as possible. The game feels massive and dense,
      telling a comprehensive and complete story in some 20-30 hours. And that''s
      not accounting for all the optional content, which includes battle gauntlets,
      optional bosses, hidden collectibles, learning secret moves, and more.

      I would highly recommend this to any fan of turnbased RPGs and/or retro gamers
      in general. While the ride wasn''t always smooth, I was here for a wild one
      and it did deliver. This is unambiguously the best 2020 Steam game I''ve played.'
