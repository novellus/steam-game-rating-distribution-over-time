However I do have somethings to go over that hopefully will aid in the endeavors of your friend. Considering that I don't really like 'puzzle adventure' games I can say that there were a number of genuinely fun puzzles! And often I felt a 'cascading success' whenever I successfully solved the puzzles placed before me and caught myself having genuine fun. Even though I did abuse the hint option a fair pit and may have skipped one or two I found difficult I did appreciate that there were alternate solutions to the puzzles, such as instead of finding things I could play an item matching game so I wasn't simply stuck there. The artwork is quite nice, not bad in the least and it can be very atmospheric, the animations however are were it starts to suffer a bit. There's a bit of jank in the animations that make them look a bit, wrong on occasion, though there are lots of smaller animations that looked nice. When it came to people moving or large objects it got a little off. The game excels at its still art but its animation does require a bit more work, not bad for a small time company though.\nThe soundtrack is very nice but because I kept getting stuck I'd hear the same music loop and at times it did get on my nerves a touch. A longer loop could fix this I think but that might just be a problem for me. Storywise its not too bad, as an outsider however I know very little of the culture, faiths or similar things of India. Reading little tid-bits of legends, stories or mythological figures, I feel, would enhance aspects of the story though I may just be pining to learn more about the 'lore of the land' as it were. Not bad over all though\n[4:06 PM]\nI feel like there is talent behind this and while this is, from what I can tell, their first major release, its not bad considering not only its price but what it has on offer. I do recommend taking a look into other gameplay styles or choice making. In particular a game I could recommend for the developers in terms of art style and story is Banner Saga, which presents itself in a way I find quite compelling. If nothing else its worth investigating. As for the voice acting in the game is a little basic but the actors sounded for the most part rather fine (English Version) though the lead could have done with a few more attempts.\n\nOverall however the game isn't too bad for $4 and I'm having my fun with it. I do genuinely enjoy gathering the ingredients to make like the medicine, the olive oil and so on.
