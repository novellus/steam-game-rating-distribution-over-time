    review: "\xC9 uma DLC foda, os personagens e tudo que cont\xE9m nessa DLC ajuda\
      \ pro visual do seu parque nas quest\xF5es relacionadas a cinema, filmes e como\
      \ o pr\xF3prio nome diz \"Studio\".\nSe voc\xEA pensa em montar um parque parecido\
      \ com a Universal Studios por exemplo, essa DLC vai ajudar muito.\nPor fim,\
      \ se estiver no pre\xE7o normal recomendo aguardar as promo\xE7\xF5es, pois\
      \ geralmente nelas fica em torno de 10 reais apenas."
