This route features the stunning part from Kreuzlingen to Schaffhausen. <br><br>The route as it is today was built in 4 segments from 1869 to 1895. Initially, there were 3 Swiss train companies who had built routes in this area. One after another, the NOB (Swiss Northeastern Railway) took over the separate parts and united them. In 1902, when Switzerland started nationalising its railway companies, SBB took over the route. They started electrifying the route in 1928, but because of its status as a branch line, it took until 1969 to complete electrification. <br><br>In the 1990s, the SBB slowly started decommissioning the route, but in 1996 the MThB (Mittel-Thurgau-Bahn or Central Thurgau Railway) took over the route and started modernising both the tracks and the trains.
