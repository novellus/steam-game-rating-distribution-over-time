Each chapter of the game is a forced path littered with enemies. Attempting to push anywhere other than forward emediatly hits invisible walls.\n\n-Invisible walls everywhere. See stairs? They'll be blocked by a wall. See the cave entarance ahead of you? Wall.\n\n-Audio rises, drops, and cuts at random, often being made worse by the stage music blaring in out entirely.\n\n-Enemies will bug out and become un-killable forcing level restarts often.\n\n-Un-even story plot.\n\n-Menus and icons apear extremely dated and unpolished.\n\nPros:\n+ Great OST (locked behind an extra $20 if you want to listen to it out of the game)\n\n+ Game Models and level atmospher are extremely well designed, if wrongly executed. It doesn't look \"Next Gen\", but it's also not trying to. The cell shaded comic book style looks fantastic.\n\n+ New vilian character shows potential if used correctly in future episodes.\n\n\n\nI'm used, and willing to sift through problems in a game to find the enjoyable, but even I am struggling here.\n\nI do hope the devs are able to correct this troubling amount of issues in time for the 2nd episode. In the mean time, even the most die hard Afro Samurai fan may want to stick to re-watching the anime for the time being..","timestamp_created":1442955369,"timestamp_updated":1481519911,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":62,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.759924829006195068","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hfrd+NgCet2eRQ=="}
