It suffers from the same issue as a lot of indie boomer shooters, it has an excellent aesthetic and style but lacks in gameplay. The guns don't have much feedback and the enemies are mostly dopey and easy to kill even on higher difficulties, and feel as if they are just scattered through the level without much thought about how the player might want to approach fights. Hulshult's OST work is fantastic as always and hopefully it gets a couple updates or something to make it a little more polished. \n\n(Also fuck you for making me reload my guns in a boomer shooter)\n\nEDIT: Go play Ultrakill, it's way more fun and actually worth the money if you're after a good boomer shooter","timestamp_created":1610200312,"timestamp_updated":1610207348,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw0sj18/YCf7DnwQI="}
