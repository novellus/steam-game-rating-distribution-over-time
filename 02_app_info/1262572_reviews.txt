It's a real cool place with a lot of open areas and objects to jump over. It has different textures and the airfield's end is just water, so racers and cops usually fall down. And the cars from this DLC have a license plate reading: \"VELOCITY\"\n\n[h1] CARS [/h1]\n\nThis pack mostly has normal cars you can see on street in real life.\n\n[b] Alfa Romeo Mito QV [/b]\n\nThis car sounds like a hypercar though it's really slow, slows down a lot when turning as well. Look hot though.\n\n[b] Audi RS 3 Sportback [/b]\n\nThis thing looks like your standard Hatchback ride, and it actually is. Honestly it's fairly slow though you can drift with it, has good on and off road traction.\n\n[b] BMW 1 Series M Coupe [/b]\n\nThis car looks and sounds beatiful. It's pretty fine too, can drift pretty well with track tires.\n\n[b] Ford Fiesta ST [/b]\n\nFar as I remember this was the car at the trailer. It's pretty much same with the Audi.\n\n[b] Porsche 918 Spyder [/b]\n\nThis car is slower than the normal 918 in retail. That's all there is to it. Oh and it has an ugly vinyl that you can't get rid of.\n\n[h1] MODS [/h1]\n\nThis is the only pack that has car mods.\n\n[b] DRIFT TIRES [/b]\n\nThis thing is amazing. It makes your car slide a lot but if you know what you are doing that isn't a problem. You can have really long and fun drifts with this thing. And it's PRO mod makes the tire emit colorful smoke which changes when you go through a body shop.\n\n[b] JUMP NITROUS [/b]\n\nThis thing gives you a hilarous speed boost if you use it mid-air. Though it's pretty much useless and depletes really fast. So I don't like but if you will spend a lot of time mid-air then you can use it.\n\n[b] RAM CHASSIS [/b] \n\nThis thing is avaible in the core game for some reasons that I don't know. Though it's really amazing to get rid of that stupid CRASHED screen for head-on collisions.\n\n[h1] ULTIMATE SPEED [/h1]\n\nThese cars are really fast weak and hard to control. And the cars from this DLC has license plates reading \"ULTIMATE\"\n\n[b] Bugatti Veyron Vitesse [/b]\n\nThis car is a bit longer than the original one that comes with the game. And it has silver rims and a two-tone color scheme. It's pretty decent honestly, and can drift well.\n\n[b] Henessey Venom GT Spyder [/b]\n\nThis is the fastest car in the game. Looks pretty slick as well.\n\n[b] Lamborghini Aventador J [/b]\n\nThis car is really ugly. It's really fast like anything else in the pack though. It's a convertible as well.\n\n [b] Mclaren F1 LM [/b]\n\nMy favorite car after Maserati. This thing is really nice. Fast and hard to control, just like everything else in this pack!\n\n[b] Pagani Zonda R [/b]\n\nThis thing is beatiful. It only has a carbon fiber paintjob with red lines. It can't be changed.\n\n[h1] MOVIE LEGENDS [/h1]\n\nNow, I am not a person that likes movies, so I won't talk about what movies these cars are from. These cars' plates read \"MOVILGND\"\n\n[b] Aston Martin DB5 [/b]\n\nThis thing is really old but it's actually pretty well. Looks amazing as well. It's just lovely.\n\n[b] Aston Martin DBS [/b]\n\nFar as I know this car has a V12 engine. It screams a lot like in James Bond. Looks way better than V12 Vantage as well.\n\n[b] Dodge Charger R/T [/b]\n\nThe true american classic. My favorite muscle car as well. It has a giant air filter in front too. It's pretty fast and handles really good. My favorite car from the pack.\n\n[b] Pontiac Firebird T/A [/b]\n\nThis car looks nice but it's slow. Just what you expect from an old car. \n\n[b] Shelby GT500 [/b]\n\nI thought this was the 2012 model. Still is a true classic and it's just fine. Pretty easy to beat as well.\n\n[h1] NEED FOR SPEED HEROES [/h1]\n\nAll of the iconic cars from previous games! Plates read \"NFS-HERO\"\n\n[h1] CARS [/h1]\n\n[b] BMW M3 GTR [/b]\n\nWhat else would you get this DLC for at the first place? Sounds and looks amazing. Pretty fast too. Best car in the game in my opinion.\n\n[b] Lamborghini Diablo SV [/b]\n\nI think this is from Hot Pursuit? Still pretty fast for an old car though.\n\n[b] Nissan 350Z [/b]\n\nTrust me, Nissans in this game are absolute crap. Except EGOIST. They look amazing but hilariously slow without any mods. You can make this thing amazing with right mods though.\n\n[b] Nissan Skyline GT-R (R34)  [/b]\n\n\"rule 34 funy ahahhahaha xd\"\nJokes aside, just read 350Z\n\n[b] Porsche 911 GT2 [/b]\n\nBest Porsche ever? It's actually fast and is pretty controllable as well. You can use this without mods.\n\n[h1] MODS [/h1]\n\nI know I said only Terminal Velocity has mods, but that's kinda true. These mods are only for these cars and they are just liveries. You can't change colors in this cars but liveries instead. Each car has:\n\nURBAN\nSTREET\nRACE\nABSTRACT\nHERO\n\nI won't comment on these, they are pretty subjective.\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nDo I recommend it? Heck yes! It's the best DLC I've seen for a long time. Even though this game is really old it's still amazing.\n\n[spoiler] Thank you for reading to the end. If you are seeing I wish you a happy day.
