    review: "[b]Safari Cafe[/b] \xE9 o primeiro jogo da s\xE9rie [b]Katy and Bob[/b],\
      \ a hist\xF3ria do nosso simp\xE1tico casal de irm\xE3os come\xE7a em um safari\
      \ africano, quando juntos t\xEAm a brilhante ideia de vender alimento aos turistas\
      \ e usar os animais como forma de entretenimento!\n\nAo longo da trama vemos\
      \ que Katy se apaixona por um personagem aleat\xF3rio, come\xE7ando assim uma\
      \ hist\xF3ria de amor que termina entre o casamento dela e desse personagem.\
      \ O irm\xE3o n\xE3o tem tanto destaque como merecia, ele apenas prepara os alimentos\
      \ que os clientes pedem na cafeteria, permanecendo bastante ofuscado entre o\
      \ casal que surge.\n\nO jogo \xE9 um t\xEDpico gerenciador de cafeteria, onde\
      \ voc\xEA fica indo de um lado para o outro preparando os pratos ou bebidas\
      \ para os clientes. A hist\xF3ria passa por entre 3 caf\xE9s diferentes ao longo\
      \ de 60 fases massantes, voc\xEA acumula dinheiro para fazer upgrades nos equipamentos\
      \ do caf\xE9.\n\nTodas as fases possuem miss\xF5es secund\xE1rias simples de\
      \ fazerem, ao conclu\xED-las, voc\xEA ganha moedas de ouro para upgrades permanentes,\
      \ como velocidade da personagem ou humor dos clientes. \n\nBastante casual,\
      \ entretanto n\xE3o oferece suporte ao idioma brasileiro, mas isso n\xE3o interfere\
      \ no entendimento ou interesse pela hist\xF3ria geral do jogo.\n\n| [b]Valor\
      \ pago:[/b] R$1,19"
