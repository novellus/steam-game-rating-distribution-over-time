Most of the story is told through art that you get whenever you transition to a new screen. The screens are quick..but not painless. It's easy to die in this game. You are supposed to collect runes to help you progress (buy items, rez), but other than the ones the game gives you for free during the starting level these appear to drop randomly. \n\nOverall a good game with a low key mellow soundtrack.","timestamp_created":1609882656,"timestamp_updated":1609882656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0Pue6vYCc+vpwAI="}
