And it is a simple, but fun idea.  But it needs more work: as others have mentioned, the AI needs to be improved, there should be more than one map/level, and it could stand some real online multiplayer instead of just simulated.\n\nFor now, I would suggest waiting for a better version, or for this product to have more work done, even if it's on sale.","timestamp_created":1609740285,"timestamp_updated":1609740285,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xO7/5fYCfZWnwAI="}
