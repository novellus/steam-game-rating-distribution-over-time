    about_the_game: "Relive your favourite club nights and gigs, load your own music\
      \ (Hardcore, Punk, Metal, any genre really, via .wav audio file format) and\
      \ go to the dance floor,  annihilate anyone in your path using the classic metal\
      \ moshing moves (lots of NPC's doing the same), stage dive as you please, head\
      \ bang with realistic hair physics. The music you load drives the game, your\
      \ experience. In a nutshell, it's a next level heavy metal music sim. <br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nHone your inner Metal head or be straightedge, or go punk and destroy\
      \ everything,  or play some classical Beethoven while moshing, we don't mind.\
      \ Or visit other clubs and explore.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIMPORTANT - Setup instructions:<br\
      \ />\r\nFor the ideal playing experience, before playing the game grab some\
      \ of your favourite artists .wav tracks, copy those into the folder ..\\Windows\\\
      MadMosh_Data\\StreamingAssets<br />\r\nWhen the game loads it loads those songs\
      \ and plays them in order, to get data such as beats per minute. If you do not\
      \ perform this step, don't worry, the default in-game music will play! When\
      \ you are ready start the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce playing, press the escape\
      \ key to get the options, help, player customisation. To stage dive press the\
      \ right shift key while in dance more (Hold both left and right shift for a\
      \ BIG stage dive, to stop/start dance mode press left ctrl key), power moves\
      \ controlled by M, , ? keys, L is for headbanging. Take a drink to get your\
      \ strength back, press E key near a drink. C key is for slow motion.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nHave fun in the mosh pit."
