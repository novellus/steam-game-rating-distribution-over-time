    about_the_game: "Galactic Crew is a roguelike sci-fi game that takes place in\
      \ a galaxy far away. You start the game as a captain of a small spaceship, with\
      \ only a few crew members and limited resources. During your journey through\
      \ outer space, you will meet merchants, miners, scientists and notorious pirates.\
      \ You will need to trade goods and resources to upgrade your ship and to get\
      \ better equipment for you and your crew. Equip your ship with a teleporter\
      \ to explore different types of planets and underground dungeons. Talk with\
      \ scientists about their work, trade with merchants, rescue crashed pilots,\
      \ fight raiders and vicious beasts or gather resources to craft new items.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Explore a galaxy</h2><br>When starting a new game, an entire\
      \ galaxy is procedurally generated for you to explore. Mine asteroid fields\
      \ to gather resources, trade with merchants, get missions from space stations,\
      \ upgrade your ship at shipyards, explore new galaxies with jump gates, explore\
      \ planets with your crew or raid underground dungeons.<br><br>While travelling\
      \ through the galaxy, you will meet random encounters and some of them want\
      \ to harm you. Make sure your ship is well-armed and your crew is well-equipped!<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Ship customization</h2><br>All 12 playable spaceships have\
      \ their own layout. Retrofit your spaceship at any space station or shipyard\
      \ by replacing rooms, equipping drones and improving your weapon turrets. More\
      \ than 25 different rooms are available to customize your ship. You can have\
      \ everything from simple rooms like engines, generators and crew quarters to\
      \ tactical rooms like teleporters, shield generators and drone boosters. Use\
      \ rooms like item processors or botanical gardens to even produce your own goods\
      \ and items!<br><br>Mining drones can be used to improve the mining yield of\
      \ your ship, while combat drones and shield drones give you a great advantage\
      \ in space combat. Various weapon turrets in different sizes and special abilities\
      \ are available to arm your spaceship.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game customization</h2><br>When\
      \ starting a new game, you can customize your game by selecting a spaceship,\
      \ an avatar, a profession and bonus cards. Depending on your selection these\
      \ bonus cards can improve your ship\u2019s strength, add more objects to the\
      \ galaxy, alter game mechanics or add story lines! You can add multiple story\
      \ lines to create your own custom campaign!<br><br>Only a small fraction of\
      \ these cards are available when starting the game for the very first time.\
      \ You can unlock all of them by getting achievements. Play the game and you\
      \ will unlock more content!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore planets and dungeons</h2><br>There\
      \ are over 100 different handcrafted dungeons to raid and over a dozen planets\
      \ wait for your exploration. These explorations range from meeting scientists\
      \ at archaeological sites, scrapyards and weapon smuggler outposts to medieval\
      \ villages, mining outposts and crash sites guarded by large monsters."

    review: "Pues que decir, lo probe y la verdad, me gust\xF3 el sistema, dise\xF1\
      o.... un poco pesado y tedioso los controles en planetas y fuera de la nave.\
      \ Aunque puedes sobrellevarlo. El porque no lo recomiendo es porque cuando lo\
      \ compras pones que esta en espa\xF1ol, pero al entrar en las opciones del juego,\
      \ intentas cambiar el idioma al espa\xF1ol, y no te deja, por lo que intuyo\
      \ que no esta implementado. Y como lleva asi desde que lo compre y no hay un\
      \ soporte tecnico ni discusiones en steam para que te digas algo al respecto\
      \ sobre esa hipotetica traduccion al espa\xF1ol, no recomiendo el titulo por\
      \ falsedad."
