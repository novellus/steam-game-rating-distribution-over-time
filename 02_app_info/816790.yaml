    review: This map has can be as easy or as hard as you make it. The new trucks
      are quite cool and the D-538 can self load logs. Note that the D-538 doesn't
      always spawn, so starting with a c-class truck will make it much easier. There
      are also some C-65115s you can use, but those struggle though every inch of
      mud. If you want a casual experience, spawn with the 538 and it's no problem.
      If you want a hellride, try using the starting trucks. 7/10 would log again
