If you like visual novels, it's great and definitely worth your time! And if it's not, what are you doing here? You're silly.\n\nIts greatest strengths are in its writing and usage of spirtes- The banter feels natural for the most part, the two characters are fleshed out well in the time they have, and there's a surprisingly wide variety of sprites that add some life to the story. Those, along with some interesting themes, make it a solid and relaxing way to spend a few hours.","timestamp_created":1488244931,"timestamp_updated":1488244931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m++TwdoCfLypcw=="}
