    review: "I've had a Steam account for many years now and I have lots of games,\
      \ but this is the first review, I think, I've written for any of them. I love\
      \ this game and I really hope you keep updating it! I saw Grillmastah's video\
      \ back in March and added it to my wish-list, and finally purchased it today.\n\
      \nI love the interactive mini-game with the aliens because I love the techno\
      \ music! The scenery is spectacular! When I first saw the Blue Hills (I think\
      \ that's the name of the area) I was blown away. The imagination and creativity\
      \ that has gone into this game is awesome. I really like the non-melee game-play.\
      \ When I get a new game, if there's a way to turn that off, I do that right\
      \ at the start. Not every game needs to have \"things\" trying to rip your face\
      \ off All the time. \n\nThank you for making it! Please keep up the great work!"
