All of the music played in-game just suits the overall theme and is killer when it starts playing and getting you in the groove of things, especially combat.\n\nI bought it while it was on sale along with the game itself, but I'd easily pay $5 for how amazing it sounds. As for the only (at the time) other review here, it's true that it's more hybrid. There are electric synths and instruments but also physically played instruments by a real musician which in my opinion is a great combination. There simply are just sounds a computer can make that a human with an instrument cannot and the other way around.","timestamp_created":1605408304,"timestamp_updated":1605408304,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541393697261810303","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuNXy5PUCf5O5rgI="}
