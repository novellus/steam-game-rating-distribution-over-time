      notes: 'The game does have blood and gore on the ground, floor and walls in
        various parts through out the game. There are some swear words in some of
        the readable files found throughout the game. '

    review: "LOL.  $30 for a game mashed together from default GameGuru assets?!?\
      \  \n\nGameGuru is a game engine that often is found on sale for $5 on Steam\
      \ and found in huge bundles with DLC on bundle websites for just $10 or $12.\
      \  Imagine taking this bundle that help spawn literally hundreds of 99 cent\
      \ and $1.99 garbage games on Steam and mashing together your own mess of default\
      \ assets and asking $29.99 USD for it.  Well, look no further people, because\
      \ that's exactly what this indie developer has done!  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTY3-BEPa4\n\
      \nIf you dare read the about information from the game's main menu. you'll quickly\
      \ see that a developer who struggles to put together a proper sentence has also\
      \ exported this game you just paid $30 for.  It's the moment where you start\
      \ to question your own intelligence and more importantly, your own sanity.\n\
      \nThis GameGuru game is no different from the hundreds of others found on Steam\
      \ except that this one has the nerve to ask $30 for instead of the common 99\
      \ cent price tag.  It's got all the crap we have come to hate in all GameGuru\
      \ games... terrible textures, laughable AI, terrain stretched upwards to create\
      \ sinfully ugly mountains, a obnoxiously loud heartbeat when you take any damage\
      \ at all, etc.\n\nAvoid unless you can find it on some key selling website for\
      \ under a quarter.  Then you might want to buy it, not for yourself, but as\
      \ a gift to the most annoying friend you have on Steam."
