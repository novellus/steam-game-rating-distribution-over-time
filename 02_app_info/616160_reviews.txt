Not sure, if it still was worth it, but better than buying every music DLC separately.\nLike the music, although I turned off Viking Metal, Full Plate Metal and Orchestreal House Lords because it was playing too damn often and broke the immersion for me.\n\nTL;DR: Overall very good music, best to get on sale.","timestamp_created":1604406263,"timestamp_updated":1604406263,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zZeEx/UCeMGCrAI="}
