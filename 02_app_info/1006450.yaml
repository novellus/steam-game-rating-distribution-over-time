    review: 'Take this review of "Eric the Unready" with a grain of salt since I think
      I''ve just grown too old to play these types of games (semi-graphical, basically
      text adventure).  But, besides the genre, another problem is that the game is
      OLD (1993) and feels like it.  The interface is bad, the graphics are terrible,
      and the sound is horrible.  Surprisingly, it also seems to load and run a bit
      slowly on a modern machine (I assume that''s an issue with the DOSbox it runs
      in).  That probably would have been acceptable, but the game just didn''t grab
      me (and I don''t know why).  So, after a mere 1.2 hours, I gave up and I''m
      Not Recommending it.


      I don''t know if this is allowed, but, if you''re at all interested in the game,
      you could try it out for free at the Internet Archive:
