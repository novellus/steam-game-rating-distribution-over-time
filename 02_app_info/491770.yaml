    review: 'It''s a really good game, the creatures are cute and the combat is great.
      But, you have to go online and verse real players for coins for new creatures
      and game money for customizations. The AI don''t fight back in local play but
      still fun to play with friends.


      Only get this game if you have family or friends that play it, I only play it
      because I have a sister who does, we help eachother out with the unlockables
      and steam achievements.


      There are things wrong with this game however. Like said, in local play, the
      AI don''t fight back and the game forces you to go online to unlock things.
      It takes forever to level up, also, you have to pay real money to get in-game
      money to unlock things. I wouldn''t recommend getting this game if your playing
      it by yourself. Make sure that you have friends or family members that play
      it as well before getting this game.
