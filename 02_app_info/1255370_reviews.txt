However, it not accessed in-game. Instead, you must run it from Seek Girl's installation directory. If you want to access this DLC's contents from your Steam Library, I suggest adding the appropriate file as a \"Non-Steam Game\".\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is essentially a gallery locked behind a sexual minigame. The gallery is navigated with an avatar, and images are opened by interacting with static NPCs. Each NPC starts a short game, where you click on hearts as they appear on screen (to fill a gauge). Once you've clicked enough hearts, you get to see some [i]saucy[/i] content. There are five images to unlock, and they must be earned in a predefined order.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nYou're some well dressed dude who bangs (willing) girls in prison. Maybe he's promised them freedom in exchange for sexual favors. . . ?\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThere is no title screen or menus. Upon booting the game, you are taken directly to the gallery. The gallery uses standard RPGMaker sprites.\n\n[b]- The Goods -[/b]\nThere are five ladies to choose from, each animated and with dressed/undressed versions. The animations aren't the [i]worst[/i] I've seen, but I wouldn't call them good either. I saw visual errors here and there, from doubled noses to flickering screens. Expect basic female on male action.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nYou can find [i]two to three times[/i] the number of animations in other titles for the same price, uncensored, and higher quality. Considering that and lack of gameplay this DLC (and the base game) adds, I don't reccommend this software.\n\n[h1]Support the Wombat[/h1]\nIf you enjoy my reviews, please follow my Curator page.
