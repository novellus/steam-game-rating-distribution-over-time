Maybe it wasn't really my sort of film.\nNonetheless, it was ok to watch.\n\nThe two end scenes were decent ones, so that was a plus in its favour. There's nothing worse than watching a show which turns out to have a rubbish ending, but that wasn't the situation with this movie - so the writers did well on that score.\n\nI should note three negative aspects of the production:\n\n1) I found it a bit slow to start with - although that may have been necessary, just to lay out the background for the story.\n\n2) The scenes regarding the daytime television awards were a bit stupid, and quite a stark contrast to the nature of the rest of the movie (the kitchen fight scene was a bit that way as well) - it was almost as if a different writer had come up with those parts. The scenes for the daytime television awards were a very poor attempt at humour, which followed a style which has been used in various low-grade productions, and they just made the show look a bit stupid. Thankfully those scenes didn't go on for too long.\n\n3) There seemed to be some discordant background noise in a couple of places (e.g. at 17.42 min.) - I don't know if that was just with my download (although I did double-check that spot in the film) or if it was meant to be some sort of ambient noise.\n\nNot the best movie I've ever seen, but certainly not the worst, more of a middling affair.\nThe acting, filming, music, and production were all very good.\n\n5.5/10","timestamp_created":1485673295,"timestamp_updated":1495290779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ419KRk9wCetLgcA=="}
