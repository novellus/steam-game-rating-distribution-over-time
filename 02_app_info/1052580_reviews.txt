The art style, the music, the writing--it all comes together and creates such a moving experience. With just a few words, characters are given such rich backgrounds and varying experiences. We get glimpses of life, tragic little vignettes interspersed with moments of happiness. I cared about these robots, and I mourned them. \n\nFair warning that this is a sad game. I cried several times while playing. I regret nothing though. I loved every moment of it.\n\nEdit: Note that you can only play this game once! Once you are done, you will have no restart option.","timestamp_created":1609040902,"timestamp_updated":1609112759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rYWm0/YCdorPvQI="}
