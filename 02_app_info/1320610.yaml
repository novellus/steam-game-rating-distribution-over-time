    about_the_game: Patrick's Parabox is a mind-bending puzzle game that explores
      a unique recursive system of boxes within boxes within boxes within boxes. Learn
      to manipulate the world's structure by pushing boxes into and out of each other.
      Wrap your head around what happens when a box contains itself, and learn to
      use infinity to your advantage. Explore more mechanics and recursive twists
      as you delve deeper and deeper into the system. It's boxes all the way down.<br><br><img

      /><br><br>The game has over 250 hand-crafted puzzles, which are designed to
      make you think, but also to guide you and showcase the beauty of the system.
      Each puzzle contains a new idea; there is no filler.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1320610/extras/steam_gif_2.gif?t=1592338839"
      /><br><br>Patrick's Parabox won the Excellence in Design award in the Independent
      Games Festival 2020. The game was also an IndieCade 2019 festival selection
      and received the IndieCade Developers Choice award.<h2 class="bb_tag">Demo Information</h2><br>This
      demo consists of the first few dozen puzzles in the game. Hopefully it gives
      you a sense of the depth of the puzzle system. The full game has a number of
      additional recursive mechanics that are gradually introduced, and over 250 puzzles
      in total.
