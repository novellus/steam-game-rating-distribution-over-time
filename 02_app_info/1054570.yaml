    review: Awfully tedious and boring. Wasn't a tutorial so I couldn't grasp the
      janky (and often glitch-ridden) controls for the first ten minutes of playtime
      before I actually understood what to do. Took me about six minutes to play essentially
      everything this game has to offer. In it's current state, I wouldn't recommend
      this game to anyone who cares about spending money on actual quality games.
      Would've been much better as a one-off free to play title, but for $7.00?? Nah,
      I'm good.
