This is a game from 1999. If you are expecting it to work straight out of the box on a modern computer you will be disappointed. Even if it does work (it did for me), the 1999 graphics are a bit sad.\n\nFor all those children crying that it's broken, no it isn't. It's just not compatible with modern hardware. Don't expect an official patch because the game was essentially abandoned in 2002. If any of that upsets you, move along and save your £3.49 because this game isn't for you.\n\nOK, so why is Steam selling a 'broken' game from 1999 that doesn't even work on a modern machine? That's easy. It's because it was, and still is, one of the best 'space simulation' games ever. While there haven't been any official patches for two decades, there are new unofficial ones every few weeks.\n\nThere is a large and active community of fans who have kept the game alive and updated for twenty years. The game's source code was released in 2002 under a non-commercial license, and FreeSpaceOpen was born. There are now games based on Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5 and the Wing Commander series, all using an updated version of the FS2 code. FS2 itself has been completely worked over, with new hi-resolution graphics, new voice acting and new music. The original Freespace 1 game has also been ported across and given the same updates. Dozens of new campaigns and missions have been added.\n\nThe latest builds of the game engine support 1440p monitors and current graphics cards - I'm using a GTX 1060 6GB.\n\nTo get it up to the latest standard is really easy. Buy FreeSpace 2 from Steam and install it. Download the FreeSpaceOpen mod installer called Knossos. Run Knossos and tell it where your installation of FreeSpace 2 is. Browse the catalogue of mods, download whatever takes your fancy and play. The Knossos launcher also has a settings box where you can adjust your sound and graphics preferences. Note that you won't be playing the Steam version of the game at all, so your Steam overlay won't work and your playing time won't register. The Steam version is just there so the Knossos launcher can see you own a legitimate copy of the game for copyright and licensing purposes.\n\nI bought this game new in 1999, in the original retail box. I've enjoyed playing it for years. After building a new computer I decided to resurrect all my old games and get them working. Rather than messing about finding the box in the loft, I spent the price of a coffee on the Steam version. It took maybe ten minutes from hitting \"purchase now\" to playing The Babylon Project mod in 1440p widescreen.\n\nThe one and only criticism I have is that it doesn't support multiple USB input devices, so I can't use my rudder pedals and joystick together. I have a Thrustmaster T-Flight stick, with a twist for the rudder so I can work around it.\n\nThis game was criminally underrated when it came out. Do yourself a favour and drop £3.49 on it, and download the latest community patches to play the best space combat game ever.","timestamp_created":1609085074,"timestamp_updated":1609086684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtsnC0vYCeJPmvQI="}
