    review: 'I never played a game that hasn''t been reviewed before. It almost feels
      like I''ve come across something very hidden. The presentation overall isn''t
      really up to par with some more polished experiences, reminding me of when Xbox
      Live had indie games and some of them were either crap or gold.


      I''m gonna be a bit blunt: This game ain''t gold.


      The game is another top down dungeon crawler roguelite where you slice baddies
      in a dark and gritty atmosphere. A majority of the early game involves lots
      of circle strafing baddies with the usage of the sprint key and the sword. As
      you progress, you find various spells that aid you in your little adventure.
      The cooldowns between using your offense feel very slow, and combat doesn''t
      really feel satisfying, at least until you can get some spells to pepper some
      enemies with. The spells not only make the game more fun to play, but make confrontation
      easier when you play at a distance. The starting weapon you have could deal
      a bit more damage in the early game, since it takes a good chunk of time to
      both evade and kill enemies.


      You progress in the game by going through doors or holes that have numbers and
      decimals in them. From my understanding, they determine how far you progress
      in the game. Things spike up greatly in difficulty on the 3rd level where your
      mistakes become more punished. There is less leeway and you quickly have to
      start from the beginning. At one point, I also reached the "Engineer" boss.
      I tried to get to the boss, but before I could, I kept falling downward as if
      I was transitioning into another level. I kept arriving at the same spot over
      and over, until I felt like enough was enough.


      Core Of Darkness is a fair attempt at game development. While it isn''t a good
      game, it does have some creative ideas with how it handles its spellcasting
      and enemy/hazard design. The game really would have benefited from more polish
      and more play testing before being tucked away under steam''s storefront. At
      the very least, this game tried to be a game, rather than something more bland
      or generic. With that said, I can''t think of who I''d recommend this to.
