    review: "Not a bad game, but some improvements could be made to make it better.\
      \ \n\n1. Having the option of a score limit? Right now it seems that it just\
      \ goes on until both sides agree that the one with more points wins?\n\n2. A\
      \ topic filter for questions? I get that it's supposed to be general knowledge,\
      \ but not everyone is a genius. (It is rather funny to see friends struggle\
      \ to answer questions though). \n"
