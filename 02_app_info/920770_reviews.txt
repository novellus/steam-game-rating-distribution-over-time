That is natural evolution of games such as Santa Claus in Trouble from the early 2000s. I'm glad that Santa's Story of Christmas revived festive theme in platformers. I wish more seasonal games like this, because nowdays if you want to play something \"Ð¡hristmasy\", all you can get is just some point and click searching for objects.  Again, this is great festive game that will help you to get in the mood on the winter evenings. But don't think this game is easy, oh boy, it is not. \n\nMerry Christmas and Happy New Year!","timestamp_created":1608838104,"timestamp_updated":1608838104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvKiOy/YCecLtvAI="}
