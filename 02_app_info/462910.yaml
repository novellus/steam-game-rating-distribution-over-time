    short_description: PolyRunner VR is an addictive, high-quality experience that
      tests your skills against an other-worldly, ever-changing landscape rather than
      testing your ability to maintain control of your stomach. This engaging virtual
      world offers more interesting, challenging terrain the further you progress.
