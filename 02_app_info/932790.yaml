    review: 'I don''t mean to discourage the developer but honestly this game really
      really should be in Early Access. I know it says BETA on it, but it''s on steam
      as a regular release, and it''s simply not ready. The game world has promise
      but it needs A LOT of work. Platforming seems floaty and imprecise. Combat is
      clunky and unsatisfying. The sound effects are low quality and ineffective.  And
      there are bugs. I literally got  stuck because I jumped out of bounds looking
      for secrets and had no way back into the level, Not to mention the game is incredibly
      short.  Right now, it''s just not worth playing.



      Edit - Now that the game is fully out, I can safely say that I do NOT believe
      this game is worth playing.  Basically, nothing was fixed from it''s early access/BETA
      release to it''s full release. Poor combat, poor level design, poor sound design
      still plague the game. Sure an extra two levels were released but they aren''t
      any better than the rest of the game. Not worth your time or money.'
