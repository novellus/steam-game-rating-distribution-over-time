The enemy roster consists of a grand total of 3 enemies that get slight recolors every now and then. The combat feels button-mashy and seems to require a fair bit of grinding to get the most out of it. There's no way to replay stages either.\n\nWhen you enter the first stage, you're met with a \"tutorial\" in the form of text prompts at the bottom of the screen that fade away in 2 seconds, and you're expected to read all these in the middle of combat. Missed anything? Too bad, no way to get that information again, better go look it up, along with other mechanics that are never explained to you.\n\nThere's a story here, but... let's be honest, it doesn't really matter. The actual plot is minimal, and in typical anime fashion, characters take 20 dialogue boxes to say what could be relayed in a few words.\n\nOverall a mediocre game with little to recommend it, not even on sale.","timestamp_created":1609086268,"timestamp_updated":1609086268,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484848499298095703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpv7A0vYCcu7mvQI="}
