    review: 'I have to say that I''m not super into these sort of obtuse puzzle games,
      the ones where you have to try everything with everything to figure out what
      the game wants. It''s even worse when some options kill you (with no save feature
      to boot), so normally I''d just write a game with features like that off as
      bad and move on. But, if nothing else, this game has a fair bit of effort put
      into it, it''s not too long, and there are multiple solutions. This makes that
      parts I''m not into less unpleasant, though I still need to make note of them.


      The plot isn''t anything special, when you''re told that you have amnesia and
      are in a dangerous location, most players will know the twist already. But,
      since the dialog is sparse, it doesn''t get on my nerves too much, sometimes
      cliches are fun.


      Speaking of the writing, it''s nothing special, and not capitalizing "I" really
      bugs me, but that''s just a nitpick.


      Overall, I''d give it a 6/10, give it a look if you''re into escape room-esque
      puzzle games.'
