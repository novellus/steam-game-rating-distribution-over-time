    review: 'If you''ve seen my review of the game, you already know I''m starstruck
      by it. The music is no exception - quality lofi with 8bit undertones, and each
      track sets a particular mood for various scenes. It ties the entire thing up
      very nicely.


      It''s great music to chill and read to, and, last but not least, it''s amazingly
      varied and high-quality for an otome game (let alone a Western one). Sometimes
      the soundtracks of otome are comprised of free-for-alls that get recycled through
      various companies. Most of the time, whether or not they''re commercially shared,
      they''re just plain generic and forgettable. That a quality soundtrack like
      this was composed for a Western otome game is just pleasantly shocking.'
