    review: This game is worth a shot if you are into arena shooters and want a new
      twist to it. There is tons of customization options which (in my experience)
      takes 15-20 or so hours to unlock it all. The game (at its current state) has
      no Micro-Transactions. However, Keep in mind that the playerbase is lacking
      and you will most likely be spending all of your time with bots.
