Bottom line: if you're new to spriting (or even a veteran, but looking for an adorable, nostalgic, and simple-to-use UI), this program is worth every penny. The simplicity makes it significantly less daunting to start off with than a lot of other (often much more ridiculously expensive) programs, and while those other programs may offer some feature sets not available in Aseprite, spriters should have no issues creating fully-featured sprites, landscapes, and any other pixel-graphic items.\n\nI'm no pro at it, but this program alone has made the learning process so much better and accessible to me. I'm making really slow progress due to family and health issues, but I feel a sincere glow of pride each time I finish the animation cycle for another one of my sprites. I've even purchased additional copies of the software for two of my sons to play with as well, and am constantly amazed at what they've created with the program whenever the mood strikes them.\n\nAlso, worth noting that at the writing of this review, I've got \"24 hours\" of play time listed; my offline \"work\" PC, however, has an additional 50 hours on it as well.","timestamp_created":1610178246,"timestamp_updated":1610178246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw18aG8/YCeqrfwQI="}
