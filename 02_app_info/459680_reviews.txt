I liked the game quite a bit, though it's better suited to a mobile platform to pick up and play for a few matches.\n\nThe sound and graphics are a real treat, and do benefit from the PC platform. The difficulty is a bit high in my opinion, and difficulty settings would be appreciated.\n\nAll in all, a solid tactical game.","timestamp_created":1608375895,"timestamp_updated":1608375895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vZCrvfYCc460uwI="}
