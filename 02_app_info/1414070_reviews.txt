Much of 'those' stray puzzles are welcomed additions when compared to the variety it already has when focusing only on its more sokoban-like puzzles of pushing objects onto spots.\n\nBeing only 200 levels long, it's rather short when combined with its relative ease, albeit its difficulty does fluctuate. For me, it took only 22 hours to beat all of the levels... This ensures that the game can't possibly overstate its welcome, if such a thing was possible with its variety.\n\nThe game organises its variety further and keeps the game fresh with 10 chapters, 20 levels long per chapter, each focusing on different elements or sets of elements. The game is also divided into sets of 100 levels, consisting of the initial 10 levels of each chapter, and the last 10 levels of each chapter.\n\nOnly one game element seems particularly underutilised and not fully explored, but otherwise, the game uses all of its elements in a lot of different combinations, again being reminiscent of chip's challenge at times.\n\nWhether you find the game hard or easy, I think you'll find its solutions interesting and satisfying most of the time.","timestamp_created":1606641097,"timestamp_updated":1606641097,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553805768489837646","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4krPRifYCfs6ItQI="}
