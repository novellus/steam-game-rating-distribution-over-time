I always remembered it being really difficult and near impossible to manage. Well, I remembered correctly. I love the graphics, the humor, and the idea/concept of this game but I just can't win. I can't win even on the easiest mode. \nPersonally, the commuting and importing angels and demons is a pain. I can't get enough to STAY, even after adjusting the planet's beliefs and toying with the collages entry percentages. It wouldn't be so bad if every building had to have it's own efficiency between imported and local workers. I can fix it with the Micro Manager thing but for way too much money. It should be a convenience, not a hassle to use.\n\nWhile I really want to recommend this game, I can't. It's not even that it is dated, but more that there is TOO much to manage even in the beginning. Nothing gets easier or better and there is no reward for trying. \n\nIf you like true impossible odds, go ahead and get it. Otherwise, you'll get a laugh or three out of this game but that's about it.\n\nI think the game itself needs a lesson on how to be \"balanced.\"","timestamp_created":1598480125,"timestamp_updated":1598480125,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xOG1lvQCcbL7nQI="}
