    review: I really like this game, it is excellent. Is one of the only games I've
      played where watching the enemies move is as interesting as moving your slimes.
      The art style is excellent and the music is also really good. The menus are
      really well made, and everything is easy to use. Every move you make is impact,
      and the levels are challenging but fair. I really like the three round cap,
      as it means that you don't end up hanging back and hiding. It is a highly enjoyable
      game, I highly recommend getting this game, it is excellent.
