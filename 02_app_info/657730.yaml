    about_the_game: A terrible curse has spread to our fair city. A curse that if
      left unchecked, will threaten us all. The nights have grown long, and with it,
      hordes of evil creatures come with it. Werewolves, demons, skeletons, ghouls,
      and they all want just one thing. To feast on our flesh and take over our souls.<br><br>But
      we will not stand for this! We will band together and root out this evil. Together
      we will unmask whoever is behind this, and put a stop to this menace.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2>Wolflord
      is a multiplayer online intrigue game, where you will be matched with other
      players and put in small groups, where it is vital to your survival that you
      eliminate the evildoers among you. Or, if luck will have it and you draw an
      evil card yourself, work with your secret team to take control of the game.<br><br>Lies,
      deception, evaluation and careful speech is key components to the game of Wolflord.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Heritage</h2>Wolflord is a modern take on the classic Mafia/Werewolf
      game genre that have existed as party games since the 80s.<h2 class="bb_tag">Charity</h2>We

    review: Take Town of Salem, throw 30+ players in and give them one of 100s of
      roles, no game is ever the same and its well made, even my potato can run this
      game. There's only one problem and its that there's no player base for the game.
      If the game had more players it would be amazing.
