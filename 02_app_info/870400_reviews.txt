Side note, it was missing files when I purchased it, so the dev had to be contacted before it would even launch. Just not a good all-around experience.","timestamp_created":1589856694,"timestamp_updated":1589856694,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7/21lfICf4XeiAI="}
