The concept is one I hadn't seen before, and while there are quirks with it, it works well.  At first, I was put off by the small platforms and what seemed to be the overall method of solving the puzzles, but as I played more and learned how to use that methodology, I enjoyed it more.  In the end, I found it very enjoyable and definitely recommend it.\n\nAbout a week after I purchased this game, it transferred ownership to Walsh Technologies Corp, and the store page now says \"Walsh Technologies has recently acquired this game. Updates and a roadmap will be coming soon\".  I'm not sure what that means for the game, but when I played the game, the overall play time was roughly 1.5 to 2 hours (I'm not sure how many levels/tests there were because they aren't numbered).  My recorded time is much longer because I spent quite a while restarting the game, testing, taking notes, and creating a discussion thread while the game was still open.\n\nI would love to see this concept expanded upon and used in a larger world, especially combined with a variety of different puzzles.","timestamp_created":1569478986,"timestamp_updated":1569478986,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548717975616455078","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkZmPtu0Cfqny0gE="}
