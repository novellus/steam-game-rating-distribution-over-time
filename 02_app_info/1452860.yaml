      same time while dodging big flames. Orlando will be continuously raised by the
      ladder between the buildings and you must click anywhere on the screen to switch
      the building he is facing. Choose the windows with the victims and avoid the
      burning ones until the water is ready.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1452860/extras/title-water-to-save-the-day.png?t=1604606336"

      on the next update! I constantly update all of my games with players suggestions.
      Thanks for you detailed review!


      Edit: hi! I just included more options on the title screen, I have also included
      the tutorial, the pause menu, the record tracking. Besides that I have also
      included levels, more effects, day/night mode, time tracking, and much more!

    review: 'This game is not really fun. Is it supposed to be a parody? The game
      is almost identical to super mario bros. All u are doing is going up and saving
      people with the occasional person with water sometime being available. The main
      screen is only a play button. There is no tutorial or explanation for the game.
      There is no "Esc" button. There is no place where I can find about scores? How
      well did I do; can I beat my personnel score??? This game should not have been
      released for even these simple options.
