This DLC introduces goals that let you earn victory points (VPs) in new ways and potentially compete with p/c engines of other players. It also let's you switch strategies easier during an ongoing game. Each game will select 6 goals from a pool of goals. Take a look at the screenshots on the steam page above. You can see a column with symbols (column including the red 6+ symbol) between the played cards area and the draw pile & OK button section. These are filled up to 6 in total. Here are some examples of goals:\n\nBe the first to play 3 alien cards: 3 VP\nBe the first to discard cards by a full hand: 3 VP\nBe the first to play a development 6 card: 3VP\nBe the first player to own 5 VP chips: 3 VP\nBe the first to own every type of production world: 3VP\nBe the first to own a bonus for every action: 3VP\nHighest military count at the end of the game with at least 6 military: 5 VP\nMost production worlds at the end of the game: 5 VP\nMost development cards at the end of the game with at least 4 dev cards: 5 VP\n\nPlaying with goals is optional though, if you don't like it you can switch it off and play with the new cards.\n\nPros:\n+ I get the impression that the AI is better than the base game AI and it's very competent at making use of the new DLC features.\n+ Goals\n+ Goals can be switched off\n+ There is a little more reason to go for alien cards due to the alien goal\n+ New starting (home) worlds, New cards\n+ Military strategy is a bit more viable due to the military goal\n\nCons:\n- Most of the green cards are still worthless\n\nFinal verdict: Recommended but only when you have experience with the base game. The DLC is not suitable for first-time players.","timestamp_created":1606744131,"timestamp_updated":1609558565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560351729393005371","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iNTK4PYCcOHqtQI="}
