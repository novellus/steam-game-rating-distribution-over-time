    review: "Well, there is nothing much to describe and the game is as simple as\
      \ applying butter over bread with paper knife. You hit the same coloured butterfly\
      \ and make a combo and congratulations, you have already completed the game\
      \ because that's it and no further level progress . Just one playground and\
      \ try different permutations and combinations to score a combo and hear a ingrained\
      \ cute baby voice lauding the player with \"Awesome, Cool, Combo, Multi Combo,\
      \ Its funny that out of all the heavy and large games you have in your library\
      \ you chose this astray one only, You are so weird, etc. etc.\" voices. \n\n\
      So, the achievements might make you stick with the game for few extra minutes\
      \ of gameplay. But the chances are probably  no one would last long for more\
      \ than a 5 minute song . Good for a 3 year old daughter and for the parents\
      \ who want to introduce their kid into the world of gaming, this could be the\
      \ best start for any toddler or their first game indeed."
