      Survive against never-ending waves of enemies as you move from zone to zone,
      rapidly upgrading your capabilities through Psionics, Weapons and Perks. Keep
      your score multiplier high by killing enemies faster. Take a short break between
      waves to find loot, buy items at shops, or to activate defensive turrets. You
      will eventually die, but will you reach the top of the online scoreboard?<br><br><strong>ESCAPE</strong>:
      In this variation of Doomed mode, you can actually make it out alive! Battle
