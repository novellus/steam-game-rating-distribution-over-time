Said aircraft include:\n\n[i] Standard [/i]\n1. Bf/Me*-109-G4\n2. Fw-190-A5\n3. Bf/Me*-110-G2\n4. He-111-h16\n5. Yak-7\n6. P-39 (Lend-Lease)\n7. Il-2 Mod. 1943\n8. A-20b (Lend-Lease)\n\n[i] Premium [/i]\nHs-129b\nSpitfire Mk.Vb (Lend-Lease)\n\nAll of these aircraft are amazing in their own respects, and have their unique quirks and features that make them all the more special. I would recommend this expansion to anyone who is wanting to continue in this sim. It is a must have.\n\n(*I put down both Bf and Me titles because I was involved with a War of Words on Wings of Liberty server that regarded this very subject. It goes by both designations, guys.)","timestamp_created":1575129752,"timestamp_updated":1608961167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.573510289192199707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46eHjzvYCc/6T4AE="}
