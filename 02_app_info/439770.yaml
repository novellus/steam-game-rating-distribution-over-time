    review: 'I can''t recommend it. CYOA''s tend to fall into two sections, either
      stat-driven and more focused on statistically advancing your way to the top
      overtime as power-creep sets in, or stats which are easily raised as long as
      you don''t do anything too crazy, and you can probably get through just fine
      with middle of the road stats.



      This one falls extremely into the first camp, and doing anything which isn''t
      your focus, is rewarded with failure, and rending apart your character in later
      installments. Failure to follow what your character is good at, and attempting
      to read situations to know what stat is going to be used, is more important
      then actually reading the book because of the extreme difficulty later on.


      However, it is an interesting story, fun to read, and I went into this thinking
      that maybe people just didn''t really prioritize too much, and I decided to
      fully build my character in a select few skills, only to end up not even having
      enough at the third installment, which is frustrating to say the least, and
      resulted in me just putting it down out of not wanting to rush through three
      other books, get the optimal choices and secrets, just to complete the end.'
