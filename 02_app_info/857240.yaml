    about_the_game: In Summer Heights Correctional Facility, the government are using
      the prison to experiment on the inmates. As the prison population has been pushed
      to the brink the government have been pitting inmates against each other as
      apart of a psychological observation know as The Prison Experiment. With a ticket
      home and a pardon from the warden on the line, walking free has never cost so
      much!<br><br>The Prison experiment is a third person Battle Royale experience
      with a twist. You will be faced with a totally unique gaming experience designed
      to separate the strong from the weak.<br>This game is not just offering a fifty
      man free for all mode, we also offer different game modes for a truly immersive
      playing experience. We want players to get the full Battle Royal experience
      and more!<br><br><strong><u>Features -</u></strong><br><br><strong>CLASSIC BATTLE
      ROYALE</strong> - This is what players have come to expect from a Battle royale
      game. Fifty players enter the game but only one can claim the victory. Be sure
