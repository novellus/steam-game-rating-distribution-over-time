    review: "With curling cancelled, I was looking for a curling fix. Unfortunately,\
      \ this package didn't have what I was looking for.\n\n\n\nPros:\nThe ice surface\
      \ appeared pebbled and that's a nice attention to detail.\nIt looks like the\
      \ developer cares about making a fun product, and they deserve credit for their\
      \ efforts.\nThe control scheme is easy to learn and I can't complain too much\
      \ about the controls in general.\nCredit for a clever 2-sweeper control scheme.\n\
      \nCons:\nThe stones are thrown straight by default, which should be an impossible\
      \ thing to do. \nStone physics on collision are incredibly unrealistic in multiple\
      \ ways.\n4-stone ends leave little room for any strategy.\nGame length should\
      \ probably be customizable.\nHitting the wall did not remove stones from play.\
      \ I never tried hogging a rock, so I don't know what would happen.\n\nA good\
      \ effort, but this skews more 'arcade' than simulation. Someone playing curling\
      \ for the first time might enjoy it, though they'd probably have to look up\
      \ the rules outside of the game.\n\nI hope the developers will continue to improve\
      \ product, because potential is there."
