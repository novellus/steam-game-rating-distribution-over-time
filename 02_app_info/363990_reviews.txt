Cause at the end of the day that's what wins or loses you the game. Not that level 10 succubus or vampire. The 5390 sentinels which you stacked up with your assembly and avarice rituals. Payday comes along? Don't matter they're fodder anyway, just build more if they die or get unhappy.\n\nStill, fun little single player campaign - Fucked up the bot AI for skirmishes though. 4/10.","timestamp_created":1599360914,"timestamp_updated":1599360914,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpdrVsPQCfq6KoAI="}
