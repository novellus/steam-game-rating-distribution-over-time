    review: Disappointed to discover these tracks are very low bitrate, at only 180kbps
      MP3. I was hoping for minimum 320kbps MP3. This may sound petty, but the composition
      and performance on these tracks is great, and they deserve to be heard at their
      best. At the end of the day, this OST is less than half the price of a specialty
      coffee from a pretentious coffee chain, but I'm still feeling a bit let down
      by this purchase.
