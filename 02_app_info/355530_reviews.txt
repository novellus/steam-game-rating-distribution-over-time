To represent this, they have taken the concepts of discourse and dialogue and distilled them to an extreme abstract. This. Was. Brilliant.\n\nReading a lot of the negative reviews, it seems like not everyone 'got' it, but I assure you, this is one of the most accurate depictions of mincing words I've ever seen, and it could only be achieved by extreme abstraction. Obviously, an actual conversation is a touch more complex than this, but they've done an admirable job of capturing the tone of discourse without it having to apply to any *specific* discourse. Mad props to the designers for coming up with a game that basically describes how I interact with the world.","timestamp_created":1477443052,"timestamp_updated":1608928331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z8DmzfYCdMmEZA=="}
