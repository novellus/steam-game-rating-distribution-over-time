    review: 'I think Dr. Evil will be happy with this device.

      As my first play was with kbm, I felt like I needed the mouse to control the
      destination of shots... or perhaps be used for a special "orbital strike" kind
      of weapon. I''d much prefer this instead of only being able to point the turret
      with the arrow keys.

      If you do somehow set up multiplayer (co-op, points duel, or deathmatch, etc)
      you''re going to need moar wepons.

      Anyway, excellent job and worth the 99 cents.'
