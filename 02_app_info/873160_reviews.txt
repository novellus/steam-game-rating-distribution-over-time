There are no customization options at all - no mute, no non-fullscreen option, no settings of any kind. \n\nMost bewilderingly, there is no button to exit the game. I had to force a quit from outside the program. \n\nI am very disappointed and regret my purchase.","timestamp_created":1534804322,"timestamp_updated":1534804322,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540229201316833496","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7ezdrOUCc8D2qAE="}
