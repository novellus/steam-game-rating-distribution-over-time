    developer_response: I'm very happy to hear you've had fun playing wots and will
      work on a good narrative to go with the campaign, I always like to hear about
      people who have fun playing as at the end of the day, that is the greatest reward
      for a developer.

    review: "This game reminded me heavily of the old school days of Dynasty Warriors\
      \ (Or for those more well versed in the series Samurai Warriors)\n\nYou get\
      \ hoards of enemies to cut your way through and gates to stop them from spawning.\
      \ To this end I think the game accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. I\
      \ personally am uncomfortable with highly realistic VR games where you kill\
      \ other people as I find it sickening. Not in the \" I find killing people in\
      \ video games morally reprehensible\" way but more actually feeling sick as\
      \ my brain watches me stab someone. This does a good job of letting you hack\
      \ and slash in VR without feeling like a sadist as your blade gets stuck in\
      \ the flesh of your enemy that you do not even know why you want them dead.\
      \ \n\nI have so fare been able to find replayability by giving myself different\
      \ challenges and I look forward to future options allowing more such challenges.\n\
      \nI would say if you wanna play a game where you can fight for high scores with\
      \ your friends and you want to try it in early access. This one fits the bill.\
      \ If you want a hyper realistic and fully completed game try something outside\
      \ of early access. This game will likely never be a hyper realistic VR experience\
      \ and I consider this a good thing.\n\nI have a couple criticisms of this game\
      \ but it is in early access. So more a reaching out to the dev to look into.\
      \ \n1.) There is no story I would like this to change\n2.) The movement needs\
      \ some more options. It will be hard for players that get motion sick to play\
      \ the game. either with smooth motion or with the lunge motion. I personally\
      \ have some complaints with the player collision being dictated by the center\
      \ point (represented by the red wire frame ball) I like to see if I am going\
      \ to hit a wall based on where I am standing. But I also see that this is to\
      \ prevent players going through walls.\n\nAll in all I look forward to the further\
      \ development of this IP and will continue to follow it.  Thanks for bringing\
      \ me back to playing games in my buddies basement. Its been fun so far.\n"
