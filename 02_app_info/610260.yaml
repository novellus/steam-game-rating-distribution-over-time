    review: "So I got this on sale for $3.59 and honestly, there are better VR rollerocoaster\
      \ experiences out there (including Russian VR Coasters from the same developer!).\
      \  Also, the price is a bit steep for what's really being offered. So what is\
      \ being offered? \n\nFour rides (lasted me a total of 14 minutes to experience\
      \ all of them) of varying fun factors and lengths, each with low resolution/low\
      \ textures, each with no interactions, and each have the same ride feeling.\
      \ I guess that's what's missing most from the game, you don't ever really feel\
      \ like you are in a rollercoaster. In fact, I never felt the butterflies in\
      \ my stomach or the euphoria you would feel if you actually rode in a rollercoaster.\
      \ The rails as you are whizzing by also don't look very good (they blur or they\
      \ look very slow .. depending on where you look).\n\nThe scenery and rides from\
      \ best to worst (IMO) were 1) Mega Kinda Ka - nice outside park with rocks that\
      \ bring a nice surprise 2) LIberty - the statue of liberty needs to look better\
      \ though 3) City 4) Euthanasia - starts out looking very good, then a big disappointment,\
      \ poor graphics really bring immersion down here.  \n\nHowever, every single\
      \ VR scene and ride were better in Russian VR coasters.  This dev obviously\
      \ hates America.  I'm joking ... or maybe not.\n\nRating 4/10 should be a .99\
      \ cent game then I could tepidly recommend and overlook its flaws"
