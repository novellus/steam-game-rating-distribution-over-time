    review: 'I want to love this game, but it is completely unplayable until they
      make a way to move the table. Automatically to edge of play area, which for
      most people is a wall.


      UPDATE: They have fixed the table location issue. Still kind of a bummer you
      can''t adjust the table position, but now I am able to play. Not sure if this
      will be more difficult for those with smaller play areas, but it works for me!'
