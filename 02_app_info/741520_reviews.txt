Good story, good humor, great level design, quite a lot of content. The way the game handles difficulty is pretty clever too, there are some optional extra hard tasks on every level, and if you repeatedly fail at the main task a lot, the game gives very helpful tips sometimes.","timestamp_created":1609450669,"timestamp_updated":1609450669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vIiv3fYCePmbvwI="}
