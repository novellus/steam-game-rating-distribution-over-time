From the fun characters to the difficult fights, it's all very well made. Even the hardest stages are very forgiving and let you try over as much as you want with minimal penalties, and the achievements are rewarding and fun to grind. I strongly recommend the game.","timestamp_created":1609778353,"timestamp_updated":1609778353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4toqR5/YCc5q4wAI="}
