However this one like dang I don't know what to say, cause I really wanted to make these cool Christmas style dungeons here, and the water doesn't look as cool as they have it in screen shot 6 of 8.  Like I tried doing something similar to it, and even made the river area small like in the picture.  It doesn't look awesome like in the screenshots.  Also screenshot 3 of 8, I can't make the bottom of the water look all super cool white and blue style.   I mean I have to recommend it, because it's def still good, but I mean I don't know I can't get the water stages to look super cools like the way the screenshots have them.  Maybe I just suck I wouldn't mind admitting that, I don't know it for sure lol.  Maybe the developer can help us out on how to understand the tile sets more best.  Anyways thumbs up and thanks for the addition to the rpg maker mv assets.  Hope you bring your jungle assets also, cause I would like to buy that also.
