Music is nice, the art is great, the characters are interesting and it's incredible the interaction depth that you can have! \nI found myself in a hate-love relation with the discourse battles: knowing that you have only few seconds to defy statements or prove lies and give come backs, with fast paced music on the background putting you under pressure, it's a nightmare!! I almost lost the game once because of this ha ha! I hate it... and I love it!!\nThis game proves a challenge and I guess that's what I like the most about it, not to mention the dark humor. Nothing like trying to prove yourself against just everybody and come out as a winner with a few sarcastic lines in the middle!\n\nI definitely recommend it to the ones disposed to get their butt kicked a couple of times and those who like things a bit rough. It has everything!\nThere's little not to like about this game. Well done!! :D","timestamp_created":1568285488,"timestamp_updated":1568285488,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574459195137023926","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuK7Gku0CfO+L0gE="}
