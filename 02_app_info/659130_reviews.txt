In the Settings panel, select the Downloads tab and you'll find the \"Clear Download Cache\" button at the bottom. Then select \"OK\" to confirm and acknowledge that you'll need to login to Steam again.\nThis fixed the problem for me. Please notify me if this work and please delete a negative review. Possibly the error is due more to the Steam platform than to our game. In the future, please post a message via the Steam forums"}],"cursor":"AoJ4nKT99/UCdY7vrwI="}
