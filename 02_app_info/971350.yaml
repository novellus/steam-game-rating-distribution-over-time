    review: I liked it, it was entertaining, and also refreshing to see a VR movie
      with actual actors for once (good work by Michelle Rodriguez). I don't understand
      why people are complaining about the angles and editing. For me, this was positive
      and a lot better than all those boring fixed-angle/fixed-position films.  I
      just hope that they keep building better and better cameras the coming years
      (16K VR360) despite the small market for it, because the current hardware (cameras
      and headsets) clearly isn't ready for prime time.  I don't think Robert Rodriguez
      could have done it (much) better than this.  Obviously, the budget could't have
      been high for such a small audience, and with hardware that is extremely limited
      of what it can produce, even the best director and best actors in the world,
      would have a very hard time making something good.  I hope the future will bring
      more of these VR movies, I believe in it, but it simply needs to be in (much)
      higher quality.
