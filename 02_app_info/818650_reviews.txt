But i quite like puzzles and uncertain things, so not a big deal..\nGame freezes from time to time for couple of seconds - maybe my comp is slow ?\nAnd soon I will finish the game, and thats not good at all ;)","timestamp_created":1592770492,"timestamp_updated":1592770492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5p6h7PICfeGyjwI="}
