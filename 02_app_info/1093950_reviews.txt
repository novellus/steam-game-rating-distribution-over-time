Many cool new things that made me spend a lot of time ingame. I usually don't write reviews but as a tower defense fan and not finding enough reviews on this one, I had to say that it really brings some novelty on the genre (I had to re-think all my strategies learned in other TDs).\nI like how the enemy is fighting with me, they struggle to bring my towers down :D, very nice animations and there is something interesting and addictive with the AI that I can't pinpoint exactly. \nI can make my towers target any alien I want and that's a huge plus. Having total control over targets makes you realize that skill actually matters a lot. Big difference from one replay to the other.\nOne more plus for this tower defense is the ability to create ambushes using the military orders to your towers.","timestamp_created":1587646824,"timestamp_updated":1587646824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5P/H0/ECfrL1ggI="}
