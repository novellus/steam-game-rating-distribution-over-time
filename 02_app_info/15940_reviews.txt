It somehow lacks personality. I also really hated the big heads. They should've used cartoony sprites instead of this semi-realistic look. It would've looked better in every single way. But I do like the genre though, so I can't say it's a bad game. They're great games for small periods of time.\n\n[Rating: 65/100]","timestamp_created":1310669556,"timestamp_updated":1402231210,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535276710987091064","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgcjfvcYCeomMAw=="}
