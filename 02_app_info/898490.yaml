    review: I can't recommend this game as it is right now.  The game is interesting
      as a concept, but as another reviewer noted, the game has not been completely
      translated into English and so suddenly puzzle text appears in Polish (?).  The
      text at times is cut off of the cards and text size in the journal is incredibly
      small.  It is not clear what is to be done and so a lot of clicking is involved.  I
      don't mind that necessarily, but in the second game section, I thought I was
      going to a different room and I ended up leaving the second scenario unfinished
      and I could not go back without starting the entire game over since there is
      just one auto save.  All of the above made for an unenjoyable experience.
