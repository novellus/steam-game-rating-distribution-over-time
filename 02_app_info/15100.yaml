      \ Montreal that redefines the action genre. While other games claim to be next-gen\
      \ with impressive graphics and physics, Assassin's Creed merges technology,\

      \ become a vulnerable, yet powerful, agent of change.<br>\t\t\t\t\tThe setting\
      \ is 1191 AD. The Third Crusade is tearing the Holy Land apart. You, Altair,\
      \ intend to stop the hostilities by suppressing both sides of the conflict.<br>\t\
      \t\t\t\tYou are an Assassin, a warrior shrouded in secrecy and feared for your\
      \ ruthlessness. Your actions can throw your immediate environment into chaos,\
