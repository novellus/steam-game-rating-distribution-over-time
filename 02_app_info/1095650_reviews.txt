Don't buy this game... I do recommend it for @Tryyton who likes derpy games for his channel at twitch.tv/tryyton but for me, I just don't have the patience for a game of this caliber.\n\nLike it has good intentions, with it's hunger/thirst/stamina/fatique, crafting,  etc... I found fruit, was hungry, ate it, didn't change the values however, still hungry. And you have to press R for basic crafting and B for advanced crafting... \n\nI recued this lady from a hut for example: https://clips.twitch.tv/HappyGracefulMeatloafAliens\n\nMy character feels way too small, running could be faster and jumping should be higher. Maybe an option too, to turn of the footsteps sounds? https://clips.twitch.tv/GrotesqueGrossCheeseTBTacoRight\n\nI wasn't hungry, there was no monster behind me, my health was 100% and suddenly this happens: https://clips.twitch.tv/CarelessKitschyBurritoDAESuppy Just random, just like that. No explanations... \n\nThe idea might be good, but the execution of making a game from it is bad. Maybe another DEV sees this game and thinks, let's collaberate and make a decent game from this. I just do not recommend this game. \n\nHowever, I do like the idea behind it, the setting of a prehistorical world, the goal of the game. But for recommendation, no points. Sorry.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1586289300,"timestamp_updated":1586289300,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.437894314527511597","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJworqNq/ECdoj+/gE="}
