It's ugly. My eyes sore after just a few minutes, and it even gave me a nausea.\n\nBy unplayable I mean it's truly uplayable. The whole point of making 'retro' game is not to make it so barebones that it doesn't even have simple configuration options, even Wolfenstein3D has them. This game has awful controls.","timestamp_created":1599485379,"timestamp_updated":1599485379,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m8CwtPQCfPivoAI="}
