So you have to turn the flashlight back on every few seconds (literally) throughout the entire game. \nSecondly, while the save feature works, it forces you to sit through the opening scene every single time you load, AND you lose your flashlight when it loads. So the save function is useless since you absolutely cannot see or make progress without the flashlight, which means you have to restart the entire game from the beginning each time you die so you can get the flashlight.","timestamp_created":1583706848,"timestamp_updated":1583706848,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsJeS3vACcfv39gE="}
