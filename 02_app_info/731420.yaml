      /><br>Growing up, I spent most of my summers indoors playing video games, trying
      to beat that one final level, trying to get just a bit better and beat my own
      high score. Roguebreaker is my love letter to that time of my life, when you
      could just lose yourself in a colorful world for a little bit. Beat a level,
      unlock a new upgrade, and repeat. <strong>It's a small, simple game designed
      to be played in a short sitting, just long enough to zone out and have a good
      time for a few minutes and relax</strong>.  I hope you're able to feel a little
      bit of that as you play. If not, I'd be happy to hear why and what I could do
      to make it that much better for you.<br><br>Thanks so much for giving it a shot,<br><i>Josh

    short_description: A roguelike twist on Breakout, just like you remember with
      a thick coat of 80s slathered on top. It's fast, it's juicy, it's vapourwave,
      it's small, it's Roguebreaker! How many bricks will you break in this arcade
      game?

    developer_response: "edit: Thanks to mixer.com/Janoria, we were able to troubleshoot\
      \ the mouse issue and there's now a patch for this issue live now!\n\nGlad you\
      \ liked the game!\n\nThe mouse pointer should be locked to the game board at\
      \ all times, so I'll look into why it's not happening for you.\n\nI've got a\
      \ missile upgrade in the works but having a prestige mode sounds like a really\
      \ fun addition because once you're at the end of a run it could be wild to restart\
      \ again with everything you've got. \n\nThanks for the suggestion!"

    review: "Got this game because it was cheap and looked fun. Beat it in about 15\
      \ mins. Still had fun so I am going back for more. Got it for 3.50 and it is\
      \ totally worth it.\n\nThe biggest drawback I've run into is the mouse pointer\
      \ isn't locked into the window on fullscreen. So sometimes when you are playing\
      \ you may not realize your pointer is outside the window and your paddles stop\
      \ moving. \n\nOther things I would like to see: More in level power-ups (such\
      \ as guns on the end of a paddle that lets me shoot at bricks), more levels,\
      \ and the ability to keep going after 10 levels. I do understand that this game\
      \ is $4 and it is worth it for that price already so anything after the current\
      \ iteration would just be a plus.\n\nIn short: Get this game - it is fun, cheap,\
      \ and a great way to lose 15 mins playing a game.\n\nEdit: I've come back and\
      \ played some more after a year or so, and the mouse lock problem I was having\
      \ has been fixed. I SHOULD have pointed out in my original that my monitor set\
      \ up is one above the other, which could have been the issue. I still stand\
      \ by what I said prior: Get this game, it's cheap, fun, and even if you only\
      \ play for 1 hour before deciding you're done you'd still get your money's worth."
