    review: 'Just a pretty package. Not a full game. Not polished Not worth the money.
      Would look out for this company since it looks like a pattern of theirs.


      I would love for there to be a good game on this theme but I get the impression
      that this company is making it a practice to ship barely half of a game in a
      pretty packaging. For what little has been modeled, it looks great, but there
      is no depth to the game. I like that they didn''t go with fixed recipes (that
      would be pointless to play even) but with the manipulations available, you arguably
      remove the most fun parts of what should be an alchemy simulations - experimentation
      and the interaction between reagents. Now you can easily figure out the best
      recipe for each potion and rince&repeat; update parts as new tools become available.
      The choice of reagents etc can make for a good tutorial but also means there
      isn''t much to discover. There are also some odd decisions that just make the
      gameplay less interesting and directly clash with each other - such as the knife
      sharpening and the highly restricted storage; and annoying seeming ''bugs'',
      such as dried items disappearing over night and the cleaner getting stuck. Missing
      incredibly basic settings such as mouse sensitivity. Already seen all of the
      relevant challenges of the game.


      Would have liked to see more thought to the gameplay and the mechanics (I think
      what I do on my own is more fun frankly) and for it to have been developed into
      a proper game. With the current content, not worth the price, and also don''t
      think these practices should be encouraged.


      The Chemist is probably a better game to try.'
