    about_the_game: "In 1525 Durer invented his drawing machine.  It is a way to mechanically\
      \ produce a picture.  Drawing Machine is an implementation of this technique\
      \ on a desktop that helps you draw a picture.  This app will help you learn\
      \ to draw.  As your skill improves you can use the app less and less as you\
      \ develop the proper mental repertoire for drawing pictures.  This app is &quot;Divide\
      \ and Conquer&quot; as it can be applied to drawing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDurer's\
      \ drawing machine works by dividing the picture into many smaller contiguously-connected\
      \ pictures.  Instead of drawing one large picture all at once you draw each\
      \ of many small pictures, one after another.  You can see how each smaller picture\
      \ is connected to the other small pictures.  The original picture is cut up\
      \ into these smaller pieces by you specifying the number of squares you want.\
      \  If you specify 10 squares then the original picture is sectioned into a 10\
      \ by 10 mesh of smaller pictures for a total of 100 small connected pictures.\
      \  Overall, the technique is very simple and very effective.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThis app is useful whenever someone who is not an artist needs to draw a picture.\
      \  If you need to draw a picture to be used on computer then you can use this\
      \ app to draw whatever picture you need.  This is true even if you are a bad\
      \ artist.  You can take a picture with your cell phone and use that image in\
      \ the Drawing Machine to create your very own personalized version of your photo.\
      \  You can look up any picture online and use the Drawing Machine to create\
      \ the picture you would draw if you really were a good artist.  Therefore, this\
      \ app can be used for design and illustration, for web page design, for animation\
      \ and modeling, or for any process which requires pictures or images.  You can\
      \ use the app to become a better artist or to add your personal artistic graphic\
      \ touch to your game.  Many of us are not good artists but must produce pictures\
      \ or images for our aspiring games.  We can't afford to hire professional artists\
      \ to create our pictures.  You can plug this app into the gap in your skills\
      \ that exists if you aren't an artist.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you wish you can\
      \ use the app only to locate and place certain problematic points on your target\
      \ image.  Alternatively, you use the app only for some of the picture but not\
      \ all of the picture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis app extends Durer's drawing machine\
      \ by providing two additional helpful features.  The &quot;crosshairs&quot;\
      \ feature allows you to create within the grid pinpoint accurate crosshairs\
      \ on points of interest.  You can use the crosshairs to reduce the number of\
      \ squares you have to deal with thus making it easier to use the technique.\
      \  These crosshairs allow you to be exactly correct when you place critical\
      \ points.  The &quot;perspectives&quot; feature helps you plot various types\
      \ of perspectives onto your targeted image (i.e. 1 point, 2 point, or 3 point\
      \ perspectives with their various vanishing points).  These two features improve\
      \ the basic functionality of Durer's drawing machine."
