      [b]stonewall penitentiary[/b] is a 1st-person point & click murder mystery.
      you wake up naked and tied up in a prison cell after somebody brought you and
      a few others there to confess your sins, and they will probably resort to more
      convincing methods than saying ''please''. once you and the girl next door get
      out of your cells, you''re invited to meet some new friends in the prison cafeteria,
      because the villain is one of those playful ones, like jigsaw from the [b]saw[/b]
      movies.


      6 people who all killed somebody, whether they acknowledge it or not, 6 hours
      to find a way out, but after each hour somebody will die. luckily, [b]it''s
      not a timed game[/b], and after a 7th person shows up, it''s clear that one
      of them is the captor. this is mentioned on the store page, not much of a spoiler,
      and there''s clearly more to the story, to be found out at your convenience.


      simple point & click controls with optional hotkeys, left click on an item to
      look at it or take it, but [b]no hotspot indicator and right click doesn''t
      zoom out of a close-up[/b]. besides the inventory there''s a map, shows all
      possible exits for the rooms, but no fast travel and only the current area is
      visible, can''t switch to others. the character window shows your current goals
      and score, like in the good old days, and journal entries scattered all around
      fill story gaps. companions will occasionally follow your around, commenting
      on stuff and [b]some dialog choices affect the story[/b], handily marked before
      making a decision. there aren''t many of them and they didn''t seem to do much,
      except near the end.


      windowed mode available, separate volume settings (low/medium/high only, not
      the best) and text size settings, which is always nice, should be a more common
      feature. since it''s a very dark game, brightness settings would''ve been nice,
      but there''s in-game representation of achievements and a tutorial to familiarize
      yourself with the interface.


      [b]manual saving only before quitting[/b] (no prompts or confirmation, straight
      back to desktop, very elegant), a single slot per game, but [b]progress is logged
      continuously[/b]. still, no proper manual saving anytime over multiple slots
      is not good game design, especially coupled with emptying the inventory after
      certain sections even though some of the items could''ve been used later as
      well, like in an instance that locked me out of an entire room unnecessarily.


      [b]there are quick-time events[/b], have to click at the right time for a certain
      action to succeed, but it isn''t too bad. what''s horrible is [b]the captor
      occasionally showing up, forcing you to do something quickly[/b]. I hate it
      when they add things like this to a point & click clearly made for a different
      kind of audience. [b]no progress is lost if you die[/b], you can keep trying,
      it''s just incredibly annoying. and of course, there''s a maze, but it''s very
      binary and over fast.


      the presentation is like a comic book, but somehow weirder, still fine, and
      while it''s fully voiced, [b]I wasn''t a fan of the main guy''s voice and the
      performance of some of the others[/b]. beating the game unlocks a codex with
      character infos and stuff, it''s online-only, not part of the game, but covers
      all the developer''s games, as they''re part of the same universe. and getting
      all the achievements reveals a bonus post-ending scene in the main menu, but
      I obviously didn''t bother with that, just looked at the relevant files in the
      game''s folder.


      it was a really enjoyable adventure despite the few issues I had, [b]took about
      7 hours and it''s definitely recommended[/b].'
