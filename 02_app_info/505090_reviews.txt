I feel like this is the game you play when you are pretty much out of games.  The game never glitched on me, it's pretty, the voice acting is good, and the translation is okay.  Story wise, not too much is going on, and there is a disunity to other routes that I don't care for (aka personality shifts of MC and family relation changes), but this is also probably why the game has you chose the guy after the into rather than have a main route with choices that lead to the different routes.","timestamp_created":1607140795,"timestamp_updated":1607140795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p8zDmPYCe5C0twI="}
