The games are super repetitive and all around not interesting. The plot twists at the end of all three games are really dumb and take me out of the immersion. Also the voice acting, the horrible voice acting, there is no emotion in any voices in these games. I beat these games only because i remember them from when i was younger and because i like beating games, but it was NOT worth it. I want my 20 hours on this entire series back","timestamp_created":1601618491,"timestamp_updated":1601618491,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ459b58/QCd6arpQI="}
