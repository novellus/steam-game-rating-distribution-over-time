    review: 'Funny games, love the opportunity to play  and discover secondary missions
      during the story gameplay. Love the possibility to customize your interface
      after completing the missions. The game has "nonsense" details that make me
      laugh a lot.... I suggest this game you if you are looking for a relaxing, amazing
      and funny game!

      i''m very courious to see the next releases!!!'
