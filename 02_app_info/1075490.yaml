      per second, 3 layers per frame. Over 250 animations and 20 minutes of cinematics.

      a small indie team of four.<h2 class="bb_tag">Single player mode with dual character

      courage with two playable characters drawn together through an inseparable bond.<h2

      a wide variety of puzzles, presented in gorgeous hand-drawn environments. Puzzles
      work standalone, requiring no 'hidden items' or player backtracking.<h2 class="bb_tag">LESS
      reading, MORE cinematics</h2>We replaced a dialogue system with a series of
      beautifully hand-animated cinematics telling a mysterious story.<h2 class="bb_tag">Engaging
      Original Soundtrack</h2>Our composer created an original soundtrack, designed
      to immerse the player in the emotional highs and lows of the story, kindling
      goose-bumps along the journey.

    reviews: "\u201CChiaroscuro is one of my favourite words, so what luck that upcoming\
      \ point and click adventure game Luna The Shadow Dust has such a focus on light\
      \ and shadows, giving me a tangential excuse to use it.\u201D<br><a href=\"\

      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a><br><br>\u201C\
      LUNA feels wonderfully dream-like, and I love the Ghibli-inspired artwork. It\u2019\
      s a stunning game. The puzzles are fun and clever, too, and the orchestral music\
      \ is simply wonderful.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://amostagreeablepastime.com/2019/04/24/theres-a-demo-available-for-the-lovely-looking-luna-the-shadow-dust/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >A Most Agreeable Pastime</a><br><br>\u201C\
      There are few games as engrossing as well-made point &amp;click puzzle adventures\u2014\
      nothing catches my eye quite like the intersection of intellectual challenge\
      \ and stellar artwork.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://cliqist.com/2016/04/22/lantern-studio-team-behind-luna-shadow-dust/\"\
