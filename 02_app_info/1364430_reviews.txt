Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a lot of roguelite/likes and love metroidvanias, but sometimes you just want a burger, not a six course meal. The game is still challenging; you'll probably die at least a few times even if you're a bullet-hell junky (which this game also is not).\n\nThe one minor critique I have is that the upgrade/metroid elements are a little on the shallow end. I'm literally complaining about the \"lite\" part that is clearly reflected in the trailer, my review, and price point, so take that with a grain of salt. I really just wanted \"more.\"\n\nAdditionally, one of the devs responded to my forum post, then reached out to me directly to help me out with an issue I was having. That issue being a patch sadly reset my progress. He was going to help me recover it, but I informed him that there was no need, because I already started over and played through it again. That says a lot about the game's fun factor as well as the people that created it.\n\nThe price point is perfect; maybe arguably a little low. Just pick it up, crack a beer, and enjoy. It's worth it.","timestamp_created":1598298160,"timestamp_updated":1598298305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589390993118286133","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4npaAkfQCdcXFnQI="}
