I'm just over 5 hours in, but I'm already loving it as It's a clever blend of RTS and City/Empire Building where you can join in on the battlefield shenanigans.  The screenshots (while really good) don't do the game justice.  You will be running around a map taking over camps to grow into a force to be reckoned with. The game will even have bosses you can challenge before you get to your opponent (like a MOBA). There is so much to look forward too and I love the presentation, the music, and best of all...  the potential. If you like city building, PVP, and having your own Tavern.. you need... no ... you \"deserve\" this game.  This is my fist real steam review, so i am kinda of at a loss for words, but check out my video to get my impressions and see why we should keep an eye on this game.\nhttps://youtu.be/6T-iocFfiGY\n\nIf you want something new to play.. I  Can't recommend it enough.  7/10 \n\nStill love this game!  Got some friends to play, and they love it also.. update coming soon.. and I AM READY to review it when it come out.","timestamp_created":1589590614,"timestamp_updated":1606337918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60120844841003418","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1589627766,"developer_response":"Hey Radikus, thanks for your review :) \nSome bugs are already fixed as you can see in our recent patch note (key binding for example). \n\nWe love to see that you are enjoying the game!
