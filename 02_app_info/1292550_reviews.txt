This game has some serious potential that I can easily seeing making it big as long as some things are fixed. But for a newly released 3d indie game I would give it at least 7/10 stars yet still an all in all great game that I'm sure will get better with time!","timestamp_created":1589769294,"timestamp_updated":1589769294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwi8rokvICfMfCiAI="}
