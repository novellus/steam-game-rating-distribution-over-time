    review: "King of the Streets is relatively simple 2D fighter that has tons of\
      \ potential, looks nice, and needs an additional year of beta-testing and tweaks.\n\
      \nI want you to know that even though this is a 'do not recommend' and a large\
      \ part of the review is negative, I actively want to see more work from the\
      \ developer. The reasons I got this game are (almost) all reasons worth getting\
      \ if you share them: aesthetically speaking, this is a game about a sorely under-represented,\
      \ and oftentimes, misrepresented culture and people. 3D models may not be everyone's\
      \ cup of tea but I genuinely love the way this game looks, especially the backgrounds\
      \ and the old school CRT filter. This game also has a great OST that's perfect\
      \ for a fighting game. Conceptually, there's some genuinely good ideas that,\
      \ with fine tuning, would make an easy and fun little fighting game for anyone\
      \ to get into.\n\nSo, that's the good. I like the way it looks, and I love what\
      \ it is, conceptually.\n\nThe other reason I got this game is that I love supporting\
      \ indie fighting game devs. It's a tough genre to design for. Unfortunately,\
      \ KotS is lacking in all the areas that matter for gameplay.\n\nJust a quick\
      \ list of simple cons:\n-There is no support for arcade sticks, or at least\
      \ not a TES+ which I know a lot of people have and use for fighting games. \n\
      - Combo counter is broken and will pretty much tell you everything is a combo\
      \ (eg. Sweeny f.HK into itself over and over again is counted as a combo. It\
      \ is not, it is a very slow jumping overhead.)\n-There really isn't enough hit\
      \ stun to make most things a combo, even though this game has a cancel system\
      \ that I rather like (rapid fire lights to make a light>medium chain, and heavies\
      \ have thier own dedicated button, so in /theory/ characters should be able\
      \ to do LMH>Whatever. But... they can't. Because there's not enough hitstun)\n\
      -Command Grabs can circumnavigate this problem /sort of/, but most characters\
      \ don't have them. B-PAC is a great example of demonstrating this, because he\
      \ can do 2LK5LK>Command Grab, and since there's not enough hit stun off of the\
      \ 5LK cancel on hit, he just gets the command grab for free. Same for block\
      \ stun, really. B-PAC rocks.\n+ (I'm gonna sneak a positive in here, because\
      \ B-PAC also has a OTG grab AND a crouch grab shining wizard, and i genuinely\
      \ feel like his stuff looks cool as hell. He's a great example of what this\
      \ game COULD be if the game were mechanically tightened up) \n-In general I'm\
      \ not a fan of whiff canceling in 2D games, but I could accept it in this if\
      \ it were implemented properly. I rarely see any game implement properly, though,\
      \ and this is another one.\n-/+? There's glimpses of quality of life that i\
      \ really appreciate\u2014like the fact that training mode shows hitboxs, for\
      \ example. It's really shocking, if I'm being honest, to see such a player friendly\
      \ polish in this random part of a game otherwise missing them.\n- Crouching\
      \ hitboxs are QUITE short, and end up making many special moves and normals\
      \ whiff. Since overheads also don't have enough hitstun to lead to combos, and\
      \ the damage is quite low on individual pokes, there isn't... a ton of reason\
      \ not to crouch the majority of the time.\n\nThere's more, but I think you get\
      \ the gist. I have a feeling $20 is way too steep for most people given the\
      \ problems outlined above (compare this to, say, the polish of Punch Planet,\
      \ which is still in Early Access, made only by three people, and still quite\
      \ complete when compared to KotS) but I also hope people continue to support\
      \ the developer (particularly in feedback!) because I want to see this game's\
      \ style, and the mechanically parts of it that work well, developed further.\n\
      \nIn short, I bet Field Magic's next game, or next big update, will be great.\
      \ Or, at least, I think they /can be./"
