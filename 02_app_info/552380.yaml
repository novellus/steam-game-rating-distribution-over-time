    review: I'm not sure why it isn't compatible with Oculus. I think it was listed
      as compatible back when I purchased it. I got in the game normally, and couldn't
      get past the main menu; for some reason the buttons just don't work. I'd be
      angrier if I didn't know the struggle of testing many different expensive platforms
      for such an inexpensive & apparently simple game. I will definitely update this
      review if I'm made aware the Oculus situation changes.
