In other words, a game made on a ridiculous premise and exploring gameplay based around the concept. In the case of Roundabout, take a limo that can only do donuts and try to get from point A to point B as fast as possible without dying. \n\nGameplay wise, I very much enjoy it. You can replay any mission an infinite amount of times with whatever abilities you unlock later in the game. Every mission has objectives that cannot realistically be done in one playthrough of the mission. Thankfully you can do a run through focused on completing only one task on the checklist. For example, collecting all of the collectible star coins in the mission. The game remembers which collectibles you had already collected through your sunsequent playthroughs so you can focus on only collecting the coins you have missing. The game has both friends list and global ranking systems with friends list being used for all activities and global only being used on challenges (which are repeatable with no real point other than to flex among your friends and the player base). \n\nThere are however some issues with the game. If your limo dies and the previous checkpoint was on top of a building, you will die again as the limo gets respawned inside the building rather than on top. Further complicating things is that there is no way for players to know how much money they have while driving unless they drive over a purchasable property or collect a hidden money stash. The game also does not tell you how many star coins you have left to find when doing another runthrough of a mission only getting an update when you run over a new star coin. Another bug I found was that sometimes when you respawn your car starts off in a damaged state (you can take damage 4 times before dying on a fifth hit) which ruins any flawless or time trial attempts.\n\nI give the game an 8/10. It is a corny gem that does a lot of things right for completionists, though some bugs and oversights do make 100% the game frustrating.","timestamp_created":1609726801,"timestamp_updated":1609726801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554140150547027588","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xrbM5fYCfIiiwAI="}
