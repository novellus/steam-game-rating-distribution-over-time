      \ and a common goal to make the lands of Rodia safe for its inhabitants. Together,\
      \ the two kingdoms have grown to become the most powerful in the world. But\
      \ as we all know, power can corrupt even the most virtuous of souls.<br><br>As\
      \ the ruler of Siralim, you just received word that King Lucius of Nex has obtained\
      \ the Ultimate Nether Orb - a powerful relic that can be used to control the\
      \ gods themselves. Worse yet, Lucius intends to manipulate the gods to aid him\
      \ in conquering Siralim. You are left with no choice but to wage war on Nex\

      \ /><br><br>In Siralim Ultimate, you\u2019ll encounter over 1300 different creatures.\
      \ Each creature has a unique stat spread, as well as its own, unique trait.\
      \ And don't worry - none of these creatures are re-skins or re-colors!<br><br>A\
      \ trait is a passive effect that affects that creature\u2019s battle capabilities.\
      \ For example, the Firewound Angel\u2019s \u201CPyre\u201D trait greatly increases\
      \ the amount of damage it deals with basic attacks, and its attacks also afflict\
      \ the target with the \u201CBurning\u201D debuff which causes damage over time.<br><br>Most\

      \ /><br><br>At the start of the game, players can choose from one of 30 different\
      \ specializations for their character. Each specialization offers a unique list\
      \ of unlockable perks that change the way your creatures fight in battle.<br><br>Here\
      \ is a list of just a few of the specializations in the game, along with a brief\
      \ description of how they work:<br><br>Animator - As an Animator, you will always\
      \ have a unique creature in your party called Animatus. Your entire battle strategy\
      \ will likely focus on this creature. You can empower your Animatus, and even\
      \ use your other creatures to make it stronger in combat.<br><br>Cabalist -\
      \ As a Cabalist, you'll enable your creatures to cast spells that they normally\
      \ wouldn't have access to. While other people's creatures might run out of Spell\
      \ Gem Charges, you'll be able to keep your creatures well-stocked with fresh\
      \ Spell Gems at the start of every battle.<br><br>Cleric - As a Cleric, you'll\
      \ specialize in healing abilities, as well as buffing, resurrection, stat-boosting\
      \ effects, and providing your creatures with protective barriers. Your creatures\
      \ will be extremely difficult to kill.<br><br>Defiler - As a Defiler, you'll\
      \ specialize in debuffs and stat-reducing effects. Enemies will be so weak that\
      \ your party will be able to easily pick them off, even if they were originally\
      \ much more powerful than your creatures.<br><br>Druid - As a Druid, you'll\
      \ probably only want to have one (or two, later on) creatures in your party.\
      \ Your creatures will gain massive benefits for being part of a smaller party.<br><br>Evoker\
      \ - As an Evoker, you'll empower your creatures' spellcasting capabilities.\
      \ Your creatures will be able to cast the same spell multiple times in one turn,\
      \ and these spells will be much stronger than if they had cast them without\
      \ your guidance.<br><br>Hell Knight - As a Hell Knight, you'll favor creatures\
      \ that specialize in attacking. Hell Knights empower their creatures' attacks\
      \ with chaotic magic. Hell Knights are surprisingly adept at spellcasting in\
      \ a pinch, as well.<br><br>Inquisitor - As an Inquisitor, you'll have a solution\
      \ at your disposal for every problem you encounter. In addition, Inquisitors\
      \ are able to use healing effects for offensive purposes - for example, when\
      \ your creatures heal enemies, they instead cause damage to them.<br><br>Monk\
      \ - As a Monk, you'll boost your creatures' chance to Dodge attacks and spells.\
      \ When your creatures Dodge, they'll unleash a devastating counter-attack on\
      \ the enemy.<br><br>Necromancer - As a Necromancer, you'll summon minions to\
      \ aid your creatures in battle. These minions can do all kinds of things to\
      \ support your creatures - they can cause damage, boost your creatures' stats,\
      \ debuff enemies, and much more.<br><br>Paladin - As a Paladin, your creatures\
      \ will be able to endure even the most powerful of attacks. Each time your creatures\
      \ take damage, they'll also damage their enemies.<br><br>Reaver - As a Reaver,\
      \ your creatures will gain massive benefits in combat as battles continue to\
      \ drag on. If your creatures manage to survive for just a few extra turns, they'll\
      \ be able to devastate your enemies.<br><br>Sorcerer - As a Sorcerer, you'll\
      \ support your creatures by debilitating their enemies from afar. Generally,\
      \ your enemies won't be able to act for the first few turns in battle as long\
      \ as you're around.<br><br>Tribalist - As a Tribalist, you'll want to assemble\
      \ a party of creatures that belong to the same race. This will provide them\
      \ with significant benefits that are exacerbated by their racial synergies with\
      \ each other.<br><br>Trickster - As a Trickster, you'll heavily inconvenience\
      \ your enemies by preventing them from taking action. You'll also gain the ability\
      \ to manipulate the element of luck - for example, if a positive effect has\
      \ a chance to activate but fails to do so, you can try again.<br><br>Eventually,\
      \ you can unlock all of these specializations on the same save file and quickly\
      \ swap to them whenever you want.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_08.png?t=1606657638\"\
      \ /><br><br>Each of your creatures can equip an Artifact. Artifacts provide\
      \ your creatures with various bonuses, including stat boosts, on-damage effects/procs,\
      \ traits, and even the ability to automatically cast spells when certain conditions\
      \ are met.<br><br>In order to obtain an Artifact, you must first Forge one at\
      \ the Blacksmith. After that, you can Socket your Artifacts with crafting materials\
      \ to add new properties to them. There are over 1000 crafting materials to be\
      \ found, and they all provide different properties. You can Upgrade your Artifacts\
      \ to unlock new socket slots, and even Brand your Artifacts to give them a custom\
      \ name.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_09.png?t=1606657638\"\
      \ /><br><br>Your creatures can equip Spell Gems which allow them to cast the\
      \ spell contained within the gem. There are more than 600 different spells for\
      \ players to find.<br><br>In order to obtain Spell Gems, you must first find\
      \ an Inscription that acts as a recipe to teach you how to Craft the Spell Gem.\
      \ You can Upgrade your Spell Gems to unlock Enchantment slots, and then you\
      \ can use these slots to add properties that affect the way the spell works.<br><br>For\
      \ example, you can add a modifier to a Spell Gem that allows it to deal damage\
      \ to an additional enemy. Another interesting property is called \u201CMagnetic\u201D\
      , which causes the spell to be more powerful for each creature in your party\
      \ that has that same spell equipped.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_10.png?t=1606657638\"\
      \ /><br><br>Unlike other games, Siralim Ultimate allows you to decide when you\u2019\
      ve finished it. For that reason, we\u2019ve packed the game with a ridiculous\
      \ amount of content to explore, items to collect, achievements to earn, and\
      \ so much more. Many players have enjoyed the previous Siralim games for thousands\
      \ of hours (that's not an exaggeration) and Siralim Ultimate is going to be\
      \ even larger in scale. There will always be something new for you to collect,\
      \ no matter how long you\u2019ve been playing!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_11.png?t=1606657638\"\
      \ /><br><br>Each of the 30 realms in Siralim Ultimate is ruled by a different\
      \ god. Players can earn Favor with these gods to increase their Favor Rank.\
      \ As your Favor Rank with each god increases, you\u2019ll be able to earn new\
      \ items, creatures, decorations, and much more.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_12.png?t=1606657638\"\
      \ /><br><br>Almost every gameplay system in Siralim Ultimate is meant to last\
      \ players forever - or at least for a very, very long time. For example, your\
      \ creatures do not have a level cap, so you can continue to level them up and\
      \ make them stronger indefinitely. Similarly, enemies can scale infinitely as\
      \ well.<br><br>Post-story content is filled to the brim with countless activities\
      \ for you to partake in to make your creatures more powerful. Here are a few\
      \ examples:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Take on randomly generated side quests\
      \ to obtain unique creatures and items.<br></li><li>Draft a team of creatures\
      \ in the arena and see how many battles you can last before your final creature\
      \ falls.<br></li><li>Battle against the gods themselves! These super boss-style\
      \ fights are among the most challenging in the game\u2026 but also the most\
      \ rewarding.<br></li><li>Unlock the relics of the gods and upgrade them indefinitely\
      \ to unleash devastating powers upon your foes.<br></li><li>Encounter Rodian\
      \ Creature Masters in Realms. Defeat them to earn Mastery, items, achievements,\
      \ and much more!<br></li><li>Work with five different guilds to take on powerful\
      \ World Bosses.<br></li><li>Collect skins and accessories for your creatures\
      \ to customize their appearance.<br></li><li>Collect cards to unlock permanent\
      \ bonuses for all your creatures. There's a card for every creature in the game!<br></li><li>Collect\
      \ Nether Stones, which are Diablo-inspired, randomly generated items that can\
      \ be socketed into your Artifacts to grant them unimaginable power.<br></li><li>Partake\
      \ in mini-games such as slot machines, keno, scratch cards, and even a board\
      \ game that rewards you with exclusive items.<br></li><li>Use Realmshaping to\
      \ unlock new events and perks in each of the 30 realms.<br></li><li>Defeat enemies\
      \ to gain Knowledge about them, unlocking additional benefits when you next\
      \ encounter that creature in the wild.</li></ul><br>The list goes on and on\
      \ and on, and we have plans to add even more end-game content in the future\
      \ as well. The point is, Siralim Ultimate isn\u2019t a game where you\u2019\
      ll finish the main storyline and then call it quits. There\u2019s so much content\
      \ for you to discover afterward that it\u2019s almost ridiculous!"

      \ of unlockable perks that change the way your creatures fight in battle.<br><br>Here\
      \ is a list of just a few of the specializations in the game, along with a brief\
      \ description of how they work:<br><br>Animator - As an Animator, you will always\
      \ have a unique creature in your party called Animatus. Your entire battle strategy\
      \ will likely focus on this creature. You can empower your Animatus, and even\
      \ use your other creatures to make it stronger in combat.<br><br>Cabalist -\
      \ As a Cabalist, you'll enable your creatures to cast spells that they normally\
      \ wouldn't have access to. While other people's creatures might run out of Spell\
      \ Gem Charges, you'll be able to keep your creatures well-stocked with fresh\
      \ Spell Gems at the start of every battle.<br><br>Cleric - As a Cleric, you'll\
      \ specialize in healing abilities, as well as buffing, resurrection, stat-boosting\
      \ effects, and providing your creatures with protective barriers. Your creatures\
      \ will be extremely difficult to kill.<br><br>Defiler - As a Defiler, you'll\
      \ specialize in debuffs and stat-reducing effects. Enemies will be so weak that\
      \ your party will be able to easily pick them off, even if they were originally\
      \ much more powerful than your creatures.<br><br>Druid - As a Druid, you'll\
      \ probably only want to have one (or two, later on) creatures in your party.\
      \ Your creatures will gain massive benefits for being part of a smaller party.<br><br>Evoker\
      \ - As an Evoker, you'll empower your creatures' spellcasting capabilities.\
      \ Your creatures will be able to cast the same spell multiple times in one turn,\
      \ and these spells will be much stronger than if they had cast them without\
      \ your guidance.<br><br>Hell Knight - As a Hell Knight, you'll favor creatures\
      \ that specialize in attacking. Hell Knights empower their creatures' attacks\
      \ with chaotic magic. Hell Knights are surprisingly adept at spellcasting in\
      \ a pinch, as well.<br><br>Inquisitor - As an Inquisitor, you'll have a solution\
      \ at your disposal for every problem you encounter. In addition, Inquisitors\
      \ are able to use healing effects for offensive purposes - for example, when\
      \ your creatures heal enemies, they instead cause damage to them.<br><br>Monk\
      \ - As a Monk, you'll boost your creatures' chance to Dodge attacks and spells.\
      \ When your creatures Dodge, they'll unleash a devastating counter-attack on\
      \ the enemy.<br><br>Necromancer - As a Necromancer, you'll summon minions to\
      \ aid your creatures in battle. These minions can do all kinds of things to\
      \ support your creatures - they can cause damage, boost your creatures' stats,\
      \ debuff enemies, and much more.<br><br>Paladin - As a Paladin, your creatures\
      \ will be able to endure even the most powerful of attacks. Each time your creatures\
      \ take damage, they'll also damage their enemies.<br><br>Reaver - As a Reaver,\
      \ your creatures will gain massive benefits in combat as battles continue to\
      \ drag on. If your creatures manage to survive for just a few extra turns, they'll\
      \ be able to devastate your enemies.<br><br>Sorcerer - As a Sorcerer, you'll\
      \ support your creatures by debilitating their enemies from afar. Generally,\
      \ your enemies won't be able to act for the first few turns in battle as long\
      \ as you're around.<br><br>Tribalist - As a Tribalist, you'll want to assemble\
      \ a party of creatures that belong to the same race. This will provide them\
      \ with significant benefits that are exacerbated by their racial synergies with\
      \ each other.<br><br>Trickster - As a Trickster, you'll heavily inconvenience\
      \ your enemies by preventing them from taking action. You'll also gain the ability\
      \ to manipulate the element of luck - for example, if a positive effect has\
      \ a chance to activate but fails to do so, you can try again.<br><br>Eventually,\
      \ you can unlock all of these specializations on the same save file and quickly\
      \ swap to them whenever you want.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_08.png?t=1606657638\"\
      \ /><br><br>Each of your creatures can equip an Artifact. Artifacts provide\
      \ your creatures with various bonuses, including stat boosts, on-damage effects/procs,\
      \ traits, and even the ability to automatically cast spells when certain conditions\
      \ are met.<br><br>In order to obtain an Artifact, you must first Forge one at\
      \ the Blacksmith. After that, you can Socket your Artifacts with crafting materials\
      \ to add new properties to them. There are over 1000 crafting materials to be\
      \ found, and they all provide different properties. You can Upgrade your Artifacts\
      \ to unlock new socket slots, and even Brand your Artifacts to give them a custom\
      \ name.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_09.png?t=1606657638\"\
      \ /><br><br>Your creatures can equip Spell Gems which allow them to cast the\
      \ spell contained within the gem. There are more than 600 different spells for\
      \ players to find.<br><br>In order to obtain Spell Gems, you must first find\
      \ an Inscription that acts as a recipe to teach you how to Craft the Spell Gem.\
      \ You can Upgrade your Spell Gems to unlock Enchantment slots, and then you\
      \ can use these slots to add properties that affect the way the spell works.<br><br>For\
      \ example, you can add a modifier to a Spell Gem that allows it to deal damage\
      \ to an additional enemy. Another interesting property is called \u201CMagnetic\u201D\
      , which causes the spell to be more powerful for each creature in your party\
      \ that has that same spell equipped.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_10.png?t=1606657638\"\
      \ /><br><br>Unlike other games, Siralim Ultimate allows you to decide when you\u2019\
      ve finished it. For that reason, we\u2019ve packed the game with a ridiculous\
      \ amount of content to explore, items to collect, achievements to earn, and\
      \ so much more. Many players have enjoyed the previous Siralim games for thousands\
      \ of hours (that's not an exaggeration) and Siralim Ultimate is going to be\
      \ even larger in scale. There will always be something new for you to collect,\
      \ no matter how long you\u2019ve been playing!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_11.png?t=1606657638\"\
      \ /><br><br>Each of the 30 realms in Siralim Ultimate is ruled by a different\
      \ god. Players can earn Favor with these gods to increase their Favor Rank.\
      \ As your Favor Rank with each god increases, you\u2019ll be able to earn new\
      \ items, creatures, decorations, and much more.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_12.png?t=1606657638\"\
      \ /><br><br>Almost every gameplay system in Siralim Ultimate is meant to last\
      \ players forever - or at least for a very, very long time. For example, your\
      \ creatures do not have a level cap, so you can continue to level them up and\
      \ make them stronger indefinitely. Similarly, enemies can scale infinitely as\
      \ well.<br><br>Post-story content is filled to the brim with countless activities\
      \ for you to partake in to make your creatures more powerful. Here are a few\
      \ examples:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Take on randomly generated side quests\
      \ to obtain unique creatures and items.<br></li><li>Draft a team of creatures\
      \ in the arena and see how many battles you can last before your final creature\
      \ falls.<br></li><li>Battle against the gods themselves! These super boss-style\
      \ fights are among the most challenging in the game\u2026 but also the most\
      \ rewarding.<br></li><li>Unlock the relics of the gods and upgrade them indefinitely\
      \ to unleash devastating powers upon your foes.<br></li><li>Encounter Rodian\
      \ Creature Masters in Realms. Defeat them to earn Mastery, items, achievements,\
      \ and much more!<br></li><li>Work with five different guilds to take on powerful\
      \ World Bosses.<br></li><li>Collect skins and accessories for your creatures\
      \ to customize their appearance.<br></li><li>Collect cards to unlock permanent\
      \ bonuses for all your creatures. There's a card for every creature in the game!<br></li><li>Collect\
      \ Nether Stones, which are Diablo-inspired, randomly generated items that can\
      \ be socketed into your Artifacts to grant them unimaginable power.<br></li><li>Partake\
      \ in mini-games such as slot machines, keno, scratch cards, and even a board\
      \ game that rewards you with exclusive items.<br></li><li>Use Realmshaping to\
      \ unlock new events and perks in each of the 30 realms.<br></li><li>Defeat enemies\
      \ to gain Knowledge about them, unlocking additional benefits when you next\
      \ encounter that creature in the wild.</li></ul><br>The list goes on and on\
      \ and on, and we have plans to add even more end-game content in the future\
      \ as well. The point is, Siralim Ultimate isn\u2019t a game where you\u2019\
      ll finish the main storyline and then call it quits. There\u2019s so much content\
      \ for you to discover afterward that it\u2019s almost ridiculous!"
