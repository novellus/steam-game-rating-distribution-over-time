      notes: "Moor contains pixel-styled blood and gore as well as certain enemies\
        \ that might look somewhat disturbing.\r\nThe game also has an overall dark\

    review: "This game has a certain charm and I really wanted to like it, but unfortunately\
      \ I can't recommend it, all things considered.\n\nIt is a small roguelite with\
      \ permadeath and random dungeon generation, made mostly by one man. It has retro\
      \ graphics, quite somber mood and some nice premade locations. Derelict chambers\
      \ of the castle seem to tell a story of a forgotten kingdom buried under the\
      \ earth and there are some light environmental puzzles as well. However, overall\
      \ the game is not that fun to play. \n\nCombat is really slow and tedious, enemies\
      \ are brainless and unvaried brawlers with just different graphics and UI is\
      \ somewhat clunky. RPG elements, ranged weapons and magic are all pretty much\
      \ pointless, all you gonna do the entire game is basically just swinging one\
      \ sword and eating health items. There are a lot of bugs, even though the author\
      \ tries to fix them regularly. \n\nBut the biggest drag is total lack of any\
      \ map functionality, which makes navigating the maze of random, virtually indistinguishable\
      \ corridors extremely confusing and boring - and on top of that, you will have\
      \ to backtrack all levels after completing the game goal of finding a gemstone\
      \ or something.\n\nIt is a real shame that this title is not more polished.\
      \ It would be better if instead of random map generation there were hand made\
      \ levels - as given the author's knack for environment building it could significantly\
      \ improve the experience. Right now supposed added replayability is not really\
      \ much of an advantage, as the game will most likely bore you and wear your\
      \ patience after an hour or two.\n\nMy playtime of 10 hours is by no means indicative\
      \ of the amount of game content, it can be completed in 1-2 hours. I'm just\
      \ a masochist that likes finding and reporting bugs in indie titles :D\n\nIf\
      \ you're interested in this kind of game, but done right - \"Delver\" might\
      \ be for you."
