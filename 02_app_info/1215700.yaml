    review: "Nice puzzle platformer, reminiscent of Braid and Limbo, interesting and\
      \ innovative thumbtack mechanic. Narratively and artstyle-wise it reminds me\
      \ of Child of Light, with the rhymes and tale-like handdrawn style. Also Gris,\
      \ from Nomada studio. \nFor that price it was a welcome and enjoyable experience."
