Built in PC based video capture increases load on the PC whilst recording. For most modern, machines that can comfortably run the chosen SIM racing game this should not be noticeable. However, if the PC is already near the limit for the game that is running, it may be necessary to reduce resolution\/quality settings for VBOX Sim video capture to avoid video lagging behind telemetry. Alternatively, consider purchasing an external video capture device to reduce the load on the PC. For ultra wide monitors we recommend reducing the capture resolution if performance problems ensue.  Support is included for external video capture devices such as the Avermedia LGP Lite as an alternative to the built in PC Based video capture. VBO files should be opening with Circuit Tools v2.9.30 or later (available on the Help tab in VBOX Sim).<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"Racelogic is a trademark of Racelogic Ltd.","developers":["Racelogic"],"publishers":["Racelogic"],"price_overview":{"currency":"USD","initial":12999,"final":12999,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"$129.99"},"packages":[447260],"package_groups":[{"name":"default","title":"Buy VBOX Sim","description":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","save_text":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","subs":[{"packageid":447260,"percent_savings_text":" ","percent_savings":0,"option_text":"VBOX Sim - $129.99","option_description":"","can_get_free_license":"0","is_free_license":false,"price_in_cents_with_discount":12999}]}],"platforms":{"windows":true,"mac":false,"linux":false},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"}],"genres":[{"id":"70","description":"Early Access"}],"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1283440\/ss_7828cd0802c972aa382da53f99b045ed0cf34988.600x338.jpg?t=1599144827","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1283440\/ss_7828cd0802c972aa382da53f99b045ed0cf34988.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599144827"},{"id":1,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1283440\/ss_42ee0baea612027d8d034f123b0d5b435d3fe0e4.600x338.jpg?t=1599144827","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1283440\/ss_42ee0baea612027d8d034f123b0d5b435d3fe0e4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599144827"},{"id":2,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1283440\/ss_7585ad7699fc96706beb098d3860fa3e122aadfb.600x338.jpg?t=1599144827","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1283440\/ss_7585ad7699fc96706beb098d3860fa3e122aadfb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599144827"},{"id":5,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1283440\/ss_4b5ec77b619c53d6a881681ec8ce163846dd44f6.600x338.jpg?t=1599144827","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1283440\/ss_4b5ec77b619c53d6a881681ec8ce163846dd44f6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599144827"},{"id":6,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1283440\/ss_c8b0e4dc147412dcec0f2906c792218c9740303e.600x338.jpg?t=1599144827","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1283440\/ss_c8b0e4dc147412dcec0f2906c792218c9740303e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599144827"},{"id":7,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1283440\/ss_3ed193569116ffcde60ba6c3dfbdac31431a628f.600x338.jpg?t=1599144827","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1283440\/ss_3ed193569116ffcde60ba6c3dfbdac31431a628f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599144827"},{"id":8,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1283440\/ss_849dff5823314f5c3c223d9d2b21394108b95c60.600x338.jpg?t=1599144827","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1283440\/ss_849dff5823314f5c3c223d9d2b21394108b95c60.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599144827"}],"movies":[{"id":256790619,"name":"VBOX Sim","thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256790619\/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1596637007","webm":{"480":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256790619\/movie480_vp9.webm?t=1596637007","max":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256790619\/movie_max_vp9.webm?t=1596637007"},"mp4":{"480":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256790619\/movie480.mp4?t=1596637007","max":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256790619\/movie_max.mp4?t=1596637007"},"highlight":true}],"release_date":{"coming_soon":false,"date":"Sep 3, 2020"},"support_info":{"url":"","email":"simsupport@racelogic.co.uk"},"background":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1283440\/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1599144827","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null}}}}
