Props to the composer for writing something that's at once epic, spacey and robotic that evokes the classic 8/16-bit legends. I'm particularly sensitive to music in video games, and this one struck the nail on the head for me.\n\nThe gameplay is through controling the protagonist as if he were a mouse cursor on the screen. Left click is the classic gun, right click is a smash attack that turns your little robot into a ball of death when you touch enemies. There are upgrades that I assume come with each successful completion of the Story Mode. \n\nStory Mode is five stages, and using about 12 continues (most on Stage 4), I managed to beat the game in under 30 minutes. This is good because you about six weapons to unlock, and you unlock one weapon per play-though (I am assuming). I unlocked one new gun (left click), and a new play mode (Practice Mode, i.e. choose any stage to play). \n\nMost of the game's worth is through replay value. The story is simple, but well done. It's not the centerpiece of the experience, that's learning how to survive. \n\nThe enemy attacks aren't very forgiving, but they are fair. The stages ascend in difficulty at a correct rate, so that I was learning from my mistakes quickly rather than being bombarded by a million bullets from the get-go. The artwork, which emulates the Behemoth Games style cartoon work, makes it easy to distinguish bullets trying to kill you, moving enemies, and backgrounds. You should be able to recognize what kinds of attacks are coming at you to move accordingly through the deeper circles of bullet hell. \n\nIf I have one major complaint, it's that the final boss was one of the easiest for me to defeat. I was expecting a THIS ISN'T MY FINAL FORM sort of ordeal, but nope. I'll probably give this another couple playthroughs, but I'm not likely to unlock everything. If you are looking for a quick bullet-hell game, this is it.","timestamp_created":1534243239,"timestamp_updated":1534243239,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xb6BnOUCeqywqAE="}
