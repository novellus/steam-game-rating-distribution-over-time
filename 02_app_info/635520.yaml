    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Phantasmat: The Endless Night" Collector''s Edition is a Hidden Object Puzzle
      Adventure game. The game was developed by Eipix Entertainment and published
      by Big Fish Games Studio.


      "The Endless Night" is the third episode of "Phantasmat." Previous episodes:
      "Phantasmal" and "Crucible Peak."


      Since this is a collector''s edition, it comes with extra features that are
      not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals
      can be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are four different difficulty game modes to choose from: Easy; Medium;
      Hard and Custom.


      There is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel
      between each location quickly. It also indicates that there are tasks that can
      be completed at certain locations. The interactive map is not automatically
      given at the start of the game.


      There is a padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in
      place to make it stationary.


      There are interactive items in the game. Some of these interactive items may
      require extra components before they can be interacted with. All interactive
      items are marked with a symbol in one of the corners.


      The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Riddled items; Find ''x''
      amount items;Shadow items; Traditional word list. Some of these hidden object
      scenes may require little or no interactions. Most of the hidden object scenes
      can be replayed in the game''s extra feature section.


      The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of
      them. Most of the puzzles can be replayed in the game''s extra feature section.


      There is a collectible in the game: Eye. They are scattered throughout the game
      for the player to find.


      Since this is a collector''s edition, there is a bonus chapter, but it can be
      accessed only after the main story is completed.


      There are thirteen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing
      the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need
      to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game
      only.


      Miscellaneous


      There are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Bonus Hidden Objects; Bonus
      Puzzles; Soundtracks; Wallpapers; Concept Art; Souvenir Room and Game''s Strategy
      Guide. Most of these extra features can be accessed only after the entire game
      is completed.


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
