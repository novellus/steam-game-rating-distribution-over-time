I really like it :) The graphics are great, there are tons of characters to talk to and the idea of the game is very refreshing. I like doing puzzles and wondering how to move forward in the game. I also find myself nodding my head to the beat of the music time to time, ha ha :D \n\nFor me this is the best game I play at the moment. I wish I could say more about the game but I don't want to spoil it. See for yourselves ^_^!","timestamp_created":1609960153,"timestamp_updated":1609960153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+svG7PYCetSKwQI="}
