    review: Hot Mars 69 is possibly the best game ive laid eyes on. Since Skyrim every
      game I have played has been mediocre or flat out terrible, but this game is
      easily the best game I have every played. The gunplay is the best on the market,
      the open world gameplay is 300x better then God of War, and the enemys are better
      programmed then the enitirety of Super Mario Odyssey. The sound effects were
      crispy, espiecally the heartbeat sound, which thankfully plays throughout almost
      the entire game. The gun is the greatest gun ive ever seen and I know gun games,
      ive played splatoon on the wii u. Couldn't reccomend this game enough selling
      your house for this game is a amazing financial decision. Without this game
      your life will never be complete. This is the best game on steam thank you lord
      gaben. 69/10
