    about_the_game: Vecter is a fast-paced runner and shooter game where your goal
      is to survive by the skin of your teeth and raise hell in your path. You get
      in your ship, you push the throttle on max and then try to survive for as long
      as possible by annihilating anything that gets in your way.<br><br>There are
      obstacles, there are enemies, there are power-ups and there will be plenty more
      to come! I hope you're good at staring contests because you will not have the
      luxury of blinking!<br><br>Compete with your friends and with strangers for
      the top spot of the daily leaderboard. If you're top dog for that day, you remain
      top dog for that day on that track forever! It's all you, you did it!<br><br>And
      you don't need to be in-game to show off your position, you can also take it
      to your friends house and brag about your greatness while everyone is awkwardly
      ignoring you for boasting about something nobody's even heard about. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.vecter.online/leaderboardLegends.html"

      /><br><br>One important thing to note is that Vecter does not have a road-map,
      or a planed out future. There is a trello board with features that I plan on

      a one-man dev team, and I'm making this game purely out of passion around all
      of my other IRL commitments, so development sometimes may be slow. It's a hobby
