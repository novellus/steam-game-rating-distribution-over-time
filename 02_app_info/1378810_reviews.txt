The UI is horrible, so is the object placement, and in general the jumpscares are actual dogshit. The monsters look like autistic toys made by a 13 year old, obviously just Unity assets and nothing else. Never buy this piece of shit game and save your money for helping kids in Africa rather than supporting a shitty developer. I'd rather stay in a class with a gorilla who teaches English and has mental problems in a fucking 8th grade class instead of giving you my money and letting you freely copyright strike any criticism related videos towards your horrible excuse of a game that you can't handle like a real developer should. الله معاك","timestamp_created":1604774634,"timestamp_updated":1604774634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490566045045852661","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwobSB0vUCc//7rAI="}
