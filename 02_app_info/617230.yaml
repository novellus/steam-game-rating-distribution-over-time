    review: "Basically a portal maze. Levels or rooms inter-linked with one another\
      \ through portals with a very brief loading time \nbetween each. The game play\
      \ consisting of walking around with a torch avoiding the occasional trap with\
      \ some\nfreaky audio and and sometimes visual effects. There don't seem to be\
      \ any monsters. If you die from a trap\nit's game over and you have to start\
      \ over so you have to manually save your progress from time to time. The traps\
      \ can often be deactivated by pushing a box into a trip wire or sensor beam,\
      \ the boxes generally being convieniently placed next to the traps.\n\nDespite\
      \ the dark look of the game and the reasonable sound effects and music the levels\
      \ are far too small and simplistic\nand many don't seem to differ in layout\
      \ very much from one another. Many of the levels don't seem to have traps or\
      \ any\nchallenges.\n\nGenerally from where you port into the level theres a\
      \ choice of 3 or 4 directions. If theres no traps, you walk along \nan often\
      \ straight corridoor for literally 5 seconds to the sound of some freaky sound\
      \ effects to the next\nportal at the end of the corridoor. So you are spending\
      \ seconds not minutes on each level even with traps, which\nbe fair I felt was\
      \ frustrating because I just wanted to explore some big, dark, complex levels.\n\
      \nWith bigger, more complex levels and more challenges, maybe a few monsters\
      \ within, this could be a reasonable game even with the purly exploration with\
      \ a torch based game play. \n\nTo be fair I didn't exactly dislike the game\
      \ it's just it was far to quick and easy to complete. Stumbled upon the exit\
      \ within 38 minutes of total game play even after dieing the first couple of\
      \ times and learning to save progress. Played it some more to try and explore\
      \ but didn't realy find that much more to it.\n"
