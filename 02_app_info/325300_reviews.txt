I eventually walked away from the demo realizing I played one of the best party games I've ever seen. I've tried to keep up with it's development, but life (and my own indie studio) got in the way. A couple of us were reminiscing about Bearzerkers today at our studio and I decided do check-in on it. AND THEN WE PLAYED FOR THE NEXT TWO HOURS! \n\nI'm so excited for this game and the developers, as I remember them in 2014, are great people. Please buy this game and share it with your friends. =)\n\n*An actual review*\n\nThe game has simple mechanics... you move, you kick up ground, and there are powerups. That's it. And it's all you need. You run from bears, you kick up ground to block your friends in hopes of them getting eaten, and you survive. The music is fine, the escalating bears is exciting, and the party replayability is amazing. 9/10, WILL PLAY AGAIN.","timestamp_created":1462160944,"timestamp_updated":1462160944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586466193199157715","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwuK3lt9QCeY3nVg=="}
