There is a bit a variety in the number of mech forms you can take, although some are clearly better than others for certain tasks [spoiler] The bomb tank was the one I used almost exclusively for the bosses [/spoiler] , while others you use only when it's needed or not at all. The difficulty can also spike at times as well, but not enough to take me out of the game too much. The music, while keeping up with the simple theme, was pretty good to boot.\n\nOverall, Mech Chip was a worthwhile little experience to try out, even if getting 100% achievements ended up grindy right at the end.","timestamp_created":1599411048,"timestamp_updated":1599411048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5PmUsvQCc42boAI="}
