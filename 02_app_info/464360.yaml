    review: '[h1] The Simplicity of Space [/h1]


      [b] What I Liked [/b]


      I recommend this game as a decent, affordable, space shooter.  It''s not the
      best space shooter I have played, nor is it the worst.  It''s simplistic.  So
      why am I recommending it?  Because I think it''s a good game for what it''s
      trying to do, especially for the price point.  I purchased it on sale and don''t
      regret supporting the developer.  If it''s on sale, I''d say give it a try.  You
      may end up liking it.  If you breeze through the story in the beginning of the
      game, you can try out the combat before the 2 hour mark so you can get a refund
      if you really don''t think it''s for you.


      [b] What I Did Not Like [/b]


      I am someone who likes complicated systems when it comes to designing a ship.  While
      this one does have different ways to upgrade your ship, I didn''t find it fulfilling
      enough.  It also had a mix of click-based story telling.  Those aren''t my strong
      suit,


      [b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]


      I made multiple purchases during a sale that was happening, including this game,
      so I moved on to another game I had purchased.  I doubt I will re-visit this
      game unless I want a simple space shooter with text-based story telling.

      I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also
      bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for
      2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a
      game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught
      my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest
      of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint,
      then the game must be special!'
