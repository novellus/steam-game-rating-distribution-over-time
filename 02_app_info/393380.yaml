      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Squad is a <strong>large scale combined arms</strong> multiplayer
      first-person shooter emphasizing combat realism through communication, team
      play, emphasizing strong squad cohesion mechanics as well as <strong>larger-scale
      coordination, tactics, and planning</strong>. <br><br>It features <strong>20
      large open maps</strong>, vehicle-based <strong>combined arms</strong> gameplay,
      and <strong>player-constructed bases</strong> to create a heart-thumping, visceral
      gaming experience with split-second decision-making in real-world scale firefights.</h2><h2

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">50 versus 50</h2>Pitting several conventional and unconventional
      factions against each other, Squad aims to create authentic combat experiences
      utilizing a sense of being a part of something greater than yourself. Pick a
      side and become a member of a nine-man squad with your team to face off against
      50 other players in intense, large combat environments. Squad features the US
      Army, Russian Ground Forces, British Army, Canadian Armed Forces, the Middle
      Eastern Alliance, and Irregular Militia and Insurgents with their own unique
      arsenals.<h2 class="bb_tag">_</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/393380/extras/fobsiege.gif?t=1605299997"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Building System</h2>Do you hear the sound of rumbling and
      grinding gears? Do you fear the inevitability of your short life at the end
      of a T-72 Main Battle Tank barrel? Get your Squad Leader to place down an anti-tank
      guided missile system and remove that pesky tank from the battlefield. In Squad,
      we provide numerous methods to adapt to the ever-changing needs of the battlespace.
      Place down emplacements like HMGs and AT guns, or build up a fortified position
      with sandbags, HESCOs, and razor wire.<h2 class="bb_tag">_</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/393380/extras/communication.gif?t=1605299997"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Communication</h2>The pinnacle of the Squad experience,
      communication is a soldier's best tool in effectively engaging the enemy. To
      help facilitate navigating the complexity of communication on the battlefield,
      we provide a world-class in-game VoIP system that allows you to talk to other
      soldiers locally, internally in your squad, between squad leaders, or squad
      leaders to the Commander. Also, we provide a plethora of other tools that fire
      team leaders and squad leaders may use to inform their squads and teams, such
      as map tools and in-world marking tools.

    review: Highly recommend this game. Have been wanting to play it for a very long
      time and finally have the opportunity. has a very steep learning curve and even
      only 30 hours in, still trying to learn how to do everything properly. Community
      is very good and for the most part very helpful and understanding, of course
      there is the occasional exception. Cannot wait for the developers to add even
      more factions. Hopefully they can come up with a way to factor in proper Fire
      Support bases, the ability to knock over and cut down trees with explosives
      and impacts from heavy vehicles would be nice too, maybe even being able to
      add mouse holes in walls etc to make better firing positions, battle scarring
      would also be much appreciated, being able to use the ground as cover after
      an air strike or artillery strike etc. But the game is still in early development,
      overall I'm really impressed with it and it would have to be one of my favourite
      games.
