    review: Fun combo mech. All of her specials are really good for combos, and some
      can even combo into each other. This means you'll need a lot of meter, but you'll
      get a lot of payout for what you muster up. The ultimate is meh, kinda hard
      to use, but the specials are really good for approaching, which suits Stardust's
      burst damage heavy playstyle. My former main, until I started mastering Shifu
      and Mirai.
