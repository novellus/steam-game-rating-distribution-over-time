      \ cell continues.<br />\nAs in the first chapter of his journey, the small cell\
      \ will have to come back to life a part of the organic tissue in which it floats,\
      \ but this time the method used is very different:<br />\nmust create and close\
      \ the beneficial bubbles to attain a level of coverage required to overcome\
      \ the various levels. These bubbles, once created, will crystallize and explode\
      \ on contact with the main cell. With increasing levels appear new bonuses and\
      \ new enemies. There are three worlds, in which appear random barriers and large\
      \ breathing cells that will hinder the journey of the protagonist.<br />\n<br\
      \ />\nObjectives of the game...<br />\n<br />\nThe aim of the game is to revitalize\
      \ the organic tissue (at any level) with the &quot; beneficial bubbles &quot;\
      \ that are drawn from the main character ( &quot;back to life ... &quot;). To\
      \ close the drawing of the bubble must return to the starting point of the &quot;\
      \ design &quot; ( indicated by the yellow arrows ) . In the design phase of\
      \ the bubble, if the red contours are touched by an enemy or by the protagonist\
      \ himself, then the construction of the bubble explodes and is canceled. To\
      \ pass each level you have to fill ( revitalizing ) with the &quot; beneficial\
      \ bubbles &quot; a certain percentage of organic material present in the playfield\
      \ ( the percentage covered / required is displayed in the lower-right corner\
      \ of the screen) . There are 300 levels divided into three worlds. With increasing\
      \ levels appear new enemies and new bonuses. Each level has a time limit to\
      \ be exceeded, visible in the upper-left corner of the screen. The final goal\
      \ of the game is to overcome all 300 levels of the three worlds, to complete\
      \ the mission of the small beneficial cell.<br />\nOnce created, the beneficial\
      \ bubble 'crystallises' after a few seconds (and turns blue). If the main character\
      \ touches a bubble crystallized, it explodes decreasing the percentage covered.\
      \ This was done also to improve the 'strategic' side of the game. At the top\
      \ right of the screen is also a MAP that helps you to orientate in the exploration\
      \ of the level."
