I have followed the development of Rome Reborn VR since its inception in the 1990s. Now that the first VR applications of the project are starting to appear in online stores, I am delighted to express my strong support for this unique initiative which combines archaeological accuracy with state-of-the-art technology. The goal is to make the core monuments of the Eternal City easily comprehensible even to non-experts, and to bring ancient Rome into the homes and schools of people wherever they may be. In my opinion, the Rome Reborn VR team has brilliantly achieved this goal. --Prof. Paolo Liverani”<br>5\/5 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pg\/romerebornvr\/reviews\/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Dipartimento di Storia, Archeologia, Geografia, Arte e Spettacolo, University of Florence (Italy)<\/a><br><br>“As Director of the Civic Museum of Rieti, about 80 km north of Rome, on Saturday, May 26, 2018 I organized, at the museum, two public demonstrations of the Rome Reborn VR application presenting the Roman Forum. Over 100 people of all ages attended both demonstrations. I can report that the response was enthusiastically positive. The event showed that Rome Reborn VR has the potential to make the study of history come alive for students and the general public. Rome Reborn VR is a great tool for the museum world and for anyone around the world who wants to learn more about ancient Rome by going back in time to visit the city as it appeared at the peak of its development in AD 320. --Dr. Monica De Simone”<br>5\/5 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pg\/romerebornvr\/reviews\/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Civic Museum of Rieti (Italy)<\/a><br><br>“This is an *amazing* pedagogical tool with lots of applications in secondary and higher education. As a professor of Classics, I consider Roman Reborn VR an indispensable tool for courses on Roman civilization, Roman history, Roman archaeology, even Latin literature. While this app has a lot to offer to faculty and students, it will also appeal to non-academics who are interested in ancient Rome. --Prof. Zoe Stamatopoulou”<br>5\/5 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pg\/romerebornvr\/reviews\/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Department of Classics, Washington University (USA)<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/923270\/header.jpg?t=1607881832","website":"https:\/\/www.flyoverzone.com\/products\/rome-reborn-forum\/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel-i5 or greater<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> NVIDIA GTX 970 \/ AMD 290 or equivalent<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 10 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel-i5 or greater<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> NVIDIA GTX 1080 or equivalent<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 10 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Mac OS Catalina, 10.15<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel-i5 or greater<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 8 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Intel HD Graphics 6000 1536mb<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Mac OS Catalina, 10.15<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel-i7 or greater<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 8 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Intel HD Graphics 6000 1536mb<\/li><\/ul>"},"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"Copyright 2020 Flyover Zone.
