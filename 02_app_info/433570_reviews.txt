Controls are sometimes unresponsive. I can use my controlller, but shown promts are for the keyboard. I could live with the \"story\" (spoiler: the story is \"rescue the princess\") if it was written in a better way or if the gameplay would be any kind of fun. But it isnt.\n\nThe idea about a side character becoming a hero sounded good, the execution isnt. \nI just cant recommend the game.","timestamp_created":1572803686,"timestamp_updated":1572804220,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxvqbme4Cebud1wE="}
