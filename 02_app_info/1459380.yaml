      \ are hired to transport hundreds of freed human slaves from a former world\
      \ of the Glorious Empire to sanctuary. A beneficent Aslan clan lord has lent\
      \ them a ship for the job. There is just one catch - they must go no farther\
      \ than six parsecs. To make matters worse, they are being hunted by forces who\
      \ desperately want to prevent them from reaching their goal. With a vulnerable\
      \ and poorly armed ship, the Travellers must use their wits to deliver the refugees\
      \ to safety.<br><i>Exodus</i> is set near the borders of the Glorious Empire\
      \ and the Aslan Hierate where centuries of warfare have devastated the region.\
      \ The Glorious Empire has left billions of human slaves behind on the worlds\
      \ they have lost. Eager to obtain the land on these worlds, the Hierate is torn\
      \ between deporting the humans, converting them into a labour caste, or terminating\
      \ them in a genocide of epic proportions.<br>The Travellers' voyage takes on\
      \ symbolic meaning. Success could trigger a mass exodus of humans from Aslan\
      \ space. Failure might spell their doom.<br><i>Exodus</i> includes the following:<br><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li><i>Bad Betty</i> , a modified <i>Khtukhao</i> -class Aslan\
      \ clan transport</li><li><i>Little Betty</i> , the <i>Bad Betty's</i> sleek\
