    about_the_game: A world-renowned penguin entomologist's specimens have accidentally
      been set loose in the Antarctic skies! To prevent a possible ecological catastrophe,
      a team of penguins embarks on a mission to recover the escaped bugs as quickly
      as possible.<br><br>Equipped with a jetpack, a bubble blower and a portable
      bug tracker, our penguin hero sets out to immobilize the insects in each patch
      of sky so that the rest of the team can capture them. He'll run into plenty
      of resistance, from hungry mosquitoes and aggressive bees to quick, evasive
      dragonflies, but he's also sharing the skies with a friendly merchant who may
      be willing to help him out - for the right price.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li> Scour the skies in search of butterflies, mosquitoes, dragonflies,
      bees and more.<br></li><li> Earn (in-game) coins for your efforts, and spend
      them on upgrades for your equipment.<br></li><li> Replay areas in Memory Mode
      - with the bug tracker switched off - to test your bug-chasing skills even further,
      and earn a coin bonus for doing so!<br></li><li> Discover and collect over a
      hundred mysterious medallions hidden in the sky.</li></ul>
