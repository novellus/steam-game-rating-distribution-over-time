      \ is the highly anticipated sequel to our successful first adventure game <strong>Game\
      \ Royale - Riders of the lost bald</strong>. <br>The game is a point-&amp;-click\
      \ adventure and a tribute to the great classics of this genre. <br><br>The second\
      \ part of <strong>Game Royale</strong> continues the story right after the dramatic\
      \ cliffhanger seen at the end of the first part. The player guides the main\
      \ character Jan B\xF6hmermann through a short and thrilling adventure full of\
      \ puzzles and humorous dialogues. The story begins with Jan, as he wakes up\
      \ on a remote island without any memories of previous events. He has to fight\
      \ for survival until he is finally able to call for help. While the main storyline\
      \ takes place on said island, we will also revisit the show\u2019s venue, the\
      \ famous Studio K\xF6nig in K\xF6ln-Ehrenfeld. In a parallel storyline, the\
      \ player takes on the shape of popular sidekick William Cohn, who makes it his\
      \ own personal mission to find his missing friend. Apart from these two, there\
      \ will be a reunion with other popular figures of the Neo Magazin Royale world.\
      \ All of them are dubbed by the real people on the show.<br><br><strong>***THIS\
