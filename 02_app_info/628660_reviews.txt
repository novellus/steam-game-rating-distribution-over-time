It shows - this game has deeply thought out gameplay challenges, graphics and sounds. The original version is unlockable and has some subtle improvements of the original, while keeping the gameplay and vibe intact. A must-have for Lode Runner fans for for those who are wondering what makes this game a classic. 10/10.","timestamp_created":1606296619,"timestamp_updated":1609396137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4woXf2/YCdO+xsAI="}
