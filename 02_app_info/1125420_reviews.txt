Only thing I would criticise are the 1-2 parts in the game where you need to avoid enemies or deal with them in a certain way but the controls aren't that tight. This can be a bit annoying at first but never the less a really nice game with a pretty story and some not too difficult riddles.","timestamp_created":1609532894,"timestamp_updated":1609532894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws93o3/YCfdvAvwI="}
