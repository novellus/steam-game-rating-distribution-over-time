    about_the_game: 'Nil-Ninjahtic: Ronin is a pseudo 8-bit action platformer. While
      it integrates gameplay mechanics of the previous titles in the series, they
      are combined in a manner which differentiates itself from its predecessors.<br><br>Rather
      than playing as a ninja-like protagonist, the main character shares more characteristics
      with that of a samurai. Usage of the environment is still the focus of the platforming
      and puzzle elements remain intact, although progression through each level is
      straightforward without the open-ended nature present in the previous titles.<br><br>Features:<br><ul

    review: "Defintly the most hardest of the Ninjahtic trilogy. the feature of save\
      \ anywhere present in the other games don't exist here. Also the hp bar added\
      \ in the second game doesn't exist too - so it back to the \"one-hit-ko\" mode\
      \ present in the first game. \nWhile the other protagonists share some \"agility\"\
      , the one here has a low-high jump that EASILY can make fall when trying to\
      \ cross a pit. Also the enemies here are SMART and can counter - killing you\
      \ EASILY! the ONLY good (useful) feature is the climbing/walking wall ability\
      \ from the previous (second) game of the series.\n\nIf you don't played or know\
      \ the prequel games I don't recomend this one! But if you like the hard-as-nail\
      \ types of games, its your choice.\n\nI may say I was enticed to play it by\
      \ the pixel art and the ninja appealing, but in the end it only bring me stressing\
      \ moments due the extreme difficulty if compared to the other Ninjahtic games."
