    review: "In true Castlevania fashion, the second one is much worse. The level\
      \ design is less encouraging towards taking alternate paths and finding secrets\
      \ than the first one, the boss fights are just lesser versions of the first\
      \ game's bosses (i.e. the Gladiator Dozer (Stage 3 of CotM2) takes several tactics\
      \ from the Glutton Train (Stage 1 of CotM) while offering less opportunities\
      \ to attack, not to mention Gremory (Stage 7)'s first form is outright taken\
      \ from the first game (Stage 8). The option to forgo an ally by ignoring them\
      \ or simply killing them for their power is also removed. \nZangetsu continues\
      \ to be the all-around character until the Soul Eraser is acquired, which is\
      \ equivalent to Ultimate mode in CotM, in addition to upgrading your subweapons.\
      \ [spoiler] In Episode 2, the Soul Eraser is forgone for the Zanmatou, the blade\
      \ made to seal demons. Unfortunately, it demotes your strength to its base by\
      \ removing Soul Eraser's bonuses. [/spoiler]\nDominique is the Bloodlines expy\
      \ of the group, wielding a polearm. Just as Miriam of the past, her jump is\
      \ higher, and her weapon is longer. Her subweapons are magic spells, with the\
      \ important ones being heal-focused. Golden lanterns drop the Resurrection Anthem,\
      \ meaning in order to have everyone alive, you have to ensure that everyone\
      \ dies before Dominique. If you happen to lose her, then you've essentially\
      \ lost a life.\nRobert is a bizarre character. His rifle weapon travels instantly\
      \ across the screen, allowing you to kill some enemies before they've even truly\
      \ appeared. His subweapons are nothing to brag about aside from the D. Cannon,\
      \ which is practically necessary with its kickback giving the player a vertical\
      \ boost. Rapid switching between him with his wall jump and the next character's\
      \ hover ability are necessary to exploit the game into getting one where they\
      \ need to go.\nHachi is a meme dog with an enormous hitbox unlike any other.\
      \ The ability to completely ignore spikes as well as an invincibility button\
      \ subweapon says a lot about modern game design. The game feels justified in\
      \ throwing dozens of enemies in one area simply because of invincibility. A\
      \ character like this completely ruins the flow of what's already painfully\
      \ slow gameplay.\n[spoiler] The past characters Miriam, Alfred and Gebel come\
      \ back in the Final Episode, but they function just as they did previously.\
      \ Gebel is needed for so many secrets and paths - the game torments you constantly\
      \ with this fact by offering one block tall pathways that are raised, meaning\
      \ Robert can't crawl through them, or with faraway doors that can't be flown\
      \ to using Hachi and Robert's combination hover and wall jump. [/spoiler]\n\
      Just buy the first game. It's better and cheaper."
