I'd be cooler with it if you got more lives per game.\n\nThat said, you can get used to it after a while, and it's one of the more fun games of its kind I've played for a while. The sound and music add great lo-fi/chiptune audio to enhance the experience.","timestamp_created":1587260906,"timestamp_updated":1587260906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoeuHyPECeK3ugQI="}
