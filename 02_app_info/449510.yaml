    review: es mas un juego de plataformas que uno de terror o puzzles y tambien uno
      de esos donde el escritor se enamoro del villano de una manera tan exagerada
      que ni dios podria bajarlo del pedestal jaja, no se trata de influir en la historia
      ya que en definitiva lo que hagas no cambia el resultado sino de perder una
      tarde con un juego tranquilo que toca temas profundos como la moralidad en la
      ciencia.
