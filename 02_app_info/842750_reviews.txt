I started playing on the 2.0 mega update. I plyaed on the switch a lot and it was very fun to play with friends. everyone I have showed this game too likes it. I reccomend it esppecially because of the cheap price. It is worth the $7. I give this game a 7.9/10.","timestamp_created":1610044992,"timestamp_updated":1610044992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoJ2K7/YCdeSrwQI="}
