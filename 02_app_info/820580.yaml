    review: 'Rather haunting soundtrack in what is really just a generic clicker.
      In the early game there''s some strategy involved to avoid going hungry or becoming
      really sick, but later on you rake in absurd amounts of cash to fund a weirdly
      lavish post-apoc lifestyle. There is a story throughout of the girl Ashley losing
      her entire family to what I''m assuming was a freak attack by a major world
      power, but it doesn''t much go into detail in her younger hard years and skips
      up into high school and college fairly fast. Also yes, the story is in rather
      broken and sometimes funny english as expected.


      It''s pretty relaxing to play through, worth a buy on seasonal sale discount
      if you''re looking for another 100% game or an easy time waster.'
