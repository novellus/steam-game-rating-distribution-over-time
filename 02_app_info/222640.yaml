    review: "One of the worst games I've ever played. I've never worked so fast to\
      \ leave a bad review. Half the time, you can't even select your characters to\
      \ use their skills. I've had multiple \"game over\" screens indicating a lost\
      \ battle, but will still have a couple remaining party members. Other strange\
      \ glitches coming in and out of scenes. The writing sucks, you're thrown in\
      \ to a random world with really no backdrop of what's going on. Basically, some\
      \ developers had an idea for combat and hastily scrawled a story around it.\
      \ Don't let a somewhat pretty looking game fool you...this isn't Blackguards,\
      \ Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, or any other reasonably competent turn based\
