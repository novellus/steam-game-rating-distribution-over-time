Did some studio purchase an incomplete horror movie and then wrap it in a paroty story about a movie studio trying to produce said movie?  Why does the trailer show a serious movie when the intention is to make fun of this movie and play it up as comedic sort of like MST3000 but done poorly?\n\nI'm not recomending this movie because it seems to be falsely advertised.  If I went into the movie expecting 2 hours of heckler's cracking jokes then I probably would have felt differently.\n\nI sort of wish this movie had been done as a proper horror movie and have it been completed.","timestamp_created":1477975170,"timestamp_updated":1477975170,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwveuLj9gCcr7BZA=="}
