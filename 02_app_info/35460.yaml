    review: 'This game just gets so boring.


      Bought this game after playing The Solus Project (Great game by the way) in
      hopes that it would be just as good as that game. I was disappointed. Nothing
      really happens in this game it''s just boring puzzles and bad fighting mechanics
      that lead to a worthless and forgettable gameplay experience'
