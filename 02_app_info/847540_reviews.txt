I'll start by saying I am an original Atari C-64 owner. My point, rule of thumb I have no need for retro gaming style in fact I dislike \"going back\". Songbringer is awesome hands down a true expansive adventure game/rpg. It with out a doubt has that magic feel of Zelda. No generic examine button, dead body steaming on ground. strange blue orb pillars! What do I do? That is another bit of cleverness  in the game you use a certain items to interact with objects in the world. If you are on the fence, jump the heck over!","timestamp_created":1601263541,"timestamp_updated":1601263541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sNOv6fQCc9zHpAI="}
