(I wouldn't care that it's text based, but get someone to check your spelling and grammar, please)\n\nIt acts like you have some freedom, but you really don't; the story is linear, you move your ship in a very straight forward planet to planet progression or you fail. Most of your time is spent reading background story for each planet or hailing new people just to listen to them spout drivel that is poorly written and just has no value to what your goals are.\n\nYou'll meet a new species and get pages of text that amount to: \"We are is the guys that do crawl from water aned will be the eating you todday, ok? Do you agree?\"\n\nYou either agree and the game ends, or you fight. Rinse and repeat for about 2 hours until the game is over. I'm not joking. Short game filled with bad dialogue, linear hand holding and nothing of real interest happens. Oh, and to add insult to injury, the combat mechanics are stupid.\n\nBefore each fight you pick a simplistic loadout. Would you like to use shield 1, 2 or 3 today? Would you like to use computer 1, 2 or 3 today? Would you like to use engine 1, 2 or 3 today? Again: not joking, this is what the equipment in the game is called. The only minor attempt at strategy comes from picking which weapon you will use, either short, medium or long range and through trial and error (fail and reload) you'll figure out which weapon type works against each alien race. The problem is it just doesn't matter, once you die and figure out you need a different weapon type you just kind of win. There's no strategy beyond that involved. You don't even have control over shooting in this game. Combat is just floating in a direction while aiming, the ship auto-fires for you at whatever enemy you select. If you have the right weapon to hit their speed and flight pattern you'll win, if you don't you will fail, change weapons and try again. \n\nAnd that's the entire game. Bad writing in a childish storyline punctuated by boring combat and lackluster strategy choices; and even if it was a good game (and it's not), it's so short you'll barely notice it exists. If you see me with more than 2 hours played on this game it's because I decided to idle it and get the steam cards, or I'm drunk and hate myself enough to get 100% achievements just to prove I can. \n\nIf you want a real testament to how bad this game is, take one look at the world statistics for achievement completion. The achievement with the highest completion rating is 4%. That means 96% of the people who own this game do not complete the very first achievement.\n\nYou can reach the first achievement (a boy and his goat) after playing less than 5 minutes of the game and without effort or combat, all you need to do is click through some storyline and fly to the very first planet (the only one on your map, you can't miss it). That means 96% of the people who own this game have not even played it for 5 minutes.\n\nThose people were smart enough to see how bad the game was and just shut it off. I hate myself enough to keep playing longer than that, but I don't recommend anyone else be this much of a masochist. \n\nJust to add further insult to those who buy it: the game asks you from the moment you launch it whether you want to play act 1 or act 2. The developers never bothered to make act 2. So even pretending this was a good game, it was half a game and then abandoned and it will remind you of this every time you start it up. So even forcing yourself to \"finish\" puts you half way through this very bad story that never ends.\n\nThis is one of those games that make steam look bad for even allowing it to be sold in the store.\n---\n\nEDIT: This game currently has 6 positive reviews out of 56, but the store page summary at the top says it only has 6 reviews total and won't post its positive/mixed/negative summary. (which should be glaringly negative)\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]","timestamp_created":1537619346,"timestamp_updated":1609100519,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456330478191375732","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45az30vYCeuuVqwE="}
