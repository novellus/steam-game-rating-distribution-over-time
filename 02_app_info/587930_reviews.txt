I have to play it with 50% scaling to make it smooth but then the game is extremely blurry and it's hard to read anything. The anti aliasing option doesn't work for me which makes everything look jagged and pixel-like, and upscaling doesn't help much.\n\nLike others have said, at this stage, the game is basically just about killing hordes of zombies which is cool and all but the entirety didn't quite live up to my expectations.\n\nSingleplayer map is anticipated but not yet released.\n\nI know the dev has more to the game in mind and I've seen pictures of some of the process, but very little seems to actually have been added. I will hope for an update to add more to the story and fix performance/other bugs because the project seems to be very ambitious still. I'll give it some more time to show itself.","timestamp_created":1607888231,"timestamp_updated":1608694235,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ497/pxvYCes72uQI="}
