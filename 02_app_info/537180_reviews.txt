After a while, I stopped enjoying it. I enjoyed Digimon in the past, but, man, the grind game is real here. Say you found a spot where you can get a Digi-egg drop of your favorite Digimon. Now, spend about 2-3 hours to drop at least 3 of those eggs. Next, if you haven't done so already, grind specific data to hatch the Digi-egg. For the amount of data, it all depends on the egg. As for the time... difficult to gauge, but longer than an hour for around 30 data. After all is said and done, it's time to try to hatch the egg (the most nerve-racking and rage filled portion of this event). With regular egg drops and not those bought from the Cash Shop, you can very well lose the egg on your first attempt of hatching it. If you get the egg to level 3, you're in a decent spot. I say decent because it's the lowest you can hatch your Digimon at, which is most of the time under 100% of its full potential. If you want better than decent, pray to RNGesus that the attempt to level 4 doesn't break your egg. To get your egg into top tier, try your luck at level 5... Actually... just... no... slim to none chance of it actually reaching there... And that's just one thing that grinds my gears. If your Digimon aren't strong enough, you're gonna have a hard time advancing. Even your starting team (minus your starter) are below their full potenial, so doling out a lot of damage is difficult.\n\nTo sum up a poor rant, head into the game if you just want a huge grind fest.\n\nEDIT: Previous gripes still apply, but it's gotten somewhat better. The events actually help you, be it giving you good items, like Burst Mode items or Riding Items, so that's part of the upside. If you also log in after months of not playing, your experience does get better. If Steam allowed a medium rating, I'd change it to that, but for now, I'll keep it thumbs down, since it didn't garner enough to change it over to a thumbs up.\n\nEDIT2: Alright, updating review with the latest game update. I'm gonna stop playing for a few months because the update is screwed. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling to no avail. Let me know when it's back up, yeah? Get it together, man.\n\nEDIT3: Game has gotten a bit better, especially when you're playing with friends. The new content is good; I just wish that they would fix the older content instead of constantly adding gamebreaking bugs and events that offer less than stellar rewards.","timestamp_created":1486275239,"timestamp_updated":1606520461,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.604683399200439453","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47JqFhvYCdbircQ=="}
