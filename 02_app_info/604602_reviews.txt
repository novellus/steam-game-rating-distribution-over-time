On the other, it's the only way to get a 4th character in your party, thus making it a fairly big powerup. Also, the DLC characters are mutually exclusive, which is hilarious given that the only \"reasonable\" way to buy them is a pack with all of them.\n\nAnyway this stock art lady replicates your third-slot character, but starts 4 levels higher. Or like one fight's worth fairly quickly, so whatever.\n\nUnfortunately, Witch is the worst class and a second one isn't helpful, making her the worst of the DLC characters.","timestamp_created":1500186376,"timestamp_updated":1500186376,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.630107462406158447","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9O6Epd0CesKLgAE="}
