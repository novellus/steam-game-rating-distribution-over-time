About everything is spot on and definetly a 'Pro' Train. The only con I would say is that the horn is too long because when you press Spacebar/B, the horn sounds for about a second, which may not seem long but in reality every train's horn sounds for about 0.2 seconds from a single tap. So it should be the case here because you can't play any tones.","timestamp_created":1610101448,"timestamp_updated":1610101448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1Mvh8PYCcNHAwQI="}
