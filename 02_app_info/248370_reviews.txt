It was a cracked version back in the day. Come to think of this game again and wanted to see if it was on steam. And it is. But I have to admit that the cracked version worked better than this version. I can't set my graphic settings. It gives me the message I need to restart the game for changes to take effect. But when I start the game the changes didn't take place. Also the profile thing doesn't work. Can't create or delete a profile. And the previews of already completed projects doesn't show the bridges I build. The cracked version however did do all those things. At least now I have payed for playing the cracked version back in the day. I don't recommend buying this game on steam. Best look for the old DVD version somewhere. But for this little money I will still enjoy this game despite looking like 240p.\n\nA little addition. The game doesn't save anything. So when i close the game and start it the next day i have to redo al the previous bridges i already passed. How can this steam version of the game be even worse than the original ? Gonna look if i can download this game somewhere else cause this is just unplayable. It's becoming a trend here on steam. Same with Saint Row 4. Can't play it anymore. And steam does nothing about it. No more games on steam for me !","timestamp_created":1600231817,"timestamp_updated":1600418528,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526315808296203613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsJeY0PQCda2PogI="}
