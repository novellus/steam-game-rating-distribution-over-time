      down every single door you come across, regardless of how unlocked they might
      be.<br></li><li>Some doors will be too strong to kick down. That's why you gotta

      \ world, listening to its excellent soundtrack, meeting its quirky inhabitants\
      \ and battling weird foes. An RPG adventure that\u2019s more about having fun\
      \ than grinding and stats.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.alphabetagamer.com/deathbulge-battle-of-the-bands-kickstarter-demo/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Alpha Beta Gamer</a><br><br>\u201CThe\
      \ Deathbulge demo feels a bit like Double Fine\u2019s earlier RPGs like Costume\
      \ Quest, plus a dash of Brutal Legend and a whimsical sense of humour. This\
      \ is heavy metal at its silliest.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/deathbulge-battle-of-the-bands/\"\
