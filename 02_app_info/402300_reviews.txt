But it's addictive and I've had a lot of fun with it. There's strategy in creating a dungeon that not only is inviting to adventurers, but snuffs out anyone who gets too far.\n\nI don't want to oversell DM ZV. It's really not all that deep, and likely I'll play it furiously for a few days then never pick it up again. But it's super cheap and worth what I paid for it.","timestamp_created":1588460458,"timestamp_updated":1588475311,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ubag7PECd66ThQI="}
