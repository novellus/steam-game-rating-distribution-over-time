    review: SCAM ALERT. Got the "game" almost as soon as it came out, I was really
      excited about it. Nothing happened at all for a while. Then I thought I'd check
      it out again after a few months to see what was new and worse, this time it
      asked me to sign in / register and my account didn't work anymore. I tried to
      make a new one but it's not possible anymore. The website has been completely
      abandoned and their forums (which have like 30 legit posts from the first month
      it came out) and taken over by spammers and scammers. I asked Steam for a refund
      like a month ago but it was too late already since I've had this "game" for
      a year now.
