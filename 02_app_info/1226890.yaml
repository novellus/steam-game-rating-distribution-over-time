    developer_response: Hello, I'm sorry to hear you had a bad experience with Stellaxy.
      I am happy to let you know that the issues you have experienced were fixed back
      in July. I take bugs very seriously and fix them asap when they are reported.
      Unfortunately, this issue was not reported until after your review (We got the
      first report on July 6th, and fixed it on July 9th). Thank you for your review.

    review: I really wanted to like this and DID enjoy playing for an hour or so through
      the tutorial quests. Unfortunately, the final tutorial quest is to save your
      game and every time I tried the game crashed without warning or log. Sorry,
      I'm not going to research fixes for a simple indie game like this.  I took my
      $5 back and let me know when it works.
