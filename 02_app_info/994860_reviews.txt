It has things that I really liked, like having to be careful to reload the gun or the damn barbed wire. The graphics, reminiscent of a GB, is very nice too, and the music and sound effects are great.\nFully recommended, you don't even have to wait for a price reduction, it is very cheap.\n8/10\n\nHey, if this review has been useful to you, you could follow me on:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/38997970/","timestamp_created":1601609641,"timestamp_updated":1605403109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60000002384185791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46Oze5PUCd42ppQI="}
