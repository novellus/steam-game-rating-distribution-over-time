This makes them vastly worse at handling large mobs, but slightly better at fighting single targets.\n-The gatling gun does 15 damage per shot instead of 10 and comes with 200 more bullets, making it far superior for extended fights.\n-Walking and turning speeds are noticably increased.\nIronically, the standard version is the better choice for most underground missions. However, if you want a vehicle with a great ammo count and low reload cost, the gold coat does well on many surface missions. Just don't expet it to take hits.","timestamp_created":1547452371,"timestamp_updated":1547452371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.621850132942199707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g6rWpegCeKWruAE="}
