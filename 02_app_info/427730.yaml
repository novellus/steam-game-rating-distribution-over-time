      1 on 1 video game featuring a clueless father attempting to prevent his infant
      son from certain death.<h2 class="bb_tag">Current Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>
      A beautiful home for you to watch over your son in<br></li><li> Physics based
      game play allowing you to move small objects as you please<br></li><li> Beautiful
      compositions to be played on your baby''s piano<br></li><li> Two unique character
      types to play as<br></li><li> Randomized locations of crucial items<br></li><li>
      Awesome power ups for being able to do chores<br></li><li> Available for PC,
      Mac and Linux/Steam OS</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">The Characters</h2>Who''s
      Your Daddy features two different characters to play as, the daddy and the baby.<h2
      class="bb_tag"> Daddy</h2>The daddy''s goal is to prevent the baby from dying.
      He has a number of items that can be found inside the house to help him complete
      this task such as:<br><ul class="bb_ul"> <li> Power Outlet Covers<br></li><li>
      Cabinet Locks<br></li><li> Pills</li></ul>The father player also has the option
      to do various chores around the house, such as cleaning up toys or changing
      a smoke alarm battery. Doing these side activities rewards the father player
      with a power up to help him watch over his son. Some examples of these are:<br><ul
      class="bb_ul"> <li> Peek-A-Boo: Makes the daddy invisible<br></li><li> Bat Dad:
      Daddy can see baby''s health and location through walls<br></li><li> Say Momma:
      Daddy can see the location of important objects through walls</li></ul>The daddy
      player faces a number of challenges, due to needing the knowledge of how to
      approach any danger his baby may be in. He needs to be alert, fast moving and
      prepared for anything if he wants to keep his son safe.<h2 class="bb_tag">Baby</h2>The
      baby''s goal is to take his own life using whatever objects within the house
      he can get his little hands on. This includes actions such as:<br><ul class="bb_ul">
      <li> Shoving forks into power outlets<br></li><li> Chugging various cleaning
      products<br></li><li> Scuba diving unsupervised in the tub</li></ul> The baby
      player has minimal responsibility and this allows for a simple, yet erratic
      play style.'
