If possible\nIts the horn on the has chirping sounds from sounds what to be a bird at the end of the horn end sound.\nIt's only noticeable when the world is quite and when the train engine is shut down...\nYou can hear the chirping sound from the ending of the horn sound. from outside the vehicle and within the cab you can still hear the chirping sound...\nCan that be fixed please? And maybe a more realistic horn by any chance? or just a quick fix of the horn? I would be happy if you devs of this game can fix that weird sound issue... ( It only needs a quick adjustment in the audio )\nAnyways this is a nice train and love using this vehicle but has a strange issue with the train horn. mainly a audio issue that needs to be readjusted... If possible.\nAnyways love this train and would recommend this to other people looking for a Amtrak train to drive or any other train.\nIt just has a minor issue with the train horn with hearing birds chirping in the end of the horn... Good train just needs some horn adjustment in the horn audio!","timestamp_created":1609558879,"timestamp_updated":1609558879,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4se3L4PYCfKrNvwI="}
