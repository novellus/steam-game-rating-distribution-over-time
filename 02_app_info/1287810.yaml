    review: With over 60 hours of playtime this rpg is fantastic, and a dev that not
      only responds quickly but does updates immediately to make the game better as
      he listens to players feedback. The quick battles, the areas to explore, the
      quests, the challenge, all the characters in the party with useful skills, the
      huge amount of creatures and bosses, so many things to do and find, it never
      ends.  The use of scrolls to teleport where you have have already been and ships
      and boats to aid in travel adds fun and speed to the vast world to explore.
      Searching everywhere will yield important items that are used to get better
      weapons/armor/items.  There are also interesting puzzles to solve and rewards
      for finding many secret locations. An arena to get better equipment and a house
      you buy to build up with property that also adds goodies. This game has it all,.
      Highly recommended to all rpgers!
