    review: "WOW! Just like the Arcade back in the day. I really can recommend this\
      \ game so far. There are issues I haven't looked into and I'm not too wild about\
      \ the lack of full screen (or maybe I played first now I can look for a full\
      \ screen fix if any). \n\nI really like the music, filled with all the 90's\
      \ goodness the game has to offer. I really enjoyed that time because it was\
      \ a TRUE Renaissance for the Shooter genre. Some people were getting burned\
      \ out and it wasn't quite as possible and for a time we had REAL GEMS released\
      \ in the genre like Lightning Force (Thunderforce 4 - BEST Music in a Shooter\
      \ EVER), M.U.S.H.A (An UTTER Surprise when it came out and an INSTANT CLASSIC),\
      \ Eliminate Down (UNDERAPPRECIATED Japanese Mega Drive GEM - REALLY Expensive\
      \ too), Axelray/Axelay (AWESOME shooter - Top 5 BEST SNES Shooters EVER), STARFOX\
      \ (OBVIOUSLY), R-Type 3, Space MegaForce (The Most Seriously UNDERAPPRECIATED\
      \ Shooter EVER on ANY System - SNES), The PS1 and Sega Saturn classics, the\
      \ 90's were an awesome time for shooter fans and this game really brings that\
      \ feeling home again.  \n\nBack to the game, the graphics are nice and sharp,\
      \ the music is EXCELLENT. There seems to be ZERO slowdown or lag but I have\
      \ only played single player, I have not tried Co-Op yet. It controls very well\
      \ using an X-Box 360 controller. I have not tried the keyboard like I normally\
      \ do but I'll look into it. The extra fighters are appreciated and every thing\
      \ from the arcade is there. Overall the game is a SOLID 8 to 9 for me. It is\
      \ well worth buying it RIGHT NOW during the sale. At the current sale price\
      \ you can't really lose on this purchase!"
