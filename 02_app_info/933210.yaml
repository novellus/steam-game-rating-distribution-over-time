      of a world nearing its end. From Kitty Island to the City of Cyclopia with its
      weird enslaved citizens through a huge comet-struck desert into the deepest
      pits of Darkside, Kittey''s big journey may lead to some uncomfortable truths.<br><br>But,

    review: "This game has surprised me in so many ways. Before the review I will\
      \ not pander to nostalgia because this game does not do the typical \"oh hey\
      \ i'm based on a retro game\" cliche. It rises above that norm because it strives\
      \ to be better then games like \"A Hat in Time\" and \"Yooka-Laylee\".\n\nPRESENTATION\
      \ -----\n\nThe game presents itself as an open world 3D platformer collectathon.\
      \ And this is where the game truly shines, the levels feel massive with detailed\
      \ purpose. Each area feels as if the developer thought out how to go about traversing\
      \ them in fresh and cool ways, In some ways I feel the presentation of this\
      \ game outshines the big boys that pander to nostalgia like \"A Hat in Time\"\
      . The game's atmosphere feels dreary and original, with an emphasis on a more\
      \ adult looking word.  The game isn't without humor though, as the characters\
      \ do crack well placed jokes. Overall the constant changing level design keeps\
      \ the experience truly fresh without nostalgia pandering.\n\nMECHANICS -----\n\
      \nThe game works on a progressive mechanic system, meaning the game always changes\
      \ how it plays. Examples of this would be the desert level introducing a roll\
      \ a ball mechanic and the castle towers stage throwing in shrinking/expanding\
      \ platforms into the mix. The core mechanics are very solid for the playable\
      \ character. Including stuff like gliding,power glove, and gravity glove. Each\
      \ of the core mechanics are implemented everywhere so it gives you a sense of\
      \ skill. Currency upgrades play a role as well. Coins you can use to purchase\
      \ health and offensive upgrades, as well as item maps for each of the levels\
      \ to find hidden objects. The main mechanic of the game is collecting \"Hearts\"\
      \  they are used to progress at various points in the story. So the game is\
      \ chocked full of cool ideas and executions that will make even genre veterans\
      \ happy and surprised by them all, it even switches to \"2D\" in certain segments\
      \ to freshen it up yet again.\n\nSTORY -----\n\nWhile the story does not reinvent\
      \ the wheel, I feel it flows pretty well. You play as a bipedal talking cat\
      \ that likes to eat and dream. One day he has a strange dream that compels him\
      \ and his friends to literally save the world. The cast of quirky and likable\
      \ characters really helps this game progress at a rate that doesn't feel rushed\
      \ or dragging in any way.  And the humor while childish, fits the narrative\
      \ well. \n\nLENGTH -----\n\nNow this is where the game is worth the selling\
      \ price. The game is VERY long, Longer than even games like Yooka-Laylee and\
      \ A Hat in Time. Taking a glance at the level status menu shows around 60 Levels\
      \ each massive and full of things to do. Even after the lengthy campaign is\
      \ tons of stuff to do, like finding the last of the coins and hearts. You will\
      \ always find yourself looking in every nook and cranny for objects you missed\
      \ during the main campaign. In some ways the length is on par with some triple\
      \ A games.\n\nCLOSING -----\n\nThis is a great example of what the 3D Platformer\
      \ genre SHOULD be doing. Instead of pandering to what has been done, try NEW\
      \ things.\n\nAnd you know what I think this game has done just that.\n\nWith\
      \ that said for 10 bucks I can honestly say this game has defied my expectations\
      \ in a fresh and almost exhilarating way. \n\nAnd I think that's this genre\
      \ needs more then anything."
