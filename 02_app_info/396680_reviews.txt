If you expect flying, trading and shooting, then you might not like the game.\nThis is more of a ... a ... political simulator? ... private detective simulator? ... trading simulator? ... relationships simulator?\n\nThis game is unique and extremely ambitious. The game is challenging to understand, as it is hard to communicate the mechanics of the game properly. I think the idea is well done, but the difficulty of presenting the system makes the game look borring. At this point I can't imagine how it could be done better. \nIf you get used to the system it is quite enjoyable.\n\nI have spent about 7 hours just talking with NPC in this game, working on my career and making friends, I bought a space ship and never used it.\n\nI can't offer pros and cons as this game is incomparable. Except that from Steam page it appears like typical space trade/fighter sim, and it is not that.\n","timestamp_created":1592044081,"timestamp_updated":1592044081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.594815254211425781","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49pnO1vICc8jhjQI="}
