We bought it when it was still under development, but since then a whole lot has happened and the game runs much more smoothly now, with fewer glitches.\nThe concept is also great - a bit of hidden objects, combined with some puzzle solving, combined with a bit of shoot 'em up action, all set in very beautiful environments.\nThis is also one of the few games where your character is a full person, not just a floating head and hands. My wife is 4'11\" in real life, and in the game she actually feels the right height in relation to me, being 6'1\", thanks to the pregame height sync. The female character is very pretty, and according to my wife, the male character is quite handsome too, all of which gives the game a lovely dream-like feel that I don't get from any of the other 20+ VR games I own.\nThe story line seems rather intriguing, but we haven't quite reached the end yet as we keep running out of time, which also makes it more exciting.\nThe only negatives are that here and there, there are still a few glitches with the one weapon (magic wand, which sometimes goes flying off the handle, literally!) but other than that it's just really good fun for when you're neither in the mood for all-out action, nor just sitting on the couch, but instead just a nice romp in a beautiful world with good puzzles that get progressively more difficult.","timestamp_created":1601329489,"timestamp_updated":1601329489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4xpyr6/QCd8fbpAI="}
