    review: 'You control two characters at once, avoiding the centre and trying to
      knock the other player''s team inwards. The gameplay changes slightly once you
      become infected, since you have to avoid yourself and others who are infected,
      yet also chase the opposite team making for quite a challenging game.

      Casual couch game taking advantage of the Steam Remote Play, yet still allows
      for single player against an AI, overall it is a fun game you can play with
      friends and it is good to see the developer adding new features.'
