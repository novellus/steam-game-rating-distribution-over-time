    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Mystery Trackers: The Void" Collector''s Edition is a Hidden Object Puzzle
      Adventure game that was developed by Elephant Games and published by Big Fish
      Games Studio.


      "The Void" is the first episode of "Mystery Trackers."


      Since this is a collector''s edition game, it comes with extra features that
      are not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visual for the game is nicely done. The visuals can
      be adjusted in the game''s option menu. Please do note that this is an old game,
      it might not play well on wide screen monitors in full screen mode; due to the
      game''s format.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are no game difficulty modes to choose from.


      The notebook keeps tracks of the progression in the game. Such as story events
      and clues.


      There is no interactive map in the game. The player has to remember where to
      go in the game.


      There is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in
      place. The inventory panel is stationary.


      The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Traditional word lists; Find
      "x" amount items. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no
      interaction.


      The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of
      them.


      There are twelve different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the
      game. All the achievements do come with some requirements that need to be completed
      in order for them to be unlocked. These are in-game achievements only.


      Since this is a collector''s edition game, there is a bonus chapter, but it
      can be accessed only after the main story is completed.


      Miscellaneous


      There are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Game Strategy Guide; Screen
      Saver; Soundtracks; Concept Art and Wallpapers. Most of these extra features
      can be accessed only after the entire game is completed.


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
