If you enjoy surreal, bizarre video games like Hylics, Cube Gothic or Zeno Clash, this is for you. This game is playable vomit.\n\nIt looks and sounds deliciously abrasive, with low res textures and disgusting colors at every turn. Your health indicator takes up an entire quarter of your screen. You will die quickly and often. You will often be confused. The font is almost unreadable. The default control binds are counter-intuitive. Once you submit and accept, you will only know a hunger for murder and flesh.\n\nMy only complaints are unstable framerates and that the price tag is a bit steep at $20. Can't wait to see how this game develops during early access.\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1610051440,"timestamp_updated":1610051440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw2Omi7/YCdJWvwQI="}
