      school. She doesn't have many friends. Her home is not as safe as a home should
      be, especially since her adopted older sibling Ash has moved out. Despite everything,
      she is a cheerful girl with an upbeat and caring personality. At least until
      she realized she is being followed - by an individual, and an organization.

      safe.<br><br>She is to move in with Ash in the friendly Twin Elms Apartments,

    review: "This is the BEST VR horror game to date and easily the scariest as well.\
      \  I have played a LOT of horror games in VR (and not in VR) and this one has\
      \ scared me and made me uneasy more than any other game I think I have ever\
      \ played.  It is far from just a bunch of jump scares.  The game plays a little\
      \ bit like an old school horror game (think silent hill or resident evil). \
      \ The biggest difference that this game has from those older games is how much\
      \ depth this game has in terms of playstyle.\n\nOne second you're sneaking behind\
      \ a monster and the next you're turning around and running for your life because\
      \ you don't have enough health to get into a fight.  The only reason you don't\
      \ have enough health is cause of the last fight.  \n\nseriously I can't stress\
      \ enough how incredible this game is, I don't know why it isn't more popular.\
      \  don't let the price scare you away either because I'm 5 hours in and still\
      \ only on the first chapter.  \n\nThe devs are also very responsive in their\
      \ discord channel.  You can tell they put a lot of time and effort into this\
      \ game and continue to.  I am looking forward to seeing the rest of the chapters\
      \ for this game as they come out and I already know I wont be disapointed with\
      \ them. \n\nBe warned, this one is NOT for the faint of heart."
