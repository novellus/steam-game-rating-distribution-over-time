    review: "I have a great fondness for casual indie games that I can binge so I\
      \ really wanted to like Heroland. But after a good 4 hours or so I just couldn't\
      \ stand it anymore. \n[list]\n[*] The premise of the game is that you are an\
      \ amusement park tour guide who takes customers on adventures to make them feel\
      \ like heroes. While this is cute, the game still just plays like an ordinary\
      \ idle-RPG. The only difference is that the game constantly bombards you with\
      \ heavy-handed \"jokes\" about how everything is actually fake. \n[*] As a guide,\
      \ you 'collect' customers with their own unique personalities that you can level\
      \ up and become friends with. The main reason that I came to despise the game\
      \ is because there is *so* much dialogue. The characters are cringey and over-the-top\
      \ and they constantly have annoying *unskippable* skits which ruins the flow\
      \ of play. \n[*] Your adventurers fight the enemies by themselves while you\
      \ standby to provide support, e.g. use healing items, change tactic. For the\
      \ most part your team do just fine by themselves and will even keep themselves\
      \ healed up. I pretty much just kept the game on max-speed and stopped to throw\
      \ out a healing potion or two to stop someone dying. Playing slowly is not engaging\
      \ enough but you can't just let the game autoplay or people will die.\n[*] The\
      \ art style is adorable and there are tonnes of collectables and furniture that\
      \ you can collect to decorate your room.\n[/list]\n\nI would have happily kept\
      \ Heroland playing in the background to collect all the cute plushies and furniture,\
      \ but the constant unskippable dialogue drove me mad. There's also not enough\
      \ to do during combat to be fun but it still needs you to press a button every\
      \ now and then to stop people dying so you still have to pay attention. Worst\
      \ of both worlds."
