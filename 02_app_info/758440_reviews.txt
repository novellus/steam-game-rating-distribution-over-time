I was expecting it since I’ve read about it a year ago. Content is poor for my taste. It's not bad but I really can’t recommend it as it is. I finished it in 5 hours. Story is basic. Very repetitive gameplay. It funny but very old fashioned. I hope the free update from the developer could add the fun that was missed along the way.\n","timestamp_created":1582468290,"timestamp_updated":1582468290,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456330478191375732","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3bqdufACfOqP9AE="}
