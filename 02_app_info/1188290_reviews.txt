Take this whole review with a grain of salt, as we're still talking to each other and while my understanding of the game evolves.  [/b]\nI couldn't complete this one.  I had four big complaints.  The first is that I had no idea where to go.  I mean that in several senses.  For instance, I often had no idea that I could interact with an object until I tried.  This means that I would frequently be rubbing against walls trying to figure out what I was supposed to interact with.  This ties into my second complaint, which is that there are multiple areas where you can go out side the map or get stuck on things.  Even if I could figure out what to interact with, I got to the hotel, and I had several interactable items that required some prerequisite.  I could not figure out where they were.  I would have searched more, but then I ran into my third complaint, which is the combat.  Despite using WASD controls, in order to aim, you hold shift and aim 360 degrees with the mouse.  You still need to have the same horizontal or vertical coordinate as the enemy, and I cannot tell you how janky that feels.  It was unbearable.  Final complaint: unless I'm missing something, there's no way to hit escape and bring up a \"load\" screen to load a prior save.  This means you basically are forced to close the game if you want to try and return to an earlier save to conserve ammo or something.  I noticed pressing F1 brought up a key rebinding menu, but I couldn't tell what it was trying to tell me.  That definitely needs work.  I got so impatient I loaded the wrong save, and then I had to close the game and reopen it.  When you're streaming over discord, that's a real annoyance.  The thing that sucks is that the story was really good.  I'm <120 minutes, so I'm refunding.","timestamp_created":1604902757,"timestamp_updated":1604976620,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.434782594442367554","comment_count":15,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1604938002,"developer_response":"That's a shame. You can also hold mouse right in order to aim as well, it was in the tutorial stage near the beginning. \n\nAll interactable items have a shining effect placed on them, the only objects that don't have a shining effect are doors. I'll look into the hotel stage and the map errors you've raised though."}],"cursor":"AoJwnvaD2PUCdMulrQI="}
