    review: I don't normally post reviews for games, but this is incredibly short
      and not really worth the money. I'm glad I got it on sale. The romance is too
      quick and seems almost random. The art style is awkward and not always consistent.
      If you want something to read in one sitting, this is for you, but not if you're
      into otome games.
