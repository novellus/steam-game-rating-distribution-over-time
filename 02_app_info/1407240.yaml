    review: "I really wanted to like this game. The concept is really cool. Fly a\
      \ rocket and land it back on another pad. However it seems the developers never\
      \ heard of physics. This rocket is incontrollable, they seem to be doing something\
      \ very weird with the momentum of the rocket. It is easier to fly a rocket and\
      \ land it on another planet in Kerbal than it is to just fly this rocket around\
      \ the corner. \nIt is really sad because this game has so much potential. I\
      \ really hope the developers fix it."
