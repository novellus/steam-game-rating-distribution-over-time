    review: I liked the detective theme and the twist at the end (the second end after
      the bonus part). I think it's worth the money and time spent playing it. Only
      thing I didn't like was that it ran slowly. Click on something . . . and wait.
      My computer more than meets the preferred requirements so I think the game is
      just slow.
