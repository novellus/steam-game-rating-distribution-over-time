The controls. somehow when playing with WSAD or arrow keys sometimes it reverses my controls so that  iaccidently go up instead of going down etc.\n\n2. Its a bit laggy when it comes to rendering music inside the game. there are certain points of the game where it will lag freezing both pads but not the ball, so your forced to stay still and let the ball score on either side.\n\noverall its a fun game, but im sure this has been said before, it needs some tweaking.\n","timestamp_created":1485399518,"timestamp_updated":1485399518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525316417217254639","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws72t7NkCecHBcA=="}
