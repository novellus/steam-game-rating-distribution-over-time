    developer_response: "Hi there. Sorry to hear that you did not enjoy the game.\
      \ Please understand that there are no centralised servers, and it is up to players\
      \ to host their own games, so your experience with high latency might improve\
      \ if you or a friend host (which uses Steam lobbies so no technical setup is\
      \ required).\n\nIf you have the time, I'd appreciate any information you have\
      \ about the crashes, issues, or bugs you experienced, so I can fix it immediately.\
      \ There is a support link on the ProtoMasons website, or a bug forum in the\
      \ community hub.\n\nI hope you can consider revisiting the project in the future.\
      \ Thanks for the feedback.\n\n-----\n\nUPDATE JAN 2018:    I understand that\
      \ you have updated your review to give some opinions and feedback regarding\
      \ specific issues. Thank you for this.\n\nIn response to this review, we introduced\
      \ new game music and a more consistent UI in version 1.0.4, and intend to continue\
      \ improving the interface of minigames in the short future. This update also\
      \ included a new multiplayer minigame and is the beginning of a focus to add\
      \ more generalised game features to keep things fun and interesting when you\
      \ are playing alone or with a friend. \n\nA number of bugs have been fixed since\
      \ this review, including an issue that related to the desync of player movement,\
      \ which sounds like the cause of your complaint regarding latency. ProtoMasons\
      \ was specially designed to work well under high latency environments (200 -\
      \ 400 ping) and it is a focus to continue improving this so desynchronisation\
      \ is avoided. Thank you for helping identify this bug."

    review: "Hey, I'm here to rewrite my review. I had to summarize things because\
      \ it was late at night for me and I needed to get some sleep for my college\
      \ exams the next day.\n\nThis game isn't bad. I'm actually impressed with the\
      \ work in this game for only having 1 main developer. So I'll be going more\
      \ into detail about what I liked, disliked and somethings that I think should\
      \ be worked on.\n\n---\nSome of the things I really enjoyed are...\n\n  1) The\
      \ mining minigame was pretty fun and enjoyable. I can tell you put a lot of\
      \ thought into it. And props to you on adding an anti-afk feature.\n\n  2) The\
      \ user-created marketing feature is great but a tad bit confusing. I couldn't\
      \ find out how to sell my own things on the market even after creating my own\
      \ business.\n\n  3) The amount of interaction in this game was very enlightening.\
      \ Being able to walk up to a piano, television or chair and being able to either\
      \ play it, turn it on or sit on it.\n\n---\nSome of the things I disliked are...\n\
      \n  1) The music in this game sounds kind of child-like and repetitive as if\
      \ someone is constantly playing the xylophone around me. A game like this should\
      \ try to have music that you can listen to without growing tired of it or getting\
      \ annoyed by it.\n\n  2) The sound in the game whenever text is being written\
      \ is too loud and clunky. I found myself trying to skip through all the text\
      \ sound by holding space because I disliked the sound that much.\n\n  3) I fealt\
      \ like I had no purpose in the game after about 20-30 minutes. From what I could\
      \ tell, There were no real goals that I had in mind that I could work towards\
      \ completing. Hopefully as time goes by however, Your future content that you\
      \ add will change this.\n\n---\nSome of the things I think should be worked\
      \ on are...\n\n  1) The UI in this game isn't very stream-lined and consistent\
      \ with a theme. The colors and fonts seem varied.\n\n  2) While trying to play\
      \ with my friend on his server, my own server or your own server (Jargoon),\
      \ We couldn't see each other and there was some consistent latency across the\
      \ board. But I can't really blame you for that.\n\n  3) I crashed about 3 times\
      \ in the hour that I played. I can't tell you exactly what the error was off\
      \ the top of my head because it's been a couple days. So I apologize for not\
      \ being able to help you identify this problem.\n\n---\nTo summarize my experience,\
      \ This game is fun however its small and partially buggy. I don't think a game\
      \ like this should be worth $14.99 USD in it's current state especially since\
      \ it's a new release, early-access game with little to no players online. You\
      \ could compare the price of this game to something like Garry's Mod which is\
      \ 2/3rds the price with a stable client with more content and a larger playerbase.\
      \ I would probably buy and keep this game if it was $4.99.\n\nI hope the information\
      \ I've provided assists you in your development of this game."
