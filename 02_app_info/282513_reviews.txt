Just as in Corporate Lockdown, however, there's very little in terms of story, though the maps are loosely connected (Lingard must acquire medical supplies); and again, other than different starting items and blueprints, the gameplay for the new character remains the same.\n\nJust as Corporate Lockdown, I recommend getting this on a sale.","timestamp_created":1605793011,"timestamp_updated":1605793011,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530201315879821777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ405qu8PUCeOylrwI="}
