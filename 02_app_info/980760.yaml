    about_the_game: "Good Color helps you choose a good color.  It helps you do so\
      \ in many different ways.  Primarily it uses color wheel theory to let you a\
      \ pick a color or colors which &quot;go with&quot; one or more starting colors.\
      \  Other ways that it helps you choose a color is by:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1)Letting\
      \ you import a JPEG photo from your cell phone and pick a color from that photo.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n2)Providing a list of well-known and not-very-well-known colors\
      \ that you can select.  Do you know you must use 'mauve' or 'indigo' but you\
      \ don't really know what those colors are?  Good Color provides a long list\
      \ of colors you can add to your theme by just one click.  The name of these\
      \ colors is on the click button AND the color of the button is the color that\
      \ matches the name.  This means you can search through this list of color names\
      \ by text (looking for a certain word)  or you can just look at all the colors\
      \ and pick the one you want.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3)Letting you use various color\
      \ models to set a color.  RGB, HSV, HSL, CMY, YIQ, and YUV color models are\
      \ supported.  Perhaps you know you must use some certain color and but you only\
      \ have the numeric values for that color in one model (in HSV perhaps).  Good\
      \ Color lets you easily switch between all these color models.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\n4)Providing a large list of color themes which you can use to create\
      \ your own theme.  These themes have been confirmed by online voting to be popular.\
      \  You can look through this list of themes and pick out one you like.  When\
      \ you choose your first color for your theme, Good Color will find the two popular\
      \ themes which most closely match your initial color (and helps you integrate\
      \ such a matched theme with your selected first color).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      5)Letting you change the color wheel being used.  You can slightly or greatly\
      \ modify the definition of the color wheel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n6)Supporting\
      \ 24 foreign languages.  In Good Color you can change the foreign language in\
      \ which the program's commands are displayed.  You can switch from English to\
      \ Spanish for example.  You can also see the documentation in whatever foreign\
      \ language you prefer.  This foreign language capability does NOT use the locale\
      \ you have set on your computer.  This lets you keep your locale for your computer\
      \ set to whatever language you normally prefer yet use Good Color in some other\
      \ language without interfering with your base locale setting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \n7)Allows you to set 1 or more base colors and then use color wheel theory\
      \ to choose 1 or more additional colors.  For example, if you have two colors\
      \ you must use yet you need 2 more colors Good Color will use color theory to\
      \ choose the remaining 2 colors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGood Color can be used to\
      \ choose a good matching color whenever you need to choose colors.  You could\
      \ be playing a game and trying to select good matching colors for your skins.\
      \  You could be a game designer trying to find colors which your customers will\
      \ like.  You could be a video artist trying to select colors that you yourself\
      \ like.  You could be painting your house, choosing the color of your new car,\
      \ choosing the color of your next dress, or choosing the color of your makeup.\
      \  You can always choose to select a color yourself that you think is a good\
      \ match but if you want to use an accepted method of color choice then you use\
      \ the color wheel and Good Color helps you use the color wheel.  Are you someone\
      \ who has no idea what is a good matching color?  Let Good Color help you choose."
