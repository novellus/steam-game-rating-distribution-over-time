    review: 'Short Review: I wanted this, like, four years ago...


      Standard Review:


      It''s an excellent graphics asset pack, well made, and...it goes well with any
      modern/futuristic game, or even one that falls in line with apocalyptic gameplay.
      Fact is, if you''re looking for the best modern/futuristic/apocalyptic graphics
      asset pack, then this here is right up your alley. However...


      One thing to note is that there''s only the graphics, no readme or other instruction
      files (the readme that it comes with is just the milktoast RM EULA stuffs we
      likely have hundreds of by now), and there''s no graphics notation files that
      state what each tile is (not common with asset packs though I''ve seen some).
      You''re basically on your own with figuring out what each tile is, and then
      setting passability for each tile manually (at least for B-E since the editor
      tends to auto-assign passability for A tiles). There''s also the layering and
      tiling with some of the tiles that doesn''t completely work together without
      editing, and there''s also the fact that both indoor and outdoor tiles are combined
      together. Whilst possibly convenient, it might be to the end user benefit to
      separate the indoor and outdoor tiles into separate map types.


      All in all, this is an excellent asset pack, and for full price, it is worth
      getting, but if you don''t get this when it is on sale, then you''re an ignoramus.
      I did get it on sale, yes, and it was worth the purchase. Sweet Mercy.


      Addendum:

      If you''re going to use this, it does require editing.


      Tileset B has it arranged so that the top-left part of the stairset is in a
      place that is designed to always be blank, and set above character, for that
      tile is tile zero. If one tries to set the tiles up in a way that would make
      sense with the graphic, you won''t be able to move properly with it.


      I still recommend this, but the tileset absolutely must be edited from the get
      go, else it''s partially unusable at best.


      It''s still great, and well-made, no question.'
