It is a game that dosent take itself too seriously so hopefuly you are prepared for some humor :)\n\nit has 3 player local coop and online as well\n\nI highly recommend to try, If you dont like you can always refund with less then 2 hours played within 2 weeks so it is not risky thing to give a go.","timestamp_created":1607142277,"timestamp_updated":1607142434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525134801864624023","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzezJmPYCcc+0twI="}
