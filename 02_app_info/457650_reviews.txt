It's a good educational app. You get a nice narrated tour of Stonehenge. I definitely learned some things that I didn't know before about this ancient monument.\n\nYou even have your own sandbox where you can change stuff like the time of day or night, the angle of the sun, fog, or you can change the colors of the stones, or add your own. You can listen to your own music while you just chill. You can even fly around and check it out from different angles. You can add your own decorations such as butterflies or your own campfire. \n\nI did find the controls and the UI to be a little on the clunky side. You can only teleport or move forward in the direction your controller is facing. You cannot smooth turn or snap turn. The game ran smoothly. I did not experience any crashes unlike some of the negative reviews.\n\n[b]Rate 6/10. Good for what it is. I know there are free apps that are better than the narrated tour here, but this is good for what it is. I got it on sale for less than $4 USD and I think it's a steal at that price.
