    review: 'The game itself is about as basic as you can imagine.  Top down block
      pusher where you control a square and you push other squares and occasionally
      circles; barely a step above having no graphics at all.  That being said, the
      gameplay, the level design and overall mechanics are pretty competent.


      160 ''Standard'' levels and a handful more ''Bonus'' levels. Even the ''Simple''
      levels require some thought and foresight to solving them.  New mechanics and
      objects are introduced every few levels to keep things fresh, though none of
      them are particularly unique or groundbreaking.  It''s worth a buck or two if
      you''re looking for something like Chip''s Challenge with a little more thinking,
      a little less reflex, and an equal amount of graphical fidelity.'
