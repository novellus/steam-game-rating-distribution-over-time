    review: 'CAVEAT: Recommended to achievement hunters. You might find this little
      thing kind of, well, small and lacklustre. It''s cute, sure, but it really doesn''t
      provide that much besides an easy 5 achievements. The dev was very nice and
      responsive, and that''s a nice thing to see, so as long as you know why you''re
      getting it, I give it a thumbs up.'
