    review: This is one of my favorite games for VR.  Most of the full-length games
      don't suspend disbelief like some of the minigames, and this suspension is really
      the magic of VR!  Of the dozens of VR games I own, Robo Recall is probably the
      best.  Super VR Trainer is the second best (tied maybe with Beat Saber?).  They
      are my go-to games when showing off the system.
