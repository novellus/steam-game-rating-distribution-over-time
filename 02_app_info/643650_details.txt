Conspiracies and political intrigue endanger the lives of Aliena the noblewoman, Jack the outlaw-turned-mason, Philip the monk and their hometown of Kingsbridge. Will faith and love prevail in the face of violent attacks, ruthless kings and greedy bishops? <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe soundtrack, composed by Tilo Alpermann, reflects these themes: darkness and violence, longing and loss, faith and passion. Tilo Alpermann’s composition wonderfully orchestrated by the FilmHarmonic Orchestra in Prague is a piece of art retelling the story of 'The Pillars of the Earth' without words and visuals. A wonderful achievement.","about_the_game":"‘The Pillars of the Earth’ tells the story about the construction of a cathedral in 12th century England – an almost impossible undertaking in a time of war and great despair.
