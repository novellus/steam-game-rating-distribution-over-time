However, I was very pleasantly surprised. I can confidently say this is one of the most atmospheric point-and-click games I have played in a long time, including the creepiest. \nThe sound design is fantastic in almost every scene, making the paranormal situations downright terrifying with their realistic ambience and very well done ghost voices (no cheap BOOs or cheesy lines here!). This game's audio scares you not in a screaming blood-murder way, but in the chill-down-your-back, always-looking-over-your-shoulder-for-shadow-people way that is just great, especially with headphones. Big applause on that piece.\nThe art design and graphics of the game are great as well for a 2-D point-and-click, mixing photography and pixel animation surprisingly well, to the point where you almost forget the characters are not \"in\" the background. The imagery used for the different hauntings were also excellent, with plenty of scenes making me nervous or unnerved with the subtle approaches they took. Luckily, there's little to no jumpscares, so everything relies on creep-factor (which is always a big PLUS in my book if done correctly). A few more claps for the game!\nThe story and lore are interesting and enthralling. While I'm not versed in the actual history of the actual town of Saxton, England, so I can't say if the history in this game is real or imagined, the story and history presented in this game is well laid and well written, providing a background that is full of mystery, legend, and powers beyond what we can even start to guess at. It's all fascinating and actually makes you want to slow down and learn about everything you can, instead of giving you mindless facts that have no reason to hold your interest. The fact that you're sometimes not even sure what year you're in sets a great mood and extra layer of mystery to the story. The characters are also interesting and engaging, with some backstories to them as well (with some mysteries left to them still). More claps to you.\nNow, the \"eh, it's okay\" parts of the game were the puzzles and the voice acting. Most of the puzzles are either too easy or the solutions were a bit too hidden/nonsensical. The bit with the cat took me forever to figure out and I still don't know why that solution worked. There was also a puzzle that relied on knowing how to identify music notes by ear, which makes the puzzle impossible for non-musicians like me. As for the voice acting, for most of the game, it's alright. Not the best, but definitely not the worst. Also, the worst was from our main protagonist at the start of the beginning, but her got better as the game went on. \nAs for the cons of the game, there are only a few from me. The biggest is the WALKING. While I appreciate being able to double-click to move to the next scene quickly, when I have to go across the whole map to get where I need to go (or think I need to go, that's always great when I'm wrong), waiting for my character to walk into frame for the scene quickly frustrates me. The fact that I have to go through 10+ scenes multiplies that frustration by the same count. A fast-travel function to the main areas of the game at least would have been very welcome. The dialogue is also a bit disappointing, as no response you select affects the game other than moving the story forward when needed (no relationships to build or alternate endings here). However, I can understand if the creator wanted to keep to one ending and just give the player more freedom to their dialogue within of just listening to a whole conversation start to finish. So I'll let that slide. The only other disappoint is the ghost find on the tracks. It looked more like a alpha version of the final product rather than the final product. It's about the only place where the visuals just don't work and looks unimpressive.\n\nAll in all, this is a great game. It has some flaws, as all things do, but this really is a diamond in the rough. I hope to see much of the same or better performance in the sequels!","timestamp_created":1610068903,"timestamp_updated":1610068903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xbjl7/YCeLG2wQI="}
