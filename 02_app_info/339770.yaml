    reviews: "\u201COne thing I absolutely loved about the game though is the music\
      \ that plays during battles. I\u2019m a bit of an RPG nut and I know a good\
      \ RPG battle theme when I hear one and Dark Scavenger is no exception. I sometimes\
      \ left the game running in the background whilst doing other things (such as\
      \ writing this review) and it kept me incredibly entertained throughout.\u201D\

      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Midlife Gamer</a><br><br>\u201CMusically,\
      \ this game is excellent- it has a rather upbeat, techno soundtrack, along with\
      \ some of the coolest boss music of all time. While I don\u2019t think I\u2019\
      ll find myself whistling the themes any time soon, I would recognize most of\
      \ them instantly- and probably be suddenly ready for battle.\u201D<br><a href=\"\

      Rarely do game soundtracks evoke such emotion or feelings. Usually the audio\
      \ for games will suit the subject matter, and that\u2019s as far as it goes.\
      \ But Dark Scavenger does well to evoke the sense of intrusion, of the outsider\
      \ being where they shouldn\u2019t be. From space, to the otherworldy planet,\
      \ to creatures viewing YOU as the alien, to discovering the secrets of the planet\
      \ Didella, the music carries with it that Sci-Fi feel; spooky, yet adventurous.\
      \ Does it make sense to say that the music carries with it the sense of philosophical\
      \ investigation that the story slowly exposes you to?\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://brutalgamer.com/2012/06/13/dark-scavenger-pcmac-review\"\

    review: "Quite the mixed bag, in terms of both genre and quality...with a general\
      \ leaning towards the \"zanier\" end of things. Some very, very cool tracks,\
      \ and some a bit more in-one-ear-and-out-the-other-ish.\n\n   It's a heck of\
      \ a lot of tracks for the price, though, so I'd happily recommend it to anyone\
      \ who enjoys a bit of lo-fi, synthy instrumental goodness that spans a whopping\
      \ variety of moods (including Zappa-esque freak-outs, heartfelt laments, and\
      \ a smattering of metallic riffage for the cranium-bangers out there). Even\
      \ [i]better[/i] value, suffice it to say, at a decent sale price.\n\nVerdict:\
      \ 8/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator\
      \ pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\u200B\
