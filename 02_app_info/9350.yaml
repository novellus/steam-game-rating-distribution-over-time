    about_the_game: 'For a thousand years, three opposing forces have waged war for
      what they believe is true. There can be no room for compromise: their way is
      the only way. Dubbed The Infinite War, this devastating conflict has taken its
      toll on a once-peaceful galaxy and has only served to deepen the hatred between
      the factions. After centuries of struggle, the battle for supremacy has at last
      reached a turning point. Under your strategic command and leadership, will your
      faction reign supreme? Will you be victorious and elevate your race to domination?
      Or will you lead them into the hell of defeat and ultimate extinction?'
