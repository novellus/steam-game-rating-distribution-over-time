The game has multiple endings and branching pathways throughout the game. This visual novel didn't contain any voice acting and while that wasn't an issue for me I know some players are picky about that sort of thing so I figured I would mention it. The game has icons at the bottom of the screen for saving loading and that sort of thing that initially had me confused but fortunately there is a help section that will tell you what the buttons do.  I'm a bit surprised this game hasn't gotten more attention. Hopefully people will read this review and give the game a chance like I did.","timestamp_created":1609718296,"timestamp_updated":1609718296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3P2r5fYCf6iewAI="}
