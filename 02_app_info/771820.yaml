    review: "I purchased this for my children in hopes of expanding their educational.\
      \ Unfortunately, it turned out to be a buggy mess with horrible controls. Purchased\
      \ on launch date, a week, I was hoping the developers would have fixed the bugs\
      \ by now. Joystick controllers will launch your character sideways, frequent\
      \ stuck in the walls and there isnt even a QUIT game option on the main menu!\n\
      \nInteresting concept if it was executed properly, but at this state, it's shovelware\
      \ at it's finest. \n\nSteam refund requested."
