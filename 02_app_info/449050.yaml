    review: When I first saw this game, I thought it would be just another run of
      the mill mmorpg, but after investing over 7,000 hours in this game, I can truly
      say this is one of the best fps experiences Ive had since SMITE. The chracters
      feel so fleshed out and you can really connect with them, which isnt a very
      popular trend in survival games like this. And I mean, for a card game, it really
      does feel like a whole different game to Hearthstone. I truly believe that blizzard
      has taken there company very seriously, and the result are masterpieces like
      this one. So if youre looking for a competitive dungeon crawle with great gameplay,
      I cant recommend a better driving game. 10/10
