I have never played this game and not enjoyed my time spent. Everything about the game is slick, and it the intense environmental thriller/ultra tactical aspect of an FPS is something that scratches a certain itch.\nOn the other hand, this game has been kicked down as many times as you can shake a stick at. Truly, it's sad and disappointing to see what happened to this game, a quick google will show you the trials the devs have been through. At one point, there was literally one person left working on the game, because everyone else quit.\nI can't fault the dev (s) for what has happened, nor do I dread to think what I'd do in the same shoes. All I can say is that this game will probably never be what I want it to be, but it doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the time I got to spend with it - Kind of like an ex.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game, it's truly fun, but it HAS to be noted that this game is basically sold \"as is,\" so don't get your hopes up by any means.","timestamp_created":1609825860,"timestamp_updated":1609825860,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwmqfG6PYCd8LOwAI="}
