    review: 'First. I want to mention that I have not watched the other anime. Nor
      have I went through the VN yet. ( Despite having both.. Backlog on both and
      I admit I do not watch anime or go through vns in any particular order. I just
      go through the stuff when when the mood strikes me. This does make me want to
      go through the VN soon tho.. )


      Now to my view on the anime.


      I am just going to say that.. I really liked this anime. It is a bit dark in
      some aspects so thats going to be a bit of a warrning there. ( I mean like..
      Really dark. ) A decent amount of the story can be predicted if you pay attention
      to what is going on but there was one thing I admit it was.. Umm.. Yea. I did
      not expect something to happen. Now I did think something was due to something
      happening but not in the way it did. ( Yea I know I am being cryptic here but
      I am trying my best to not do any spoilers. )


      At this point all I can really say is. I really enjoyed the anime but it has
      some messed up scenes in it. Due to that I can not recommend it to everyone.
      This anime wont be for everyone. Especially those who can not handle gore or
      traumatic events in anime format. Also if you have a fear of hospitals this
      might just increase that a bit. ( Thankfully I do not but I am going in for
      a major surgery in a few days as of this review.. One that is supposed to take
      several hours and was told I will be in the hospital for at least 1-2 weeks
      if not more. Not the most I have spent in a hospital but still sucks XD )


      Now here is the portion of my review to tell you about Steam''s video player.
      It needs work like I stated in other reviews I have done so far. So please keep
      that in mind. The video portion is also provided by Crunchyroll and I will be
      honest when I say.. I do not know for sure if this is censored or not. Odds
      are it is in some way or another.'
