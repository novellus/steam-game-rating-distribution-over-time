    review: 'The fourth in the series, this game references primarily Celtic-Irish
      fairy lore. We get to meet Oberon and Titania, king and queen of the fairies,
      and learn about the  fairy folk living in our own world, exiled from Fairyland.
      The protagonist is the young granddaughter of a writer with a mysterious connection
      to Fairyland.  She is pitchforked into her grandfather''s (previously unknown)
      role as a human with ties to Faerie after his death, when a witch starts abducting
      the fairies living in the human world.


      Overall:  a solid HOPA game with lots to do, a good bonus chapter, and a moderately
      interesting story ~ 8.5/10


      Pros:

      - lovely visuals/art

      - lots and lots of HO scenes ranging from word lists, to silhouettes, to riddles
      (lots of riddles)

      - a decent number of puzzles, mostly in the lower-middle to upper-middle of
      difficulty (though many are easy if you stop and look at the starting positions)

      - collectibles indicator, fully interactive map, fully integrated Guide

      - full voice acting, mostly good (maybe all good, but I''m not the best judge
      of Irish (quasi-Irish?) accents)

      - the extras include a good bonus chapter, replayable HO scenes (giving in-game
      achievements), and access to the "Bubble Shooter" game (which I never fully
      understood except in its basics); the usual bonus content you''d expect, nicely
      presented


      Cons:

      - the hit box for HO scenes was occasionally too picky, just often enough to
      annoy me a little

      - the HO scenes were well laid out, but sometimes overly complex without clear
      instructions (plus see above)

      - the plot was a little weaker than the first and third games in the series
      (but better than game two); I liked the protagonist''s backstory, but would
      have appreciated more than just glimpses of her own character and reactions

      - toward the end of the game, not being able to use obvious items became irritating
      (I know it''s classic HOPA stuff, but don''t make me walk past two *obvious*
      buckets so that I can use the gourd I''ve been carrying around)

      - unlike in games one and three, I found myself referring to the Guide a couple
      of times: once because an obviously correct solution wasn''t accepted (very
      annoying, and the Guide had the same answer - this turned out to be an actual
      glitch, forcing me to "skip" the puzzles to continue); the second time because
      "what to do next" was too obscure for me

      - on two occasions, I went through and just clicked on everything in my inventory
      looking for what worked; in one case, the "correct" combination was ridiculous
      (and I say that advisedly, since I know the genre)


      This is still a very good game for the genre; if anything, it tries to do too
      much and be too clever with HO scenes, which isn''t usually my complaint. With
      the exception of the second, weaker effort, this whole series has been very
      enjoyable, my criticisms notwithstanding.'
