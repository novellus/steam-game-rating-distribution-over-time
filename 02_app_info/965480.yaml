    about_the_game: "Complete your character design, plot manipulation, and worldbuilding\
      \ all in one place. Designed to be a revolutionary tool for writers to plan\
      \ out their stories, Campfire Pro is the writing software novelists and screenwriters\
      \ need to go from the seed of an idea to a detailed plan that\u2019s ready to\
      \ be executed.<br><br>Character Development: Add characters with essential information\
      \ like name, age, and personality traits. Then flesh out your characters by\
      \ adding backstory, relationships, custom panels, and grouping characters together\
      \ in their respective factions.\u200B Use the Character Arc View to track your\
      \ character's physical and emotional changes in a graphical format. With the\
      \ Relationship View, create family trees and complex relationship webs to have\
      \ a visual representation of your characters' interactions.<br><br>Plot Design:\
      \ Use the powerful Timeline tool to add scenes and other plot events. A straightforward\
      \ drag-and-drop interface allows for easy reorganization and story manipulation.\u200B\
      <br><br>Worldbuilding: Campfire Pro is also a full-featured worldbuilding tool.\
      \ Upload an unlimited number of maps, then add pins for each location. Flesh\
      \ out your locations with history, culture, and politics. Campfire's Encyclopedia\
      \ provides a place to store all other information.<br><br>Campfire strives to\
      \ be <i>flexible</i> and <i>inspiring</i>, providing a variety of features to\
      \ achieve these goals. Each character has their own cork board, which holds\
      \ an unlimited amount of custom panels and images. The Timeline is infinite,\
      \ allowing writers to work with an endless canvas as they add a plethora of\
      \ scenes and events. The World page allows users to upload any number of maps\
      \ and pin locations onto them, creating a concrete, visual resource to geographically\
      \ keep track of the story. Finally, Campfire\u2019s seven themes provide different\
      \ aesthetics to work within, keeping writers inspired regardless of genre. Fantasy\
      \ novelists can expect a medieval-style writing experience, while Sci-Fi writers\
      \ receive a visually high-tech version of Campfire. For writers who don\u2019\
      t want a dramatic theme, the Simple Light and Simple Dark themes allow for a\
      \ plain, distraction-free writing experience.<br><br>We also produce a YouTube\
      \ series on writing, which you can check out here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmBhAk9dCBs\"\

    review: "Excelente programa que me est\xE1 ayudando mucho a la organizaci\xF3\
      n y creaci\xF3n de mi juego de rol.  Sobre todo incluyendo el pack de creaci\xF3\
      n de mundos.  Permite realizar relaciones entre personajes, hechos en la l\xED\
      nea de tiempo, razas, items, etc.\nLa interfaz es simple y sencilla de utilizar\
      \ pero como punto bastante negativo que le encuentro es que todo est\xE1 en\
      \ ingl\xE9s, no s\xF3lo la interfaz, sino tambi\xE9n los modelos de fichas de\
      \ cada uno de los elementos, lo que hace que haya que traducir todo manualmente\
      \ y crear uno mismo sus propios modelos."
