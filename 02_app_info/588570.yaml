    review: ALERTA. Para mi es un fraude, uno compra este dlc para hacer juegos (ya
      que esta dentro de un motor grafico) de pago o gratuitos y esta prohibido usar
      algunas cosas en los juegos de pago de este dlc, y ademas te prohibe hacer ciertos
      tipos de juegos que pueda ofender a alguien, osea tienes prohibido hacer el
      90 % de juegos usando este dlc, este dlc no sirve para lo que es, o sea para
      usarlo en un juego gratuito o de pago, no lo compren.
