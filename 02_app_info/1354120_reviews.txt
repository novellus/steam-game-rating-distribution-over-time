The base game needs polish, but the expansions are out-right game breaking.   My gaming group has played the base version to completion a number of times, but tonight with the expansions we didn't make it past the first age.  Seems to have the hardest time during battles when figures are moving into the territory at stake.  It locked up and timed us out 3 times, unacceptable really.","timestamp_created":1609574959,"timestamp_updated":1609574959,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+ZiJ4fYCcYTUvwI="}
