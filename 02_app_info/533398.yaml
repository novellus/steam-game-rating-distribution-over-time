    short_description: Kiba trains hard to catch up to Naruto, who is now hailed as
      the hero of the Leaf Village, but with little success. Feeling desperate, Kiba
      asks Kakashi if he could train him. Although busy with his own mission, Kakashi
      respects Kiba's wish and summons his Ninja Hounds as a training partner.
