      /><br>This is an ''XL'' version of my popular mobile game ''Ding Dong''. I have
      added/changed a variety of things to make it more suitable for the Steam platform
      and improved a lot of code and features based on knowledge gained since I originally
      made it. I have been learning to make games by making games and love creating
      small-yet-solid arcade games with simple mechanics. <strong>Please expect ''Ding
      Dong XL'' to be a small, re-playable, arcade score-chaser game where the only
      basic goals are to constantly beat your previous score and unlock a handful
      of cosmetic skins for the character.</strong> I greatly appreciate feedback
      and will do my best to ensure support for my games. Please contact me through
      Twitter, My Website, or the forums if you encounter something wrong with the
      game, something misleading on the store page, or you just want to say hello.
      <br><br>Thank you for taking a moment to read this; I really hope you enjoy
      playing my game.<br><i>Adam Nickerson - Nickervision Studios</i>'
