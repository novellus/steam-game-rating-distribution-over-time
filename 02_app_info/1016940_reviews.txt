More unfortunately though is the lack of online play. It might be fun with friends, but I was completely unable to get Steam Remote Play to work properly for the local multiplayer so I couldn't tell. This game shows a lot of promise with some fun gamemodes and a unique style, but I'm going to wait until they add online multiplayer and a bit more polish.","timestamp_created":1595358232,"timestamp_updated":1595358232,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1595416108,"developer_response":"Hey Evan,\n\nThank you very much for review and feedback about why you are not enjoying The Otterman Empire.\n\nIn regards to Steam Remote Play a large portion of it working is dependent on the hosts internet connection so we highly recommend if playing with other people the person with the strongest connection host the match.\n\nIn regards to the damage display, we have been listening to the feedback of the community and reviews and are working on making this more clearer to players.\n\nIn terms of an online mode we are fully dedicated to supporting The Otterman Empire for a long time to come and will update the community once such a feature may be on the way."}],"cursor":"AoJw3NewufMCfJrhlgI="}
