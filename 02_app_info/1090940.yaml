    review: " The control options menu reads like a technical manual for your wrecking\
      \ drone, and it took me a moment to digest all of it. The weighty feel of your\
      \ inputs and the flexibility of your control options result in an extremely\
      \ tactile gameplay experience. \n\nThe trailer does not emphasize enough the\
      \ wonderfully creepy atmosphere of exploring the gameworld.\n\n"
