      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Setting</h2>In Path to Prosperity, you are sent to the
      small village on a newly discovered island in order to develop the settlement
      and create a thriving industry. In order to win, you have to amass wealth, and
      send a predetermined amount of coin back to your homeland. But every development
      costs coin, and you have to constantly assess whether an investment is going
      to pay off for you in the long run. You start with only few houses and villagers,
      and let your people collect food and resources for you until you can support
      more villagers. Build up your logistics and start producing goods you can sell.
      Continuously increase the size of your economy and settlement, and make sure
      you can defend what you have created, while ensuring you are more efficient
      than your opponents!<h2 class="bb_tag">Competitors</h2>While you only have pirates
      to content with in singleplayer, you can play against up to 3 friends in multiplayer.
      The first to send home the agreed upon amount of coin wins - but if you do too
      well, your competitors may choose to spend their coin on soldiers to attack
      you. Every investment needs to be weighed and often the person who seemed to
      be falling behind can end up on top.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1394520/extras/SteamScreenshot24.png?t=1606339356"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">First Person Perspective</h2>In Path to Prosperity, you
      are thrown into the shoes of a commander on an island - with all advantages
      and disadvantages this brings with it. Unlike in a traditional RTS, you can't
      zoom out to get a better feeling for the land, or see an opponent's army advance
      from halfway across the map. So exploration, anticipating your opponents moves,
      securing chokepoints, and staying on top of what is happening on the island
      is paramount to secure victory. Having your boots on the ground also means that
      you can quickly leap in to make important changes, however, so you can cut down
      a tree if your villagers are slow to collect wood; you can build that house
      next to your new mine; or take out a gun to help fend off the pirates - just
      make sure to not get distracted from the bigger picture!<h2 class="bb_tag">Build
      your settlement</h2>The most efficient way of getting things done on the island
      is by using your villagers to collect resources, produce goods, and defend what
      you have created. Every house you place provides additional room for villagers,
      and every villager uses food. Make sure that your food production and deliveries
      to your markets are always secure to avoid your peoples' starvation. Should
      your villagers die, they will come back on the next ship - but you will have
      to reallocate their jobs and the disruption may just mean that your competitors
      overtake you. Once your settlement is large enough, you can use buildings like
      the bathhouse or cafe to increase your peoples' productivity and make your city
      look much more appropriate for your achievements.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1394520/extras/FieldGrowth.gif?t=1606339356"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Explore and find riches</h2>Every island has riches hidden
      in the jungle. A node system spawns random loot, ore veins, and pirates of different
      value and threat throughout the map. Exploring the island can not only give
      you a better lay of the land, but can also provide your settlement with early
      advantages, or lead to the discovery of a gold or gem vein that you can exploit.
      But balance your exploration carefully - the existence of a rich vein is not
      guaranteed, and you may be better off managing your settlement instead. Conversely,
      ignoring what the island has to offer may allow your competitors to win without
      your intervention.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1394520/extras/LootFind.gif?t=1606339356"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">The seed market</h2>Traders offer seeds for nutritional
      and luxury crops at your port. The seeds are randomised in each game and you
      have to adapt to what is available. The market is also limited in quantity,
      so any seed you buy is unavailable for your competitor and vice versa. Choose
      carefully whether you invest in a crop early on, or whether it is better for
      you to go with cheaper, less profitable industries to begin with. Additional
      crops will become available to you when you have submitted a quarter, half,
      and three-quarter of the required coin to your Queen, so time your submissions
      to reap the most rewards.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1394520/extras/SteamScreenshot23.png?t=1606339356"

    developer_response: 'Hi Iamledgen,


      I''m sorry to hear it isn''t running - and I''m obviously happy to help you
      sort it out. Could you maybe send me an email with your specs (bugs@pathtoprosperitygame.com),
      and let me know at what point the black screen is happening? I do think it''s
      a cool game, so let''s make sure you can play it ;).


      Best,

      Phil'
