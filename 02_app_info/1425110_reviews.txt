It cannot process a single turn, crashing to desktop when 'end turn' is pressed.  game load and save functions also do not work either.\n\nThis should have been tested more before release.","timestamp_created":1608242741,"timestamp_updated":1608242741,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498404413461685181","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48JevufYCctaFuwI="}
