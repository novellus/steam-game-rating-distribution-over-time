You have to manually decrease the V/Spd down to zero climb, that is once you get close to the 18000 foot mark. if you don't, you'll climb onwards and upwards. once you stop the climb the auto pilot keeps you at your desired height. do the same for your decent.\n\nThe aircraft sounds are pretty spot on, the turbine sounds are very good (just turn up your head phones)\n\nit's a 9/10 for this one, if the red lights were working it could be 10/10.","timestamp_created":1550176145,"timestamp_updated":1610055765,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519841313362121582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wKmz7/YCduXyugE="}
