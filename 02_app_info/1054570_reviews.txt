Wasn't a tutorial so I couldn't grasp the janky (and often glitch-ridden) controls for the first ten minutes of playtime before I actually understood what to do. Took me about six minutes to play essentially everything this game has to offer. In it's current state, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who cares about spending money on actual quality games. Would've been much better as a one-off free to play title, but for $7.00?? Nah, I'm good.","timestamp_created":1595705114,"timestamp_updated":1595705114,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2ffbw/MCfvDClwI="}
