    review: 'Deathless: City''s Thirst, is well written and well-paced, and definitely
      a favorite of mine in the choose-your-own-adventure novels. (Max Gladstone also
      authored a book series based in this setting, if you enjoyed the game.) High
      replay value, and an interesting real-world historical nod to the St. Francis
      Damn (though events can play out differently, depending).'
