There is not even a map for the second encounter.  all in all i would give this a 1/5 as playable.  The story line isn't bad and if you take your own time to find pictures, tokens, maps, and create more chat frame text it can work.  but not work $5.99, maybe $1.99 but even with that there is almost no work put into this from the paper version.","timestamp_created":1416019247,"timestamp_updated":1416019247,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56856238842010498","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+d/U2MkCc+mwMQ=="}
