Broken and Abandoned.\n It's impossible to complete the 2nd mission and progress further in the steam version. I purchased the game originally off the developers site, and was able to copy the original mission 2 file from that version to  my steam copy so i could play. Unfortunately I lost the file in a computer crash and had to reinstall the steam copy as well.\nWhen I had a working version the game was quite interesting, like a flight sim with oars (although dated graphics)\nI have written to the developer requesting a copy of the original file and reporting the unplayable state of the steam version. No response, so I can only conclude it's abandoned.","timestamp_created":1584635211,"timestamp_updated":1584635272,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtOvn+fACdMWf+QE="}
