During combat an attack can initiate a combo if there are many attackers and you can block their attack. You can also use special attack for more power. All the worlds are procedurally generated so it is never the same playthrough. The goal of the game is to recover the five Gems of Genesis from each region to confront the final boss. The game look very good, the combat is fun but light and it needs to be because you have to find the exit of the level before the world crumble around you. If you are not able to find the exit in time then you are going to the underworld where you fight monsters while trying to find the portal to go back to your level. This is a game for casual players that is fun to play and where progression is good. It is like Diablo I but with better combat and in a dungeon. This is the kind of game that you can come back to play often, very easy to get into. The only drawback is that you need to have a controller to enjoy the game at the moment but the developer is saying that he will introduce new navigation keys on the keyboard to make it easier to play with a mouse and keyboard.","timestamp_created":1605973998,"timestamp_updated":1605973998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm8/g9fUCc4bZrwI="}
