Now Spellforce3 Versus has arrived, clean RTS classic adventure with Orcs, Dwarfs, Elves, Humans etc. The Visual, Animation, Audio and game mechanics is all very very good. This is just what we looked for and we are already enjoying it and we will come to spend many hours with this game.\nBest RTS game I played since Starcraft2 and Age of Empire3.","timestamp_created":1607608644,"timestamp_updated":1607608644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmqa8pvYCe9rcuAI="}
