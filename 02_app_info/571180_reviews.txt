Surprisingly addictive. Simple to play, difficult to master the throwing technique. Length of houses/neighboorhood should be increased. A little too short although that does make me want to get back in a try again even more so. Hard for me to beat my own high score once I got 1550 points. Those chimney bonus points sure help!","timestamp_created":1608955573,"timestamp_updated":1608955573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sLbOzvYCfP+hvQI="}
