The tech is out-dated (think, 2000) and the graphics are simple, but it has its charm.  If you like Anatolian culture and architecture, you will enjoy this game.  \n\nDon't believe all the Russian haters who accuse this developer of just trying to make a quick buck.  Yes, the developer used an off-the-shelf game engine.  But he also used textures and sounds from Turkish culture, to evoke the impression of Anatolia in the Ottoman age.  For instance, if you approach a mosque, the muezzin will begin calling the faithful to prayer from the minaret. \n\nSome constructive criticism of the gameplay:  the character moves too slowly.  He always walks.  Is there a key to make him run, to cover vast distances more quickly?\n\nThis review is based on just hour of playing, so I have hardly scratched the surface of the entire game.","timestamp_created":1569674391,"timestamp_updated":1569674391,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.40841183066368103","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1569681107,"developer_response":"Thank you for your review.
