Most developers use this engine to crap out absolutely atrocious games to sell them on any storefront they can and this game is no exception. \n\nStory:\n\nIn The Spirit Underneath you play as an unnamed man who awakens in a mysterious graveyard , with no idea who he is and how he got there, as you try to piece together the story and escape hell. \n\nIf you played My Bones, the story is almost an identical rip off, like I mean even the plot twist is the same. It's absolutely terrible and when you read the first note you already can easily guess how the story plays out. Even the ending of the game has an identical choose how you want to proceed with the story. Literally no effort put into the game.\n\nGraphics:\n\nLike most Game Guru games the game is filled to the brim with a bunch of asset flipped locations and items. You remember My Bones, the game I mentioned at the start of the review. Well these two games look identical, the first location is literally a fiery red graveyard that looks abysmal. \n\nThere is a few moments where character models appear and they seem completely out of place and it honestly makes me laugh. There's on part in the game where you encounter killer bunnies that look like Robbie from Silent Hill 3. \n\nAudio:\n\nThe audio like most of the textures is all stock. The music is constantly looping and absolute pain to listen to, The stock effects like a scary noise happening when you get too close to a certain object sounds like it was pulled straight out of a 3 AM video. \n\nGameplay:\n\nThe Spirit Underneath is basically a walking simulator where you hunt keys and unlock doors until you finish the game. It's really boring and not to mention at first you think there is going to be threats going after you because you have a HUD that displays your health and lives and you simply can't die in the game. \n\nJust like My Bones this game is also insanely short. A single run will take you less than 10 minutes and there is another ending in the game for you to check out, but even then these endings are joke endings that make literally no sense. \n\nVerdict:\n\nThe Spirit Underneath is absolutely atrocious. It's not scary, really boring and not to mention absolutely horrendous. When I played My Bones I thought that was the bottom of the barrel, but The Spirit Underneath managed to dug past the trash and crawl even further down the same barrel. It's an atrocious game that is not worth a single cent from you.\n\nFinal Rating:\n1/10\n\nPros:\nN/A\n\nCons:\n- Asset flip \n- Stock music makes you laugh rather than scaring you\n- Pretty much a direct rip off of My Bones \n- Really short\n\nIf you liked this review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews","timestamp_created":1593127000,"timestamp_updated":1593127000,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.684490740299224854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/Jrx9vICfLqXkAI="}
