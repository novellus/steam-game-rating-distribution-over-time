    review: "Trabajaron significativamente en la calidad del gui\xF3n y aumentaron\
      \ la dificultad en comparaci\xF3n con el juego principal, le echaron mas ganas\
      \ a la hora de crear tanto la misi\xF3n principal como las secundarias y el\
      \ esp\xEDritu de las islas tropicales se transmite perfectamente. Los gr\xE1\
      ficos parecen haberse mantenido al mismo nivel, pero los paisajes se han vuelto\
      \ mucho mejores. Completarlo lleva entre  7 y 15 horas dependiendo de c\xF3\
      mo juegues. \n\nY aqu\xED terminar\xEDa TW2 el 20 de septiembre de 2011. \n\n\
      Los siguientes DLCS dan un poco de miedo, tuvieron una fuga de talentos tremenda\
      \ y los pocos que quedaron o no cobran a final de mes o son un poco cabrones.\
      \ Porque hay que tener los cojones muy gordos para orientar la cerradura de\
      \ los cofres hacia la pared.\n\nY un largo etcetera, pero ya para la siguiente\
      \ rese\xF1a.\n"
