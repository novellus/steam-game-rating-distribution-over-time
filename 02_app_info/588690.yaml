    about_the_game: "<strong>Peace, Death!</strong> is an arcade simulator with difficulties.\
      \ In this game, you play as the Reaper working for your boss, Death, in Apocalypse,\

      \ You need to examine each client's feature to determine his, her, or its fate.\
      \ There are more features every day and the game becomes more difficult. Your\
      \ client holds a pistol? Send him to Hell unless he changes his mind and drops\

      \ not that easy! First, take the hat off, and you might see the horns. Being\
