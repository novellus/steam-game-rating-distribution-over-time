    review: ive been called a r*pist, an n word, a f****t, and told to kill myself
      on multiple occasions for using tone, so I bought tone prime. the tone prime
      execution is so goddamn cool, if you're a tone main like myself I think its
      worth it. supports the creators and makes tone that much better
