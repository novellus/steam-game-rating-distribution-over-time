L'avion Airbus par défaut fonctionne beaucoup mieux.  Très déçu !\n\nThis software add-on is not made for use on Steam FSX.  The overhead panel does not work like it shoudl do.  It is impossible to shut down the engines with buttons and start them from there, of course.  If you have read the user manual thoroughly, you would have learned that to fill the MCDU with the appropriate datas as it should be, you must start with a cold start.  However, this is not possible on this version of FSX on Steam.  As some byers wrote, it is a complete scam or they should fix it to offer a full operating panel.","timestamp_created":1590253318,"timestamp_updated":1602745606,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw96PFlfUCctrliQI="}
