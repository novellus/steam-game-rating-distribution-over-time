    review: "Airship Dragoon is a typical indie project made in solo. Despite all\
      \ the nice concepts this software piece presents, for the \"mainstream\" gamers\
      \ it is barely just a bit more than an engine demo. Especially if you're playing\
      \ the games for the world immersion and good stories, and not for the \"pure\
      \ gameplay\" only (like we had in the '80s). Therefore I suggest thinking not\
      \ even twice, but at least 7 times before buying yourself into it. Even with\
      \ 75% and more discounts. Good thing is that you can download the freeware trial\
      \ version right from the store page, and try the game pace by yourself (it is\
      \ slow indeed, the question is how do you feel about it?).\n\nSo, Airship Dragoon.\
      \ Accurate combat simulator where you control a group of soldiers fighting in\
      \ turn-based mode with other groups of soldiers. In full 3D on the big procedurally-generated\
      \ maps of some presumably dystopian world made in steampunk aesthetics.\n\n\
      The game has a major campaign mode, plus another one bonus campaign, plus the\
      \ most default game mode, one-highly-customizable-battle-long only. There is\
      \ no multiplayer option, which is no wonder, for it's kinda heavy for the one-man-game-studio\
      \ to provide worldwide server support.\n\nIn the main campaign, you have 6 nations\
      \ to choose from, all based on the late-19-early-20-century real-world-empires...\
      \ but it is not going any further than the colour of the banner and the set\
      \ of names for your soldiers. You start on some quite big map made up of hexagonal\
      \ cells, which you need to conquer before other PC-controlled nations will do\
      \ it. And it means hundreds of battles, all following one pattern. Yes, there\
      \ will be some randomness in the quantity and quality of enemies, in the terrain\
      \ features and the current amount of your funds and reserves. But in any battle,\
      \ after you know how many people you and your opponent have after you set inventory\
      \ (weapons, ammo, and armor which they carry) for each of your soldiers in a\
      \ strictly manual manner... And considering some variety of weather and terrain\
      \ conditions on the battle site... It is the same fight again and again. Same\
      \ goals, same collisions, same tactics from the opponents.\n\nSo please, don't\
      \ raise any high expectations about Airship Dragoon. Yes, visually tactical\
      \ map where you move your troops looks somewhat like Valkyria Chronicles...\
      \ But that doesn't mean Airship Dragoon is somewhere close to Valkyria serial.\
      \ It's a totally different title, where all where you spend your time on is\
      \ about battles... and preparing for them by a very long manual process of arming\
      \ and re-arming your squads, one man at the time. And it is normal to have battles\
      \ there like 20 on 20 men or more... \n\nHowever, as a pure wargame, without\
      \ any story as a side dish - the game's good. Boring, if you're not a big fan\
      \ of turn-based tactical firefights, but deep enough to give the game 5.8/10\
      \ mark and my personal upvote - for gameplay only.\n\nPS: read all the manuals\
      \ - it is the only tutorial in the game!"
