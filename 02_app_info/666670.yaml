    review: "[b]File Format:[/b] MP3 (320kbps) and WAV (1411kbps).\n\nBefore I went\
      \ deep into hard rock/heavy metal territory, I grew up on a large dose of classical\
      \ music, listening to it almost daily until I got sick of the repetition. Even\
      \ still, that does not detract from the fact that the composers of that era\
      \ were hardworking geniuses that could cram a mountain of melody and harmony\
      \ into their compositions.\n\nYears later, alongside the release of The End\
      \ Is Nigh comes possibly the soundtrack that made me start really appreciating\
      \ Ridiculon. I wasn't all too enamoured with Isaac Rebirth's soundtrack initially,\
      \ but their remixes of well-known classical tunes married together rock and\
      \ classical into a rather potent combination that keeps TEIN tense and exciting\
      \ at various stretches.\n\nNote: This almost NEVER goes on sale on Steam. If\
      \ you ever spot it on sale, make it a point to pick it up.\n\nTrack picks:\n\
      THE ARID FLATS - New World Symphony (Dvo\u0159\xE1k 1893) [but why couldn't\
      \ they have put BOTH the Past and Future versions into the download instead\
      \ of remixing both into a single track?]\nTHE MACHINE - Flight Of The Bumblebee\
      \ (Rimsky-Korsakov 1899) \nGOLGOTHA - Night On Bald Mountain (Mussorgsky 1867)\n\
      ACCEPTANCE - Hungarian Rhapsody (Liszt 1847) \nTHE FUTURE - Requiem (Verdi 1874)\t\
      \n\n[h1][b]9.5/10[/b][/h1]"
