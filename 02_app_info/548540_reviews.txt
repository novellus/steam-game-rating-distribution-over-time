It feels too much like 'wiggle this knob and hear the sound change'. There is no real in-depth sound synthesis explaination and how this works within Z3TA. This knowledge you either need to have from dealing with synthesizers or with other plugins. Reading the manual has been far more efficient so far in combination with the iPad application of Z3TA+ 2. Hopefully the remaining videos will change my opinion... but I have a hard time continuining.","timestamp_created":1511106058,"timestamp_updated":1511106058,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8ZK86t8CefLbiwE="}
