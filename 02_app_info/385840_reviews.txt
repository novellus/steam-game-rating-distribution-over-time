The conversations were all right but there wasn't much depth to the world. There are some funny one-liners.\n\nAll in all, a good old-school point-and-click adventure, I'm glad I played it but there's not much replay value. Recommended to any fan of the genre.\n\nNote: like others mentioned, I ran into issues with the game resolution. Keep in mind, that this is an old AGS adventure so it's display support is not as up-to-date as the current version of AGS. Windowed mode with 4x scaling worked for me; none of the full-screen ones did. If you have issues during start-up, run the winsetup utility that sits in the game folder to configure resolution.","timestamp_created":1581963274,"timestamp_updated":1581963568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495594710111618042","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuIyYqvACe9b28gE="}
