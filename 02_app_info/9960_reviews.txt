My love of all things classic, tells me that I should give this one a pass, however, my serious gaming side (as small as it may be), tells me be honest.  \n\nWhat I have played of this game it is fun, once you get use to it, the fun novelty of it shines through, and what a great addition to anyone's library for the sake of Halloween and whatnot, honestly, I kind of like the feel of it, and like the updated graphics to the original Atari 2600 game I use to play as a kid makes me feel nostalgic, so yeah, I am sorry for anyone that expects a harsh review, but I just can't bring myself to do it, its a fun game to me, I recommend this one, its well worth the play, but definitely get it on sale if you still can!","timestamp_created":1593125186,"timestamp_updated":1594411158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569752275943756104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn/GTnfMCddOWkAI="}
