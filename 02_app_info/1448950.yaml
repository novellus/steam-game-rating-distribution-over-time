    review: 'TLDR-its a bad 8 dollar game.


      only played for about 20 minutes, the movement system is terrible, you''re only
      allowed move between set locations not providing much of any player freedom.
      and then a bug kept happening where if I would exit back to HQ from a level
      it would immedietly put me back in the subway level with no way to fix it other
      then restarting the game. the enemy AI is also pretty bad so its supplemented
      by large numbers which seems like a way to try and add difficulty which is made
      worse by the fact that this games enemy hitboxes are not stellar either.  I
      realize its a new release and some of these things will (Probably,iunno) get
      patched out, but there are just some general basic choices made for the game
      that would kill most people''s enjoyment/ first impression of the game as it
      did my own. that being said for 8 dollars what are you really expecting?     refunded
      and moving on.'
