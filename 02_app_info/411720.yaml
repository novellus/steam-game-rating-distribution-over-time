      /><h2 class="bb_tag">The Anti Virus</h2>When you play as the Anti Virus your
      only goal is to isolate all the Rogue Programs within the time limit. You can
      play as one of the 5 available Anti Virus classes: <strong>Guardian, Adjudicator,
      Sentinel, Sapper</strong> and <strong>Arbitrator</strong>.<h2 class="bb_tag">The
      Rogue Program</h2>As a Rogue Program your task is to infiltrate the computer
      and steal as much of the data as you can before time runs out or the Anti Virus
      isolates you. You can play as one of the 5 available Rogue Program classes:
      <strong>Clunker, Stalker, EGOR, Grunt</strong> and <strong>Skipper</strong>.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Abilities and Points</h2>Each class, either Anti Virus or Rogue
      Program, has a set of four unique upgradeable abilities that help them reach
      their goal. These abilities are upgraded throughout the match when you receive
      upgrade points. For every 5,000 points you gain a new upgrade point to spend
      on an ability. The Anti Virus gets points by isolating the Rogue Programs and
      by winning the round. The Rogue Programs get points by unfreezing fellow Rogue
      Programs, standing in the data streams, taunting the Anti Virus and by winning
      the round.'
