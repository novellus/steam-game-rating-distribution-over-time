It would be better if the marker beacon lights worked.  Original FSX planes had working marker lights, but many add-ons do not.  Marker audio usually works in most planes.  No one seems to talk about this....or know about it.  The 207 is very stable and easy to fly.  It has nice instrument lights that work in the daytime if needed.  It is one of my favorites.","timestamp_created":1582658230,"timestamp_updated":1582658230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw74LyvvACe+DI9AE="}
