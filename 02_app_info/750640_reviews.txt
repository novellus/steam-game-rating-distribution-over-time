Consists of 4 songs in total, with 2 different songs, each in a \"Radio Edit\" (about 3 minutes playtime) and an \"Extended Edit\" with a length of about 9 minutes.\n\nAll songs are encoded in 320 kbit CBR MP3 format. ID3 is completely tagged and the songs even have a cover included. Thumbs up!\n\nTrack 1 - Mirrors - is a simple, yet catchy synth tune, in an unobtrusive, ambient style. Track 2 - Sleep - features some instrument that I'd describe as \"Tibetan singing bowls\". Decent underlying percussion, will probably make a good songs to do some meditation to (hope I don't falls asleep to it :D:).\n\nIs it worth the 99 cents? My opinion: definitely. Go to iTunes for instance, you'll get a single song for the same price instead of 4...
