    short_description: "&quot;That game where you can pee, poop and puke.&quot; --\
      \ this is a 2D platformer with 360\xB0 aiming. It is violent, it is fast, it\
      \ is absolutely over the top. Jump around, slide, dash and dunk into enemies\
      \ to kill them, and then eat them. On your quest for meat you encounter a lot\
      \ of deadly traps in a post-apocalyptic wasteland."
