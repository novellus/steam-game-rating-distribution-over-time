It has a great \"run and gun\" feel that makes it so much fun. It may not be Dark Souls level difficult, but it's not going to be an easy win either. Love the upgrades feature, it makes the game so much more interesting. Also, the 4 classes are very different, allowing for greatly varied styles of gameplay and make each play through a different experience. All around a fun time, and hopefully the dev continues to refine it.","timestamp_created":1560112819,"timestamp_updated":1574985126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh7qb2u4Ce/yMwwE="}
