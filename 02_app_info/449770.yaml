    about_the_game: "Legend of Moros is a retro-style RPG that focuses on the quest\
      \ of Roland and his friends as they try to return to their homeland. But while\
      \ they have a straightforward goal, adventures don't often end up that way...<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nMain Features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharacters: There are over\
      \ 12 characters that will join you on your journey. The main character does\
      \ not have to be in the active party, which results in 1000+ potential party\
      \ combinations!<br />\r\nStoryline: A carefully written storyline that is equal\
      \ parts dramatic and humorous. NPC's and sidequests help to increase the player's\
      \ understanding of the world outside of the main quest.<br />\r\nOriginal Assets:\
      \ Custom animations, tilesets, music, and monsters help to set a unique tone\
      \ and aesthetic for the world.<br />\r\nGameplay: A tactical combat system that\
      \ rewards proper execution of both individual character tactics and the overall\
      \ team strategy. Select one of three difficulty settings to choose from for\
      \ this 30-40 hour adventure.<br />\r\nSidequest driven: Apart from the main\
      \ story, NPC's or objects may start a potential sidequest. The player is free\
      \ to choose whether or not to take these missions, but there are rewards for\
      \ them, as well as helping to learn about the other character's motivations.\
      \ There is also no time limit for completing a sidequest, but certain sidequest\
      \ bosses may grow stronger if you choose to progress through certain points\
      \ of the main story. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEquipment: Equipment has been simplified.\
      \ As opposed to many separate pieces of armor and multiple hand slots, characters\
      \ each have a few different and unique weapons that do most of the modifications\
      \ to statistics. In many games, weapons get progressively better as you make\
      \ progress. In Legend of Moros, there are always benefits and drawbacks. A weapon\
      \ may have a high critical hit rate, but poor defenses, for example. You can\
      \ also equip one weapon mod (to change your basic attack's element, or to give\
      \ a chance for a status effect), one seal (which lets your character use a skill\
      \ they otherwise couldn't), and two accessories (status resistance, extra attack\
      \ power, health regeneration, and so on). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnique Combat:\
      \ This game uses an unusual Stamina system. As opposed to games where spellcasters\
      \ use MP and everyone else is just attacking, Stamina is consumed by a character\
      \ whenever they use a skill or spell. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut that's just using\
      \ another name for a resource, and this is still a turn-based game. How is that\
      \ different? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach character can set a certain Tactic; this\
      \ allows them to gain Stamina whenever certain criteria are met. Which do you\
      \ prefer: having your main healer regain Stamina whenever they heal someone,\
      \ or whenever a party member takes damage? While each option covers multiple\
      \ criteria (so you could have both of these), there are many different ways\
      \ each character can be used. While RPGs have tended toward more of an action\
      \ and reflexive skillset as time has gone on, I have tried to make this the\
      \ epitomy of a strategy RPG.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere's a large and interesting\
      \ cast of characters, and for the vast majority of the game, you can choose\
      \ to have any four characters that you've found in the active party. If you\
      \ don't like the main character, you can swap them out very early on. Also,\
      \ at the beginning of the game, you are able to pick the difficulty you'd like\
      \ to play on. (You can also press F1 on the keyboard to check/edit controls,\
      \ if need be.)"

    review: "This is a competently written yet fun old fashionedish JRPG style game.\
      \  It has plenty of oddball humor and craziness as you attempt to find Justice\
      \ and learn what has happened.  The fighting mechanics and abilities are inventive\
      \ and keep the game from becoming just a slog of a typical  RPG grind. Unless\
      \ you play in hard mode.  Hard mode is... a grindfest extraordinaire.  I would\
      \ suggest sticking with Normal or Easy, as it has no bearing on the story. \
      \ \n\nInstead of typical enemies found in these style of games they are uniquely\
      \ designed and use non stock art, which is a relief from so many RPGmaker games\
      \ simply using base assets. Because the enemies aren't your typical RPG fare,\
      \ you have to experiment as the usual kill x by using x doesn't apply, leading\
      \ to less boring fights as you learn the game.   The stamina system is a nice\
      \ system as well, I've not seen it used this way in very many games.  \n\nThe\
      \ map is fun to explore and the art used different from anything else I've seen.\
      \  I never felt like I got too lost, nor did I feel it was far too big.\n\n\
      All in all it's well put together and well worth what is being asked for.  Well\
      \ worth playing.  \n\nAs for why I have so little time in the steam version,\
      \ I bought and originally finished the game on itchio.  \n\nThe only real con\
      \ I have is that because it's RPGMaker and low budget,  the art though unique\
      \ when not stock doesn't overcome the 'RPGmaker' feel.  Yet there is still enough\
      \ changed in the game that it certainly isn't cookie cutter either.\n\n\n"
