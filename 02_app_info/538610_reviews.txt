Even if it's just RPG Maker games about a hostile landscape, they still stand head and shoulders above ~90% of the JRPG people on steam.","timestamp_created":1566281353,"timestamp_updated":1566281353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48pjp1uwCcpLa0AE="}
