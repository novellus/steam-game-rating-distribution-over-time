    review: 'This a spin-off sequel to Selector WiXoss. It''s not necessary to watch
      Selector WiXoss, as only one minor character makes a reappearance, and much
      of the setting is different.


      Overall, this one is a lot more grim compared to Selector. If Selector WiXoss
      is Yu Gi Oh meets Madoka, Lostorage is Yu Gi Oh meets MahoIku with a dash of
      Daybreak Illusion.


      I should note that despite the comparison to Yu Gi Oh, there''s actually very
      little in terms of fleshing out the card battles. Most of the cards aren''t
      shown, and never explained, and whole battles are commonly skipped. The rules
      aren''t really fleshed out either, and at some point the rules are quite blatantly
      thrown out the window for action factor, so it wouldn''t matter anyway. It follows
      card game rules roughly to the extent that most stuck-in-MMO series follow actual
      MMO rules.


      Overall, I wasn''t entirely sure if to recommend this series or not. It''s...
      not bad. Not particularly good, either. It''s very far from a must-watch. I''d
      have a much easier time recommending Selector. But it is well drawn, and has
      decent writing.'
