    about_the_game: 'On a cold November night in a desolate estate deep in the mountains
      an innocent life has prematurely perished. Surrounded only by his family and
      closest friends, a controversial yet immensely successful businessman William
      Goldberg passed away under mysterious circumstances. Being an upstanding member
      of society and the owner of Goldberg Industries, a multi-million dollar arms
      company responsible for providing the military during the World War 2, news
      of his death caused an uproar at the local police department. It seemed the
      case was tailor-made  for the legendary detective Knox, a prodigy who successfully
      solved over hundred cases. Accompanied by an aspiring young detective Clark
      assigned by the Chief to keep an eye on him, Knox departs towards the Goldberg''s
      estate to discover the truth behind the incident. <br><br>Miles away from nearest
      settlement in a mansion hidden from the eyes of public, it is only natural to
      presume that only those present at the time could have been involved. Follow
      clues, look for evidence and discover key information by interrogating the suspects.
      All pieces of the puzzle will be presented and it''s up to you to deduce who,
      how and why the murder happened. A mystery visual novel inspired by classic
      novels from Arthur C. Doyle and Agatha Christie and &quot;When They Cry&quot;
