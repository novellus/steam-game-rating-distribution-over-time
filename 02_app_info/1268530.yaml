    about_the_game: "Back in 1997, Kerbalai was serving his sentence in a local prison\
      \ when he received news of his wife's serious condition. He decided to arrange\
      \ an escape to be with her one last time, but at the last moment, a cellmate\
      \ turned him in to shorten his sentence.<br />\r\nThe prisoners could not sleep\
      \ that night because of the screams that came from the police room. It is still\
      \ unclear who exactly shouted, since not only Kerbalai, but also two officers\
      \ disappeared after that night...<br />\r\nThere is a legend that although the\
      \ police managed to stop Kerbalai, but his soul is still looking for justice.\
      \ Every night, he locks the rookie officers in their room so the prisoners can\
      \ get out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOutside The Grid is a multiplayer game\
      \ where you can play as a team of prisoners or as a team of police officers.\
      \ At your disposal are many different tools with which you can open doors, stun\
      \ opponents or pretend to be their friend.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd remember,\
      \ Kerbalai is always there for you!"
