The voice acting is really good as well as the music, all of the anime characters have their traits and nothing feels off or like they won't say or do, and the UI is pleasant and true to the anime. \nThe art is 10/10, the moment you see it you know its from Psycho-Pass.  \n\nOverall, the characters -Nadeshiko Kugatachi and Takuma Tsurugi are likable and have different personalities.\nIn fact all of the characters are very well written and at some point or another, I found myself sympathizing with Alpha and even some of the victims (or latent criminals I guess} \nAs far as I am in the game, the choices have their impact in the story and it can be anxious when choosing the faith of a characters as the player can feel the burden of the choice they are making. \n\nIf you are not a fan of the anime, the story is pretty solid and interesting, however there are some mentions of cases that happened in the anime that you may not understand or you will have to look it up. \n\nGood luck on your first day, Inspectors. \n","timestamp_created":1609362350,"timestamp_updated":1609362350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+5Pe2vYCd/ryvgI="}
