I've been watching out for this game for some time, and im really happy that it turned out to be such a pretty game. The story is beautiful and true, the animation is really cute and great, and the music fits the game perfeclty. All in all, a well produced game :)","timestamp_created":1513368436,"timestamp_updated":1513368436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548387110233306885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0rfyreACcqOdkgE="}
