      \ this bundle will ensure you're armed to the teeth and ready for anything when\
      \ battle commences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor starters, the Engineer Pack places\
      \ a rare A3-210 weapon into your hands. This stylized piece of kit not only\
      \ looks the part, it also offers a level of firepower that you can rely on when\
      \ the battle really heats up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf looks could kill, the Engineer\
      \ soldier skin that comes with the pack would be held responsible for an astronomical\
      \ body count. Boasting unique head gear, enemies won't even have the privilege\
      \ of seeing your face before you dispatch them. Now that's cold.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nFurther adding to your arsenal, the pack also features 7 days worth\
      \ of smoke grenades. Simply remove the pin, throw in the desired direction and\
      \ your enemies will not know from which angle you're coming.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nOf course, even with so much firepower in your favor, there's always the chance\
      \ you could be the one on the wrong end of a stray bullet. Ensuring you're prepared\
      \ for such an eventuality, the Engineer Pack features 10 Resurrection Coins\
      \ for the Co-op mode to bring you back from the brink multiple times and give\
      \ you a freakish air of invincibility. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, the Engineer\
      \ Pack also provides 7 full days of stat boosts to ensure your bravery in battle\
      \ is well and truly rewarded. With the booster in play, expect 100% more rewards\
      \ on XP earned, 75% more Warface Dollars than you'd usually earn for your antics,\
      \ and 50% % faster item unlocks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Warface Engineer Starter\
      \ Pack is granted only once per account and only on the first server visited\
      \ after the purchase."
