Be patient in the beginning (as just like a great book the first few chapters set the storyline then delivers bigtime).  Many areas to explore and later on in game you can return to them to pick up additional goodies from the same treasures chests. Has no quest menu so just make a mental note on where to go.  The quests are well done and give high powered weapons and items.  Explore everywhere and battles are challenging and quick. And one of the best things is that the developer is quick to respond and help and fix any bugs. Just wish more developers were this fast to respond with many other rpgs. A definite jrpg winner!","timestamp_created":1575745967,"timestamp_updated":1575745967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uerx8O4Cer7g4gE="}
