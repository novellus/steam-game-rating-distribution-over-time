Don't get me wrong, I've followed the different additions.  I just haven't sat down at a table and played.  And I still haven't, but with the fantasy grounds program and some core books, I've been playing regularly.  I am amazed at this program and all it does.  It takes a little work, and I recommend watching tutorial videos on You Tube, otherwise it may seem overwhelming.  But once you get the hang of this wonderful program you'll be amazed at all you can do.  For anyone who doesn't have people close by to play with, especially with Covid going on, I highly recommend you give this a shot.  You will not regret it!","timestamp_created":1610236379,"timestamp_updated":1610236379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ496fk9PYCf+v3wQI="}
