      at heart).. Build your world, choose your train, go on exciting adventures through
      cityscapes, jungles and deserts...and even crash and blow things up!<br><br>From
      the makers of Trainz Simulator comes a whole new world of fun for young train
      fans (or the young at heart).<br><br>With a few simple clicks, anyone can make
      their first &quot;Train Town&quot; in seconds. Then jump into Drive mode to
      explore your creation and run trains for hours to come. <br><br>With the incredible
      &quot;Crash Physics&quot; feature, mayhem in your virtual world is never far
      away as you bounce, smash and crash into everything in your path. And don''t
      forget to watch out for exploding gas bottles and tanks!!<br><br>Train Town
      offers two different modes of fun for the whole family: <br><br>In Create Mode,
      populate your world with buildings, rocks, trees, roads, cars and a variety

      then jump right in to Driver Mode to follow your trains wherever they go. <br><br>In
      Driver Mode, add your favorite trains such as Tough Thomas, Steaming Sam, Rocket
      Train Rod and many others. How you drive them is up to you - speed up or slow
      down to avoid the cars, characters and other trains, or perhaps go all out on
      a destruction derby approach to wipe everything off the map. <br><br>Jump from
      train to train, change camera angles, zoom in and out and enjoy the action in
