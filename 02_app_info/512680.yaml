    about_the_game: <strong>Conga Combat</strong> is not a typical arena-shooter.
      Defend yourself against the pan-dimensional critters using your bullet tail,
      close enemy portals by looping around them and charge up your hyper-destructive
      mega-lazor by laying a path of bullets in front of the mindless, drifting purploids.
      Oh, and stay the hell out of the way of the EVIL X - those dudes are BAD news!<br><br>Combining
      trippy visual effects and coffee-break sized bytes of hardcore action, <strong>Conga
      Combat</strong> can be played solo in either arcade or survival mode. Arcade
      plays like a typical coin-op, with the player starting from the beginning each
      game, jumping from dimension to dimension by achieving the ever-growing kill-quota
      on each stage. Alternatively, the 'pure' survival mode sees the player facing
      an endless horde of increasingly aggressive geometric critters in a single arena
      for as long as they can.<br><br>Got some people over for a gaming session? We've

      Music 10/10

      Graphics 10/10

      Gameplay 10/10

      Controls 9/10 (a little slippery for me, but that''s part of the challenge)'
