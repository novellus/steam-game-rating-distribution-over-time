Long grass and specific fences make black lines in my screen that move very aggressively whenever I zoom in. I tend to ignore it for now, until I can get a better PC (especially a better graphic card). Is it worth it though? Yes, definitely. \n\nI bought the game with all the DLC's in sale because I thought it was too expensive normally. I really like this game. The developers put a lot of work in the graphic motions of the animals. The plants are okay, only trees look really good. Regular plants look like they came straight out of Zoo Tycoon 2 without the Graphic Mod. (I've also played the game on a better PC, everything looks better except the plants lol). \nBut ofcourse, the plants are not the reason why we're here. The mods from the workshop also work fine, I sometimes have a bit of difficulty to place habitats right, but most of the time (and with some patience) it works okay. \n\nIf you're looking for a new version of a game like Zoo Tycoon 2, I would recommend this game. But be aware: it's definitely not a Zoo Tycoon 3. Making paths kinda irritates me in this game (it also irritated me in Planet Coaster). It's not as free as in Zoo Tycoon. Planet Zoo doesn't allow animals mods yet via Workshop and Zoo Tycoon 2 had a lot more animals in the game (not sure if Planet Zoo is going to make a shit ton of DLC's tho)\n\nAlthough there are some downsides, I would still recommend this game. I've been waiting for a new zoo game for so long, and it's finally here. Zoo Tycoon 2 became really outdated and I hope Planet Zoo is going to be just as good in the end with all the DLC's and updates.","timestamp_created":1609702293,"timestamp_updated":1610108213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48LL78PYCf8yVwAI="}
