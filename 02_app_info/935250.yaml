    review: "  O jogo \xE9 bom para quem gosta de jogos retr\xF4 vale mais que seu\
      \ pre\xE7o a pesar de ser curto, a plot \xE9 gen\xE9rica, a musica \xE9 ok mas\
      \ o foco \xE9 na gameplay que \xE9 bem no estilo retro andar e bater nos inimigos\
      \ at\xE9 encontrar um boss \xE9 bem interessante jogar com os vil\xF5es principalmente\
      \ com o pr\xF3prio necromante, para quem j\xE1 \xE9 acostumado com plataformers\
      \ antigos o jogo \xE9 bem f\xE1cil ent\xE3o recomendo colocar no dif\xEDcil.\n\
      \  Se voc\xEA vai jogar aqui v\xE3o algumas dicas: preste aten\xE7\xE3o o jogo\
      \ tem v\xE1rios caminhos secretos, tome cuidado com inimigos enquanto pula,\
      \ sua arma \xE9 sua maior inimiga o boost da lan\xE7a vai te matar muito e a\
      \ maioria dos bosses n\xE3o s\xE3o dif\xEDceis s\xF3 s\xE3o demorados. \n  Enfim\
      \ recomendo para quem curti a nostalgia de jogos retr\xF4 e \xE9 isso bom jogo."
