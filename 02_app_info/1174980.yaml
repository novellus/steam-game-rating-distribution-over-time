    review: I purchased this software a while ago as I saw it was designed for music
      creation on a touch screen using a very different interface to normal music
      production software which intrigued me - "cubes?? for making music?? this will
      be weird!" - it was and it also turned out to be a great bit of fun. Played
      around with Mutant for a bit and worked out some of it then with assistance
      from the developer/support & the user guide that recently got included even
      managed to get two computers rocking mutant in sync quite nicely producing some
      good sounds. (I have 2 computers with 22inch/23inch touchscreens and a dj mixer
      here so can also mess around dj'ing with various elements of 2 looping compositions).
      The recent update looks to have made it even better with the added sampler instrument
      and quantisation features - i can get drums played in time much easier now as  my
      timing is terrible (thank you for adding that in the update, still investigating
      new features but did also notice some sound editing parameters such as drum
      pitch/amplitude options are now included greatly increasing the sound palette
      - very nice touch thanks)  Looking forward to any future updates, was worth
      having when i first purchased it, now its even better.
