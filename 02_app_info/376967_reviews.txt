This add-on really helps in getting more life and more value out of the New York-New Haven route. It should be noted that almost all the negative reviews for this add-on are because people did not take the time to read the notes and requirements for the pack.\nI purchased this in a sale and it only cost me around $7 for the 10 scenarios that are included. All in all great value for money!","timestamp_created":1605488817,"timestamp_updated":1605488817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tual5/UCe53SrgI="}
