If available, this would be a neutral rating, but given the drawbacks.... I'll go for the \"thumbs down\". \n\nMajor issue is: I just can't engage with the characters. Too stereotype, good is good and bad is bad and there's nothing in between. Minor major issue: the very straightforward story. No surprise, no twist, nothing like that. Even though the game is graphically pleasing and presents some neat ideas like commanding animals to help you in certain situations and the HOG scenes are challenging, at the end of the day all of the good things are not enough to outweigh the downsides. And as I've played other titles from the same publisher (e.g. the Enigmatis series) that truly knocked me off my feet, sadly it's just not enough.","timestamp_created":1609356306,"timestamp_updated":1609356306,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5YzH2vYCdK3vvgI="}
