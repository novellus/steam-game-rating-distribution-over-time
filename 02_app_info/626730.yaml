    review: 'I wasn''t really sure how to rate this game, because it''s still in early
      access, clearly not complete and has bugs that stop the game being enjoyable.
      That being said, it''s a nice idea and once this is finished and polished up
      I think it will be a great little hotseat, multiplayer party game.

      So, I''ve said I don''t recommend this game for now (and certainly don''t get
      it if you expect a completed game), but really this is a neutral review.


      Here are the bugs I noticed, the first being the most problematic:

      1) The last player (tried in 2 player and 3 player) always plays two extra games,
      that they clearly aren''t supposed to play. Then when the final scores come
      up the last player gets points and the other players get 0.


      2) In the bull fight and the shopping game the bonus scores don''t seem to be
      working properly (always display as 0)


      3) There''s sometimes a graphical glitch with the arrows in the archery game


      As for the games themselves, there''s a nice selection, some of which seem quite
      original. The ice cream game and the hole in the wall game were my favourites.
      Though with hole in the wall, some poses were too high. I think the devs need
      to add height calibration for each individual player for this to work. Least
      favourite games are probably the bull fight, which is just a bit boring (plus
      the bull sometimes inexplicably goes for you right at the end), and the game
      where you punch the blocks. Some of the combinations are impossible to get and
      because it isn''t in time to music (as Soundboxing/Audioshield are) it isn''t
      all that enjoyable.


      Anyway, these are my first thoughts and I''ll update as the game is updated.'
