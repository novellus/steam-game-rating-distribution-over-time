    review: "So me and my friends got this game on a whim, because it looked like\
      \ a fun. So here we go.\n\nPros. \nSo this game has been allot of fun for both\
      \ FPS and RTS. For RTS, you start off feeling like a god controlling what your\
      \ opponents do because they have little to nothing. Then as the game counts\
      \ down, it gets a little harder. Mind you, this is as we start learning how\
      \ to play. \nIn RTS, getting to control where your units go and who to attack\
      \ is amazing.\nIn FPS, Gun play feels good. Building buildings and upgrading\
      \ them is an awesome addition to protecting your objective.\nYou can go down\
      \ fast if you dont know what your doing so be careful.\n\nCons.\nManual relaoding\
      \ on guns. Sucks. But can be dealt with without issues. Going down is wonky\
      \ but can be over looked. Aiming is weird but I can get used to it. \nRTS wise,\
      \ controlling units is weird. It feels good in terms of starcraft or warcraft\
      \ feel but needs a bit of polishing. Trees tend to get in the way from point\
      \ of view and i get why you see them, but i feel like the trees should be more\
      \ transparent for the RTS person. Sometimes you'll be clicked on all your units\
      \ when you dont want to be and they all go where you tried clicking on a small\
      \ group to attack. The video shows you being able to tilt the camera while in\
      \ RTS, but i have yet to find it. would make playing RTS a bit better.\n\nGame-wise\
      \ cons. Ping and lag are an issue if you have too many bots in the game. This\
      \ is a 4v1 game, so try not to have more then that even if your just going against\
      \ bots. Bots are stupid so i suggest with friends or other people to play with.\n\
      Game needs some polishing game play wise. Im hoping the developers focus more\
      \ on game play, rather then graphics soon, because graphics are not bad by any\
      \ means. Balance is a little weird. Being able to make bug tanks that are hard\
      \ to kill int eh beginning of the game feels wrong. \n\nOverall Thoughts. This\
      \ game is amazing despite bugs in it. Me and my friends have only played a very\
      \ short time but are already looking forward to see what else comes up with\
      \ this game. FPS feels good, RTS is fun, and over game is amazing in it own\
      \ right. If your planning to get this game, have friends to start off with,\
      \ but if your feeling like you cant wait for that, there is a discord where\
      \ you can find people. The game is worth it in my opinion as long as the developers\
      \ keep up witht he game and make it better because it holds allot of potential\
      \ already from what we have played. We are looking forward to more int he future."
