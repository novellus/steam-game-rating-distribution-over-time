    review: 'It is my favourite game because when you get to the end  there is a score
      chart, whether it is genuine or not I do not know.  I have managed to get to
      the top once.  I suppose it gives you something to aim for.  I find it very
      relaxing and keeps my brain and coordination going.  I did hear that the scores
      were not correct why don''t they remake it ?
