The whistle is not the best but could be much worse but the sounds of the loco are aweful and once a certain speed is reached it sounds like a completely second sound source is used to cover the first making the loco look like a rush job.\n\nThe 4MT comes in a black BR scheme and looks a bit scruffy which would look right at home as tidiness would've fell away by the time the 4MT was around. Since this pack comes from the TS marketplace all you get is the loco and tender so no scenarios, coaches or wagons and like some marketplace items no manual either. It comes equipped with AWS so you no longer have to fear those yellows or reds and the headlamps can be swapped by holding CTRL and making you're way through the 1, 2, 3 key and etc.\n\nNow since the regulator goes to 100% instead of the usual 75% I did a test run to compare speeds and regulator settings\n\nRegulator:              Speed:\n100%                      0-11mph\n90%                        11-13mph\n80%                        13-16mph\n70%                        16-20mph\n60%                        20-26mph\n50%                        26-34mph\n40%                        34-46mph\n30%                        46-62mph\n20%                        62-84mph\n\nThis is just a rough guide and was tested on level track and no coaches/wagons so results will differ with load and gradient.\n\nOverall it's a nice loco and will do nicely for those wanting to add more to their scenarios even as background Ai. There is a sound pack from Steam Sounds Supreme for the 4MT but the site states it only works for the Just Trains version of the 4MT but who knows it might change one day.","timestamp_created":1506020661,"timestamp_updated":1506020661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48PL00t4Cd6v4hQE="}
