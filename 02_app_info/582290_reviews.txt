The game is still really buggy and I still don't feel I can recommend it in it's current state but it is definitely closer to a \"recommend\" than I thought it would be at this point. At the very least, it's kind of playable at this point and you can make some progress. \n\nFundamentally broken in just about every way imagineable. I thought the game couldn't possibly be as bad as the other reviewers made it out to be. I was wrong. It was even worse.","timestamp_created":1583893305,"timestamp_updated":1584486904,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577851593494415283","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1583976547,"developer_response":"Hello.
