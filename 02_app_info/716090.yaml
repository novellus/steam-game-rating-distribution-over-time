    review: "The board game format this is based on is AMAZING but this online adaptation\
      \ is a poor reflection of it.\n\nThe board game version of this is gorgeous\
      \ and easy to play. Despite having the exact same rules and 'pieces', this interface\
      \ was designed in such a way as to be counter-intuitive to play even for someone\
      \ who knows how to play Cottage Garden. If this was my first exposure to Cottage\
      \ Garden it would put me off Uwe Rosenberg's amazing games, not encourage me\
      \ to seek them out. \n\nSome specific issues:\n* Stilted/bulky turns, even when\
      \ all players online together and playing at same time\n* No volume scale for\
      \ music or sound effects or master volume option - just (1) off or (2) blasting\
      \ your ears (can't talk with friends online and run any game sound at the same\
      \ time)\n* Each of the \"you need to click this next as part of turn order\"\
      \ is not visually obvious. Easy to think you've finished your turn when in fact\
      \ everyone else is waiting for you to hit the slightly shadowed bottom right\
      \ button for 'for real done'\n* No exit/quit button for the game without having\
      \ to press Esc key or Alt-Ctrl-Del\n* Instead of watching players place pieces\
      \ while they're doing it, you watch an ummoving screen then when the player\
      \ finishes both they and you watch an animation of what they just did. Can we\
      \ just watch in real time, please? Like we do in real life when playing the\
      \ original board game version?\n* The interface and method for requesting and\
      \ accepting friend requests not intuitive\n* Would not be able to fumble through\
      \ how to play the game without either doing the demo or having played the board\
      \ game version first. If you can't just jump in and figure it out as you go,\
      \ or have a 'how to' or 'what comes next' available while playing, it won't\
      \ appealing to new users.\n* No reference materials available while playing\
      \ if you have questions. Did not see a summary anywhere of rules, turn order,\
      \ etc available on the interface while actively playing the game."
