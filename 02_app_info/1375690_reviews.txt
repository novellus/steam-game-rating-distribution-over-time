Level music is on spot in my opinion.\n\nIt's a little bit rough on (some) edges but overall I enjoyed the ride and was worth my time.\nIt took me about 4 hours to finish the game (about half the secrets) - the last 2 levels definitely had a spike in difficulty.\n\nThe good thing is you can tune the difficulty by yourself to some degree. Just grind some levels/gold and get more health/secrets.\n\nWill try another round later with 100% completion.\n\nI only encountered one gamebreaking bug due to me being me and playing games like no one does (complete level restart was necessary - always save after a level!). Had a talk with Jay, the Dev, and he will fix it soon. You can talk pretty open with him.","timestamp_created":1600027843,"timestamp_updated":1600027951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+Z/GxPQCfL3RoQI="}
