There's potential here, but it's controls aren't fantastic. To move, you swing your arms side to side to run, which feels fine. However, this causes basic sword combat to be extremely awkward as you are fighting the controls to swing while standing still. Not only that, but the game overall doesn't look fantastic, and the first fight is pretty awful. Just trying to keep track of the boss, or rather any enemy while your character constantly runs is just a nightmare, and overall the levels are just boring and messy. Wait for a price drop or more content or something, but $20 is asking a lot for something with a cool idea, but pretty poor execution.","timestamp_created":1535652296,"timestamp_updated":1575613364,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw8v737O4CeZTSqQE="}
