Being able to get right down and see all the cars, buses, trucks that you summon whizzing around the track is really something - or raising and rotating the table so that you can do so while standing.  It's a challenging puzzle game to try and put the track into place and avoid causing the cars to crash, and there are lots of options in how you direct traffic.  I was really blown away - there are a whole bunch of vehicle models, and each one is so nicely designed and painfully cute to launch and watch.  I forgot about trying to make money to upgraded to other tables/maps and just spent an hour or so \"playing toy cars\".  \n\nIt's a great game in its own right, but a delightful app to showcase VR to kids, or those who are still a kid at heart.  Highly recommended, especially at this steal of a price.","timestamp_created":1470159180,"timestamp_updated":1470159180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwjpqUptYCdN2PXg=="}
