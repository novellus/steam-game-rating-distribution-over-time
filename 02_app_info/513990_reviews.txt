Achievements are broken, devs will probably wont bother fixin them(as seen on discussion panel - \"game is too old\"). Had few holds on missions due to bad design, but they are all passable. A lot of bugs(Tip: don't alt+tab during mission or game will just close and you will lose mission progress). Pacing in missions is wrong too, sometimes had to afk for few minutes for resoureces to gather at the end of mission. overall its not \"Happy Empire\" its \"Sad empire\".
