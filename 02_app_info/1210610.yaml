      guards, erratic thugs, mindless drones, and a host of other unsusual enemies.

      the game a cinematic feel.<br><br><br><br><i>How long can you keep running?

    review: This game rules. Each set of rooms has a new idea, and they never outstay
      their welcome. It's short but you won't find an action game this good for this
      price anywhere else. Outstanding style, too.
