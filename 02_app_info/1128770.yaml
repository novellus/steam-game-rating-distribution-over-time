    about_the_game: "Use Your Brain! is a a mindbending take on the blockbreaker genre\
      \ of games where you have to control a paddle (textbook) on all four sides of\
      \ the screen to successfully destroy the blocks with your ball (brain). By playing\
      \ something familiar in a different way you give the biggest muscle in your\
      \ body a satisfying workout and have fun in the process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      -Bounce your brain off one of four textbooks or rely on your left or right side\
      \ brain to change your direction in mid air. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Challenging\
      \ levels that WILL take you multiple attempts. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Endless\
      \ mode which challenges you to keep your brain in the air for as long as possible\
      \ and beat your prior high score!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Deceptively difficult\
      \ gameplay. Will you forget to move the left/right textbook while focusing on\
      \ the top/bottom direction? Will you over use the left and right brain boosts\
      \ to your own demise? Or will you master the way of the brain?"
