    review: A great slice of life / romance story that really is a surprisingly lengthy.
      Definitely for people who like a good long read! Excellent artwork and music.
      It's a great piece of software, that, sure, has a few wrinkles, but give how
      long it is, and how little it costs to buy, still translates in to a real bargain.
      Oh, and it's written and presented in the first person so you get a real sense
      that you are the protagonist. The title, incidentally, School of Talents, refers
      to the fact that ( most of ) the students have special abilities, the concept
      of which I am sure you are well used to if, like me, you watch loads and loads
      of anime! Having said that, the story is not one that insists that the reader
      is a real fan of anime to appreciate. Some anime defintely needs the uninitiated
      to be lowered in gently (!!). So all in all if you like a good long read, with
      a great story, and love anime art style, then this is definitely a novel you
      will enjoy. And lets be honest, even if you don't, you haven't exactly spent
      a lot of money buying it, but you really have helped some talented people with
      their startup venture.
