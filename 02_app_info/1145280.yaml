      \ />\r\nQuickly dive into a game of hockey with 2 skaters and a goalie on each\
      \ side. You'll have to pass, shoot, and hit your way to victory even it that\
      \ means taking out the ref. Plug in more controllers and have a Blockey party\
      \ with your friends as you can work together or take each other on. And if you're\
      \ ever lost in life you can even try our &quot;Ask the Bear&quot; mode.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nThis game was originally made in 2010 for the Xbox 360 indie marketplace.\
      \ It was my first ever project which put me down the path of software development."

    review: Fun little game, plays sort of like 3v3 air hockey.  The AI is challenging,
      and the fighting mechanics reminded me of playing Nintendo World Cup on the
      NES back in the day.  I wish more sports-themed video games remembered that
      they are video games, like this one does.
