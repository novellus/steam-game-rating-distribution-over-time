    review: 'It looks like it''s going to be really useful. I can think of a few uses
      already. I had some issues, but they were settings that were on/off/modified,
      so if you/re having computer issues, try looking through this program, and make
      sure nothing is set wrong. If a setting looks like it could potentially be the
      issue, go ahead a try modifying it (There''s a "reset all" setting just in case).


      It looks like I have a lot of hours, but it just starts up with the computer,
      and I leave it running.'
