    review: 'Never heard of this movie. What pushed me towards making the purchase
      was 1. the sale. and 2. recognizing Jason Tobin (from Better Luck Tomorrow and
      Tokyo Drift) and Byron Mann (from The Big Short and Street Fighter). Did not
      recognize anyone else, but all the performances were fantastic.


      Overall, very impressed by this movie. Everyone involved did a great job.


      The movie relies heavily on it''s pacing and build up of tension, which is superb
      throughout. But I can see it being a problem for some people. The finale is
      slightly predicatible but its delivery makes up for it. Again, I think the acting
      is great, the location unique, and the plot is dark. I highly recommend.'
