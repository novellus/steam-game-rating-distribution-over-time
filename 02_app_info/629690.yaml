    short_description: Vaporum is a grid-based dungeon crawler RPG in an original
      steampunk setting, inspired by old-school classics of the genre. Stranded in
      the middle of an ocean, in front of a gigantic tower, the hero has to find out
      what the place is, what happened there, and most importantly, who he is.
