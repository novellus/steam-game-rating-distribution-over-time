Now I'm just having a bit of fun running around the world.)\n\nAltered Destiny is an adventure game where the player controls the character with the arrow keys and types commands with the keyboard.\n\nThere are two specific issues I want to address with this review, which could affect your decision to purchase Altered Destiny:\n\n1.  This is the inferior MS-DOS version, and not the Amiga version, which has significantly better graphics.  I realise there used to be some commercial rights issues with running Amiga games via emulators.  However, Amiga Forever provides a solution for selling Amiga games on PC running through emulators.  Publishers like this one should look into it.\n\n2.  This game has one of the worst parsers ever.  (The parser being the typing interface.)  The vocabulary for general purpose English words is tiny, even as it contains many strange sci-fi terms inherent to the game world.  Many of these might not even occur to the player to enter.  (Make notes!!)  Because of the limitations of the parser, completing the game may very well prove impossible, even for very experienced adventurers (like myself *sigh*).\n\nEven considering the above two points of contention, I'm still going to recommend adventure fans pick up Altered Destiny.  The world building is fantastic.  And it's a shame Accolade never released a sequel.\n","timestamp_created":1606334191,"timestamp_updated":1606334191,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42dK+gPYCetXpsAI="}
