    review: 'I just want to start off and say that the game itself is fun and challenging.
      Every level feels very satisfying to clear, and the combination of a puzzle/bullet
      hell game makes it very skill intensive.


      The music is also very good, the songs are really catchy, and you won''t mind
      having it play for a couple hours.


      In terms of visuals, its simple and clean. The only problem I have with it is
      that every world has the exact same theme, which isn''t that big of a deal,
      but I think changing up the colours or something in each world could make the
      player a little more excited whenever they enter a new world, and it would help
      keep the game fresh.


      Now there is one big issue I have and that''s the lag. When I first started
      playing the game it ran fine, but as time went on the game just kept running
      slower and slower. Now, every time I open the game and start a level, it feels
      like its running at 10fps (exaggerated but you get the idea). I don''t have
      the greatest laptop but I can run much heavier games without any issues, so
      I feel like the game could be optimised better. I''m not sure of the exact cause
      of this, but I feel like dying a lot can cause the game to slow down a ton,
      or it could be something else entirely. Either way, please fix this! (Also,
      having a way to see your frame rate would be neat)


      EDIT: Another feature I would like is a restart world button, instead of having
      to go back to the level select every time.


      But overall, I highly recommend this game if you''re looking for a fun challenge.'
