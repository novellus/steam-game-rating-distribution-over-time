I don't see it being a game I get back often. I thought it would be cool to play on my arcade cabinet but it's just too hard to control. Even on a keyboard the game is uncontrollable.\nI like the concept and for a dollar it's ok to get just to try it but don't expect more than 30 minutes of trying to get somewhere. \nI dislike the lack of options, no monitor or graphical settings, cannot rebind your controller keys (you can use Steam's controller configuration at least), cannot play on a vertical monitor. That means the playfield is very small because of the cabinet around the game. \nI like the graphics and simple layout but that's it.","timestamp_created":1604266495,"timestamp_updated":1604266495,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wYHvwvUCf8fUqwI="}
