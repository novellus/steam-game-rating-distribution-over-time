You use your typing to interact with the elements in the game's world. There is room to explore the beautiful, origami world, but the unfolding of the main story is rather straightforward. The story is engaging to me as well, and makes me want to continue playing to find out what happens in the story. Collecting treasures help you see glimpses into the milestones of the in-game author's life. Highly recommend this game. Have a well-specced computer to fully take advantage of the beautiful game world and graphics.","timestamp_created":1609873724,"timestamp_updated":1609873724,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpvL86fYCeYvlwAI="}
