      /><br><br><br>Sometime in the future, a universal threat called the 'dega' have
      appeared in earth's orbit.  Earth has called upon 15 of the galaxies best known
      heroes, stemming from planets light years away, and even from earth, to finally
      stop this dega madness.<br><br>The goal of Dega Madness is to move your vehicle
      from the start of an orbital platform to the end of it without getting hit by
      any roaming dega's.  But it's not that straightforward.  Each vehicle comes
      equipped with it's own ability to help you get to the end, which you can use
      one time per vehicle.  If you get hit, you'll be sent back to the start of the
      platform with a new vehicle, and can use your ability once again.  As the stages
      progress, more Dega's show up, and your vehicle gets bigger/slower.  So as you
      go on, it gets progressively more difficult this way.  Luckily, if you're a
      skillful player, bonus lives will be rewarded by completing each level without
      dying.<br><br>There's also a co-op mode as well, where you can either work together
      to try and beat it, or face off against each other to see who can get to the
      end first.  You're going to be sharing lives, so if your second player isn't
      as good, you'll have to pick up the slack!<br><br>Hope you enjoy!

    review: 'If this was his first game, there''s some good points and some bad points.  The
      graphics are pretty nice with relatively unique designs, the gameplay is okay,
      every ability is varied and gives some spice, but near the end the gameplay
      is shockingly hard, but not necessarily due to the progressive challenge.  I
      died a few times because my character was too slow to actually move out of the
      way of the Dega.  Sound is pretty good, but more than one track would be nice.  Menu''s
      need work, being unable to exit from the main screen is really weird, needs
      to be fixed.


      Not bad for what it is.'
