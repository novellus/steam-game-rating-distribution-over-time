You need based on the information on the note to determine the code for the door to the second floor. Not all information from a note needs to be used.\nThe levers on the tower are activated by the quest.\nTo show current quest: press RMB.\n\nMuch work still needs to be done, I agree with you. But so far there is not a cent for further development. \nPlease wait and return to the game with the following updates. \nThanks for your review!)"}],"cursor":"AoJw4dv5+/ICdJjskAI="}
