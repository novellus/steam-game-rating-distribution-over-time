Spooky narrative that is interesting, bonus chapter that adds to the story, fast travel map, and casual setting with fast skips for those of us who just want to play for fun.  It took me about 9 hours, so decent length for a HOG, too.  One of the best new HOGs I've played recently!","timestamp_created":1609091211,"timestamp_updated":1609091211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47+vT0vYCfbDpvQI="}
