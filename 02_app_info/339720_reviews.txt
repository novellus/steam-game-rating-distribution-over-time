There is a few of negatives, the obvios bugs, boring, simple graphics, it can't change the keybinding (yes I'm using other layout) just move boxes and shoot.. Is not completely bad, yet I don't want to wast more time on the review, read the other reviews.","timestamp_created":1609304430,"timestamp_updated":1609304706,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvaGC2fYCcbTWvgI="}
