    review: "So a short time playing, and immediately there's something that's annoyed\
      \ the hell out of me with this game.\n - If it's not been compiled against Linux,\
      \ don't market it as being supported on it. This is built on Unity so there\
      \ should be no reason you've not compiled a linux version, if you've not specifically\
      \ leveraged Windows specific functions.\n\nMore about the gameplay:\nThe 3D\
      \ 4K tack is far to narrow on a 1080P display, which strains to look at it.\
      \ Using Musynx as an example, the track almost goes the full width of the screen,\
      \ which makes it easier to follow.\n\nThe UI needs some love and attention.\
      \ It's not the most sleek of systems, and it feels almost \"cobbled\" together.\
      \ I'm aware that this is an early access game, so it would make sense that there's\
      \ still work that needs to be done.\n\nSince I'm using the Steam play option,\
      \ running it through proton 5.0, I've already had the game lock up exiting a\
      \ beatmap, and going back to the main screen. It's also slightly clunky, which\
      \ means it doesn't give the smoothest experience.\n\nWith the game in its current\
      \ state, I'm going to refrain from recommending it, but I would like to see\
      \ it improve over time."
