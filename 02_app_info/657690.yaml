      /><br><br>Set sail across the Atlantic with your best friend, food. Food will
      keep you alive and food will keep you well- you get food by throwing harpoons
      at fish and turtles. Then one day BAM! The RNG screws you over and throws a
      pirate ship at you and you're forced to fight and defend your food! <br><br>The
      next thing you know, Johnny Macguffin is dying from an infected battle wound
      and you're <strong>amputating his leg</strong> to save his life- then you realize
      everyone is starving because Marvin Buttercup ate all the food and you're out
      of harpoons, on a raft, 2,000 miles from land, and it's raining.<br><br>The
      story is yours and unique every playthrough!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657690/extras/Features_White.png?t=1594755651"

    review: "Sigh. Alright look, one thing in particular is driving me up the wall\
      \ about this game and it's not just me, a significant ratio of the negative\
      \ reviews mention the dreaded [b][i]fishing minigame.[/i][/b] I was annoyed\
      \ so much, so quickly, as to spend a good 20-30 minutes of my ~1-hour playtime\
      \ gathering stats to give this a proper evaluation. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT FOOD\
      \ AND FISHING IN THIS GAME.\n\nYour crew are industrial strength garburators\
      \ when it comes to food. Time passes in this game at a rate of about 1 hour\
      \ to 1 second realtime, and food is deducted every 12 ingame hours. Each crewmate\
      \ somehow goes through 10kg of food per deduction. Which means that, assuming\
      \ you've still got a full crew, you go through [b]100kg of food per day,[/b]\
      \ or every 24 seconds real-time. The only real starter ship you have, the sloop,\
      \ has a maximum capacity of 600kg of food. Generally speaking, you won't have\
      \ the money to afford more than 50-200kg of food when starting a fresh run.\
      \ It's beyond ridiculous. You'll have gone through your food stores pretty much\
      \ by the time you're out of sight of port. Hell, even on the rare occasion that\
      \ you CAN load your stores up to full before departing, they don't exactly last\
      \ much longer.\n\nSo, naturally, you need to fish for food en route. There are\
      \ two ways of doing this: the fishing minigame, which uses dirt-cheap harpoons,\
      \ or the rather expensive fishing net, which will inevitably be caught by a\
      \ wave and torn from your grip after ~3-5 uses.\n\nA quick breakdown of the\
      \ various means of obtaining food:\n\n[h1]Just Buy It[/h1]\nFood costs ~\xA3\
      10 per 25kg. This varies from port to port and when trading with other ships,\
      \ but it's relatively expensive, and unreliable considering its limited availability.\n\
      \n[h1]Fishing Net[/h1]\nA fishing net costs \xA3120. One scoop with it is quick\
      \ and painless, and usually nets from 30 to 90 kg of fish, seeming to reliably\
      \ average at ~60. You'll lose it after ~4 uses, so, let's say you can generally\
      \ expect to get 240-250kg of food for your \xA3120. Compared to \xA3100/250kg\
      \ as a baseline price from port, not a great deal, but not terrible. You'd still\
      \ be better off buying food outright in most cases, assuming you're skint and\
      \ can only choose one or the other. Port inventories are also completely randomized,\
      \ so there's a good chance you won't even be given this option to begin with.\n\
      \n[h1]The Fishing Minigame[/h1]\nOh boy, what an option! Much like with the\
      \ net, you can fish pretty much anywhere, even in a snowstorm. You need harpoons\
      \ to fish, harpoons cost \xA31-2 apiece, you can hold 20 in a sloop, they're\
      \ [i]only expended if you miss your target,[/i] and generally speaking the minigame\
      \ is well balanced. Fish aren't too hard to hit. Borderline infinite food from\
      \ the cheapest item in the game! What's the catch?\n\nThe minigame itself, and\
      \ your patience with it. First, there's the music loop. I'm not up on my sea\
      \ shanties, but it's a 14-second loop with the same chord progression as \"\
      Blow the Man Down\", so, get used to hearing that ad nauseam. Second, you only\
      \ get 10kg per fish speared, [b]and that's assuming you're playing as the fisherman.\
      \ God save your miserable soul if you play as anyone else, because then fish\
      \ are worth half that amount instead.[/b] Over the course of a dozen or so iterations\
      \ of the minigame, I came out at 30-40 seconds to get 100kg of fish. If you've\
      \ been paying attention, you may already notice the problem.\n\n[b]IT TAKES\
      \ LONGER TO CATCH FISH IN THE MINIGAME THAN IT DOES TO EAT THEM.[/b] 30-40 seconds\
      \ in the minigame (assuming you're playing the fisherman, if not, then double\
      \ that!!) is enough to feed your crew for 24 seconds of travel time. This also\
      \ means that that singular, monotone 14-second loop of that one sea shanty is\
      \ officially half of this game's soundtrack. \n\nI don't know what wonders are\
      \ hidden behind the veil of Fishing Minigame: The Game, and I no longer care.\
      \ I really hate saying this, given its status as a one-man indie project, when\
      \ it runs well, has a decent aesthetic, everything seems to work as intended,\
      \ there's even a Linux port, and it has a 94% approval rating! But I would surmise\
      \ that the people who DO enjoy the game enjoy it [i]in spite of[/i] this accursed\
      \ minigame, as opposed to [i]because of[/i] it. I haven't been put off by an\
      \ otherwise enjoyable game's repetition this badly since Sigma Star Saga decided\
      \ that procedurally generated 1-2 minute shmup stages were the perfect substitute\
      \ for already repetitive random-encounter RPG battles.\n\nPS: The game doesn't\
      \ save if you're not at port. It just deletes your save whenever you happen\
      \ to die (unless you're playing on easy mode). Pretty awkward and inconvenient\
      \ system."
