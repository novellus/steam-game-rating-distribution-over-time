    review: "WARNING:  This is just a demo from the GameGuru development software\
      \ exported and being sold under a different name.  Zero work by this corrupt\
      \ and toxic \"developer\" who is not a developer but just a thief clogging up\
      \ Steam with more trash.\n\nHere's the image you load into with this game:\n\
      https://imgur.com/1lGk0oz\n\nIt made my M.I.S.S. series for obvious reasons\
      \ where you can see my live reaction HERE:\nhttps://youtu.be/93D-sE8mGBY \n\n\
      NOT Recommended at any cost!  It's a DEMO called \"The Asylum\" exported from\
      \ GameGuru and being sold as is."
