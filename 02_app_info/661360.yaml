    review: "Pretty straight forward platformer, with excellent graphics, great soundtrack,\
      \ and a programming theme. I am using a xbox-style gamepad controller, and it\
      \ is working fine.\n\nSome technical issues running on ubuntu linux 16.04...\
      \ \nI have no problem on an older computer with intel graphic drivers, but with\
      \ a computer with a new AMD card and radeon mesa drivers, this is unplayable.\
      \ For some strange reason, the platforms do not appear in the game levels. Another\
      \ small thing is that the password keychain app came up when the game started.\
      \ Not sure what was happening there."
