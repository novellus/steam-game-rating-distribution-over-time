    review: 'Whilst I acknowledge I''m not the audience for this game, I wouldn''t
      recommend it to people who do enjoy walking simulators.

      But before I get into issues I have with the game I''ll talk about the strengths,
      firstly the game does have great atmosphere that gives off a sense of dread
      despite the lack of a substantial threat to contend with, also I was quite interested
      in the story even though I only got to see very little of it.

      Anyway now for the flaws, the game''s lighting is dark to the point you can
      barely see, while this does help with the atmosphere it also compounds the fact
      the only way you''ll only know a puzzle exists when pressing w stops making
      any substantial progress at which point you''ll have to find the puzzle and
      then try to find the thing A you''ll have to use on thing B, you''re expected
      to do that while effectively being blind and the prompts to move stuff may or
      may not require the precision of a brain surgeon to find as well.

      In short interesting story and great atmosphere, shame you can''t see anything
      including the rather underwhelming puzzles and the items needed to solve them.'
