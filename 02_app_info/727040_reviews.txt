I wish there were more puzzles that utilized multiple cubes with different gravity alignments because that was fresh, but to my memory it only happened once. \nlastly, i thought the tone/atmosphere/aesthetic was consistent, unnerving, and intriguing. better than ripping off Portal with the \"test subject\" trope.","timestamp_created":1609488004,"timestamp_updated":1609488004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwur693vYCetyqvwI="}
