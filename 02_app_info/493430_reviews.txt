Everyone interested in chemistry should check it out.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit sad. I bought this software when it was still called Nano-One. At that time, it was a simple program for building molecules in VR, and it had a lot of potential. What I wanted was that program but a bit more advanced.\nIf I had known it would become \"free\", with crazy expensive licenses that have to be updated every year, I would never have bought it. It's certainly not what I was looking for, and I don't want to economically support a company that uses that business model, even if it was just 7 euros. I'm also dissapointed that the software now requires a network connection to run.\n\nI can't really give it a negative review, because it's still an amazing software, and it's amazing that it is in VR. But it's not the program I paid for, and I would like my money back.","timestamp_created":1482578941,"timestamp_updated":1536152954,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.615742921829223633","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwybz21OUCdseIbQ=="}
