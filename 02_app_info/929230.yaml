      I''ve only played a few missions, but I''ve enjoyed it so far.  It''s a VR FPS
      on an island full of velociraptors.  You''re dropped into a facility with various
      screens that serves as the mission select area.  You pick a mission (and time
      of day, night missions are great) and you''re whisked away to complete an objective
      ranging from collecting items and finding an escape route to holding down an
      area for reinforcements, all while fighting off velociraptors.  Overall it''s
      kind of simplistic; sound, textures and AI are all just alright.  In the end
      it''s a fun experience, it''s inexpensive and I love dinosaurs so it a thumbs
      up from me.'
