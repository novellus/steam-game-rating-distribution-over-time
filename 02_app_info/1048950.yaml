      threat.</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Fly</h2>Ride the winds over the desert biomes
      in your hot air balloon powered airship. Build a propeller engine and a helm

      Desert Skies Story</h2>It's the American Wild West gone horribly wrong.<br><br>It

      Then the first town was wiped out. Now years have passed and everyone has fled
      east, leaving behind a ghost land.<br><br>You were part of an expedition organised
      by famed scientist Nikola Tesla to investigate the creatures and their origin.
      A fully stocked hot air balloon kept you all safely off the desert floor, until
      a sandstorm destroyed most of the airship and took the rest of your team with
      it.<br><br>Now you're the sole survivor, out of supplies and clinging to what's
      left of your airship as it drifts down towards the sand. You've spotted some
      wagons in the desert ahead and have just enough fuel to make it there. You might
      find supplies, and if you can scavenge enough to get back into the air then
      you might be able to limp from location to location and rebuild enough to fly
      far west, solve the mystery and stop the monsters...<br><br>But that means landing.
      The creatures are attracted to noise, and on the desert floor they can hear
      you scream.

    review: "As promised I am going back and updating my review. Alright! Updates\
      \ have returned! With the promise of more updates in the future I am very excited\
      \ to see where this game will go.\n   Currently, the game is not that long.\
      \ You can maybe knock it out in about four to 6 hours. Still a good amount of\
      \ time for how much it costs. The world itself could use a bit more to it but\
      \ they have shown in these past few updates that they know this and are on the\
      \ case. The crafting system is enjoyable but be ready to dedicate a huge chunk\
      \ of your ship to it. You also will slowly begin to rely less on the environment\
      \ for survival as you progress which is a good thing because it is right around\
      \ the time you will be more focused on building for fun. The air ship is still\
      \ a bit touchy on navigating and I even managed to escape the world at one point\
      \ but still a good system. \n   A major problem though is in my opinion, once\
      \ you get a knife the seeker, main enemy of the game, is a nonthreat. You just\
      \ poke him in an easy quick time event and take no damage. Also if you build\
      \ a tier 2 bed you lose no items on death. So definitely makes it more casual\
      \ friendly but less hardcore if that is your style.\n  I definitely recommend\
      \ this game if you enjoy your crafting survival games as it is a definitely\
      \ new experience in the genre."
