    review: 'This game is not working properly. There is always a crash on the boss
      of the 6th floor not allowing you to go any further. I don''t know how close
      or far I was from the end but I grinded a lot before that.


      Besides that, gotta say this game had me surprised, but not in a good sense.
      I thought I was in for card games and strip-fights. Nope. This game is first
      and foremost a dungeon crawler made in RPG maker where for every fight you''re
      going to have you have to grind. And grind. And grind. And grind. Entrances
      and exits to floor can be very frustrating to find and I have several times
      wandering the same level for around 15 minutes before I find the tiny black
      spot hidden in a corner and aggravated by your small line of sight.


      Combat during the dungeon can be pretty frustrating, as your hit chance is around
      70% at best, everything considered; except for magic. The mage girl was so OP
      but you needed her so badly.


      You can go ahead and play this game if you want, but I wouldn''t if I were you.
      Wish I could have the time I grinded back hoping that I could get my strip battles.'
