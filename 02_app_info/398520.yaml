    review: "I personally think the soundtrack here, more than the average game, makes\
      \ a huge part of this game's personality. Not only does this help define the\
      \ game outside of the other skate games (a la THPS and Skate), it also helps\
      \ that it keeps up the game pacing. You're doing dozens of tries to nail that\
      \ full combo run, and it's nice to have something not quite so aggressive and\
      \ upfront, especially since each run could be anywhere from 10s to 40s. \n\n\
      But overall, how good is the music? A solid 8-9/10. Honestly could've benefited\
      \ from maybe a couple more tracks, as you'll no doubt listen to all of it multiple\
      \ times in a few short sessions, but I do realise this is a smaller game with\
      \ a correspondingly smaller team. Everything is suitably chilled out, helping\
      \ you reach a calmer state. The soundtrack's also pretty dang consistent too,\
      \ something I really do appreciate. While I do realise this is a compilation\
      \ of previously released tracks, nothing here is atrociously mixed, nor is anything\
      \ of subpar quality. Nice mix of house, chill, minimal. \n\nIf you're into music\
      \ collecting however, the tracks are unfortunately in 160 kbps MP3. No FLAC\
      \ lossless for you, but it's also annoying that a lot of the tags aren't filled\
      \ in. Mp3tag is your friend. On decent headphones the loss in quality is noticeable,\
      \ but again, it's nothing atrocious. \n\nFavourite track: [i]Lust-StarRo[/i]"
