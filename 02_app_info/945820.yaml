    review: "Very over-priced. This game is junk. A bunch of assets thrown randomly\
      \ in a room for you to find. \n\nThe interface is poor, mouse speed is painfully\
      \ slow, there's no setting for it, you have to hold right-mouse button to look\
      \ about, like why on earth would you not just use mouse look? And because RMB\
      \ has to be held, the mouse-cursor ends up at the edges of the screen so when\
      \ you actually want to click something you have to bring it back to the center\
      \ of the screen manually, it's a mess. There's not even a custom mouse cursor.\n\
      \nInstead of offering a choice of the TWO rooms when you start, instead they've\
      \ put that in settings. FML.\n\nThere are no achievements, so there's very little\
      \ reason to play this game.\n\nHow do you make a HOG less enjoyable? Stick a\
      \ timer on it, make movement difficult and restrict your view by giving you\
      \ a torch that you can;t even move around easily.\n\nSummary: fail, I wouldn't\
      \ recommend this game even for 10c."
