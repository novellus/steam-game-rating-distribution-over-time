    review: 'First, let me say I love the base game, Fallen Enchantress: Legendary
      Heroes. I have played hundreds and hundreds of hours of it, and I still play
      it years after its release. However, I cannot recommend this DLC. Fighting battles
      on too many of these tactical maps is simply not fun. I disabled this DLC and
      no longer use it...ever.'
