    review: "J'adorais ce jeu au d\xE9but mais il y a eu un bug.  La cl\xE9 restait\
      \ dans l'incin\xE9rateur et il \xE9tait impossible de la prendre.  Il a faullu\
      \ trouver comment effacer le fichier de sauvegarde sur l'ordinateur et recommencer.\
      \  Ensuite, la section o\xF9 il faut tirer du fusil, je n'aime vraiment pas\
      \ \xE7a.  Je pensais faire un escape room avec puzzles et non pas tirer du fusil.\
      \ Je d\xE9teste ce genre de jeu! N'ayant aucune habilet\xE9 \xE0 le faire, je\
      \ suis conic\xE9e l\xE0 et donc assez frust\xE9e...  Bref, ce jeu avait un tr\xE8\
      s bon potentiel au d\xE9but, m\xEAme tr\xE8s int\xE9ressant, dommage que la\
      \ suite ne soit pas \xE0 la hauteur."
