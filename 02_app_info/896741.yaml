    review: Beautiful model and the flight characteristics are very real.  But when
      you put the gear down for landing the gear warning horn goes off and will not
      subside even after landing and the nose gear appears to be locked upon landing.  No
      steering available after landing.  Reloaded the aircraft hoping to fix the problem
      but it persist. Tried to find fix but unable to locate any documentation or
      manual that might help.   I have removed the plane from by flight simulator
      and do not recommend this aircraft due to its deficiencies.
