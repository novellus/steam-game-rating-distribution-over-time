Game is a little less than 30 minutes long. It is pretty much a walking simulator and gameplay is simple, but very effective. There's a great sense of terror as you go walking/running around in the dark. \n\nEventually you get into the tunnels and that's where the game gets fun. I don't want to spoil the game, but let's just say the game does a great job with light and dark and creepy sounds all around in an enclosed area. You do have free locomotion but no smooth/snap turning (have to turn in real life). There's a very thin story ... but all you really need to know is to run for your life!\n\nRate 7.5. I would rate it higher, but it is a little expensive for 30 minutes of content although this is a nice game to [strike] scare friends / family with [/strike] introduce friends / family to VR ;)","timestamp_created":1541121780,"timestamp_updated":1541121780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546827793121337891","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkoWB6eYCd5jtrQE="}
