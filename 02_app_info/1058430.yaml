    about_the_game: '<i>A Legionary''s Life</i> lets you play as a Roman soldier during
      the years of the Second Punic War and beyond. Rise up through the ranks and
      win prestigious awards or just focus on making it home in one piece; it''s up
      to you.<br><br>This is a unique single-player game with RPG elements, extensive
      usage of attribute and skill checks, a turn-based combat system involving many
      variables (including morale, reach, confined space and high ground) and a touch
      of roguelike features. Among them, permadeath. If you are unfamiliar with the
      term, it means you''ll have to start over if your character dies; but don''t
      worry: the game is designed to be replayable and you''ll see only a fraction
      of it in each run. Also, you''ll be able to spend points on your next legionary
      based on how well your most successful characters performed.<h2 class="bb_tag">Try
      the demo</h2>This game is unlike most RPGs. Your character won''t be successful
      at everything. Challenges should be picked carefully based on your legionary''s
      strengths and weaknesses. In general, the game is not designed to put you in
      a situation where the odds are against you unless you willingly step into it.
      At times, you may fail to perform a task and take a mild penalty in Morale and/or
      Opinions (a measure of your relationships with relevant entities within the
      game, like your superiors and your fellow soldiers). Don''t get discouraged
      when this happens, it is nothing more than a minor setback you can easily recover
      from.<br><br>Most of all, I strongly recommend that you try the demo before
      you buy this game. It''s here on Steam and it''s free, there''s no better way
      to make sure that <i>A Legionary''s Life</i> suits your taste. The demo contains
      the first 3 parts out of 11.'

    review: 'After multiple playthroughs that took about three hours each, I can say
      with certainty that this game is fantastic. First off, It understands what it''s
      trying to achieve, and it does it quite well. The Graphics are reasonably basic,
      but this is the type of game that doesn''t require magnanimous visuals or textures.


      What you essentially have is a choose-your-own-adventure game where you''re
      a Roman citizen who''s conscripted into a newly formed legion during the second
      Punic war with Carthage. I''d say approximately half your time is spent choosing
      how you spend your time in camp, training with your sword and shield, socializing
      with your fellow legionaries, earning the trust and respect of your Centurion
      by volunteering for extra shifts of guard duty, which affects your stats and
      leads to many different opportunities throughout the story. Then the more significant
      battles begin, and you go through a series of turn based fights that, in my
      own opinion, are a real strong point of the game. First off, unlike the stereotypical
      RPG experience, even though they''re generally small fights, you do feel like
      you''re part of a much larger battle. You might be one-on-one with an enemy
      of the republic, and the game will say, "Hey, the battle is about to shift,
      so you might not be fighting this guy much longer." Then you can decide whether
      to go full offensive and try to finish him off and gain all the glory that entails,
      or merely choosing whether your situation calls for staying back and trying
      to survive. It truly does make you feel like a small cog in a much more giant
      wheel.


      There are lots of options in combat too, and they aren''t just there for fun.
      Managing your health to keep yourself from dying is one thing, but you also
      have to maintain a sharp eye on your legionnaire''s balance and stamina; the
      same goes for those you''re facing in combat. You''re also given different methods
      on how to manage those things. I have encountered many enemies that committing
      all of my legionaries energy into attacking them relentlessly was pointless.
      Better to feint and try to throw them off balance first. In that regard, one
      thing that greatly impressed me was how exemplary the game is at giving the
      player information I needed when I needed it. There isn''t always a transparent
      difference between what you should or shouldn''t decide, which only adds to
      why this game is excellent; I''ve played games that offered you nine different
      choices, but only one of them made genuine sense, and what''s the point to that?
      Sometimes, you can just be choosing between shades of gray. But I found that
      it was always pretty easy to understand what the implications were of my choices,
      and that''s not easy for a developer to pull off.


      From a story point of view, the choices are interesting, and I think the best
      way to explain them will be by summing up how my first playthrough ended. The
      overall campaign was going well, we outnumbered Carthage, and we''re poised
      to strike and crush them once and for all. My legionnaire had been recently
      promoted, doing well, and I probably could have chosen a more cautious playstyle
      for this battle and not doing anything overly bold. After all, Rome was going
      to win the war regardless. So I''m there on the battlefield, and with a text
      event, the game tells me I''m in the shield line when I see witness skirmishers
      attempting to retreat and are about to and be run down. The game didn''t complicate
      my choices. I could stay in the shield line like a good legionnaire or break
      formation and attempt to help them. It would''ve been obvious what to do in
      a real-world scenario; in gaming, where you''re usually the "Mighty Hero," it
      almost always makes sense to take the more "Heroic" approach. My instincts told
      me to do the "Heroic" option, but I had had some success recently acting like
      a hero, so I chose that option. Well, I quickly found myself in a one sided
      battle against three formidable enemies. I held my own and killed one thinking
      maybe I could survive this, but once a new foe almost immediately entered to
      replaced him, I knew I was to suffer the consequences of my actions. I decided
      to pull an Iceman and adopted a  defensive strategy, hoping that if I could
      hold on long enough, the game might tell me that my cohort was rushing in to
      save me; events like that happen too, but it was not to be. I was Overwhelmed
      and died soon after, game over, and this Centurion bled out on a field somewhere
      in Africa dreaming of the home he might one day return to during that battle.


      What''s genuinely interesting is, I didn''t feel cheated by that. I had made
      the decision, even though I knew it was risky. I have done things like that
      before and barely survived the day; knowing that you really can die adds real
      weight to your choices. In retrospect, it seemed like the right end to that
      particular soldier''s career. A well fought life, in my opinion.


      I Absolutely recommend 9/10.'
