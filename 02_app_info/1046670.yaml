    about_the_game: Delirium is a haunting first-person psychological horror game,
      made from the ground up exclusively for VR. A small indie game built around
      bigger themes of loss, lust and self-inflicted misery. It's a tale of Jon and
      Anna who moved into a long abandoned home and vanish within 30 days, without
      leaving a trace.<br><br><strong><u>Main Features:</u></strong><br><br><strong>Exploration
      Based:</strong> The emphasis is to explore this house and discover its secrets
      through each room and secret areas.<br><br><strong>Narrative Driven:</strong>
      The entire game is based on a narrative about this house and its inhabitants.
      It invites the player to explore the world to unfold the story.<br><br><strong>First-Person
      VR Exclusive:</strong> A VR exclusive first-preson game where everything from
      environments to interaction is built with the idea of VR in mind.<br><br><strong>Atmospheric:</strong>
      Atmosphere driven cinematic game, to convey the foreboding and unsettling feeling
      that the house imposes effectively. A horror game is less dependent on monsters
      and more on the dreary atmosphere of its world. The very air should feel thick
      with the impending dread to convey the essence of psychological horror.<br><br><strong>Puzzles/Gameplay:</strong>
      There are locked doors and secret places that need a combination lock or a puzzle
      or a key item to navigate. <br><br><strong>Audio Diaries:</strong> Audio dairies
      are scattered in the place, providing key first-hand account of tragedies that
      befell the past inhabitants and what occurred to them over the 30 days.<br><br>Lastly,
      I'd like to say that this is a short one-man made game that tries to be ambitious
      despite its small scope. It's pure indie in its essence and my humble node to
      all the inspiring horror classic games and cinema that I have grown up with.

    review: "Spent the first hour of the game stuck. Couldn't find any way of progressing\
      \ despite going over every room. Didn't have a lot of fun, so refunded. \n\n\
      I suspect the reason I couldn't progress was that I couldn't move through an\
      \ open doorway (into the blue room).\n\nThe game needs some object outlines\
      \ or hints."
