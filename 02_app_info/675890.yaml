    review: 'I''ve been working on a review for a while, and I made the mistake of
      focusing on the criticisms so much there''s little room for the positives.


      Whether I finish the other review or not, let me summarize here:


      Coming from a person that doesn''t like anime/manga or Visual Novels, this one
      is a positive experience. The dialogue can be a mixed bag; however, the characters-
      Desdemona herself in particular- manage to be oddly endearing and likable, and
      while it does likely harken to anime tropes (I don''t know the genre well enough
      to say), I can say the characters manage to be interesting, likeable, and unique
      in a way that anime generally fails to make happen.


      [spoiler]Except for Marcus. We need an update with a plot line where he dies.
      Make it happen, Brandon; it should qualify as an additional happy ending.[/spoiler]


      The game takes a nigh-pure slice-of-life approach, which definitely differs
      from my own preference of an overarcing "mission"-oriented plot. This gives
      an interesting take on subplots and mini-arcs that compose the experience. I
      admit I''m still trying to find words to describe this, but I can say it''s
      not without its appeal in some cases.


      Better yet it''s worth it for pushing forward.


      Eventually I probably will finalize the review I''ve written, and while it will
      have plenty of criticism, it will remain positive. This game may not quite be
      my favorite RhinoGearz title, but it''s still an experience I''m eager to enjoy,
      and remains an exception to my usual anti-VN opinions.'
