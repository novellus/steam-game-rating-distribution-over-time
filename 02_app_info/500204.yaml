    about_the_game: 'Night Environment: New Jersey for FSX: Steam Edition revolutionizes
      your VFR night flying experience. Using a series of databases, this add-on implements
      authentic and immersive lighting to different road types and other areas. Thousands
      of lights clearly illuminate highways that connect cities and smaller roads
      which link neighbourhoods. <br>The Night Environment database contains more
      road data than default FSX: Steam Edition, so roads you may not see during the
      day become visible at night. All lights are visible for up to 60 miles for a
      more immersive experience.  All highway lights are raised above the surface
      and have a lit bitmap below them, giving them a 3D feel.  <br><br>Night Environment:
      New Jersey also comes with a configuration tool so you can customize the intensity
      of your night flying experience.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>
      Full coverage of the state of New Jersey <br></li><li> All major roads and most
      minor roads illuminated <br></li><li> Compatible with 3rd party scenery products
      including FTX and all photo scenery <br></li><li> Configurable for hardware
      performance <br></li><li> Configuration tool (accessible via the Tools section
      of your Steam library)</li></ul>'
