    review: This should be advertised as "early access" and charging half the price.  Actually
      even half the price would be to much for what you get.  The screen shots above
      make you believe you will be climbing up big cliffs but they are not in the
      game (maybe that's why the description says "plus more to come").  It gives
      you an archway in a city that you can climb and it's only challenging (not in
      a fun way) because the controls are not very good.  The graphics are also bad
      the the "Spiderman" level with grappling hook is very poorly done.  Download
      the FREE Spiderman VR game if you really want to swing and play like Spiderman.  Very
      disappointed!!
