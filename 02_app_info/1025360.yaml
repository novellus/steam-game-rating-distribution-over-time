    review: I can definitely say that this game is worth the money! The mechanics
      of the game are very well planned, especially when farming and fighting wild
      animals. The 2D theme brings back the nostalgia of the old days! As I said,
      this game is very well structured and planned, and for 1 Dollar, it is absolutely
      worth it.
