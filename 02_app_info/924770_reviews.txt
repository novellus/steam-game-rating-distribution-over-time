The movement is so smooth! I can create scenes easily and get right inside of them, changing lighting and world elements. I am only 4 hours in, and this is now my go to! I will be creating some models to import in and try creating custom brushes, but for right now I have what I need. Also need to use video and see how that works out as well as painting with youtube. This is a Joy to use! :))))))","timestamp_created":1603803035,"timestamp_updated":1603923398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553105056285858154","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw15nSuPUCe9i3qgI="}
