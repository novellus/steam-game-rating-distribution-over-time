    review: This game is a combination of adventure capitalist and a building game.
      It takes a long time to play. It is a game that you play for a while and then
      stop and go back to at your leisure.  You you want an instant gratification
      game, it is not for you.  It can be tedious at times. So before you buy, understand
      the game for what it is and is not.   I took a chance on the game  in spite
      of the negative posts. I like train games and  it was a cheap game to buy.  Think
      of the game this way. It is a puzzle with many pieces that you can go back to
      at your leisure. Also, you have the ability to start the game over again and
      try a different strategy.
