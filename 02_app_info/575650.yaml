      /><br>Lily's Day Off is a visual novel which puts the player in the position
      of the main character. You will play through the game and make choices as you
      interact with Lily, the famous pop idol sensation.<br><br>However, this is not
      your typical visual novel where each route gives you new information on solid
      character personalities. As you make choices and progress in this game, your
      actions drastically change the character personalities, experiences, and outcomes.<br><br>There
      are 16 endings in total, each with a completely different theme.<br><br><strong>This
      is a comedy visual novel. There are no explicit scenes. There is, however, some
      violence and scary scenes.</strong><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/575650/extras/Extras.png?t=1575761359"
