    review: "The Ghosts of Hackney Mills is an okay horror game. Let\u2019s get into\
      \ the story.\n\nIt\u2019s a late night in Southern Ohio as Todd Collins a worker\
      \ for the White Cross Electric Company has crashed his car, luckily he's okay\
      \ and even better he's not far from the old abandoned University he was sent\
      \ out to investigate due to the power being on, but what is going on at the\
      \ that is a truth abandoned University? Todd will unfortunately discover.\n\n\
      Now the likes. The story is pretty good if you choose to listen to the story\
      \ crystals in the game. The voice acting in the game was nice, some of it was\
      \ good but others you could probably tell we're putting on fake accents but\
      \ it was still good.  \n\nThe music was good, the puzzles were okay and the\
      \ RPG Maker graphics were nice. Price for the game was good. it was very fair\
      \ for such a short game.\n\nNow the dislikes. The game is not really all that\
      \ scary despite being a horror game, I mean it was kind of scary if you listened\
      \ to the story crystals but other than that again the game really wasn't all\
      \ that scary. Game\u2019s a bit short, also the ending for the game was kind\
      \ of bad. \n\n[spoiler] After escaping the facility and finding your boss's\
      \ car the game just abruptly ends. I mean it should have ended with the monster\
      \ showing up or Todd finding his boss\u2019s cell phone and calling the police\
      \ and the game slowly transitions to the credit. [/spoiler] \n\nNow that I have\
      \ got that done The Ghosts of Hackney Mills is an okay horror game. With a pretty\
      \ good story, good music and nice voice acting. So if you're looking for a short\
      \ RPG Maker horror game this could be for you."
