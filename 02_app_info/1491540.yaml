    review: "A solid puzzle experience whose core mechanic manages to be unique and\
      \ unlike any other I've played, while drawing enough inspiration from indie\
      \ classics such as VVVVVV or Undertale to bring a sense of familiarity to the\
      \ whole thing. The mechanics of the map gameplay when introduced seem straightforward\
      \ and intuitive, but as the game goes on the complexity of each level gets deeper\
      \ and deeper with new elements thrown into the mix. There's a surprising amount\
      \ of depth here that may not show at first glance. \n\nThis game showcases a\
      \ perfect mix, I think, of both levels that will test your wits and problem-solving\
      \ and levels that require that perfect timing and fluid platforming movements.\
      \ As someone who isn't normally a fan of puzzle games, I found the experience\
      \ to be enjoyable and challenging, and for the price of admission I think you\
      \ get your money's worth. \n\nAlso the humour is goofy but it adds a charm to\
      \ the journey I think would be missing otherwise."
