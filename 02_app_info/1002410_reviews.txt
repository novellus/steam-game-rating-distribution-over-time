But this is no Myst.  Story is minimal and weak.  Puzzles aren't very connected to the world and there's too little feedback.  Most of the puzzles reminded me of the worst of the Myst/Riven puzzles that had you memorizing lengthy info from one place to match in another, through a layer of indirection.  That's drastically harder in VR when you can't write something down (and there was no built in camera roll either).\n\nI admit my views of puzzle games has changed drastically since reading Don Norman's \"The Design of Everyday Things\" a few years ago.  While the whole point is to \"puzzle\", there should ALWAYS be feedback/status/result when a action is performed.\n\nVR: Node movement with snap turn worked pretty well, it avoided clipping issues and was still fast as you could still just push the stick.  There were a tiny handle of spots where the node was slightly between snap turn positions though.  I personally can't handle yaw at all in VR, so lots of smooth turn is a hard no for me.  But the \"hand\" interaction was super-weak and virtual/physical location didn't map well for me.  It was very hard to reach the start of a lever and move it to the end.  Given how few interactions the original source has anyway, a simple click would been move straight-forward.","timestamp_created":1608730733,"timestamp_updated":1608730733,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nN30x/YCcbS9vAI="}
