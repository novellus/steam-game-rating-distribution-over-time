If the devs were going to add a few certain things related to the original creepypasta and update it, it would really have the potential to be a neat and scary game. (which really shouldn't be too difficult)\n\nI also i got a headache everytime i started playing this game, so atleast that works and stays true to the creepypasta :D","timestamp_created":1608988048,"timestamp_updated":1608988048,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.668874144554138184","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqKfKz/YCeLiwvQI="}
