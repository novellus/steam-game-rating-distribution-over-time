There is at least one area you get an error from after you've [spoiler]modified some (but not quite enough of the) code[/spoiler]. Very few games give you what is essentially the source code for almost (if not all) of the game, editable inside the game itself.\n\nQuite an accomplishment, and still fun for programmers and others interested in playing around with code via somewhat odd methods of changing string constants and fiddling around with closures.\n\nI liked it, though I've been coding since the 80s. Lua script is quite popular for modding these days, and this will expose you to it, though not really \"train\" you how to code.","timestamp_created":1608357296,"timestamp_updated":1608357296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+JbkvPYCdoGuuwI="}
