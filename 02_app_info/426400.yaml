    review: '[u][b]Notice: Seizure Warning (Intense Flashing Scenes)[/b][/u]


      A widely known cult classic, one I''ve been meaning to watch for like 20 years
      and I wish I had sooner.


      It''s a shame Brandon Lee died during the making of this film, his acting in
      this was superb as I''m sure it is in his other films. I don''t have a single
      complaint for this movie. Great story and setting, fantastic acting, great special
      effects that have aged well and an awesome soundtrack (please sell this as a
      movie DLC). Well worth a watch and I can easily say it''s worth the $10.99 asking
      price.'
