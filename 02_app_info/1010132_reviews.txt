The locomotive looks great inside and out and it gets even better when you give it some throttle, hear the two mighty engines spin up as it surges forward with the rpm dials climbing.  But then you have to immediately stop because you've hit the 25mph limit.\n\nThe choice to only allow the locomotive on the West Somerset railway is baffling and I find it immensely frustrating.  There are three scenarios, one where you do a brief bit of shunting, one where you move one stop and then put the Western on the turntable (which seems very buggy for me) and a final much longer scenario where you move along the entire line again with a maximum of 25mph and sections of 5 and 10mph.  It finishes after a long slow 5mph leaving you with a view of the mainline where the Western could finally get up to speed but not this time.  I like the diesel gala idea and it's certainly what some of the classic vintage locomotives do in real life but it feels like it should be a bonus scenario and powerful locomotives like the 52 should get the chance to do some express passenger work as they were designed for.\n\nUltimately I don't regret buying the DLC and having been using a mod to allow me to use the Western on other routes (with mixed results), I find it a good locomotive to drive with the well lit cabin and responsive controls.  It's just a shame by default it's so limited.","timestamp_created":1598489894,"timestamp_updated":1598489894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx4PblvQCd+2CngI="}
