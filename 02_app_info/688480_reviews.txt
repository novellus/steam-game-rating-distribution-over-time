I hesitated to buy this because the reviews seems so polarized. Ignore them. Its a good dogfighter, with a lot of playability. Its exactly the type of game I wanted to play in VR but be prepared, Its a lot faster paced than games like Squadrons. I'm playing on an Oculus Quest 2 with an xbox controller and having an absolute blast.","timestamp_created":1609560788,"timestamp_updated":1609560788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwpHT4PYCe5fOvwI="}
