    review: "Funbag Fantasy: Sideboob Story es la secuela de Funbag Fantasy el cual\
      \ agregan nuevos reinos y nuevas waifus al harem como siempre no hay parche\
      \ en espa\xF1ol la historia es algo corta con su anterior juego y hay pocos\
      \ GC que el principal pero no quita las ganas de desbloquear todos los GC  que\
      \ en tema del arte son 10/10"
