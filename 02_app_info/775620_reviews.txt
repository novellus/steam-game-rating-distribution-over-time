Reminds me a bit of Stalker which I love. Has shown itself to be a promising addition to the BR genre.\n\nEDIT:  The dev has been improving their game and releasing patches addressing bugs. I have also been able to play multiplayer matches by joining servers directly.","timestamp_created":1607500350,"timestamp_updated":1608513872,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513548135757446289","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwiLy5wfYCcZqsuAI="}
