ON SALE.[/quote]\n\n[i]More info below....[/i]\n\n[h1]THE LOWDOWN:[/h1]\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Wolf - Fall of Kanak (FoK) is a prequel themed story played from the other side, the Chaos Word Bearers legion. Landing on the planet Kanak their mission is to capture the planet's key installations. Their opponents, Skull Taker units loyal to the Imperium.\n\nFoK is a dlc that lets players experience firsthand the events that preceded the main story. It provides a single themed pve endless mode to the base game. First released free as an time-limited event along with achievements, it is now a required purchase if you want to 100% achievement completion. Players take control of a new character with its own fixed deck of cards, a mechanic to gather heavy weapons required to stay alive for longer and periodically spawning booster that can be picked-up to keep them alive against insurmountable odds. Against him are an array of human warriors whos numbers appear infinite.\n\nRequired for achievements:\nAcolyte of the Blood God -Take part in the Fall of Kanak event.\nSkulls for the Skull Throne! (common) - Collect 100 skulls.\nSkulls for the Skull Throne! (rare) - Collect 250 skulls.\nSkulls for the Skull Throne! (epic) - Collect 500 skulls.\nSkulls for the Skull Throne! (legendary) - Collect 1000 skulls.\n\n[h1]THE GOOD:[/h1]\n+ New set of six cards for the main game. Two legendary.\n+ Play as the other side, the forces of Chaos.\n\n[h1]THE BAD:[/h1]\n- One very grindy achievement.\n- A single map. A single PvE arena – Imperial Guard Garrison.\n- Only one playable character. Pollux the Flayer, Champion of Khorne.\n- Non-customisable deck.\n\n[h1]AND THE ORDINARY:[/h1]\n* Play against new enemies – Kanak Skull Takers.\n* Two new mechanics. Time dropped heavy weapons and booster pickups.\n* New achievements.\n\n[h1]VERDICT:[/h1]\nWorth getting for the extra content. Even if it is just one map, with continous waves of enemies attacking your only character. No allies make an appearance here. Of the two legendary cards to augment your deck, neither is required for achievements. The heavy bolter is fine for the terminator build but can be overlooked for a lesser model or bypassed for other comparable weapons.\n\nOverall the game mode is pretty fun. Very, very repetitive if aiming for the 1000 kills achievement. I enjoyed it till around 500 kills and then I farmed kills periodically to complete. The spawn rate and composition seem over-balance to keep the player always trending water and never coming up to get enough of a mouthful of air. Feels in keeping with endless mode design.\n\nOnly worthwhile if you are planning for 100% achievement completion. As it is separate from the campaigns, if that is your only focus for this game, it can be passed. It does make a nice change playing as the other side though. So if that makes your curious, its as good a reason as any to get and play. Definitely one of the dlcs to consider getting. In a complete bundle for a good discount would be my suggestion.","timestamp_created":1609627536,"timestamp_updated":1609627745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.602937936782836914","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rsfS4vYCcN/wvwI="}
