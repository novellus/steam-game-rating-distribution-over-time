Sometimes, because you clicked 2 pixels too much to the right, so the path-finding didn't feel the need to wake up and thus your character didn't move. Because of...\n\nTimers.\n\nThat's right, everything is timed.\nYou clicked on a \"button\" ? Quickly move away from it or you die. Move both characters at once, on different paths, as soon as you've clicked, for if any one of them dies, you die. Sometimes the thing you clicked has a delayed response, so you have to order your timings and your moves to avoid the dreaded full reset.\n\nHey! More incompetent design: The game starts with you listening to 10 minutes of gibberish. Or, in fact, reading subtitles, since the sound is... you know... gibberish. I like made up languages as much as the next masochist but come on guys, 10 minutes? And that's because I found out the acceleration key and skipped from then on.\n\nAnd it's buggy, to top it all. You have objects losing their interactivity, so you'll need to die to reset. You can get soft-locked when 1 character goes too far and can't open the path for the 2nd one any more, and there is nothing to kill him, and no key to reset, so you have to quit and come back and redo some previous puzzles. Barely in the first puzzles, I'm already covered in bugs.\n\nNot a good puzzle-platformer.\nAt all.\n","timestamp_created":1602414625,"timestamp_updated":1602414625,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51930546760559082","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jtjWi/UCd/+bpwI="}
