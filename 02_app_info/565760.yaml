      \ together that often. It may seem somewhat counter intuitive to combine both\
      \ in a single game, but Escape the Loop does just that. This unique approach\
      \ will allow you to spend as much time with one episode, as you want. Try figuring\
      \ out how to beat it, or waste your days exploring town, annoying neighbors,\
      \ learning to play an instrument, or do whatever else you can think of doing\
      \ in a time loop.<br>Each episode will not only be another chapter in Amelia's\
      \ story, but also add a unique twist to the time loop mechanic, changing the\
      \ town and its residents in new ways. This will make every episode as explorable\
      \ as the previous one, with new things to do and more time to spend."
