    short_description: An unassuming woman has been charged with the death of a scoundrel,
      a fortune-squandering bounder. She was found over the body, pistol in hand but
      there are other avenues in this case that even the Yard refuses to set foot
      upon. I have the feeling that there is more to the case than meets the eye.
