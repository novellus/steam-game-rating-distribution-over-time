    about_the_game: In the late 1960s, the Cold War between the United States of America
      and the Soviet Union reached its peak with the moon race. So far the Soviet
      Union was leading with its space program, but the USA caught up in no time.
      With the entry of the fictitious nation of Ustria, the duel quickly turned into
      a three-way battle.<br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1492610/extras/Story.gif?t=1607631600"
      /><br>In the game you are part of the Ustrian Secret Service and play a leading
      role in the National Space Program. The main task is to catch up on the technological
      lead through espionage and sabotage. You do this for example by penetrating
      the NASA headquarters, taking out guards, bypassing security systems to get
      access to secret plans.<br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1492610/extras/Features.gif?t=1607631600"
