    review: '[b]DLC verdict: Get it on sale[/b] OR [b]Get it in the Season Pass[/b]
      OR [b]Get it in the Deluxe Edition[/b]


      [b]Comment:[/b]

      You get 2 outfits for the main campaign. Also there are 4 missions - 1 land
      exploration & 3 Aquila naval missions. ALL OF THIS UNLOCKS AFTER SEQUENCE 6!
      The naval missions are worth getting this, some multiplayer characters are a
      bonus. But because of the short combined game time rather get this DLC on sale.
      This DLC is part of both the Season Pass and the Deluxe Edition of AC3.


      [b]P.S.:[/b] To activate the DLC, write down the CD-key Steam shows you (you
      cannot copy+paste it), start the game, go to Extras and then to Redeem Code
      (if it does not work go to uPlay and redeem the code there too), restart the
      game.
