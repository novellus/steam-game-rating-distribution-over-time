I have to say that I don't really like stealth games, but there is something about this game... I liked it so very much.  So you sneak around as a Thief/Rogue and break into places and steal loot.  You gotta think as a thief too, as at times the front door is locked.  The music is perfect for night stealth activities!\n\nSo the game isn't overly challenging (phew!), but it is satisfying.  You also don't have to kill anyone too.  I like the idea of a peaceful thief.  There is also an older man, a Fence and their relationship works out, showing the truth of how it actually is supposed to be.  Oh and Thomas looks pretty good too, so kudos.  I like the sprite design.  :D\n\nI would love to know more about the back stories of the characters.  They are mysterious as they are now, but their relationship and what they go through, can be deepened if we know more.  That said, if the Developer wishes to continue exploring with the characters, all the best to ya!\n\nYou do go through columns in this game, but to me it is fun!  The game is sort of dark (the background), but I am not sure if it's just my screen or not.  There are shelves in the bar that if you touch them, the Fence protests.  Well... when he is not in the bar, he still tells you to not to touch it.  He is dedicated to protecting his shelves!\n\nThe only thing I wish was present in the game is \"Loot Counter\", as in how much loot is located in the particular area, but if it meant to be a challenge: alright, I get it.  A note though: if you get the \"main loot\" and leave, you will not be able to come back.  I tried to reload the game, to get the single loot I missed and it drops your character at the bar.  Well guess what!  Gives you an option for re-playability!\n\nSo obviously I like this game.  It is different from the normal ones I play and gave me an interesting experience.  It keeps things peaceful and not hardcore at all.  I look forward to future updates/projects from the Developer, if they feel like it.  As for now, thank you for a satisfying game experience!!! :) =) :>","timestamp_created":1600051878,"timestamp_updated":1600051878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh8OhxfQCfYTYoQI="}
