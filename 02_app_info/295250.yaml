    review: "Stranded COULD have been an amazing game but at this state, the whole\
      \ game is just a missed opportunity in my eyes, just like how Murder was. (another\
      \ game by the same dev, Peter Moorhead)\n\nThe game has an unique soundtrack,\
      \ great art and a rather depressing 'plot'. The sole reason why I think this\
      \ game as a \"missed opportunity\" is the storytelling. \n\nSo... there's no\
      \ storytelling. And we don't have a story to begin with. Which is why this game\
      \ is getting all the downvotes. We start off in a wrecked spaceship that has\
      \ just crashed on a planet. We get out from the pod and our objective is...\
      \ What? What is our objective? We have no clear indication of where to go or\
      \ what to do or where we are, in short: if you ask any kind of Wh- Questions,\
      \ you won't get any answers. That's it. The only reason why the game becomes\
      \ so boring until the ending, the reason why you get so confused while playing\
      \ is because there's no lore. Even saying three sentences could've made this\
      \ game at least bearable, for example when we get out of the pod, the character\
      \ could've said [spoiler] Death is imminent. I have to activate them..Quick.\"\
      \ [/spoiler] and believe me, this would make the whole experience so much better!\
      \ At least we would know what was going on or at least what to do.\n\nAnd my\
      \ only critique about the gameplay is that, the character walks SO slow and\
      \ we don't know where to click. It's a point and click game. Just like what\
      \ they did in Murder, they could have just created indicators of where I can\
      \ click or not. Jesus, it's a point and click game. The only thing that you\
      \ had to nail was this.\n\nOverall, when the ending 'happens' every nonsense\
      \ going on finally made sense. And I think the creator went for the \"Just feel\
      \ it in your heart.\" kind of storytelling which is understandable, but that\
      \ doesn't really work with games all the time.\n\nIt was a short experience\
      \ and I found lots and lots of improvable elements about it, I'm still going\
      \ to upvote this because of the OST and the pixel art."
