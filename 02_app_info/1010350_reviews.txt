The bonus, if you go to the printer's website, there is a simple drop down menu selector to help find the modules that can meet your needs. \n\nhttp://mdt.aawgames.com/\n\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I do! Cheers!\nPS!!! This is all set for DND 5e! There is a whole complete set for PathFinder. Select that one if you are in that system! :)","timestamp_created":1594319216,"timestamp_updated":1594319216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2JO1mvMCePiOlAI="}
