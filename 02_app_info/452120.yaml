    about_the_game: "<i>Monkey Island meets Over the Garden Wall, in a dark forest\
      \ somewhere in Sweden. </i><br><br>In this cozy little point-and-click fairy-tale,\
      \ you are a gnome on an abandoned farm. When you realize that humans have come\
      \ to live there once more, you find yourself useful again - but also that you\
      \ might have to work harder than ever to keep them safe from the dark creatures\
      \ that lurk out in the forest. You might even have to call on some of the fair\
      \ folks for help. Their aid, however, does not come without a price...<br><br>The\
      \ game draws heavily from Swedish folk lore, with art inspired by artists such\
      \ as John Bauer and Alvaro Tapia. It uses puzzles and riddles to tell its story,\
      \ and there are several different ends to it. The player will also get to experience\
      \ unique music and compelling voice over, as well as discover part of Sweden\u2019\
      s history, since the game takes place in the 19th century - a time where over\
      \ a million people left the country to avoid starvation and build a new life\
      \ for themselves. <br><br>This game was created by one person over 6 months,\
      \ plus a composer who made the wonderful music. It fits anyone who would like\
      \ to experience an atmospheric and cozy fairy-tale, that might remind you of\
      \ the stories you heard as a child."

    review: 'It is hard to say a lot about a game this short (approx 30min), however,
      I must say that I loved the artwork and the music expecially - Very soothing.
      If you are into scandinavian folklore and music you are going to love this!
      The downside of the game, except for being insanely short and extremely easy,
      is the voice acting (Sorry!). Almost made me wish the dialogue was read-only.

      ____________________________________


      Play this game if:

      - You love scandinavian folklore

      - You love traditional scandinavian folk music, I loooved it!

      - You are a busy bee and need something easy and quick to play


      Do Not play this game if:

      - You are looking for a challenge

      - You want games with depper story and more content



      Verdict: 7/10 (due to shortness and voice acting I cannot give it more)'
