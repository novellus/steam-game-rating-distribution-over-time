    review: 'It was cool to see where Thomas Happ came from and what inspired him
      to make the game. The game art has some cool insights into how the Rusalki look
      without the pixels. A really good documentary to listen to if you want to know
      a little more about Axiom Verge and hear things that aren''t mentioned in the
      game.


      Was very fun to listen too. He also talks a bit about Orn if you have played
      that.'
