      Woodwarf is a fun strategy and base building game in which you must build a
      thriving dwarf community and gather resources, food and materials. You have
      a simple camp and you must collect lumber, food and gold so you can purchase
      new upgrades. <br><br>Hire a Fisher dwarf who will automatically travel to water
      and fish for food, or hire a Lumberdwarf who will chop down trees for wood.
      You can also collect these materials and food with a gather dwarf. <br><br>Food
      is the most important resource and all your workers constantly eat fish so you
      must provide a steady supply. Underneath your settlement in the caves below
      your dwarves guard a precious dragon egg. This egg helps defend your settlers
      from invading monsters and you must protect it at all costs. As you progress
      you can upgrade your workers and other aspects of your settlement to improve
      your resource collection etc. Try and manage your resources carefully and build
      a strong community!<br><br>Meet fellow players on our <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discord.gg/4q2mtty"
