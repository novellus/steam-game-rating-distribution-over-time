It does have explore, you definitely exterminate, there's somewhat exploitation, and from what I read... it sounds like there's expansion in this game. I played a little, I thought it was weird, but in the enjoyable kind of way.","timestamp_created":1608894888,"timestamp_updated":1608894888,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1608973402,"developer_response":"The 4x game is actually coming soon.  It is going to be like Master of Orion, but the battles will be fought with live combat.  In fact, I'm not even sure I want you to be a ruler of a star system, but instead have the rulers simulated and you're tossed about in the middle like a bounty hunter trying to decide which is best for himself.   You might find yourself making lots of money running missions for one king, but then you determine he's a huuuuge jerk, and then fight against him. That's the type of 4x I want to get to.  How far I do all depends.\n\nFirst thing is first: Fleet Management update so you can upgrade your ships individually and put them in your active fleet or on reserve.  Then Capital Ships. I want these two updates out by the end of January if not December.  Then after about three months after that the MMO is being launched.  Then 4x, Special Space Dungeon competitions and Grand Scale Live Game Master Role Play will be added.  \n\nIt really isn't as ambitious as it all sounds.  If I didn't have a League of Legends addiction, I could probably hammer it out in 1/3 the time. ;)  I just love video games soooo much. That's why I chose to make them, for quality play, not as other modern companies do to exploit their userbase."}],"cursor":"AoJwhPfmzPYCfOuCvQI="}
