The hands are completely wrong to hold the swords (Vive).  Play is not explained and the story is not apparent.  Gameplay is very very simple with little variety or interaction.  Essentially, you can just wave your swords around and hope you kill something.  No blocking and not much of anything else.  Nice visuals but needs a lot of work.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkbyo7kT4I","timestamp_created":1538818309,"timestamp_updated":1538968825,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538002967834472656","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ypXsqOYCeJaWrAE="}
