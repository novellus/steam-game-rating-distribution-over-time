    review: Perhaps a little short. Ok, very short. The game was just warming up when
      it ended... but aside from that it was beautiful, whimsical and really engaging
      to play all the way through. I really hope to see more VR games following in
      this style. Even though it's a 'sit down' game, you'll spend a lot of time standing
      up and ducking around just to look around the scenes.
