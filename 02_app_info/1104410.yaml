    review: While the content seems very appealing, I haven't been able to play the
      game since I installed it and added one of the DLC races to the game, as it
      always crashes to desktop during new game creation. After researching online,
      I discovered several people have had the same issue after creating and saving
      custom ships/races. I believe this content causes a similar issue. I have had
      GC3 for five years now and haven't had any problem playing until adding this
      content and trying to use it in-game.
