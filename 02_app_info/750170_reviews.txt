Even though some planned features are not yet implemented already this looks and works as fully finished product.\n\nThis game simulates diesel train operations in England around 60-ties, so one may expect left side driving with classic semaphores. I don't really know English rail but it seems that everything is modeled as it should be. We have markings for speed limits, yellow distant signals and red semaphores. Junctions work as intended so the signal shows which branch we are going to take. Therefore the game is realistic, allowing for true hudless driving (as long as we know the route - where are the stations and speed limits). This is amazing. Physics is good, the brakes are modeled very nicely - for example longer train will cause the brake to respond with a lag. Sounds are nice. These old diesel trains have mechanical gearbox, so driving is a little more challenging than with modern train - we need to switch gears like in a car. At this point my feeling is that the gearbox is not yet fully modeled as it should be - we can make mistakes, like stopping with high gear or switching gears with power on and nothing wrong happens. Hopefully this will be corrected with full game release. AI drivers are not scripted, they try to react to what they actually see. It's really a good simulator for a hardcore simmer like me.\n\nBut even a total newbie to train driving will have a lot of fun. There is a simple mode in which we only operate accelerate/decelerate buttons without taking care of the gearbox, throttle and brakes, so one can learn to feel the train first. But even in the advanced mode we can use help of AI driver who will tell us which key to press to operate properly. Again it's not scripted in any matter, this helper will try to react to the situation and tell us what to do. For example if we are going too fast, he will tell us to apply a brake (and which key to use), when we slow down, he will tell us to release the brake. He will show us when to change gears, where to stop, which button to press before departure to warn the passengers etc. This is absolutely AMAZING feature, which will teach anyone to drive the train effectively.\n\nOf course as most train simulators do we can use a little cheat - track monitor. It shows us incoming speed limits, stations and signals, so we can react properly and play even if we don't know the route at all. We can also configure the track monitor to show us the indication of the signal or only signal placement - in the latter we have to read the signals ourselves.\n\nAt the end of the journey we get a summary and a graph showing our real speed as a function of distance, compared to what we were expected to have and to the speed limit. Another nice feature which helps us to improve. We also get a score depending on speed limit compliance, timetable but also used fuel (energy). We get lower score for using different helpers (like track monitor) which encourages us to learn more realistic driving.\n\nFor each route there is a whole day timetable, which is very nice. We can take any train we want and we will meet also other trains from thetimetable while driving. There are no scripted scenarios. I'm not sure if there are random events, but it happened to me that I had to wait under red signal and I also got a message from the dispatcher to tell me why I wait. We also have time compression if we are bored with waiting.\n\nAs for the routes - apart from one demo route, there are two fully functional but fictional routes. They are pretty long, allowing for over one hour of driving one way. They also have several branches so we are not forced just to drive forth and back. Still I would like to see real life routes. It might be possible in the future. Also a route editor should arrive soon, allowing for user made workshop routes.\n\nSummarizing here - this is a great product. It really works well. I like the realism and many new ideas introduced to train driving. One issue which is not really important to me, but might be important to other people is graphics. It might seem a little sparse and not yet polished. It's not as beautiful as in some costly modern games. But remember that this is still early access game so it might improve a lot in the future. For me personally it's not a flaw. I still play OMSI2 and don't really care about graphics that much as long as I have realistic product which gives the feel of driving a real vehicle (and this one does). Again it's not bad, but maybe just a little sparse in the details.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nEDIT: After over two years I must add that the game is being developed as promised. We have a route editor and train editor. While the latter might be a bit difficult the route editor is very easy and fun to use. The game has become not only a train simulator but also 'make a route and drive it simulator' as making the routes and timetables is as fun as driving them.
