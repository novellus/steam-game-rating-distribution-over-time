    review: "Dia dhuit! Sceal (Gealic for \"story\") is a wonderful innocent game\
      \ about Iona, a little girl, who goes on a quest to recover her last memories.\
      \ You will find yourself painting certain buildings, listen to the wisdom of\
      \ Branna the raven and help different villagers, including your in-game parents.\
      \ At the end of Chapter 3, you will have to choose one out of three persons\
      \ in order to end your story. \n\nPROS:\n- Different languages, including Gaelic!\n\
      - Awesome soundtracks!\n- Village represented in both night and day, and different\
      \ seasons;\n- Storybook with rising buildings;\n- Ouvert and intern symbols;\n\
      - Losts of interpretations can come up from this game;\n- It almost feels like\
      \ William Butler Yeats and William Faulkner mixed together;\n- Better try Windowed\
      \ version first of all, because... \n\nCONS:\n- ... because my system is not\
      \ good and it ran in slow-motion, but it was nice!\n- This is all for the cons.\n\
      \nTo sum it all, I think that people interested in nice simple stories from\
      \ the children's point of view would be delighted to play this game. Remember:\
      \ play it as innocent as a child! You will fall in love, first of all, with\
      \ its soundtracks. They are instrumental and vocals. I hearby thank the developers\
      \ for making such an amazing little story available to us and I want to see\
      \ some more games like this!"
