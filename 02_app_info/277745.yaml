    about_the_game: "One of the Great Western Railway\u2019s most iconic tank engines,\
      \ the Class 14XX, comes to Train Simulator complete with GWR autocoach.<br><br>Based\
      \ on the ageing 517 Class, the first of the diminutive tank engines entered\
      \ service in 1932 as part of the 48XX Class and designed for running autotrains\
      \ when coupled to autocoaches on branch lines of the Great Western region. Twenty\
      \ locomotives \u2013 classified as Class 58XX \u2013 were also built without\
      \ fittings for autocoach running.<br><br>In the mid-1940s, the GWR experimented\
      \ with oil burning locomotives, which saw the 48XX Class reclassified as 14XX\
      \ Class, a classification they carried until the end of steam in Britain and\
      \ their working life. The last 58XX Class locomotive was withdrawn in 1959 with\
      \ the 14XX Class withdrawn from service by 1965.<br><br>Numerous autocoach designs\
      \ were tried by GWR, many of them being converted from Steam Railmotors which\
      \ were tried at the beginning of the 20th Century but had proven to be too impractical.\
      \ Autocoaches were designed to be operated in conjunction with tank engines\
      \ like the 14XX Class to provide push-pull services on branch lines and where\
      \ locomotive turning was not possible.<br><br>All four variants of the Class\
      \ are included for Train Simulator, including the GWR 48XX with autocoach fitted,\
      \ GWR 58XX unfitted, BR 14XX with autocoach fitted and BR 58XX unfitted. The\
      \ locomotive includes an array of features, including realistic cab with multiple\
      \ views (including fully modelled firebox and coal), fully modelled and animated\
      \ valve gear, realistic wheel slip physics, simulated steam chest, cylinder\
      \ cock management, realistic injector control, opening windows with rain effects\
      \ and dynamic lamp setting.<br><br>Also included is a Diagram A31 autocoach\
      \ in both GWR and BR liveries, which can be used as a driving vehicle when attached\
      \ to any consist.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving\
      \ you the freedom to drive the GWR Class 14XX on any Quick Drive enabled route\
      \ for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included\
      \ are scenarios specifically for the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/24096\"\
