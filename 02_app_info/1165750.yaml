    review: cryptic for the sake of being cryptic. No real gameplay within first 20
      minutes beside walking around picking up 'stats' in skills. Shaders used to
      give 'ps1' esque graphics failed pretty often, leading to spots with large black
      shadows directly in center frame, or completely black screens. wasnt a fan
