Actually, that's not exactly true when i initially picked it up those aforementioned performance issues were too bad to play it on my crappy laptop at the time. HOWEVER, when i later on a random evening decided to boot it up i was very grateful i didn't just skim over this title like i most often do. At first the artstyle kinda made me think that gonzossm (dunno if you know him he's on youtube) had made a career switch, but that's a bit of an unfair comparison and i'm getting off-track. What i'm trying to say here is that while the mechanical formula of this game isn't really anything to write home about, the attention to detail and polished artstyle make this something that, imo, you should look into.\n\nAnd if you're still not convinced by this strong-worded review: this game has the prestigious status of being one of the 10 games on steam that actually has a playable pc demo. So if you're a cheapskate (like me!), go play that first. I'll guarantee you you won't regret it.","timestamp_created":1609675447,"timestamp_updated":1609675447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526627242565155029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rcOI5PYCdJGGwAI="}
