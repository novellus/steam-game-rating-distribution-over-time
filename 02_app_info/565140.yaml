    review: 'It was too short, as most HOGs are, imo. But this was a better-than-average
      HOG, I thought. There was quite a bit of running around. I like that. (Some
      people don''t.) There is a map. I just love running around and finding things.


      The mini-games and puzzle pieces fit in with the story moreso than most HOGs,
      I thought.


      The hidden object scenes just had a list, with a little interaction on one item
      or two, which is to be expected for an older game.'
