The story is a mish mosh of plot points stolen from 1980s sci fi movies that did it much better. The voice acting is some of the worst I've ever heard, even for this genre, which is usually bad. But this is just terrible. And the protagonist is unlikeable to boot. Puzzles are tedious because in an attempt to be more innovative/\"sci-fi\"-ish they just kind of come across as confusing. Plus there are several timed reaction puzzles that I loathe. I'm only finishing it to get the stupid achievements and then never play it again. Don't waste your money.","timestamp_created":1609913929,"timestamp_updated":1609913929,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40qGW6/YCd4f2wAI="}
