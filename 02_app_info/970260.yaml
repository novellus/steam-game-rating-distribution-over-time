    review: 'bought this game because i missed the free key from your 9gag post, lol


      i play this game on 1680x1050 monitor (i know, it''s not your usual monitor
      resolution). if i play on fullscreen, the screen will be cropped, left and right
      part is missing. so i played on windowed mode, smaller resolution. it would
      be great if the game support not only 16:9 scale but also other scale like 16:10
      or maybe older 4:3 monitor.


      next, it would be better if we can use ESC key as "back" button instead of clicking
      X button on the screen


      character movement is responsive, no input lag or i just don''t feel it at all


      slow and curved ranged attack insist you to calculate it''s projectile movement.
      these increased the difficulty and become more challenging for people who usually
      plays game, but i think it would be a little bit too difficult for casual gamer.
      well it depends on your market target.


      PC Spec: Xeon E3-1270 V2 (IvyBridge), RX 480 8GB, 16GB RAM. using epic setting.

      about >75fps on tutorial area, and drops about 60 on the area after that. >180fps
      on trader area.


      i think this game have a great prospect in the future. i love the low-poly models
      and the world design.

      still haven''t played for long because I have to get back to my work (will try
      to play again later)


      wish you all the best in developing this game, cheers!

      *sorry for my bad english'
