    review: This is a streamlined RPG and lite crafting game with an engaging story,
      you'll have fun with it. Good RPG with choices galore, and failures will still
      help you make you stronger and unravels more of the story for further attempts.
      I finished the game with 11 hours of pretty dedicated gameplay, but there was
      still more to explore. The developers did a good job.
