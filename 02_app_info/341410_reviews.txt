This quest is not directly tied to the main story line but stands on it own as a good tale. Its played in a new area with several new enemies that hit hard and can smack you silly if you're not careful.","timestamp_created":1587999868,"timestamp_updated":1587999868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxuCK3vECc8rvgwI="}
