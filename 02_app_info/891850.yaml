    review: 'This game isn''t bad for being early.  Technial game.  Look forward to
      other races and chapters.  Few things I would like to see added.

      1. Needs a map of the stars.  The coordinates x,y,z for each system makes it
      hard to get places and get back.

      2. Some of the lighting is dark.  Real space is dark but itmakes it hard to
      find things in the game.

      3. The jump system is a mash of 2D and 3D and sometimes the HUD shows over the
      jump thingy.

      4. The combat addition is cool but I found it hard to understand the specs on
      ships and weapons.

      Some of the audio is quieter than others.  Looking for these updates.'
