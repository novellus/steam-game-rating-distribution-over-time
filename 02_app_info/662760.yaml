    review: 'How do you even write a review for the entire season?


      Anyway, it''s more than I expected, seeing as this was animated Trigger. They
      took a simple premise and went completely bonkers with it all the way to the
      end in all respects. It''s clear they had a lot of fun working on it and it
      shows.'
