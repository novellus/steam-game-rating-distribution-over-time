    review: "This short adventure cinematic is well-made, though it has some of that\
      \ \"indie\" charm to remind that it has been made by a small team of enthusiasts,\
      \ rather than a heavy-hitter like ILMxLab.  Most of the characters' animations\
      \ are motion-captured performances, though there are plenty of character movements\
      \ that are stilted and robotic, which were obviously manually-animated.  The\
      \ characters are cartoony, but expressive.  And don't let the character designs\
      \ fool you... this story is not for young children.\n\nThe game controls your\
      \ perspective, allowing you to look around and even move your head through the\
      \ world.  The ability to change the position of the camera is the key difference\
      \ between a 360\xBA 3D VR recorded video and an experience like The Great C\
      \ that runs with a game engine in real-time.\n\nThe game constantly changes\
      \ the stereoscopic base of the in-game camera, causing the game world and characters\
      \ to have bigger or smaller scale.  I'm not sure this is a great idea and I\
      \ consider this an experimental thing to do.  I'd have liked an option to view\
      \ the game from a perspective that maintains stereoscopic settings that create\
      \ a realistic scale, but it doesn't.  The two options for camera pertain to\
      \ whether the camera makes \"cinematic\" movement through the scenes.\n\nThe\
      \ story is the typical \"humans suck\" post-apocalyptic dreck that has been\
      \ done to death.  The plot and setting didn't appeal to me, but I enjoyed the\
      \ characters and I wish there had been more conversations and interactions between\
      \ Tim and Clare.  The great facial animations drew me into them.\n\nOriginally,\
      \ I thought the art for The Great C had two dudes on it, but the person on the\
      \ right is Clare and she's married to Tim.  It's unusual to see a young couple\
      \ that is already married in a piece of modern entertainment, which prefers\
      \ to depict the excitement of courtship rather than the stability of matrimony.\
      \  Their relationship status probably comes from the original short-story, but\
      \ it was interesting to see nonetheless.  I also liked that Clare was not a\
      \ hard-charging 'bad-ss' bending everything to her will.  No, she was feminine\
      \ and vulnerable in this world, which goes a long ways towards making you actually\
      \ care about a female protagonist if she's not going to just easily annihilate\
      \ all obstacles she may encounter.\n\nLastly, please ignore the negative reviews\
      \ from terrible people using the Steam review system to make their excremental\
      \ opinions public.  That one review from a grug-brained troglodyte claiming\
      \ this \"doesn't do anything to take advantage of the VR medium\" is an absolute\
      \ lie.  The experience is viewed in an immersive way with a VR headset.  That\
      \ is inherently taking advantage of VR!  And just like how he gives no specifics\
      \ on how the story is \"boring,\" he also gives no examples of how this cinematic\
      \ experience could have \"taken advantage of the VR medium\" to his satisfaction.\
      \  That low-IQ review is disgusting."
