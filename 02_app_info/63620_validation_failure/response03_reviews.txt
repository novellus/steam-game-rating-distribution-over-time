We spent hours playing Cosmic Osmo and I was overjoyed when I saw I could re-live those moments and share them with my daughter. The game is a 90s-style exploration game with no real goal or ending. Just enjoy clicking around and watch crazy stuff happen. Cosmic Osmo puts real thought and effort into making a world that is as complete as it is devoid of all context. Everything seems to connect together in a way that can only make sense in whatever universe this game takes place in.","timestamp_created":1602731824,"timestamp_updated":1602731824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuNqQlfUCdr/4pwI="}
