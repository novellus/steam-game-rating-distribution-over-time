The solution to a problem will often be a hidden object puzzle in an area that you had no reason to go back to and have alrady done the puzzle two or three times.  The puzzles themselves are often unforgiving because it feels like you need to click on specific pixels known only by the game.\n\nSo far I have finished Shadow Town only, but with the exception that I've heard Origins finally adds a map I'm guessing this will remain acurate (and I'll edit if not).\n\n\nEdit: It remained accurate, this game is terrible.  Insomniac was a mild improvement but it had weird plot issues, and Origins randomly corrupted and wasn't worth starting over.","timestamp_created":1520169961,"timestamp_updated":1521248752,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530386745929718018","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmLrfmOICcO/dmgE="}
