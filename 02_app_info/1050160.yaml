    review: "This is an amazingly fun item-arena brawler. The closest games I would\
      \ compare it to are the Bomberman series and Killer Queen Black.  \n\nYour character\
      \ avatar has no impact on your move set, which consists of punching, grabbing/activating\
      \ an item, and throwing an item. Your associated Ancient One cult (Cthulhu,\
      \ Dagon, and Nyarlathotep right now) does have a slightly altered move set,\
      \ which are fitting for the time-limited avatar transformations (similar to\
      \ a Smash Bros. Smash Ball). The game moves at such a frantic, hilariously fast\
      \ and fun pace that it doesn't need more than this.  \n\nThe maps are small\
      \ king/queen-of-the-hill arenas, and your goal is to knock everyone off the\
      \ map arena. The strategy element comes in from the weapon/item variety, which\
      \ makes great use of rock-paper-scissors for the 5-second showdown fight. \n\
      \nThe single-player and cooperative content is there, but is still being worked\
      \ on for a longer experience. What is there now is amazing and immersive. My\
      \ only \"complaint\" as of July 9, '20 is that the story is short (note, this\
      \ is early access). For Overcooked gamers, think of it as only having worlds\
      \ 1-x and 2-x finalized for playing for the story campaign (there are more \"\
      worlds\" being worked on). A solo gamer would enjoy this game as a fully released\
      \ product. A solo gamer that likes the Cthulhu mythos would very likely enjoy\
      \ the game now. There is no online cooperative element; it is currently local-coop\
      \ only.\n\nCompetitive multiplayer matches are short and sweet. They're not\
      \ quite as short as Mario Party or WarioWare games, and are closer to a Bomberman\
      \ or Invisigun Heroes game experience. Each map is out to kill the players in\
      \ a uniquely different way, so it's hard for a match to have a single person\
      \ taking a huge lead. Regarding my earlier reference to Killer Queen Black,\
      \ the Ancient One that your avatar worships and transforms into is very similar\
      \ to the Soldier Bee mechanic. You have a limited experience in the \"evolved\
      \ state\", and each transformation will alter your strategy."
