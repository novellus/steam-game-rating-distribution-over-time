      \ /><br>Medieval Western European towns emerged in the 11th century. Before\
      \ the 11th century, during the Merovingian and Carolingian eras, although there\
      \ were sporadic towns, they did not become a climate. Most of them were political\
      \ centers or cities left over from ancient Rome, mainly political centers or\
      \ ancient Rome. The remaining cities are mainly political centers, not commercial\
      \ centers. After commercial towns appeared in the 11th century, medieval towns\
      \ really emerged.<br><br>    At the beginning of the 11th century, as people's\
      \ living conditions improved, many people left their homes in the countryside\
      \ and returned to the cities to live with the lord of the fief. The most influential\
      \ families will build some fortresses to protect their homes, which is also\
      \ a symbol of their wealth. Residential areas in medieval towns continued to\

    review: It feels like being in medieval England. The music and the scene work
      well together. Apart from the feeling of traveling, there is almost no other
      interaction. It would be better if there could be some medieval people walking
      around.
