It reminds me of arcade games like Boulder Dash, but with a story.  Basically in each level you are set down in a maze and told to kill all the zombies.  They bill it is as a puzzle game, but the emphasis is much more on avoiding the zombies, the puzzle comes into it in that usually you must kill the zombies and pick things up in a proper order.  It did get a bit repetitive eventually, but I could see myself coming back to it and playing a few levels here and there.\n\nThe hub on which all of the little levels are built off of is quite unique, and is also where the story progresses.\n\nAbout the only thing I don't like is the same thing I've experienced with all of the Arcen games I've tried and that's that there's always a lot of filler.  Rather than a few lovely levels there are tons and tons of samey levels.  I'm sure the lovely levels are in here, but it's why I've gotten tired of it before the end.","timestamp_created":1425720265,"timestamp_updated":1562748321,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530386745929718018","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zt/D7esCfvusOA=="}
