    about_the_game: 'LIGHT NITE is a multiplayer third person shooter with in-game
      rewards and a minimalistic low-poly &amp; cartoonish design offering several
      game modes like team deathmatch or a battle-royale game mode for soloQ and squads
      teamplay . <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1271810/extras/Jumping_off_hoverboard.gif?t=1603731386"
      /><br><br>There is a competitive mode where players instantly earn or lose their
      assets in the arena. All in-game items and gear are tokenized in a blockchain
      using the Bitcoin sidechain Liquid. There is also a casual mode where players
      just play for fun and prestige and there is no items loot.<br><br>This means
      items have a strong real value that players are able to increase as they win
      battles while decreasing scarcity, and then trade their profits in a public
      marketplace. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1271810/extras/HoverboardGrind.gif?t=1603731386"

      their years of play time into a Bitcoin wallet<br> </li><li>Secure uniqueness
      of in-game items through a scarcity system enabled by its tokenization system:
      no unlimited editions of skins, all of them accounted for<br></li><li>Use a
      decentralized Marketplace, allowing players to trade items from any of the game
