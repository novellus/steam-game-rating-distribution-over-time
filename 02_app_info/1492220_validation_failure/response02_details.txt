As you collect essence, research further improvements for your Shell, the digital presence that you use to fight off the ÆtherNet's cyber defenses.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The ÆtherNet<\/h2>Nobody knows where the ÆtherNet came from, or who runs it, but it serves as a free and publicly available network with which the world can stay connected. Some corporations' scientists and researchers have recently discovered that the ÆtherNet does more than just provide a communication grid, it serves a more fantastical purpose. It turns out that the alchemists of old were right, the classical elements can be manipulated, and even mastered, and the ÆtherNet transmits the essence of those elements and distributes it to the world. A study of the Pillars, massive columns that act as the networking substations for the ÆtherNet, has recently revealed that the seasons are actually caused by the surging of a specific element during each season. Of course, as soon as somebody found out about this new natural resource, they wanted it for themselves, and that's where you come in.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Void Corp<\/h2>Of all the corporations to find out that the Pillars are wellsprings of new natural resources, Void Corp is the lesser of many evils. Void Corp, as a company, does research and seeks to &quot;find solutions to the many mysteries of the boundless void,&quot; or at least that's what their pretentious motto says. Many companies now vie for the first mover's advantage in this new industry, and Void Corp is investing heavily in its CyberSecurity professionals and researchers to make sure they are the prime amongst them.

Upon connection to the ÆtherNet, you'll get to work fighting off its security measures and stealing as much essence as possible. Whenever you get a moment to relax away from the hostile security systems, take the chance to send the essence you've collected back to Void Corp for further research. As you send essence back to the research team, they will begin working on new ways to collect the essence in a more sustainable manner, but also on new ways to improve your Shell for more efficient survival and deeper delves into the ÆtherNet's vast web of connections.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Shells and Ætheric Essence<\/h2>Your Shell is your tool and your weapon. It is how you will crack through the cyber defenses of the ÆtherNet and collect the essences that you are paid to find. The ÆtherNet contains five different varieties of essence that Void Corp has found so far; Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and Æther. The classical elements. As you send essence back to Void Corp's main repository, the research team will find ways for you to use it to augment your Shell, making for even more efficient essence plundering!","about_the_game":"Hack into the ÆtherNet, a world-wide, anonymously owned and operated, magical networking grid to steal essence and send it back to your corporation for research.
