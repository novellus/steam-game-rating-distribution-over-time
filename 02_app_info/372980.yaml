    review: "First of all , let me clear some misleading with this app.This app does\
      \ not contain any recipes when you first start off . The only way to obtain\
      \ recipes is via website and import it into the app or just write it down .\
      \ They do have an import option , so no worries about that . This app contained\
      \ syn option which allow you to connect with other devices that is using this\
      \ app . Furthermore , it have a group syn where you can share your recipes with\
      \ your family and friend . In summary , it is a note taker with a sharing room\
      \ . Make you look more professional but actually did nothing much compared to\
      \ all those free tools out there . For the pro tools , you need to subcribe\
      \ yearly with a payment of 37 usd . Yes , it does not come along with the app\
      \ . \nSecondly , dont expect the dev to do anything anymore . This app is already\
      \ at its final version and no future update is announce. \nThird and lastly\
      \ , It work just as an organiser . Dont expect anymore from it . If you are\
      \ the type that like to keep things neat and easy to find , go for it when it\
      \ is under 50% discount . Else , just get a notepad for free instead . I bought\
      \ it when it is 30% discount thinking that it already contain the so-called\
      \ 30 cookbooks pro tool in the description . However , in the cookbook version\
      \ , there is only ( my cookbook ) . \n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\
      edited\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nI contacted\
      \ the mastercook website and it said that the steam should provide a 1 year\
      \ subcription key along with the package . Maybe i didnt get it because i bought\
      \ it along with other products . So i asked steam to gave me and they did .\
      \ But when i input it , it said this key doesn't exist. Am i scammed or what?"
