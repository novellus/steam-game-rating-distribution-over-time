This includes their combinations as well (example: If a red and a yellow gear have shared tiles, those tiles will turn orange). There are four total sections, each with a standard and challenge category of 12 puzzles (so there are a total of 48 puzzles that are the same in both standard mode and challenge mode). Standard mode gives you your first of three stars for that level, and challenge mode asks you to finish the same puzzle under a certain number of moves and under a certain amount of time to get the other two stars. I finished the game with all puzzles at three stars in about 11 hours. \n\nI definitely enjoyed my time with this game. I think it's great that there is a standard and challenge mode. A nice feature they included is that you don't have to finish both of the challenges at once to get the other two stars. You can focus on one at a time if you would prefer, because once you complete a task it gives you the star. This is much more preferable to having to be conscious of the moves you are making, while still moving as quickly as possible. When it came to the challenges, I felt there were levels that gave you plenty of time/number of moves to complete it, but there were also some others that felt like it didn't give quite enough wiggle room for mistakes. I did find, however, that after moving forward in standard mode, the challenge mode for earlier levels became easier to handle because of the extra practice I had gotten, so I recommend continuing standard or just jumping to a different challenge level if you are having trouble.\n\nThe game settings are pretty simple, but this isn't really an issue because of the minimalist nature of the game. There is a button to toggle music on and off and another button to toggle sound effects on and off. There is also a colorblind mode that puts symbols over the colors for clearer matching. I ended up muting sound effects because they became a bit irritating to listen to. I kept the music on because it had enough variation and I enjoyed its upbeat nature. The fanfare that comes with completing a level filled me with so much joy and satisfaction. It made working through the puzzles very rewarding.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to those who are looking for a short but fun experience that exercises your brain. I felt myself starting to understand the required rotations necessary to move the tiles where I wanted to (In that respect I very much see how the Rubik's Cube inspired them), and at the end of each level I felt accomplished and pleased. Some may feel that the price is a little high with the amount of hours played, so if that's the case go ahead and get it on a sale, but I personally enjoyed the whole experience enough to say it's worth the full price.","timestamp_created":1559448263,"timestamp_updated":1559448263,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53761214017868042","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lYOXi+sCeJjJwgE="}
