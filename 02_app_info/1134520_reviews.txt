I bought this because it looked like dead cells and I kinda is. Its like Dead cells with a metro vibe/asthetic, both of which games are amazing too. The only downside is the way it controls feels a bit off sometimes. Otherwise Its great, like a 8 or  9 out of 10.","timestamp_created":1609073165,"timestamp_updated":1609073165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4rICP0vYCfqXevQI="}
