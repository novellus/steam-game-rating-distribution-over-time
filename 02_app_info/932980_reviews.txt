I was surprised to get more than I expected. I see others complain the franchise mode is broken...players retire, but your allotted amount to sign players get worse the following year, making it impossible to resign all good players. But overall I have enjoyed it in Coach Mode, despite the flaws. And there are flaws.\n\nBut 3 things really get to me about playing this game:  (I play Coach Mode)\n\n1- No running game...at least not for me. Other team runs well, but I get 1-2 yards at best when my I choose a run play.\n\n2-NO FGs on 1st or 2nd or 3rd down. I can't find a way to kick a FG on 1st, 2nd, or 3rd down...like 6 seconds left, 2nd down, on their 18 Yd Line, No FG playcall option...missed easy 3 pts before the half in one game. But the AI can do it easily.\n\n3-Clock Control...After the two minute warning, if the opponent is out of time outs and has the ball, the clock stops instead of keep running after every play. 15-25 seconds should run off the clock on a play where the AI has it and runs the ball, or completes a pass. Instead it takes 4-5 seconds to run the play and then when the play is over, the clock stops until the ball is hiked again. It is like the AI has unlimited timeouts until they either score or turn over the ball. Easy to lose a game that is close with this MAJOR flaw.","timestamp_created":1609042213,"timestamp_updated":1609042213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iPeY0fYCeN3PvQI="}
