There's still more than half of the map and tasks for me to discover, let alone complete, after more than an hour of gameplay. I didn't mention it until the end of the video, but the lighting is exceptional in the game. The lighting on the balloon dog (aka, 'sheep hero' in my play through) is truly exceptional. \n\nMy only concern was with the music - there is very little of it. I would have enjoyed if even the title screen music played in the open world. Music will occasionally play while you're performing a bounce-house challenge or something like that, but the lack of music really accentuated the terrifying children giggling. Perhaps that was the point and this is secretly a game meant to induce nightmares! Either way, its not a deal breaker, no where near it. This is absolutely worth $5.","timestamp_created":1582351143,"timestamp_updated":1583779233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.587301552295684814","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zqem4PACesjn8wE="}
