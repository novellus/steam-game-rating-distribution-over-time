Seriously, it would take only a few small changes to totally eliminate all the frustration with this game and make it a really great puzzle game.   It's so close... but I don't really foresee them adding more playable improvements at this point.  They seem pretty addicted to just selling DLC.  (I'm absolutely willing to eat my words if they prove me wrong.  I do, after all, have a bunch of their DLC that I would really like to actually be able to enjoy playing).","timestamp_created":1609897114,"timestamp_updated":1609897114,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmY/W6vYCeZPwwAI="}
