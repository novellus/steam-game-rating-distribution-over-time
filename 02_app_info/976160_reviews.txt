Mainly the keg mechanic. The keg fills up in mere seconds. Those mere seconds is barely enough to make a trip (filling up a beer mug and serving it to a customer). And that's if you serve the customers that are nearest to the keg. What's worse is that the customers can only be served so much alcohol before they crash and stop accepting them which eventually forces you to serve the customers that are located at the ends of the bar.  Except those trips take up more time than you're allowed to even take and you eventually get a game over. While you do earn some cash for each customer u serve, they're only use is so u change the graphics of the bar and the barista.\n\nTLDR; this game aint even worth the dollar.","timestamp_created":1599821996,"timestamp_updated":1599821996,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/su0vvQCdNeOoQI="}
