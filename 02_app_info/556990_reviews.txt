You can only move mouse, not your character. You stay stationary behind a barricade as a muscular ripoff of Freddy Mercury who wears a Hello Kitty shirt and click on enemies to get the same reactions with hits until they die. Over, and over, and over. It's the same unsatisfying thing again and again. The \"story\" of the game is you're (look a like) Freddy Mercury and a zombie stole your guitar so you travel into a zombie infested city and just shoot zombies. There is no challenge in any way shape or form. You'd have to be a toddler or using the original cell phone game to face any sort of challenge and that would only be because the screen is small and you'd be using touch not a mouse. If you want to force yourself through long monotonous unrewarding game play, you can unlock a few new weapons but I fail to see how that would make the game any more enjoyable considering how utterly dull it is. If I had this on cell and had a choice between playing this while waiting in a doctor's office or mindlessly flipping pages in Vogue, I'd opt for Vogue... and it wouldn't even be The Broodwich Issue.","timestamp_created":1581087719,"timestamp_updated":1581087719,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45f+KkPACd5bf8AE="}
