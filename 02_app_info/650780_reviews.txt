As is, it's still a very good shoot 'em up - albeit one that demands many multiple playthroughs to git gud.","timestamp_created":1535974331,"timestamp_updated":1609180310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529940903186798096","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn92n1fYCdM73qQE="}
