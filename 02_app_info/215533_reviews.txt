This wasn't amazing at all.\nStuff like this doesn't need a store page.\nIt's just a colour editor of the costumes.\nAnd this doesn't even work for them all.\nThis was probably: Simply a cut feature.\nSelling this thing as a DLC seems stupid.\nAnd purchasing this feels even dumber.\nThis game had awesome DLC's for sure.\nExcept this terribly bad one right here.\nI wouldn't like this even as a 'free' DLC.\nA big negative review is deserved here.\nThis really doesn't need the store page.","timestamp_created":1595594327,"timestamp_updated":1595594327,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491596639156341553","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vai1wPMCev2hlwI="}
