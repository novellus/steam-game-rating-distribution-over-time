For comparison the Japanese game version of Railroad Museum has 224 train display slots.\n\nCurrent Freight Train list still at 3 items, would be nice if the other unique Japan freight rolling stocks can also be included.\n\nBut you can't argue with FREE !","timestamp_created":1453601884,"timestamp_updated":1453602748,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.650615453720092773","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5rbeuNICeICDTw=="}
