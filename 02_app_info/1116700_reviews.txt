What started out with promise quickly turned into a grey washed out blobby mess of put this thingamabob into this whoseewhatsit. It actually got worse as it went on. The bonus chapter should be classified as torture as all the screens look the same, the puzzles make no sense and it's just a barren mess with nonsensical crap hunts. Lazy. Next time make a game which has more people to interact with, keep up the pace of how it started which seemed promising and don't just make it one big crap puzzle fest; actually have a few interesting locations with goals instead of ugly repetitive puzzle hunts.","timestamp_created":1608302328,"timestamp_updated":1608302328,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjL+Su/YCf8eZuwI="}
