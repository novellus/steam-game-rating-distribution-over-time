      \   <br />\r\n      After the mysterious death of his parents, Mark was for\
      \ the first time alone in the world ... Until one day an old friend of the family\

      \ that from of that event was bound to wander in the land of the living forever\
      \ ... protecting his book of secrets and seeking blood and vengeance."
