These cares are the back drop to the cards you use in game to create an image for yourself. It is just to look at and that's all. There is no benefit of getting these cards early. You can unlock these cards while you play the game and complete challenges. If you like the cards and can think of what to put on the cards then I would pick this up if I were you. These are really fun cards to look at but I personally haven't really used them due to the fact that they aren't really unique and fun. They are basic and hard to link them to your attitude as a player. These cards are shown to the enemy player after you have killed them. I don't find these cards worth it to buy before you start playing the game. They are kind of worthless and as stated before just for looks. If you get it fine, but I suggest not to buy this DLC because you can earn them in-game.","timestamp_created":1333325242,"timestamp_updated":1333325242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6ZOYuLYCf8SxCg=="}
