You could probably find all the artwork online by this point, to be honest, so I can't say there's much of a reason to play this. It's decent the first time through, but with how many times you need to repeat the same 3 levels, it runs its course quickly, and it's highly unlikely you'll revisit it after you've unlocked the full image gallery. Play it if you're super curious, I guess. Otherwise, you can skip this and miss very little. Again, this is mostly here for fanservice.","timestamp_created":1597622279,"timestamp_updated":1609405783,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4veuD3PYCdOL2mwI="}
