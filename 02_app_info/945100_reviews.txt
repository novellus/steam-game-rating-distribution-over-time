The game is really challenging and has huge replayability even with when playing the same track due to the procedural generation of enemies.\nThe bosses are really fun to fight against and the enemies all have their own unique abilities!\n\nReally fun and looking forward to playing more of this game!","timestamp_created":1607078631,"timestamp_updated":1607078631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45brWlvYCevmatwI="}
