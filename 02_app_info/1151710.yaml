    about_the_game: "Livonia is the brand-new DLC map for DayZ, allowing players to\
      \ experience the hardcore survival hit in a whole new environment. Up to 60\

      \ land for as long as possible, by any means necessary.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Key Features</h2><strong>New massive world to explore.</strong> At 163 km\xB2\
      , Livonia is big enough to provide you with hours of exploration as you learn\
      \ the lay of the land. Its varied landscapes and numerous landmarks provide\
      \ an abundance of places for players to take shelter, build a base, and hide\
      \ from both the infected and other survivors.<br><br><strong>Idyllic environment.</strong>\
      \ This Eastern European terrain covers the southern Topolin-Nadb\xF3r region\
      \ of the larger Polish-speaking country of Livonia. The new topography brings\
      \ lush green landscapes, dense forests, overgrown fields, winding rivers, serene\
      \ lakes, murky swamps, an array of dilapidated structures, and various remnants\
      \ of an abandoned society.<br><br><strong>Frequent Encounters.</strong> The\
