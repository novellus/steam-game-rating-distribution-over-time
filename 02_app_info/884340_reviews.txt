It's been slightly over a year since anything was heard from the developers so they're either quietly working on this or they've abandoned it. I'm thinking the latter at this point.\n\nIt's a shame as this showed some great potential but with the devs not giving updates and messages from several people being ignored on Discord I can only assume that this is a dead game.\n\nI cannot recommend this given the current situation and I certainly hope the devs com back to it.\n\n\nOLD REVIEW:\nFor clarification: I did receive a temporary free copy of the game for Beta Testing but that copy has since been revoked when the Beta Test ended and now I own a personally paid for copy.\n\nFor those concerned about any Early Access products:\n*It's very early days for this Early Access product but so far the developer team of two are very active on both the forums and Discord and are acknowledging bugs almost as fast as we can report them. It's good to know that players are being paid attention to.\n\n*The team has been receptive of comments and suggestions from the community.\n\n*Despite the nature of team based games in this day and age I have yet to come across anybody toxic. I've played several games in co-op mode and those that do talk have been amazingly friendly. Only time will tell how this holds up but so fa it's looking good.\n\nPro's:\n* An interesting take on the zombie survival genre where the devs aren't enabling people with infinite stamina to do crazy parkour stunts to avoid  and attack zombies. At this time you can't even jump which makes sense considering the equipment the playable characters are wearing.\n\n*Supplies are limited. You're hand isn't held with an over abundance of first aid kits and ammunition as they're all limited. The only exception are the handguns you start out with as they have infinite ammo which I don't agree with personally.\n\n*The \"Find Lobby\" function works when there's another person hosting and most of the time there's almost no problem joining a game. At the moment the game will only find hosted games that haven't started yet and the community has made the suggestion to the devs to make it so we can join games already in progress.\n\n* Since Beta Testing there have been almost daily updates to fix reported issues. The devs stated just recently that they're going to limit the updates to one per day in order to reduce overall patching time.\n\nPro / Con:\n*The maps are interesting in their concepts and have potential to look amazing but their appearances are basic and do need some work. At this time they look pretty basic, are way too dark for my own personal taste (could use more ambience lighting like table lamps, candles, emergency lighting etc), and in some placed feels way too open, even in the bedrooms of the mansion.\n\n!!HOWEVER!!\nThat being said they do play very well, it's still very early days and much can change. They have provided the basic necessities of playability to the levels very well and, at this time, that's more important while they focus on removing bugs and adding more gameplay features.\n\nCons:\n*For me the guns feel too close to the screen when aiming down the sites.\n\n*Reviving players isn't made very clear but all you have to do is find the player, stand over them, and hold 'E'. But I must state that the devs are aware of this and are working on possible ideas to better highlight this.\n\n*There's only one objective for all maps and that's to gather supplies that are inexplicably scattered. It would be nice if the devs could make it so that the supplies are randomly placed around the map but that could, maybe, come up in future updates and provide variety in gameplay experience.\n\nSummary:\nI normally try not to be brutal on any Early Access products that have only just been released and there's a lot of room for both community feedback and potential from the devs on any EA product.\n\nI've played far worse \"Day Zero\" Early Access games and had my money refunded as they were clearly cash grabs.\n\nThis isn't one of them and I certainly wish the devs well.","timestamp_created":1565795670,"timestamp_updated":1604384959,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514569222927093506","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4ofWyxvUCfNWr0AE="}
