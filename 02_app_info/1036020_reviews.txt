They're quite hard to get as you can only get them from selling certain items (and unlocking chests that drop the broken/complete iron plates).\n\nI'd say get it to the support the team, the DLC isn't that useful though.","timestamp_created":1560723155,"timestamp_updated":1560723155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577478289604187012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g62WsesCccbHwwE="}
