Made by Acke Hallgren in the Unreal Engine, this brief point-and-click allows players to explore an attic that has some unexpected items. With puzzles that are just challenging enough, it is both relaxing and frustrating in a way that only adventure games can be.”<br>7.9 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/indie-hive.com\/what-never-was-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Indie Hive<\/a><br><br>“...a first-person adventure that feels like a cross between Gone Home and Myst.
