This game is very similar to Danganronpa/Zero escape series. A group of people are trapped at specific location and are forced to play games for survival.  As a added bonus, you also get a chance to choose one of the two handsome guys to have a romance with. The puzzles are fairly easy which is nice since I don't have to look for hints/guide to solve them. The translation is not that great but it is understandable and you can finish the game fine. Also has nice CGS and the plot itself is very much worth playing.\nIf you are a fan of Danganronpa/Zero escape series, I would definitely recommend that you give this game a try.","timestamp_created":1601431374,"timestamp_updated":1601431421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hIiw7vQCf/33pAI="}
