    about_the_game: "Delve into the Great Western once more with the famed and versatile\
      \ GWR Pannier Tanks!<br><br>In order to adapt to the latest in firebox technology,\
      \ the Great Western Railway had to alter the design of tank locomotives, switching\
      \ from \u201Csaddle\u201D water tanks to \u201Cpannier\u201D water tanks to\
      \ make everything fit. The change was an all-around success, and eventually\
      \ led to some of the most prolific locomotive types in British railway history.<br><br>There\
      \ were several successful iterations of the GWR \u201CPannier Tanks\u201D \u2013\
      \ such as the 5400, 6400, 5700 and 7400 classes, all of which are included in\
      \ the GWR Pannier Tank Pack \u2013 the most popular of which was the 5700 fleet,\
      \ which between itself and all its variants came in at over 850 locomotives\
      \ strong. These locomotives were used throughout the GWR network on both passenger\
      \ and freight duties. Meanwhile, other classes such as 5400 and 6400 were fitted\
      \ for unique \u201Cauto-train\u201D operation on lighter passenger duties.<br><br>Despite\
      \ being no express workers, some GWR Pannier Tank locomotives were able to achieve\
      \ up to 500,000 miles during their operational lifetime, and multiple examples\
      \ were some of the last steam locomotives to still be in active service with\
      \ the National Coal Board, as well as London Transport. Of the plentiful 5700\
      \ Class, 16 were preserved with 6 currently operational, meaning visitors of\
      \ heritage railways can get a taste of the GWR\u2019s finest shunter.<br><br>In\
      \ Train Simulator, you have the ability to experience the GWR Panniers in incredible,\
      \ authentic and almost never-ending detail. The different configuration and\
      \ livery options mean you have access to hundreds upon hundreds of individual\
      \ locomotives, as they were in each era. If that wasn\u2019t enough, the GWR\
      \ Panniers are accompanied by the BR-built Hawksworth A38, A39, A40 and A43\
      \ autocoaches for varied steam-era push-pull operations.<br><br> <h2 class=\"\
