    review: "There is nothing that I can specifically point to as exceptional about\
      \ this game, yet I highly recommend it!  \n\nI found the HO scenes pretty challenging,\
      \ while the mini-games provided a variety of easy fun.  The story is okay. \
      \ The voice acting is average.  The interactive map is handy.  You can play\
      \ mahjong if you don't feel like HO fun (but then why are you playing a HOG?\
      \ lol)  Non-Steam achievements are available for those so inclined.  \n\nI can't\
      \ put my finger on it, but something kept compelling me to play this game to\
      \ the end once I started it.  The main story took just under 4 hours, the bonus\
      \ about an extra hour.  I wasn't in any hurry, mind you.  But whatever their\
      \ secret ingredient is, the whole game is a really solid entry in the HOG genre."
