The voice acting uses British talent, which especially makes sense with the game's setting in London.  While they're not 'AAA' talent, the voice actors clearly put their hearts into the characters and are enjoyable to listen to, with a few minor exceptions of lines where for whatever reason were very poorly captured by the recording.  Still, a minor quibble that doesn't detract from the experience.\n\nThe game is light on sheer number of choices, sticking to presenting them only when they're major and otherwise leaving the protagonist to have his own defined personality.  Choosing a route is thus less of complimenting character A over character B repeatedly and more about the major path you turn down.  The routes also seem dramatic in nature and not romantic (although since I haven't played all of them I don't know for certain).\n\nI was initially somewhat hesitant to purchase this due to its hefty price for such an unknown game, but when I did and fired it up I found myself hooked and lost the whole day to completing my first route.  I'm now looking forward to diving back in and exploring more of what it has to offer.","timestamp_created":1531178914,"timestamp_updated":1531178914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569491565227508545","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjYLYwOQCcOjXpQE="}
