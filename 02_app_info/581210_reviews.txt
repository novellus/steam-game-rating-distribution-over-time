Instead of managing the dungeon, now you have to run around with a character and fight incoming invaders too. There's also not as much flexibility in this game as there was in the others. It's more like a puzzle/tower defense game. Maybe some people would like this, but I like their other games better.","timestamp_created":1588460308,"timestamp_updated":1588460308,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4pjn6/ECd6iThQI="}
