      \ Game<br />\r\nIt is said that there was a wonder land located in the coldest\
      \ place of the earth. The indigenous people lived happily under the protect\
      \ of the God. Until one day, an evil dragon came here leading its vicious corps.\
      \ Destroying everything violently and expelling the residents out of their home,\
      \ the evil dragon attempted to occupy the whole world. At this moment, the God\
      \ came down from heaven and fought a life-and-death battle with the dragon in\
      \ order to protect the residents. In the end, the dragon was defeated and fled\
      \ into the ice land with its corps. The world was back in peace. To prevent\
      \ the dragon from invading again, the God built a magic gate and sent guardians\
      \ to garrison there. During this short peaceful time, everything was covered\
      \ by cold thick ice. Turret was frozen and the magic has been weakened. The\
      \ dragon from afar is getting ready for the next attack. Another protection\
      \ battle is about to begin. <br />\r\nOperation Instructions: <br />\r\n1. Two-handed\
      \ Sword: pressing the trigger key of either hilt, waving the hilt rapidly and\
      \ then loosing the hilt, an attack could be launched. Controlling the hilt and\
      \ crossing the swords with both hands, a defense could be conducted. Lifting\
      \ two swords over your head could charge power. After charging for 3 seconds,\
      \ waving down the swords simultaneously could trigger clutch shot. <br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\n2. Wands: the left hilt of magical weapons controls magic book and\
      \ the right hilt controls wands.Pressing the trigger key of right hilt could\
      \ charge magic power. Adjusting the position of right hilt could control the\
      \ cast track. Loosening the trigger key after charging power for 0.5 second\
      \ could launch the magic according to the cast track. Pressing the trigger key\
      \ of left hilt could conduct defense but attacks could not be conducted while\
      \ defensing. Charging magic power for 1.5 seconds or 3 seconds could trigger\
      \ more powerful magic.<br />\r\n3. Bow and Arrow: left hilt controls the bow\
      \ and right hilt controls the bowstring. Adjusting the position of left and\
      \ right hilts and imitating the bow drawing action could control the arrow shooting\
      \ track. Pressing the trigger key of right hilt and pulling back the right hilt\
      \ could pull the string. Loosening the trigger key could shoot the arrow according\
      \ to the shooting track. Pressing the trigger key of left hilt could conduct\
      \ defense but attacks could not be conducted while defensing. After hitting\
      \ one target, next attack will become multiple shot attack. Continuous hit will\
      \ launch the clutch shot of bow and arrow."
