I haven't played a LEGO ever since 2016 and let me tell you that completing the game feels like a huge milestone. I'd recommend it to those that are true MARVEL fans. Great characters. Decent bonus missions, and one good campaign. Before purchasing or even having the thought of purchasing it, I do have to say that you'll definitely encounter many glitches. Oof, including several crashes that I had during the exploration of Chronopolis. All in all tho, the game is pretty...meh imo. I'd suggest saving up for other better LEGO games than this one.","timestamp_created":1610169387,"timestamp_updated":1610169759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40Zbm8vYCfLncwQI="}
