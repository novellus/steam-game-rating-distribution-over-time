Bad thing is that it's not a good haircut. Turns out pulling out your hair with hands hurts your scalp.\nIf those 300 and something deaths on the last 2 Levels alone teach me anything is that this game will get you a free visit to the mental asylum with your own room for a couple of months.\n\nSymptoms include:\n- Aggresion\n- Panic attacks\n- Stress\n- Blindness and nausea from screaming\n- And absolute hate against your table\n\nIt was torture. I literally went through all 5 stages of grief. But that's what games with a tag [b]Difficult[/b] do. This game did it well... maybe too well.\nThe price seems alright and the amount of levels and lenght are pretty equivalent to that. There were some unfair and annoying bugs. Sometimes the level design wasn't that great but the unique concept made it just a little better and perhaps even worth it a tiny bit.\n\n\n[b]At the end I made it, but while playing I wished someone would unPLUG ME from living.[/b]","timestamp_created":1609286024,"timestamp_updated":1609735650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrZfu5fYCdYrOvgI="}
