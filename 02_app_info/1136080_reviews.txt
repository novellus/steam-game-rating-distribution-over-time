It ended up being a lot better than I expected it to be from initial impressions.  It plays a lot like Castlevania, though you have a much smaller primary weapon - thus less opportunity for damage mitigation.  However, the game's design takes this into account.  There's opportunities to heal, usually appropriately placed.  The biggest hurdle is just figuring the game out.  The game, and manual if you track it down (it is not included in this release) both lie.  You can tackle the stages in any order, and beat the bosses in any order, but each sword has ONE boss that takes double damage from it.  Once you swap to another sword, you cannot go back.  So there's a linear pattern you are supposed to play in, but if you are good you can do it however you like.\n\nA unique feature is the falcon.  In two player mode, the second player controls the falcon, letting them deal damage elsewhere on the screen while the main player progresses.  This helps find hidden items, and the bird is required to damage some enemies.  You do have partial control over the bird in single player, can set it to fly, and attack, but it's much more capable in someone else's hands.\n\nThe game is challenging, but not overly so.  Once you get the hang of it, it can be completed fairly quickly.  I honestly do believe this is a bit of a hidden gem for the system.  And yes, it is emulated, so you could use the ROM with another emulator if you wished.  Worth a purchase, on sale at least.","timestamp_created":1607201172,"timestamp_updated":1607201172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwovWpmvYCeIHMtwI="}
