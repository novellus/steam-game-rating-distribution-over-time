    review: "I had bought this, hoping the wallpapers would be in game so I could\
      \ take screenshots. I was a bit sad finding out, they're downloaded to your\
      \ computer for use & nothing changes in game. \n\nOverall, I learned something\
      \ new for future Steam buy's. I've been wanting this game & excited for it.\
      \ The game seem's worth the sales price so far from what I've played & with\
      \ the added on DLC purchased along side it! Happy, Thank You!"
