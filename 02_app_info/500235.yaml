    review: Total waste of money. Bought it then closed down, next day used it 30
      minutes max, then changed to another plane and continued playing. Filed for
      a refund because it is not realistic (crap is what it is...) and Steam said
      since I had played the game for more than 2 hours I couldn't get a refund. People
      who left positive feedback must have been paid by the seller.
