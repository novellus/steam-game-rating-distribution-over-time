      \ knives and the mechanical scabbard of the bulletable switch section. This\
      \ design is not a simple styling feature, but the use of science fiction organs\
      \ to enable the protagonist to achieve the difficult and gorgeous action that\
      \ ordinary cold weapons can not make, and to turn the system of switching weapons\
      \ into a special attack action rather than incompatible with the combat system.\
      \ Additional system.<br><br>The jet samurai sword can be combined with a mechanical\
      \ scabbard with a muzzle to form a shelling knife for the knife side. The two\
      \ types have different attack speed, damage and various values; and two types\
