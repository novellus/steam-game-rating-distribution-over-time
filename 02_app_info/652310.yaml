    about_the_game: "Welcome to Khufu's Delivery Service! <br />\r\nAt KDS your job\
      \ is to sort the incoming cut stone from the quarry for sending to the builders\
      \ at Giza. Efficiency is the goal, sending a full load means less time wasted\
      \ counting on the other end and a quicker turnaround for that team for you.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nOh, and the builders also offer a bonus for color-matching\
      \ boards of any size, as it helps them utilize the stone quicker.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nKeep the process flowing and everyone stays happy, got it?<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nKhufu's Delivery Service is an arcade puzzle game that challenges\
      \ your skill and speed to maximize space with different shaped pieces. There\
      \ are currently 4 game modes: Standard, Time-Attack, Pyramid, and Puzzle. Each\
      \ focuses on a different gameplay aspect to provide a variety ways to have fun!<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nGame Directions: <br />\r\nDrag and drop the pieces from the\
      \ conveyor onto the open boards. Try to fill each one as much as possible, once\
      \ they are at least half-full they can be 'sent' (the button below each box)\
      \ away. The more full the board the more points its worth, plus a faster respawn\
      \ time. Sending a board comprised of all the same color also receives a points\
      \ bonus. Time-attack and Pyramid modes are different variations of this, with\
      \ the time-attack mode focusing on speed and the pyramid mode focusing on maximum\
      \ effieciency. Puzzle mode is more like traditional tangrams, use the pieces\
      \ provided to fill in each puzzle."

    review: This is a very good and original Tetris variation. Option to turn music
      off would be appreciated and left/right rotation keys would probaly make it
      much better.
