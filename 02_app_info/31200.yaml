    review: This chapter gets trippy with a couple of interesting mechanics thrown
      in. It also gets uncharacteristically dark - I don't think I've ever heard Guybrush
      sound as serious as he does in this chapter sometimes. Also, the crappy French
      antagonist with his fake accent finally gets it. Bon voyage!
