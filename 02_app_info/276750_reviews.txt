What?  For a game I've owned for years?\nGoogling, I see this:\n\n\"A valid serial number allows you to unlock an account only once. When the serial number has been used for an activation, its useful life is over and thus the serial number can no longer be used for further activations!\"\n\nWasted my money.  Buyer beware.  One activation allowed, only.  One star.  I'd give it zero if I could for this kind of greed and horrible treatment of a customer who bought the product.","timestamp_created":1609433637,"timestamp_updated":1609433637,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525423705577850342","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iIzu3PYCe8eTvwI="}
