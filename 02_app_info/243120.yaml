    about_the_game: <i>Betrayer</i> is a first person action adventure game that takes
      you to the New World at the turn of the 17th century.<br><br>The year is 1604.
      You sailed from England expecting to join a struggling colony on the coast of
      Virginia. Instead, you find only ghosts and mysteries. What catastrophe blighted
      the land and drained it of color and life? Where are the settlers and tribes
      who lived here? <br><br>Clue by clue, you must piece together the story of what
      befell this doomed settlement and find a way to set things right. You will be
      hunted by corrupted Conquistadors and ravening shadows as you explore an expansive
      wilderness in order to trace the brief, tragic history of the colony and search
      for survivors.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Explore
      large, open environments teeming with danger and discovery. Chart your own course
      in search of clues and treasures. <br></li><li>Switch between two distinct worlds
      featuring different enemies, obstacles, and threats. <br></li><li>Wield early
      17th century weaponry including muskets, bows, crossbows, and tomahawks. Upgrade
      your arsenal by purchasing or finding faster, deadlier, longer-ranged weapons.
      <br></li><li>Charge headlong into battle with guns blazing or pick enemies off
      quietly. A novel, movement-based stealth system lets you hide in plain sight
      or use the wind to mask your footsteps. <br></li><li>Equip ability-enhancing
      Charms to complement your play style, granting anything from extra health to
      faster movement to improved stealth.<br></li><li>Play with the default visual
      style for maximum eeriness and tension or customize the color and contrast settings
      to suit your tastes. </li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">About Blackpowder Games</h2>Our
      ongoing mission is to create first person action experiences that are distinctive,
      compelling, and memorable regardless of scope or platform. Most of the founders
      began this quest together over 15 years ago at Monolith Productions and have
      continued to refine and improve our craft as a team ever since. We expect to
      continue on this righteous path for centuries to come now that the Singularity
      is just around the corner.
