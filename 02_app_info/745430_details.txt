Neon Aileron was created to evoke memories of playing older shooters that pre-date the bullet-hell genre.  We call this bullet-lite, because the focus is on shooting enemies instead of dodging complex bullet patterns.  Neon Aileron is great for players who are new to the shoot 'em up genre or those who haven't a played a horizontal shooter in a while.  The forgiving damage system and multiple difficulty levels allow the game to scale to the player's skill level.
