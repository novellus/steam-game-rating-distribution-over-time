    about_the_game: <strong>Absolutely Goode Championship</strong> is a game where
      you can either pilot a fast running marble as it competes, rolling downhill,
      on 10 different tracks or just relax, watch and root for different marble teams
      competing against each other.<br>Before the consumer electronics revolution,
      and for millennia, mostly what people had to play with were dice, cards, kites,
      wheels and marbles.<br>Being, originally, nothing more than rounded pebbles,
      marbles were able to deliver a lot of fun in hours of playtime.<br>In time,
      polished pebbles gave space to beautifully crafted glass balls, with an infinity
      of colors and internal patterns resembling stars, flowers, eyes and candies,
      just to mention a few.<br>One of the most fun and challenging marbles games
      was the downhill race, where players would spend hours planning, building and
      perfecting the race tracks in preparation for rooting for their 'teams', as
      they rushed downhill using gravity to accelerate towards the finish line.<br>Fast
      forward to the 21st century and now people of all ages can sit and watch videos
      of such competitions, in elaborated scenarios, wishing, many times, they could
      be able to influence the races outcome.<br><strong>Absolutely Goode Championship</strong>
      grants you that wish.<br>Actively pilot any of 16 beautifully rendered marbles
      on 10 different race tracks in Quick Races and Championships or just start an
      idle event and watch to the teams competing against each other, listening to
      an engaging theme song.<br>Chose the best difficulty level to challenge your
      skills and prepare yourself to face a fierce competition... those marbles are
      not fooling around.

    review: It would be great to see, at least for local play, a system where one
      could play against his friends by picking a certain marble(uncontrolled) for
      every race in a tournament. Like betting on a marble instead of a horse and
      let the race run free to see what place everyone comes in against ALL the other
      random marbles with a point system like F1. I hope this is part of what championship
      mode is. Just a thought. The more options the better.
