    review: "Orc Island is a really cool looking game, I love the retro look to it.\
      \ Found it a little hard to start with but once I worked out the controls it\
      \ was great fun. Have managed to craft some survival tools and made some weapons...........\
      \ Hunted chickens and I'm ready for the first night Orcs. BRING IT ON!!\n\n\
      Cool sounds and music in game. Would say the game needs a little polishing up\
      \ in areas but I'm sure that will come in any updates. Would love to see an\
      \ Island creator or a selection of different Island maps to keep things interesting.\
      \ \n\nWill keep playing this game, when my children allow. They love Minecraft\
      \ and have now had a play of this. The creative side is  a huge feature of this\
      \ game, you can change the shape of blocks in game. COOL. Some great Island\
      \ camp ideas spring to mind.\n\nAs the game is now I would give it a high 3\
      \ to a 4 out of 5. If the devloper reads this please keep working on the game,\
      \ be sure to love my idea of an Island maker and as I say polish it up a touch\
      \ more.\n\nCheck it out, fun and challenging game."
