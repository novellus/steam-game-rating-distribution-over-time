    review: Coming from someone who actually beat the game in one sitting, then played
      though it again. I can tell this was a work of love and hardship for the devs,
      this is really something you can appreciate from the small dev team that made
      it. I was never into speedrunning but this game just constantly is bringing
      me back and making me pull up livesplit to beat my times for each chapter, no
      there isn't a vast story, but for an indie game some of the puzzle had me stumped.
      The game has that vibe that makes you say one more time. The platform can be
      frustrating, but once you master it. Oh once you master it it's satisfying,
      I loved the movement of this game it even has a multitude of enemies the guns
      do seem underpowered and ammo feels like more of a utility than a weapon, enemies
      do seem to be placed to lengthen gameplay, but I found it fun figuring out how
      to manage to skip every enemy.  For 99 cents this game was truly a masterpiece.
      I loved every second of it.
