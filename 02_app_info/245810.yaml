    reviews: "\u201CDCS: A10C Warthog is a tremendously \u2013 and at times obscenely\
      \ \u2013 demanding game. You will experience cranial overload, and you will,\
      \ unless you're a devout ED disciple, curse the developer for being so damned\
      \ cryptic. But for those who favor stepping into the shoes of a real pilot who\
      \ flies but a single plane, and for those who are willing to commit fully to\
      \ a program that may well take months to evolve, this is the current peak of\
      \ the genre.\u201D<br>8/10 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/17/dcs-a-10c-warthog-review\"\

      \ isn\u2019t for everyone\u2014this is a simulation that demands dedication\
      \ to reveal its true worth, and only those prepared to put in the time and effort\
      \ to mine its treasure trove of avionics challenges will see that reward. The\
      \ Hog is a relatively easy aircraft to fly, but doing so while battling armed\
      \ forces with this brutally realistic weapons delivery platform is one of the\
      \ most challenging\u2014and intensely satisfying\u2014undertakings you\u2019\
