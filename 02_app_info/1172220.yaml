      \ do is sit down in the control chair and start travelling at hyper speed.<br\
      \ />\r\nThen you receive a message from H.Q. They found the enemy base. You\
      \ have to enter it and destroy the mainframe computer that controls all the\
      \ robots.<br />\r\nYou have to control the spaceship, avoid the base walls,\
      \ and fight with the robot squids. They'll fire at you, but you can parry with\
      \ an energy shield.<br />\r\nYou rotate the ship with the WASD keys or arrow\
      \ keys, fire with space and raise the shield with the 'S' or 'DOWN' arrow key.<br\
      \ />\r\nThe game is quite similar to the Asteroids and River Raid. You won't\
      \ lose your progress because of a checkpoint system."

    review: 'If you like retro space shooters, you''ll probably like this one, especially
      if the developer listens to my suggestions and spends 20 minutes making some
      simple changes as seen in this video:


      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMsT6F3nAQ0&feature=youtu.be

      (Space Space coverage starts at 20:00 in)


      My score "as is" at launch if the developer changes nothing and fails to listen
      to my suggestions:  65%


      Ehhh, it needs a few simple changes to make it a "recommend" but I will recommend
      it to old school retro game fans.'
