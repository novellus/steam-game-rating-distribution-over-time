Enjoyable as a 3D game. \nAfter crash-landing on a sentient planet, you awake to find a dreamscape world filled with discovery, wonder and the littered remains of a betrayed civilization\n Puzzles are easy to very difficult (some tricky platforming).  You have a jet pack to get around (thus the VR was too disorienting with the movement for me) Very good graphics and the story is ok.  Ending a bit of a let down but not enough to really hurt the overall experience of the game.","timestamp_created":1604899847,"timestamp_updated":1604899847,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tYff1fUCdIGlrQI="}
