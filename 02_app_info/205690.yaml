    review: Neat idea in theory, but it gets too difficult too fast (at least for
      me), meaning it winds up being more frustrating than fun. I've downloaded it
      twice now, and each time given up after about an hour because I just know I
      don't have what it takes to make it through to the end. If you love really difficult
      games requiring precise timing and perseverance, it could be worth a go, but
      for everyone else there are just too many more entertaining alternatives to
      recommend this.
