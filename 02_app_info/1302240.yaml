      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>The Hedge Maze at ol Jonny Honk\u2019s Fair\
      \ has been there as long as anyone can remember, but it's never been open. The\
      \ rumor is, a kid named Charles got lost in it, went in and never came out.\
      \ When a cop went in after them they went missing as well. No one\u2019s entirely\
      \ sure, but the locals tend to keep away from it. The maze lives right on the\
      \ edge of the Local Fairgrounds, and they are hoping to open it up as an attraction.<br><br>Built\
      \ on the land of Ethel Fir. A twice widowed woman who died in 1935 leaving no\
      \ will and no heir. It's said the maze was a crazed project she had worked away\
      \ at for years before her death. She had fervently planted and shaped the trees\
      \ muttering about looky loos, and nosey brats as it grew bigger each year, surrounding\
      \ her house and grounds, and slowly growing taller and taller. After nearly\
      \ 8 years without anyone seeing her, the local authorities assumed her dead,\
      \ and entered the maze. They found her home in a state of disrepair, food clearly\
      \ long rotten, and it appeared no one had lived in it for quite a long time.\
      \ They searched the home, and what they could of the maze itself, but failed\
      \ to find her body or any information regarding her death. Without a will in\
      \ place, her property was left to the state, and turned into a local park, open\
      \ to the fair when it visited town.<br><br>It's said that from time to time\
      \ kids will wander in on a dare, or couples will enter trying to find old Ethel's\
      \ home as a quiet place to be together. Often they come out safe and sound,\
      \ if a little excitable, but the town has always had a higher than normal rate\
      \ of missing persons. No one has ever been found in the maze. In the light of\
      \ day it's simply an overgrown hedge, and a dilapidated home from the late 1800s.<br><br>This\
      \ year the maze has been designated as an attraction and the Fair needs some\
      \ help setting up after previous employees have either quit or disappeared."

    review: If you're looking for tension, atmosphere, and a great way to flip your
      lid with friends, this is your game. Labyrinthine is a tense otherworldly nightmare
      that shares it's DNA with Silent Hill, Amnesia, and nightmare induced night
      sweats. The game combines otherworldly creatures that defy description with
      puzzles that inspire coarse language in both success and failure, and is handily
      one of my favorite things I've played in quite some time. My only complaint
      is that there isn't more of it yet, with yet being the operative word here.
      If you like supporting video games as an art form, or if you like using your
      brain, or if you like sweating so hard you could short out your mouse, this
      is the game for you. 10/10, will beat the absolute brakes off of this game.
