The developer does seem commited to improving it, and has fixed some of the issues I've highlighted. \n\nHowever there is still a lot of stuff that needs addressing. It is almost like they decided to make a game like FTL, without ever playing FTL. So it looks like FTL, but doesn't play much like FTL at all. Hopefully this changes, to some extent. I'm not expecting a clone of FTL, but if you are going to do the art style, overall gameplay of FTL, and feel of FTL's combat, then they should at least start with those things as a minimum. \n\nI'll continue to provide feedback to the developer, as they release new patches and features. \n\nMaybe in a year, it might be worth buying, but it certainly is not now. The developer gave me a review key, to continue to provide feedback, and I do appreciate the opportunity to test the game.","timestamp_created":1587870010,"timestamp_updated":1590893731,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.683361351490020752","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1589217567,"developer_response":"Hello!
