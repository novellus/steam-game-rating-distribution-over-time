I love the art and the extra little bit of text description here and there. The combat is good and i like how you can place items you found into a container that you can access in another play through. Eg. you might have a bot character who cannot use certain heal items so placing it in the container for when you play with a human character for example. If you are into these sorts of games, give it a go. (note: it seems the devs have abandoned finishing the game, sadly. The game had a lot of potential.)","timestamp_created":1603352106,"timestamp_updated":1605299650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3ZfU4fUCdeuwqQI="}
