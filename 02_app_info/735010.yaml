    review: Pretty good linear basic RPG. No need to grind, could probably skip a
      lot of fights if you want as enemies are on the map. Choice of party composition.
      English translation is "not good" but it's extremely good actually and adds
      to the entertainment value. Beat it in 4 hours... but there seems to be more
      to do on an alternate path!
