    review: 'Fair quality, for a free one-man-team game. Kinetic, takes ~2hrs with
      a somewhat slow reading speed.


      Story -- some elements surprising to me, otherwise predictable


      Characters -- I felt like this was ruined a bit by the deuteragonist being tsundere,
      with only an offhand justification. Maybe some inconsistence for plot convenience
      too?


      Visual & sound -- Fair enough. I liked hair shading, which many anime-style
      pieces omit. More even distribution of CGs would be more interesting maybe?


      68/100, eh'
