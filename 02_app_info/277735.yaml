    review: 'If you''re interested to use it in other means but shunting or yard-to-yard
      movements (just to explore other routes), keep in mind this is not "pure" mainline
      locomotive - yep, it can outperform Pannier Tank Class in output power and acceleration
      (as well as in chest and boiler volume), at least at uphill Goodrington hardcore
      scenario at Riviera seem to me much easier. On short rides - approx 3-5 mile
      long it behaves similar to other mid-low-power freight mainline steam locomotives
      like 2MT or Fowler, taking in account "normal" weight (15 loaded 2 axle cars),
      but on long runs (>10 miles) it may lose the speed on flat profile with small
      grade due to higher consumption of coal and water at these speeds (tried on
      Riviera coastal part and speed slowly decreased to 45-47 mph in some places).
      I easily accelerated it to 50 mph, but it seem other speeds more than this are
      achievable but with big overusage of steam power or using extra motive power
      or decreasing load (I''m not an expert, but it seem challenging to me). On the
      other hand, the regulator and reverser (in simplified HUD mode) give a lot of
      control over speed and acceleration (same can be said about brake system), so
      it looks more powerful than it looks on the first glance. In overall I can underscore
      that this is well modeled locomotive, not having bugs in simplified (HUD) control
      in freeroams (however this problem happened to me few times in career scenarios)
      and can fit your collection in shunting, yard-to-yard, mixed freight and slow
      suburban traffic, I can recommend to get it, but with some limitations I described
      above

      P.S. Tried this locomotive in free roaming mode, however the experience is quite
      big to figure out the possibilities of the locomotive.'
