    review: 'Moon Bus has a certain elegant simplicity to it. From the intuitive UI
      to the easy-to-pick-up gameplay, this is the kind of game you can just turn
      on while your friends are sitting around your living room trying to make conversation.
      "What''s this" they''ll say as you boot the game. "Why, it''s Moon Bus" you''ll
      reply with a wry smile. And that''s all the explanation you''ll need.


      Despite the game''s simple design and structure, it''s surprisingly challenging
      to play with ease, and once you throw three other players in there, chaos ensues.
      Wonderful, joyus chaos.


      Buy this game. It''s a labour of love, and will keep you coming back. Well worth
      the value.'
