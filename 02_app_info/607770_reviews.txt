It's weird enough to be interesting and there were enough things for me to poke at and figure out that I played it more than once. There are no enemies or time limits, so there is a non-competitive exploration vibe.\n\nAs of the posting of this review I have just over 1 hour of gameplay logged. For five bucks, there are much worse VR games out there. I'm glad to have been able to support the devs before they released their game for free (as they said they eventually plan to) and hope they keep creating.","timestamp_created":1494091117,"timestamp_updated":1494091117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55458909273147583","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nKax79sCd96+eA=="}
