    review: "If you experienced any form of '90s PC gaming, more than likely, you\
      \ know the name of [b]Carmageddon[/b]. In short, it was a brutal, controversial,\
      \ genre-defining car combat video game. It had the blood splatters, the dystopian\
      \ vehicles, the bleak locations, the offbeat humor, the industrial music, the\
      \ addicting gameplay, and more. [b]Stainless Games[/b] was the company behind\
      \ the madness.\n\nAfter [b]Carmageddon II[/b] in 1998, Stainless dropped off\
      \ the radar. They made sporadic one-off games, and a brief stint with [b]Magic\
      \ the Gathering[/b]. Eventually, they regained the Carmageddon brand. They first\
      \ released a well-received mobile port of the first game. They then released\
      \ [b]Carmageddon: Reincarnation[/b], the long-awaited sequel (aka revival) in\
      \ the series. It was followed shortly by [b]Carmageddon: Max Damage[/b], which\
      \ for the most part, was the same game but more polished and more content (and\
      \ owners of Reincarnation received Max Damage for free, a plus). Sadly, the\
      \ writing was on the wall for Stainless. Due to various reasons, they pawned\
      \ off the Carmageddon series to [b]THQ Nordic[/b], where its days are currently\
      \ spent in the ground. Stainless moved on, but, not completely.\n\n[b]ShockRods[/b]\
      \ is the studio's newest project. The best description of the game is a cross\
      \ between car combat and arena shooters. It is like as if someone got bored\
      \ of simply driving a car, and instead, wanted to control it like a first-person\
      \ shooter. That seems to be the entire premise of ShockRods, and although the\
      \ handprint of Stainless remains, that is both good and bad.\n\nSince Stainless\
      \ is known for their car combat, it comes as no surprise for them to revisit\
      \ the genre. The vehicles resemble off-road dune buggies, to an extent. They\
      \ are contraptions that is uncertain if it wants to be a vehicle or a mech;\
      \ however, this all makes sense, given the two genres that Stainless has presented.\
      \ They don't look completely basic, and the interesting crossbreed is something\
      \ new at least, but fans looking for the unique machines of Carmageddon will\
      \ be quite let down.\n\nThe other genre, first-person shooting, makes a twisted\
      \ appearance. Unlike most car combat games, the method of moving and aiming\
      \ is very similar to a shooter. Even though the camera is from behind the vehicle\
      \ per usual (but it can be adjusted to your liking), the controls for the four-wheeled\
      \ contraption is more similar to controlling a human, or a fast-paced mech.\
      \ The movement is quite fluid in its approach, and this is a refreshing change\
      \ for both genres; however, the downside is that if someone typically dislikes\
      \ one of the two genres, then they probably won't find this combo attractive.\
      \ ShockRods basically has to shoot for that gamer whom appreciates both sides\
      \ of the coin.\n\nThe actual weapons in the game are more closely related to\
      \ arena shooters than anything. There are revved-up miniguns, oversized shotguns,\
      \ high-caliber sniper rifles acting as a \u201Crail gun\u201D of sorts, launchers\
      \ that possibly resemble grenades, and more. The weapons are varied, and thankfully,\
      \ each one has a purpose. Some of the weapons will cater to a more cautious\
      \ player while others are perfect for the haphazard ones, and everything in\
      \ between. Sometimes, it's a bit challenging to keep an eye on the ammo count\
      \ as it isn't too prominent, but that seems to be the only major downside to\
      \ an otherwise stabilized weapon lineup. \n\nAlthough the actual players' cars\
      \ are detailed to the point as they were intended, the locations are even more-so\
      \ detailed. They are quite solid, and even though the landscapes are generic\
      \ such as a rustic factory setting or a bumpy desert setting, they fit like\
      \ a puzzle piece, and are great arenas for such battles. There are no options\
      \ to create or edit one's own map, and due to the small number of locations,\
      \ one might feel tired of the scenery after so long. In addition, due to the\
      \ game being built on the famed [b]Unreal Engine[/b], a lot of the atmospheric\
      \ vibes and presentation will be familiar to a player, for better or worse.\n\
      \nEven though the mixture is executed well enough, it is laid on a foundation\
      \ of potential. The key word is \u201Cpotential\u201D since, as of this writing,\
      \ it has been nearly a year since the game's final release. From the beginning,\
      \ ShockRods did not have a large fan base. Various theories circulate due to\
      \ that, such as the aftermath of the Carmageddon series, the previously-mentioned\
      \ \u201Cboth sides of the coin\u201D appeal, the lack of reach due to the company's\
      \ small indie size, and more. Despite the reasons, this is a crucial point,\
      \ since ShockRods was developed as an arena-based game, and other humans over\
      \ multiplayer is essential to experience the full impact of the game. Of course,\
      \ there are options to play bots offline, and the AI isn't half-bad; however,\
      \ it can get tiring after awhile. One small saving grace is that the community\
      \ has a dedicated Discord, and if someone was persistent enough, they could\
      \ easily find a match.\n\nTo summarize, ShockRods feels like a refreshing take\
      \ on two very specific genres. The gameplay elements are implemented on a solid\
      \ foundation; however, the foundation only allows the game to stay upright,\
      \ and does not extend beyond that. Overall support and buzz around the release\
      \ was low-key from the start, and the game's long-term impact suffered as a\
      \ result. Still, if someone wants a quick occasional session to experience a\
      \ different vision, ShockRods is worth digging up. \n\n[i]7.0/10[/i]\n\n[u]Top\
      \ 3 Pros:[/u]\n\n-The movement of the vehicles resembles a first-person shooter,\
      \ and creates a unique twist on the genres.\n\n-The weapons are varied, and\
      \ each one has a strong yet distinguished characteristic. \n\n-Although multiplayer\
      \ is the preferred option, the offline mode with bots is not a total snore.\n\
      \n[u]Top 3 Cons:[/u]\n\n-The locations can become stale over a long period of\
      \ time.\n\n-The meshing of the two genres will only cater towards specific fans.\n\
      \n-Overall activity for the online community is limited, and has been for an\
      \ extended period of time."
