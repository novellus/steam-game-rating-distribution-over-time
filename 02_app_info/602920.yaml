    review: "The concept is interesting. you \"draw\" springs to jump and fire balls\
      \ to destroy walls, all while your character auto runs. it also has a strange\
      \ learning based concept behind it. as you run there are pictures behind you\
      \ that depict various landmarks and has information about them. \n\nfor a dollar\
      \ its an ok platformer. ill give the thumbs up for the music.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaqf-qLi79I&feature=youtu.be"
