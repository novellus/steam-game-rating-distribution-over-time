After playing a couple of hours until the end, I have to say this is pretty awesome game with a great concept of gravity/time manipulation! If you like solving puzzles or mazes similar to Portal, this is the game for you. \n\nPros:\n> Great animation and effects with controls similar to most Valve games.\n> Challenging puzzles with satisfactory upgrades.\n> Added story line to make your purpose at the test site more interesting.\n\nCons:\n> Epilepsy warning! Your tool and certain obstacles will produce bright (and sometimes sudden) colors.\n> Free falling speed varies between normal running and sprinting, which could make maneuverability a bit tricky.\n> Setting very high graphics may result in variable (but minor) game lag.\n\nConsiderations:\n> Control adjustments should be in-game, not before the game starts.\n> Exploration is key even if certain areas may need more guidance.\n> In-game voice acting and audio are not the greatest, but doable for gameplay.","timestamp_created":1561088170,"timestamp_updated":1561088244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkoeHvOsCf+TwwwE="}
