      notes: "The player can drink rum and wine with pirates through dialogue at taverns\
        \ and churches. Drinking too much leads to the player \"blacking out\", fading\
        \ the screen to black. The player can smoke marijuana with specific characters\
        \ through dialogue.\r\n\r\nSail and Sacrifice takes place in a fictional world\
        \ with events relating to the inquisition and piracy that occurred in the\
        \ 18th century."

    review: "The developers have a long way to go on this one, but at least Sail and\
      \ Sacrifice seems to have a lot of potential. The graphics are decent and the\
      \ environment is immersive to the point of saturating glare, just like Caribbean\
      \ beaches. The character direction seems to be story driven, so there is no\
      \ character creation. The main character seems to be some sort of tribal dude\
      \ and the opening screen describes the basic plot with terrible voice narration\
      \ (serously guys, get a sound booth or just make it text).\n\nThe controls are\
      \ the standard WASD and the devs are working on the controls. At one point,\
      \  I hit a key that threw a grenade at my feet and I died. At another point,\
      \ I hit a bug and it froze my character's pose. Restarting the game fixed it.\n\
      \nSaving seems to be done automatically at checkpoints, like discovering settlements/towns/camps.\
      \ I haven't crashed to desktop yet, but I haven't played that long either. \n\
      \nI hope the developers add in icons for wind direction and speed because some\
      \ of these ships are practically flying by, only to suddenly stop, dead in the\
      \ water.\n\nThe game world is open for exploration and there doesn't appear\
      \ to be any linear restrictions on where the player can go. An intresting function\
      \ the player can do while jumping is holding Space to deploy this glider thing.\
      \ I thought it was cheesy at first, untill I realized I could jump off some\
      \ steep cliffs and parachute to safety. There are no survival functions, such\
      \ as eating or sleeping. NPCs do not have much life yet as all of them are standing\
      \ around waiting for the player to talk to them. \n\nI'm giving this a thumbs-up\
      \ for now because my initial impression is positive. I'll return to edit my\
      \ review later. If I have to change it to thumbs-down and loose my helpful votes,\
      \ then so be it. I just hope Sail and Sacrifice doesn't turn out like Blue Horizon.\n\
      \nUPDATE: 8/30/2020\nThe developer abandoned the game."
