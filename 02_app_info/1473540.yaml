      the deepest parts of The Cursed Mines to the Queen''s Castle in the Sky.<br><br>Gondola''s
      Adventure is a procedurally generated precision platformer featuring 5 different
      difficulties which allows for re-playability. <br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Casual
      - Suitable for players unfamiliar or new to the game genre. Unlimited number
      of lives where the player can respawn at checkpoints set throughout the game.
      Each jump is partially projected with a trajectory. The fastest way to complete
      the story mode. <br></li><li> Normal - Similar to the Casual difficulty, but
      without the jump trajectory, making it slightly more difficult.<br></li><li>
      Classic - The standard difficulty in the genre: no checkpoints or life/respawn
      system. One mistake can cost most of your progression.<br></li><li> Hard - Suitable
      for players seeking a challenge. Can you complete the story mode with only three
      lives?<br></li><li> Hardcore - A challenge for the best of the best. Attempt
      to complete the story mode without once falling to your surmise. </li></ul><br>The
      procedural generation allows for over 900 million different level variations.
      As such, if one desires to master the game, it is not enough to simply memorize
      the jumps in one level, but rather to learn the underlying mechanic. Whether
      to play the same generated level each new game or to generate one at random
      is up to you.<br><br>For competitive players and speedrunners, each difficulty
      features its own leaderboard ranked on the fastest completions. Compare your
      performance against friends or strangers around the world. Each difficulty are
      also split into fixed-seed and random-seed categories.'
