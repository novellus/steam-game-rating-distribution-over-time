    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality[/h1]\n\n\
      You can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/MFRtiOGC0AY\n\nIs this\
      \ a good game? Not really. Am I still recommending it? Yeah. Why? Well, it's\
      \ actually a good workout in VR. It's not perfect, but it is one of the better\
      \ workout regimens in VR if you're actually interested in getting fit. You may\
      \ want to mute the game and listen to your own music though (the in-game music\
      \ track repeats itself).\n\nIn this game, you will need to actually jog (you\
      \ can do a light jog or you can run as fast as possible), jump, throw, and dodge\
      \ side to side. You will get a good sweat going after 10-30 minutes of doing\
      \ this depending on your fitness level. You basically dodge the parked cars,\
      \ jump over the hurdles, and throw the football to either change the light to\
      \ green at intersections or to get rid of cops blocking your path (you can dodge\
      \ instead of throwing though). I do wish the parked cars were actually moving\
      \ cars so that the dodging left to right were more interesting. \n\nHowever,\
      \ as is, there isn't much variety. You'll be seeing the same scene throughout\
      \ the game. It really doesn't get more difficult as you go along. Although,\
      \ because you do get tired, stuff like crossing the street or jumping the hurdles\
      \ or even throwing the football does get more difficult as you lose concentration.\
      \ In my opinion, the game is more fun if you try to cross the intersections\
      \ without throwing the football at the light (so that you have to be careful\
      \ crossing the intersections so you don't get run over by a vehicle).\n\nSo\
      \ this game isn't for everyone. If you're working for a good workout in VR though,\
      \ this is among the better ones. It has enough variety for those serious about\
      \ their VR fitness regimen. Keep in mind, it is possible to cheat yourself as\
      \ this game can be played as an arm-swinger (no need to jog) if you hold down\
      \ the grip buttons. Don't hold down the grip buttons!\n\n[b]Sale Price Rating\
      \ 6/10. It's only $5 normal price, I got this for $3 USD on sale. I feel I got\
      \ my money's worth.\n\n[i]p.s. This game does not have left-handed support.\
      \ You can just switch your motion controllers though[/i]"
