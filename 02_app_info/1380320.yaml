    about_the_game: Welcome to City 13! The best city of the rest ones! The last of
      the rest ...<br><br><strong>Plot:</strong> It is not known exactly when the
      earth was covered with a huge explosion, and no one will remember how 13 cities
      had formed on the ruins of the old pixel world, and how 12 of them fell again.
      There is only a reality in which City 13 is the home for all survivors. It doesn't
      matter if you are a human or a mutant, a sophisticated aristocrat or a ragged
      vagabond, good or bad, alive or dead... City 13 will be your home, whether you
      like it or not. <br><br><strong>City 13</strong> is a dynamic 2D platformer.
      Combining the good old mechanics of classic games straight from the nineties
      and the modern directions of the hardcore platformer genre, City 13 is the quintessence
      of the old and new generations and will suit any platformer lover. Hardcore
      gameplay, varied levels, unique enemies and traps, brutal bosses, all this is
      for you in City 13.<br><br><strong>Features  of the <u>current</u> version of
      the game:</strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"> <li> 12 main and 1 bonus level. Make
      your way through the streets of City 13 and visit an abandoned laboratory!<br></li><li>
      3 unique bosses, each with his own skills and combat tactics.<br></li><li> More
      than 10 types of countermeasures and traps.<br></li><li> Atmospheric and high
      quality soundtrack.<br></li><li> A full-fledged RPG system with character leveling.<br></li><li>
      High difficulty, the player is required to give all the best! </li></ul><br><strong>
