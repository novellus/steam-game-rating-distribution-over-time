    review: 'The first and most crucial point of [b]Couch Party Game Night[/b] is
      that it''s a game that is being independently developed on the side. The second
      and other crucial point is that it''s geared towards split-screen multiplayer,
      which sadly, almost seems like a distant past-time activity nowadays. If you
      were to approach this game with these two things in mind, then you''re more
      likely to get some enjoyment out of it.


      The game supports up to four players, all on one screen; thus, external controllers
      are almost a must, but workarounds can be made for mouse or keyboard players.
      An older controller such as a jury-rigged PS3 one worked, eventually. You choose
      the amount of players, the map, and a few adjustments of the in-game options.
      There''s a small amount of different weapons, ranging from a few replicas of
      real guns to laser tag pistols, and more. Each one basically has the same purpose,
      and besides its rate-of-fire and visual or audio representation, they will all
      do the same damage. There''s also an option to manually aim and zoom for each
      one, too. The screens, split into two or three or four ways, is cut up just
      right. It''s a bit discouraging that each player spawns in the same spot after
      death, though.


      In regards to the graphics, they have a certain consistency. Anyone expecting
      a mind-blowing AAA style should look elsewhere, as that''s not the type of game
      this is being worked into. The maps are slightly varied, each one being set
      in the outdoors, with a suburbia atmosphere on all of them. The placements of
      hills, abandoned buildings, lookout towers, and other objects mixes it up a
      bit. It''s also of note that the aftereffects of the weapons are nicely done.
      For example, seeing a stream of explosions coming towards you is a bit unsettling,
      and seeing the insides of buildings light up at night with gunfire at a distance
      looks great.


      For the most part, the sound effects are minimal. The best sounding weapon are
      the retro lasers, which gives off a satisfying explosion sound upon impact.
      There doesn''t seem to be any music, but it''s better to have nothing than something
      half-done. Since this game is a physical split-screen experience, music would
      just be drowned out in the background, anyway.


      As previously mentioned, split-screen gaming (especially four players) is at
      an all time low, since when it comes to split-screen shooters, maybe console
      games such as Playstation 2''s [b]Red Faction II[/b] or [b]Quake III Arena[/b]
      and Nintendo 64''s [b]Hexen[/b] or [b]Goldeneye 007[/b] would come to mind.
      Not only are games phasing it out in the modern era, they are phasing out local
      play completely. The fact that a newer game exists for the sole purpose of filling
      that void is a surprise to see. Despite the minimalism and random flaws, Couch
      Party Game Night is a solid split-screen experience, as it harks back to the
      older days with no regrets.
