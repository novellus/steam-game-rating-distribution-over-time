I can’t describe the monsters fully but imagine a nightmare stitched together with rope and twine and then add body parts dumped on top of it for good measure.

Reverie is a horror-themed game where you are put into the role of the victim being chased by unknown creatures while attempting to figure out why you are there in the first place. It was an interesting concept, the game had great depths to it for being in their early stages. Intense moments and that feeling of “constantly being watched”, makes for a fun and scary experience. Looking forward to the future development of this game.”<br>5 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pg\/deviouseye\/reviews\/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Ocasio Productions<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1286490\/header.jpg?t=1599204428","website":"https:\/\/deviouseye.com\/awoken","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br><\/li><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> AMD FX 8300 or Intel i5 4460<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 8 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Radeon RX 460 or GeForce GTX 1050<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 11<br><\/li><li><strong>Network:<\/strong> Broadband Internet connection<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 10 GB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> Your experience with Awoken will be best at higher FPS.
