    review: "Right now the game is on sale for only 0.99 euros, which is a steal if\
      \ you enjoy:  \n[list]\n[*]Side-scrolling combat\n[*]Dark Souls\n[*]Boss fights\
      \ (that's all the game is)\n[/list]  \nIf you don't mind the graphics you see\
      \ on the trailer and you can put up with the occasional junkyness that comes\
      \ with indie games, Boss Rush: Mythology is definitely worth a buy.  \nI've\
      \ only beaten the 1st boss so far but i will update this review once i finish\
      \ the game. For now i just wanted this to work more as a shoutout for what seems\
      \ to be a great deal.  \n  \n[b] UPDATE: [/b] At this point i've beaten 17 bosses\
      \ (there are 20 in total).  \nI've really enjoyed my time in the game so far.\
      \ Every boss feels unique, with interesting fight mechanics. And the amount\
      \ of bu****it attacks that feel cheap is kept at the absolute minimum.  \nThere\
      \ is one part of the game i really don't enjoy. To the point where it almost\
      \ left me with a  sour taste in the end, although my overall experience was\
      \ good.  \nAnd that's the progression system.  \nHaving unlocked only 1 new\
      \ weapon this far into the game just doesn't feel right.  \nAlso having to grind\
      \ challenges in order to unlock the few remaining bosses feels forced. Challenges\
      \ should be something you complete cause you enjoy the game so much that you\
      \ just want to spend more time in it. Not a mandatory thing in order to progress\
      \ the game.  \nThat being said, i think this game deserves your support and\
      \ that we're gonna see really cool stuff from this dev in the future.  \nRecommended\
      \ even at full price."
