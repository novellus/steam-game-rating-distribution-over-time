    review: 'Well, that was a fun game (just finished it).  The ending could''ve been
      a bit more speechy (melodramatic?), but getting there was not a grind.

      There is scope for a couple of replays, depending on your dogfighting preferences.

      There are some non-critical bugs to iron out, but nothing that destroyed game-play
      for me.

      The story was good, the concept of modular ship-components was also something
      I like, and the map is not so large as to get bored going from A to B. (Having
      said that, though, there is scope for making this a much larger game-world (compare
      to [i]Elite: Dangerous[/i], or [i]No Man''s Sky[/i]).

      A good game, in the end.'
