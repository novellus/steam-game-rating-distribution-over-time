    short_description: The aim of this game is to maneuver Taro Heibon and get close
      to the cos-play girls without being noticed. It's the right time to get close
      to them when they are facing away, so try to move closer before they face round.
      After passing all the stages, you can register the girls in your Gallery. Find
      the girls you like and make a move.

    review: 'This is a weird and silly game but it passes the time and is kind of
      fun. The only bummer is that I could only play it on my older Windows 7 computer
      because I could not get it to work for Windows 10. Simple and fun game though.
