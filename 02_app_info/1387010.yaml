    review: I've read a few of the comments describing this game as difficult and
      while yes my first play through I got slaughtered as I was learning controls,
      didn't build up nearly fast enough all while wasting my time exploring scenery.
      My 2nd play through was much easier as now I knew what I was doing, I knew that
      I had a timer and was going to get attacked in the first place...it's a fairly
      easy game. Kind of lack luster at the moment but could possibly end up being
      good depending on the devs. Right now at 10 bucks it's not a bad price but it
      took me 4 hours to get to a point that I had experienced everything and there
      was no further to go. My rule of thumb is usually a dollar per hour on a game
      makes it worth it, so as of right now I wouldn't reccomend buying it unless
      you're into the genre then it's not bad and will hopefully provide a bit more
      as the devs get to it.
