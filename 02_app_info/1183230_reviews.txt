You can also adjust the text size as many times as needs be until you are happy with it.  This was a good start.  From here on in, the story begins and it is quickly clear that you have a great deal of say in the personality of the lead character, and that the choices you make are going to significantly impact how the adventure develops.\n\nText blocks are never a full screen, so you are not faced with too much information all at once.  Many pages end with a choice to be made, which is usually from 3 or 4 possible options.  The base text is written in second character, as in “You returned to the deck”, while choices switch to first person mode, eg. “I knocked back the rum and called for more”.  I would have expected the differential between these styles to be distracting, and yet it works remarkably well, giving a feeling of having the activity relayed to you, and then being thrust into it personally to decide what must happen next.\n\nThere is a statistics page to view where you discover just how many personality traits your choices affect – will you be adored or feared by your crew?  Are you brutal and unforgiving or a soft-hearted scoundrel?  Brazen or shy?  A loner or party animal?  Romantically inclined?  And what about your protege?  How will you shape her future?  Even your name and appearance are optional, but accessed in such a way that they are chosen as part of the natural flow of developments.\n\nAnd those are just your characteristics.  Delving further into the delights in store, you will engage in high seas piracy, competition or co-operation with other pirates, potential mutiny, treasure, betrayal, love, governance.. and more.  There are 10 deeply involved and very well written chapters to work through before you reach the end of your tale; and with 44 achievements on offer, replay value is high.  I found it impossible to stick with my original intentions for my character, as the actions of others and consequences of my own constantly changed my perspective on what I wanted to do next.\n\nThere are three main love interest possibilities, at time of writing I have seen two and they are both adorable in their own [i]very different[/i] ways.  The narration is certainly romance heavy when you want it to be, although there is an absence of any spiciness in the “alone together” scenes.  It is not obligatory to pursue a love interest, you can also play the “not interested” card if you prefer to remain romantically unattached.\n\nThe game will require some dedication on your part to read it through, and will reward you accordingly.  My first play – which I messed up with a bad decision at the end and denied myself the true love ending I was hoping for – lasted for 14 hours and I loved every minute.\n\nThe game autosaves at each page, and can only be closed via the X in the top corner of the screen. When returning, it will reopen where you left off.  This is done in lieu of any kind of manual save, which means that any decision you make is final for that play through.  There is no making a decision, seeing how it pans out, and then reloading to try something else.  This should not be a problem [b]at all[/b] during your initial experience, but is quite likely to be a bit of a bane in subsequent reads or especially if you are simply going achievement hunting.\n\nI want to come back to an admission I made near the start of this review.  I almost did not buy the game when I discovered that it was text-only.  After all, if all one wants is to read a good story, then buy a book, right? Well, that would certainly sate the desire.  But would a book also offer you the chance to shape the protagonist in a myriad of different ways, and then allow you to go back and do it again, but differently?  Would the story change each time you read through – indeed, would you even bother reading a second time?  The interactivity in this offering is what makes a thoroughly enjoyable read shine.  So many fans of visual novels insist that it is the story itself which is the most important aspect, and yet as I construct this review, I note that there are only 3 others already published for a game that has been released for 6 months.  Something does not add up, and it is not the quality provided.  If you truly believe that the story is the most important thing, and you are not averse to 17th century pirate adventures, then I strongly suggest that you put your money where your convictions lie, and show this game some love.\n\n[quote] Please follow our curator page, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4680120/]Otome Lovers[/url], if you'd like to see more reviews like this one!
