I thought it was so cute and charming with the whole Halloween theme and loved being back in the town of Saxton with the same characters of The Lost Crown. I did enjoy some of it and some parts were funny but I felt like it was getting repetitive about half way to the ending and the story is too short. It seems like it just needs some fixing in technical issues and possibly has a bug as I got stuck in a video recorder camera scene that I couldn't move on from where the back out arrow didn't show up at all, so I ended up pressing ctrl alt delete a couple times over. There are 2 screen resolution options on a mini menu before the actual game menu starts up, both options are just bad, one cutting off the bottom portion of the screen and the other making the game appear in a small box so I had to play around and tweak some settings to match up with my pc screen. I noticed that the Steam overlay wasn't working with this game and I was playing a few hrs but it says 7 mins, I think this is a Steam issue though and not the devs. I couldn't even take screen shots and my other games work fine with the overlay. I'd recommend to anyone who is thinking about playing this game to play the The Lost Crown instead. I really wanted to love this one as much as the first game. I'll continue to play Jonathan Boakes games as I find them charming but sadly this game fell a bit short compared to The Lost Crown and so I can't really recommend this one the way it is.","timestamp_created":1602565260,"timestamp_updated":1602592344,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/ND8kPUCc6TJpwI="}
