You will need to find shelter, find some food and rest. Then it’s about making your way to an old ranger station to call for rescue. <br>Sounds easy enough, doesn’t it? It is, except for the supplies you are going to need for the trip, the weather, the freezing cold, not to mention the wildlife. The goal of the game is to survive.

You won’t be able to kill a bear with a knife, it’s not the movies.<br>What you can do is be clever about the wildlife and set traps. You might even be able to find some traps hunters left behind and use them to maintain a safe perimeter or to hunt smaller animals for food. Tracking, establishing the best spot and being patient is what the hunt will be about.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1394960\/extras\/THE_SURVIVAL.gif?t=1610102000\" \/><br>Cold, thirst, hunger and exhaustion are the four major factors you have to worry about.

Spending the night in the freezing cold without any shelter is akin to a death sentence and trying to go out in a snow storm isn’t any better either. Don’t forget, weather in the mountains changes quickly and is unpredictable.
