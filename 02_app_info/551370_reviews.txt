Saw some of the reviews saying things are hidden behind paywalls and it deterred me. But took the plunge this evening and well happy with it. All the tools are there that I could ever need for personal use, and literally all I do is design robots for my own pleasure lol.\n\nBought this with the knowledge that it's going free soon, don't want a refund. This is definitely worth the money! Makes designing things genuinely fun and encourages more creativity with it's fun tools!","timestamp_created":1609976745,"timestamp_updated":1609976745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4wvGF7fYCeJeSwQI="}
