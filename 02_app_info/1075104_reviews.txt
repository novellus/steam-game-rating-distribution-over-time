Usually you'd have to copy everything from the dlc folder in.\n\nNow I can't tell which files are missing. But it's missing 2 or 3 overlays correctly for one of the categories of items and only the very bottom sprite changes to show them. Also some of the hair styles doesn't match the sprite at all and makes it curly instead. It might be because of numbering but since the silly thing self installed I have no idea what one to fix. I've got 4 of these packs but this is the first self installing one and now I'm afraid to buy the first 2\n\nI don't even get an option to back up what I had!","timestamp_created":1585994580,"timestamp_updated":1585994930,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53947371244430542","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9cKqovECd4v8/QE="}
