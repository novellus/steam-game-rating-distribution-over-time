      /><br><br>In <strong>Rollercoaster Mechanic</strong>, you save destroyed and
      broken funfairs. A small company, two brothers Leo and Noah, each with different
      skills and a great challenge: starting up broken rollercoasters and other attractions.
      Diagnose damage, repair, clean, test. And finally, enjoy every repaired attraction.<br><br><img

      /><br><br>The biggest challenge is working at heights. Here, the cooperation
      of the brothers will be the basis of success. You will often have to scale the
      heights just to unscrew one tiny screw that can cause tragedy during the rollercoaster
      ride. Going between clouds, don''t forget to bring the right tools.<br><br><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1280660/extras/repair.gif?t=1607937469"
      /><br><br>Fortunately, you have a diagnostic console at your disposal, finding
      a fault without it would be close to a miracle. It''s your command centre, you''ll
      find out where the problem is, but you''ll also have to prove your smartness
      many times because not everything will be obvious. Then, the most important
      thing will be to repair and replace the damaged parts.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1280660/extras/CLEAN_COLLECT_RUBBISH.gif?t=1607937469"
      /><br><br>The fair was abandoned for a very long time, so you not only need
      to repair the damage, but also tidy it up, clean it, often give it a bit of
      new glow, and grease or start up many elements. It won''t be easy, you have
      to watch out for hobos, hordes of rats or other new inhabitants of the abandoned
      amusement park.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1280660/extras/two_brother.gif?t=1607937469"
      /><br><br>A small family business, two brothers, and a big challenge. Things
      can happen between brothers, but don''t worry, Leo and Noah understand each
      other perfectly and complement with their skills. Use the experience of both
      depending on your needs, many tasks will require their full cooperation.<br><br><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1280660/extras/upgrade_tools.gif?t=1607937469"
      /><br><br>The profession of a rollercoaster mechanic is not easy. You have to
      learn and grow all the time, use new tools, develop and improve them. Buy new
      tools to make your work more efficient. Implement new mechanics, work faster
      and better, but also have great fun.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1280660/extras/test_and_run_the_funfair.gif?t=1607937469"
      /><br><br>And finally, the best part of your work. Each attraction should be
      tested before handing it over to guests. Remember, this is very important. You
      must be perfect, because if you make a mistake... scary to even think about
      it. Everything will surely go well, enjoy the amazing fun!'
