    review: "[i] If it wasn't for some technical problems, this would be an awesome\
      \ visual experience. There are 2 major problems when it comes to interacting\
      \ with objects and kayaking controls - let's just say the game is not very responsive.\
      \ Essentially it's a walking simulator, there are a few different segments like\
      \ walking, riding a car, and kayaking - almost like an interactive cutscene.\
      \ The game can be completed around 1 hour, there were a few forks in the river\
      \ but I think they all lead to the same place. Kayaking is the biggest portion\
      \ of the game, and surprisingly you can leave your boat and swim around, but\
      \ I wish the developer would take advantage of that by adding some optional\
      \ exploration. The game has a lot of cool visual transitions, some of them I\
      \ have never seen done before, without going into spoilers, I'll just say that\
      \ it was very creative. Please don't take this negative review out of context,\
      \ I think there are many good ideas here, the artist just needs to find someone\
      \ to help him with programming. Serious talk here, if this game was very polished\
      \ and had more content, it would be one of my favorites, so much potential.\
      \ Oh and one more thing, this experience works best when there is music in the\
      \ background, but the game was lacking sound effects and music in some areas.\n\
      \nUpdate: The game has been somewhat improved, but it still has too many clunky\
      \ parts to recommend in good faith. But hey, thx to the dev for the fixes, and\
      \ if you want to support an interesting game with some issues, perhaps give\
      \ it a try if the price is right.\n\n [/i]"
