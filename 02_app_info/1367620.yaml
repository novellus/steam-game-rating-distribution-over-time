    short_description: Home invasion horror game. Manually set up security cameras
      to try to locate and eliminate the threat from your household. Deal with distractions
      from others, and work to stop the intruder before it is too late. Not too serious.
      More of a fun, gameplay oriented experience.

    review: "buying it while having a totally different expectation leads to this\
      \ review. You might enjoy it. \nI was hoping to receive a serious home invasion\
      \ horror game which is focused on self defense through various mechanics combining\
      \ elements of FNAF with Welcome To the Game intruder sequences for example.\
      \ I was really disappointed to find out that it is absolutely NOT like that.\
      \ \nIt\xB4s more of a meme/joke based environment, with no real explanation\
      \ of what is going on, which is not the worst but tbh. we have so many games\
      \ failing to create serious experiences and believable immersive environments\
      \ that this feels like an excuse. Note that this review is based on the first\
      \ impression, I do not know much but I can tell you why the game lost me in\
      \ the first 15minutes... It seems the game works against its own intentions:\
      \ The map is SO ridiculously large which draws the focus to running around in\
      \ search for the intruder and basically anything else more than anything else,\
      \ also making the camera system quite useless if you need minutes of getting\
      \ to a general area when you see something/body on the screen. I dont want to\
      \ play a labyrinth game with wonky mechanics if the game is advertised as \"\
      domestic defense\", I don\xB4t wanna play annoying-jumpscare-simulator from\
      \ a boy that wanders around replacing the lack of horror atmosphere (that is\
      \ is lost by how the game delivers the gameplay) with loud in-your-face-screams...\n\
      this isn\xB4t it, chief. at least not for me. I played so many games that played\
      \ exactely the same.."
