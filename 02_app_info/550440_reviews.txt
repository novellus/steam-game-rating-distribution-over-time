The game was developed and published by 10tons Ltd.\n\n\"The World Beneath\" is the second episode of \"Azkend.\"\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are two game modes to choose from: Challenge and Adventure. Both modes do have a timer.\n\nThis is a match 3 game, the objective is rather simple, you have to make matches of three or more of like tokens to clear them from the board. There are several different types of match 3 styles: \"Swap;\" \"Chain\" and \"Group.\" The \"Swap\" style is where you have to switch two tokens either vertically or horizontally. The \"Chain\" style is where you have to link all the like tokens together that go in any direction. Such as \"Up to Down;\" \"Left to Right\" and \"Diagonally.\" The \"Group\" style is where a bunch of similar tokens are cleared from the board in one move. The match 3 style that is used in this game is \"Chain.\"\n\nThere are sixteen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked. These are in-game achievements only.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThere are five different trading cards to collect. Only three of those trading cards are given out by the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading cards: Purchased from the Steam's Community Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and its Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1547057645,"timestamp_updated":1600538143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60568392276763916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kb3g0/QCfZv0twE="}
