It has procedural generation (No two runs the same) with hidden and very difficult areas throughout the game. Ability to shoot in any direction with crazy cool Halloween themed ammo (like eggs,candy corn, and the ability to make all  ammo explosive) that automatically changes to different ammo when current ammo is exhausted. You have gigantic bosses that drop gigantic loot. You have a 5 slot perk based armor that could give you good or bad effects. Controls work great on keyboard, which I play mainly.One of my favorite things beside all I have listed already is costumes.Yes....you get Halloween costumes that have active and passive abilities which make for some really fun runs. More are being added to the game frequently.I don't want to give to much information that may spoil others fun away so, I will just say again  the costumes really and I mean really change each run in a super fun way like no other rogue-lite/like has for me. All this plus an art style that has so many references and amusing through backs to the 80's that you have to take time to thoroughly look on each level  to catch every one of them to appreciate how cool it is.I keep seeing new things I missed run after run. Creekside Creep Invasion is a hidden gem so far that many more should discover.There is fun to be had for rogue-like veterans and anyone that enjoys a fun challenging game.To end it I'll say another one of the awesome perks of the game and one of the most important in my opinion is a really nice, informative and accessible developer. It has been a real treat to interact with and get to know him.","timestamp_created":1508345115,"timestamp_updated":1602059172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567233383655548096","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwit+KgfUCfqLTiAE="}
