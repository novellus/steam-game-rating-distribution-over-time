    review: "So I bought Alfs Escape because im a huge fan and it was like 2 am in\
      \ the morning and I finished it within 50 minutes on hard difficulty.\nI am\
      \ a huge Oddworld Fan and did enjoy the base Game very much, even if the mechanics\
      \ were a bit clunkier and broken than in the Original Game on the PS1. So this\
      \ DLC is very short but on some points a bit harder than the base game and uses\
      \ puzzles that are a bit off , they tried a few new things there. Keep in mind\
      \ that I run into multiple smaller bugs but nothing to big. If you like Oddworld\
      \ and want a little bonus content, then I see no reason why to not buy it. It\
      \ is very cheap.\n3 \u20AC = 1 Hour of Playtime"
