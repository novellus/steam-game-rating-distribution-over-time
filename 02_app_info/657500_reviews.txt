It is fun to play when I don't have human opponent to play the board game.  It takes the 'book keeping' out of the game and is very easy to play. The only drawback is that the AI does not appear to be too creative. It plays each game fairly much the same and requires me to play at the hardest level to make it as competitive as possible. One request; I would like all the scenarios of the board game included in the computer version, and include the French and Indian War Expansion. Overall if you like the board game, I believe you would like this game.","timestamp_created":1595622101,"timestamp_updated":1595622101,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gKKfwfMCe4+rlwI="}
