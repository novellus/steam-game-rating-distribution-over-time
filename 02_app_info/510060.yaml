    review: "This is one of the best high-energy / exercise games that exists for\
      \ VR right now. It seems basic at first, but it's just so incredibly satisfying\
      \ to punch these bombs! It's one of the few games that puts you in a sort of\
      \ \"flow state\" that feels incredible. The haptics are really well done, everything\
      \ looks nice, and there are some pretty fun customization options.\n\nI've only\
      \ put a ton of time into the \"classic\" game mode.  There are 2 others in development,\
      \ but one of them is in a pretty early state.  For classic mode, the scoring\
      \ system is a bit unforgiving, and that can make going for high scores somewhat\
      \ frustrating, but that seems like it could be fixed pretty easily.  \n\nThe\
      \ developer nailed a fun gameplay loop.  Even after 6 hours of play, I still\
      \ come back to try to beat my score.  I'd really recommend this game, even in\
      \ its current early access state."
