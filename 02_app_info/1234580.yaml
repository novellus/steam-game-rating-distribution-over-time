    review: "Overall I think the game has tons of potential, but I think that it still\
      \ needs some time to iron out some of the flaws it currently has.But as it is\
      \ early access I am hopeful the flaws will be fixed.\nOverall\n+interesting\
      \ challenging gameplay\n+roguelike elements that improve the game general post-apocalyptic/survival\
      \ feel\n+replayable \n+interesting use of match-3 mechanics\n+potential to be\
      \ a great game\n+innovative gameplay\n-not quite there\n-emergent narrative\
      \ is still lacking(but as I understood the developer is working on it)\n-bugs\
      \ kinda stop the game from reaching it's huge hit potential"
