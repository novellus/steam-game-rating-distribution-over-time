I really do.  And for a student project, it is excellent.  The team should be proud of their work.\n\nTL;DR: only focuses on addition skills, a bit boring for an adult, not entirely polished\n\nThe good:\n-It's great practice for addition.\n-The difficulty scales with spell power or quest.\n-There's plenty of rewards to keep someone playing.\n-It's linear, so it's difficult to get lost for too long.\n\nThe bad:\n- It is painfully obvious that English is not the native language of the developers.  \"In\" and \"on\" were misused a couple of times.  In/on/at can be tricky for ESL'ers (some languages combine these words).  This is a relatively easy, though tedious, fix.  I doubt it would hurt the developing language skills of children, but it may be a bit confusing.\n- I'm forced to play a male character.  I could input my name, but not choose my gender.  This may have been something that was planned but never implemented.  It may have been too much work to include.\n\nThe ugly:\n-I don't expect it to get as much play time as other games.  The linear story line doesn't seem to branch, so it would be the same story every single time.  I don't think choices really matter much.\n-I find it boring.  Neat, but boring.  I'm not sure I'd be really engaged in the game if a child was playing it nearby.\n\nIf I get the opportunity I'll try to a kid to play with me.  That way I could get more accurate feedback -- it *was* designed for kids afterall.  But as it is, I wouldn't recommend it to parents for kids.","timestamp_created":1487221743,"timestamp_updated":1487465527,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513053297996520996","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47db2qdoCft6icg=="}
