No...its not EA sports, which is the biggest complaint i hear.  if your looking for NCAA Football 20 then you will be disappointed.\n\nFor a small company to make a game with this level of customization is impressive.  The gameplay and animations can get a little wonky at times, but it's not game breaking by any means. its a little rough around the edges and slower than i was used to in the EA sports games, but it is still a lot of fun.\n\nIf you are a college football fan who is willing to have some patience with the gameplay, this game is for you. decent graphics and in depth recruiting/dynasty make it a blast to play.","timestamp_created":1609632497,"timestamp_updated":1609632497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41tfk4vYCeLPzvwI="}
