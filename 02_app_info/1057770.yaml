    review: "Story of One Night is a game that bills itself as a completed horror\
      \ release. There is no story, and there's not much to say since the campaign\
      \ can be completed in 10-20 minutes, so let's just jump into why you shouldn't\
      \ waste your money here, even if the game is on sale. For those looking for\
      \ a scary experience, the only \"horror\" element to the game is some reaper\
      \ guy that can one-hit kill you when he shows up, but the majority of your gameplay\
      \ will be spent slightly moving shields back and forth to project beams of light\
      \ to open up the door to the next level. \n\nWhat you're really getting here\
      \ for $8 CAD is something that feels like a bunch of scrapped ideas and levels\
      \ from  the alpha version of an abstract/surreal puzzle-platformer, think along\
      \ the lines of Kairo, that were not good enough to make it into the final product.\
      \ Furthermore, there are more missing sound effects than ones that are actually\
      \ included, and overall you'll be unable to shake the feeling that you're just\
      \ playing a freshman's C- mid-year project. It's certainly not worth the base\
      \ price, and the $1.99 CAD I paid for it on sale isn't even justifiable. At\
      \ worst, it should be a buck. At best, it should be free. In an ideal world,\
      \ the developer would care enough to even add some sound effects, if they're\
      \ asking such a large price for such a short title.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]1.0/5.0[/b]\
