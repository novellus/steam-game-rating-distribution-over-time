      /><h2 class="bb_tag">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2><h2 class="bb_tag">Q: <i>What
      in God''s name is happening on screen?</i></h2>A: Two mini-angels live inside
      the the head of a big angel, and they''re both trying to kill one another --
      and they both have 7 points.<h2 class="bb_tag">Q: <i>Why 7 points?</i></h2>A:
      It''s actually very simple: numerologically, the number 7 symbolizes humanity''s
      deep inner need to find meaning and spiritual connection; Uranus is the 7th
      planet counting from the Sun; therefore: the game''s soundtrack procedurally
      remixes 21 (7 x 3) music samples based on player input and score (7 points).<h2
      class="bb_tag">Q: <i>What?</i></h2>A: Yes.<h2 class="bb_tag">Q: <i>Is there
      actually Doraemon porn in this game?</i></h2>A: No. The game features no Doraemon-related
      pornographic material, or pornographic material of any kind.<h2 class="bb_tag">Q:
      <i>Who is Jason Bourne?</i></h2>A: &quot;Jason Bourne&quot; is the alias of
      David Webb, a fictional US Marine and CIA officer created by novelist Robert
      Ludlum.<h2 class="bb_tag">Q: <i>Why is Jason Bourne always on the run?</i></h2>A:
      Because he lost his memory, he can''t remember who he is, and there''s some
      shady people trying to catch him or something.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1410200/extras/g2_cropped.gif?t=1608549725"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Q: <i>But why, though? You didn''t really answer my question.</i></h2>A:
      Bourne''s wife and two sons were killed during the Vietnam War when a fighter
      plane dropped two bombs in Cambodia. However, due to Cambodia''s neutrality
      in the war, every nation disclaimed the plane, and, therefore, no one took responsibility
      for the incident. <br><br><br>Infuriated by both the utter injustice and randomness
      of his loss, Bourne went to Saigon and ended up training for an elite Top Secret
      Special Forces unit called &quot;Delta One&quot;.<br><br>Years later, Bourne
      was tasked to murder Nykwana Wombosi, an exiled African warlord. He infiltrated
      Wombosi''s yacht, intending to arrange the murder to look like he was killed
      by a crew member to avoid suspicion. However, Wombosi was surrounded by his
      children, and Bourne was unable to bring himself to kill him. He tried to abandon
      the mission by leaving the boat, but an unknown shooter shot him twice in the
      back, sending him off the yacht into the sea and triggering amnesia, causing
      him to forget his identity.<h2 class="bb_tag">Q: <i>If he lost his memory, then
      why does he know Kung Fu?</i></h2>A: He doesn''t.<h2 class="bb_tag">Q: <i>What
      about that time he jumped through a window from a rooftop and killed a bunch
      of people by air-kicking them in the neck?</i></h2>A: That''s not Kung Fu.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Q: <i>Ok. But still: if he can''t remember his name, how can
      he remember all his Kung Fu moves?</i></h2>A: People who suffer from retrograde
      amnesia still retain their muscle memory -- meaning that he still remembers
      all his years of training in martial arts, even if he can''t remember who he
      is.<h2 class="bb_tag">Q: <i>And why is he robbing a Casino with George Clooney
      and a bunch of other people?</i></h2>A: That''s Matt Damon, not Jason Bourne.
      Matt Damon is an actor who plays Jason Bourne in the Jason Bourne movies.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Q:<i> But why do they need him if:<br>- A) he barely does any
      Kung Fu in that movie, and<br>- B) they already have Jet Li on the team?<br>Jet
      Li''s Kung Fu is way better than Jason Bourne''s.</i></h2>A: That''s not Jet
      Li, that''s Shaobo Qin.<h2 class="bb_tag">Q: <i>Pretty sure that''s Jet Li.</i></h2>A:
      That''s not even a question.'
