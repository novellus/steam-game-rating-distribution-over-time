    about_the_game: 'In Morphblade you move around a grid slicing, smashing and bursting
      waves of nasty red bugs. Each tile you move to transforms you into a different
      weapon: on a Blades hex you can slice enemies on either side of you, on an Arrow
      you can launch yourself through two enemies in a row. Between waves, you choose
      how to build out the grid, and upgrade your most used hexes with new abilities.<br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Hammer: lets you stay put and smash a single enemy in front
      of you<br></li><li>Blades: kill enemies on either side as you move<br></li><li>Arrow:
      plunge right through an enemy and come out the other side<br></li><li>Repair:
      repairs any damage you''ve taken when you move here<br></li><li>Teleport: move
      to anywhere else on the grid<br></li><li>Acid: strips tough enemies of their
      armour, leaving them vulnerable</li></ul><br>Killing bugs earns you upgrades
      for your hexes, and each hex type can be cross-bred with every other type to
      take on some of its properties. Upgrade an Arrow with Acid and it can kill armoured
      enemies. Upgrade a Hammer with Blades and you can kill three enemies at once
      without moving. Upgrade a Teleporter with a Repair and you''ll be healed each
      time you teleport.<br><br>Upgrades can even be stacked, so you can end up with
      an Arrow that propels you with infinite range, kills everything in your path,
      penetrates armour, knocks back everyone near your destination, heals you, and
      doubles as a teleporter.<br><br>The idea for tiles determining your weapon came
      from the iOS game Imbroglio by Michael Brough, which is great, and Morphblade
      is developed and released with his permission.'

    review: This game reminds me a lot of HyperRogue, and it feels equally pointless,
      except that HyperRogue at least had achievements to give the player something
      to shoot for. I got bored with beating my own score in video games over twenty
      years ago, and Morphblade doesn't really offer anything more than that. If the
      developer could find a way to build a story around this game like he did with
      Gunpoint (a great game that I played through twice), then maybe it would have
      a better chance of holding my interest.
