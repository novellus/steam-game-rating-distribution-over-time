    review: It's a very impressive piece of work and great fun to fly over. However,
      the buildings all have pretty much the same colour, so it often feels like there
      is a graphics glitch, as your eyes are searching for more colour. I hope they
      can improve this at some point, as it would literally be incredible if the colours
      were better.
