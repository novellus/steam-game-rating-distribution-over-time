I use attempt purposefully, as because of the lack of enviornment or detailing it is hard to use the world style when talking about this game. The 3 towers that you pass are bland, and reppetitive within seconds. The cars aren't detailed, and are boring to look at. To be honest, even the VRC effects are bothersome to me. I'd say remove it, but its cool and could have a use. Maybe when being hit or something, but as is, its severely tiresome. \nAs for the menu, it actually looks cool. I'd say put more colors into it. Maybe a glowing gradient around the text or something.\nAlso, you should be able to control the menu with your mouse.\n\nGameplay\nMost infinite runners are repetitive. This is to be expected. What normally helps them is a \"twist\" in gameplay that makes them interesting. Something that changes the normal dodging mechanics. One More Line has its movements. Temple run has turning and jumping. Flippy Knife has physics. This game does not. Besides dodging cars, there is no variation in gameplay (except one thing that I'll get to). Maybe have a shield burst, or powerups, or increased speed.\n\nI feel the controls are rubbish. They feel sluggish, and unresponsive. Maybe limiting the movement to maybe 9 snapping points would help make it feel as bad as it does. Hitboxes are very fidgety as well, and a lot of the times it would be a coin toss whether or not I'd hit them or they'd hit me. Also pressing is that at least 3 times in my short time playing I was given a situation that I could not win.\n\nBecause of the issues above, along with the (slightly) high price point, I wouldn't recomend this game at the moment.","timestamp_created":1522477646,"timestamp_updated":1522477785,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1522505921,"developer_response":"Hi,\n\nThanks for the review. A lot of these things are things that I will be tweaking over the next week in order to make the game more fun. I employ you to try again next time an update is pushed and reconsider your thoughts on the game.\n\nThanks,\nFogbound Dev Team"}],"cursor":"AoJ4+uuvveICf6iHnQE="}
