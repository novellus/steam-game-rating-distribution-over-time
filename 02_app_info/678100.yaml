      \ seen a crane operator and thought that you would have done the same, seeing\
      \ the world from bird\u2019s eye view and touching the clouds? Now you\u2019\
      ve got such an opportunity!<br><br>Play as a real crane operator and put the\
      \ container in the appropriate place. In each round you will have to put one\
      \ container in the indicated place. You don\u2019t have much time! The higher\
      \ level you achieve, the faster time goes and the less time you have to move\
      \ the containers.<br><br>To make a bigger impression on you, we\u2019ve decided\
      \ to move our game to virtual reality. You will have an opportunity not only\
      \ to experience what the crane operator normally does but also to look at the\
      \ world from the perspective of 72-metres machine. If you have a fear of heights,\
      \ be careful - you can feel a little bit dizzy.<br><br>Use Vive controllers\
      \ to control a crane and an elevator that will take you to the top of the vehicle.\
      \ Be precise and try to not fall - in virtual reality losing can be very painful!<h2\
