Plenty of weapons, enemy ships, asteroids (yes!) and lots and lots of deaths. It is the perfect arcade style game that you just want to try playing one more time to see if you can get a better score than the last time. It is not easy though, ships unlock every 20 levels with better stats to help you survive and if you want to get to the end of the game at level 200 you will need every bit of help you can get. As it is I have gotten past level 20 exactly once, I usually tap out in the mid-teens but that doesn't mean I would be back to try again.","timestamp_created":1587327428,"timestamp_updated":1587327428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48743736743927002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2syFyvECe8yGggI="}
