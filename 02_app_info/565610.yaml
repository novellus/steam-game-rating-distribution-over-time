    about_the_game: Whether you're an old fan or just purchasing Grim Dawn, this fun
      collection of historically themed and novelty vanity items allows you to outfit
      your character with a little extra flourish. The gear included does not provide
      any gameplay stats or bonuses of its own, other than killer style, and can be
      applied to other pieces of gear to change their appearance. Ever wish your badass
      legendary helm looked like George Washington's hair? Now it can!<br><br>This
      Loyalist upgrade has been made available for the many people who bought on Steam
      originally then found out about the website Loyalist edition and asked for a
      way to upgrade and receive the virtual items included with it. Loyalist was
      originally created and priced for people who wanted to help support development
      and so, the price here is a bit of a premium for what you're getting.<br><br><strong>Note
      that this is virtual goods DLC costs over $50 less than the website full Loyalist,
      as it does not include the game, future expansion, soundtrack or other materials.</strong><br><br><strong>Also
      note that for owners of the Ashes of Malmouth DLC, the items are added to your
      Illusionist collection rather than being applied directly to items.</strong><br><br><u>Loyalist
      items can be claimed in-game from the NPC &quot;Kory the Keeper&quot; who stands
      outside the gates of Devil's Crossing.</u><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Massively
