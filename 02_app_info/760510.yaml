    review: "Cat Burglar: A Tail of Purrsuit is a good and an adorable  adventure,\
      \ 3D Platformer game, so the story. Kat the world's best cat burglar has entered\
      \ the highly secure doggo base, her mission to steal all their gems.\n\nNow\
      \ the likes. Well the game is very cute from the characters and to the little\
      \ bit of story we have in the game. The game's Graphics are pretty good and\
      \ captures the feel of an old school platformer. \n\nThe music very good especially\
      \ the music for the last level it has a nice spy feel to it. It was great that\
      \ after completing the main game you can play two more games one being collecting\
      \ Jewels under a certain amount of time, the other game collecting the Four\
      \ Keys with a whole bunch of dogs in the area.\n\nIt was also very awesome that\
      \ after you beat a level in the main game you are shown different advertisements\
      \ too animal charities/shelters, that was again very awesome.\n\nNow the dislikes.\
      \ There is a bug in the game where I got stuck between something and I couldn't\
      \ move no matter what I did and had to restart the level. \n\nAll right that\
      \ said Cat Burglar: A Tail of Purrsuit is a good and an adorable, Adventure\
      \ , 3D Platformer game. With very good music, pretty good Graphics and cute\
      \ characters and story.\n\nSo if you're looking for a casual game this could\
      \ be for you it's free, but I suggest that if you have $3 donate to games for\
      \ goods if you want to lend a hand."
