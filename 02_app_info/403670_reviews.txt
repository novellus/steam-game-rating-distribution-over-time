Not for me at all. \n\nThe atmosphere was solidly spooky, so I'm really disappointed that there didn't seem to be much more to this game. I also didn't find anything 'psychedelic' about this game. Maybe the Dev meant 'psychological' horror? Didn't find much of that either.\n\nThere is an ax man who wanders around and you're supposed to figure out what to do while he's pursuing you since the game 'does not hold your hand'. Well great, but if all this is going to be is some sort of convoluted scavenger hunt/guessing game-- could we at least have a gamma slider so we can actually SEE where to look? Jesus. \n\nNot knowing where to go or what to do or why is not fun for this pastel pixie.
