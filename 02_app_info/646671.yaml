    review: These are both well designed tables on both visual and audio. They both
      have a "pick up & play" quality that lets  you understand most of what's going
      on just by playing before having to study the guide in depth. That said, something
      just doesn't "click" for me on them and I haven't found myself spending much
      time playing them. I'd give it a "neutral" if Steam allowed it, but I won't
      penalize the game for that with a negative review, but you should probably play
      the times demos of these a bit before you make your decision. If they're on
      sale though it's probably a good purchase
