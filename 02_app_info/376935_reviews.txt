Me, a huge Outeniqua Choo-Tjoe fan, was quite surprised for the quality of the route and the rolling stock. \n\nUnfortunately there are some down sides to this add-on. The sounds of the steam locomotive is really basic. Based on what I've heard in real life the whistle does not sound like that. Another thing to add is the driving cab. The cab is absolutely horrendous. It's not realistic at all, it looks like something out of 2006 or 2007. If the ride were to be more pleasant and fun at least make a more realistic looking cab interior. \n\nOverall it's a great addon. Some features of the locomotive has to be updated.\nIf your into the route is suggest buying it.\nIf your into the train model. cab etc. etc. I don't suggest buying it.\n\nThanks.\n~ChoeTjoeVantage","timestamp_created":1605808326,"timestamp_updated":1605808326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw19Do8PUCcveqrwI="}
