The story is...interesting, and the gameplay, while repetitive at times, can provide its own challenges. \n\nI think the efforts to make it a retro-style experience made it less polished; the crafting/fast-travel/questing systems seemed a little clunky on account of the programming. This was a pain in the heiney considering the grinding associated with the crafting system (constantly remaking and salvaging materials just to get that +1) and the overall shortness of the game. \n\nOverall, a fun experience. I just feel bad that it could've been so much better just by making a few different systems in-game more efficient. If the developer made another game, I'd take a look.","timestamp_created":1499678528,"timestamp_updated":1499678528,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoMrzld0CeLfBfw=="}
