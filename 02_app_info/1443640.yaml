    about_the_game: "8-bit hero Horace is often considered the unofficial mascot of\
      \ the ZX Spectrum. His first game saw him go hungry, in his third he battled\
      \ spiders\u2026 but 1982\u2019s Horace Goes Skiing \u2013 remastered for your\
      \ gaming pleasure \u2013 saw the instantly recognisable character don his skis\
      \ and hit the slopes.<br><br>Your first task is to cross a busy road that lies\
      \ between you and the ski shop \u2013 not such an easy task considering the\
      \ volume of traffic you\u2019ll encounter. Dangerously large trucks, crazy speeding\
      \ ambulances and short-sighted drivers all add to the fun. Having made it across\
      \ alive, you can pick up your skis\u2026 and now you\u2019re going to have to\
      \ cross back over. Which idiot built the shop there in the first place?<br><br>The\
      \ second stage sees Horace pelting his way through a flagged course; stay within\
      \ the race zone and you\u2019ll score plenty of points, but watch out for bumps\
      \ in the course that\u2019ll send you zinging off in the wrong direction.<br><br>Finish\
      \ the race and you get the best news of all: you get to do it all over again.\
      \ But watch out for Horace\u2019s nemesis \u2013 you never quite know when he\u2019\
      s going to appear!<br><br>Despite its apparent simplicity, Horace Goes Skiing\
      \ cemented its place in gaming history with its mix of simplicity, arcade-action\
      \ gameplay and a unique graphical style that many retro fans still hold a candle\
      \ for to this day.<br><br>This lovingly remastered version is faithful to the\
      \ original, offering retro fans and casual gamers alike a chance to experience\
      \ the same thrill as the first generation of players had back in the day. Players\
      \ can choose to control Horace either using the on-screen touch zones or by\
      \ using a compatible Bluetooth device.<br><br>* * *<br><br><i>According to the\
      \ original instructions:<br><br>Horace Goes Skiing is a sequel to the very successful\

      \ A complex, colourful and outstanding computer game.<br><br>Before Horace can\
      \ get to the ski-slopes he must fetch his skis from a hut on the other side\
      \ of the busy road. Horace will move in one of four directions: Up, Left, Down\
      \ and Right.<br><br>At the beginning of the game, Horace has $40 to spend. If\
      \ he is knocked down it will cost him $10 in ambulance fees. After Horace has\

      \ will fetch his skis. The charge for ski hire is $10. Horace should not enter\
      \ the ski hut unless he can afford the hire charge. If Horace has spent all\
      \ his money on ambulance fees, then he can accumulate points and money by crossing\
      \ the road repeatedly, as at every 1000-point boundary, Horace receives a $10\
      \ bonus. Horace should not linger on the road longer than necessary, since the\
      \ traffic becomes progressively more congested. After fetching his skis Horace\
      \ must return across the road to the ski slopes.<br><br>In the second part of\
      \ the game Horace must ski down the Hannekon run, avoiding the trees and slaloming\
      \ between the red and blue pairs of flags. If Horace fails to pass between the\
      \ flags a warning note is sounded and Horace will lose points. Horace can parallel\
      \ left or right using the chosen control method. Horace increases his points\
      \ by passing between the flags and he can also receive a 100-point bonus by\
      \ passing through the finish barrier. As in the highway section, there is a\
      \ $10 bonus at every 1000-point boundary. If Horace should hit a tree then he\
      \ can continue on the slope provided that his skis do not break. If his skis\
      \ do break then Horace must again cross the road for a new set of skis and then\
      \ return across the road to the ski slopes. If Horace successfully completes\
      \ the course with his skis intact then he must cross the road once with his\
      \ skis to the next slope.</i>"

    short_description: Hit the slopes in this sequel to Hungry Horace. First head
      across the busy road (dodging the heavy traffic) to get your skis, then head
      to the downhill ski course. Also included is an endless ski mode.
