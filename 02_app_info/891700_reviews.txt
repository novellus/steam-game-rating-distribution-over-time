I wrote a more detailed review earlier but forgot to post it. So I'm sorry this is short. It is perfect. I've played all the other puzzle games here so far and it is the perfect one in every single way. I'm really enjoying it more than them! I don't know why it says Challenging unless it is in the timed mode. In relaxed it is easy. My one complaint is that it is too short! I don't know why the other ones' are not done correctly as this one is. I would love a Part Two! Thank you so much for doing this game Right.","timestamp_created":1606030850,"timestamp_updated":1606030850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/b659/UCfYXqrwI="}
