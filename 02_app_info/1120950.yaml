    review: 'This is a fantastic high-speed auto-runner where you can only touch platforms
      of the same color, so you have to constantly switch colors to survive. I rarely
      100% speedy or twitchy games, and usually ignore speedrun mechanics, but I enjoyed
      this game enough to 100% it.


      The control scheme is minimal - you can only switch between two colors, jump,
      or hold jump to gain additional height -, yet it has a high skill ceiling and
      lots of room for expression. Firstly, you have a double jump which isn''t consumed
      by running or falling off platforms, so you have lots of control over your movement
      at any moment. Secondly, there''s a clever optional mechanic: if you time your
      color switching right before you land on a platform, you gain a temporary speed
      boost. This renders this only moderately challenging game as difficult as you
      want it to be.


      The 25 levels are varied and even transform while you complete objectives in
      them, so you simultaneously practice the level for the optional speedrunning,
      and also unlock more platforms and speed boosts to assist in that endeavour.
      If you don''t care about the objectives, I expect the game would feel rather
      short; but if you try to complete them all, and care about the par times, then
      this is quite a meaty game for the price.


      Finally, I personally really liked the game''s simple yet colorful presentation.


      Overall, I enjoyed this game a great deal. I highly recommend it if you like
      auto-runners or obstacle dodgers like Bit.Trip Runner, Super Hexagon, Velocibox,
      etc., or high-speed platformers like Super Meat Boy or Celeste.'
