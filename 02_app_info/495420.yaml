    about_the_game: "<i>State of Decay 2</i> is an open-world survival-fantasy game\
      \ set just after the zombie apocalypse. Your small community of survivors seeks\
      \ to rebuild a corner of civilization, and you get to make all the decisions\
      \ about how that happens.<br><br>You decide who to recruit to your team, where\
      \ to settle your community, how to fortify and upgrade your base, and when it\u2019\
      s time to move to greener pastures. You select which survivor to bring along\
      \ on a scavenging run for the food and ammo you need, and who you\u2019ll use\
      \ to fight off the zombies attacking your base. You choose how you\u2019ll deal\
      \ with other people who move into your town. Will you be friendly and welcoming...\

      notes: In State of Decay 2, the quiet stillness of the post-apocalyptic world
        is interrupted by gruesome horror and grisly violence. If you can't defend
        yourself with the guns, knives, and bats you find while scavenging, you might
        see your character literally ripped apart by monstrous zombies... or murdered
        by aggressive NPCs looking to claim your territory!
