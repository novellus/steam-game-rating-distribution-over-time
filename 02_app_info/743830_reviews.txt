I'm rarely compelled to leave a review but the interface of this game is terrible.  \"Partial Controller Support\" means you can't do anything out side of the actual race with your controller.  I also have a terrible time with it letting me select the upgrade cards and drag them into the upgrade slots.  One card will select and drag with zero problems... try to select a 2nd different card and it will not work until you've tried it like a dozen times.","timestamp_created":1587512058,"timestamp_updated":1587512058,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533931732177734375","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwifTFz/ECf5bKggI="}
