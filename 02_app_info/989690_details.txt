Play solo or team up in multiplayer in Conan Unconquered’s action-packed co-op Mode where you build a shared stronghold and fend off the hordes together. <\/strong><br><br>The people of Khoraja flourished during its years of peace and prosperity. But they also turned lazy and feeble. The devious and tyrannical wizard Thugra Khotan looks to seize this opportunity and is marching his army to claim your kingdom as his own.

Both players can build structures freely, and research upgrades, walls, and structures are all shared. You can also try the game in challenge mode, where you can play the same maps as other players and see how well you compare to them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STAND AGAINST THE HORDE <\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/989690\/extras\/3_(combat).gif?t=1592475976\" \/><br>Battle wave after wave of increasingly more difficult enemies coming to destroy your stronghold, from lowly footmen to experienced elites and mighty siege weapons. Giant snakes and scorpions, spearmen, necromancers, and flying demons will arrive in vast numbers to see your home burn to the ground.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CONTROL LEGENDARY HEROES <\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/989690\/extras\/4-(building).gif?t=1592475976\" \/><br>Heroes are incredibly powerful units that can greatly influence the outcome of battles.

Construct a variety of different buildings from housing to temples and military barracks. Build defensive walls around your stronghold and equip them with traps such as oil cauldrons to keep attackers at bay. Train units and keep them fed and paid to see their power grow.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SURVIVE DISEASE, FIRE, AND DEATH <\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/989690\/extras\/8-(more-hordes).gif?t=1592475976\" \/><br>The world of Conan the Barbarian is one of blood, battle, and savagery. As your soldiers and those of your enemy die on the battlefield, their bodies will be left to rot and spread disease that can quickly turn the tide of war. Of course, a necromancer might be able to turn that to their advantage.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORE THE ENVIRONMENT <\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/989690\/extras\/5-(explore).gif?t=1592475976\" \/><br>Randomly generated maps allow for infinite replayability and each map holds vast opportunities for players that dare to explore beyond their stronghold.
