[b][i]Greenspawn Restaurant[/i] has heart, but unfortunately not all small projects are worth money or time.[/b] Finishing any video game project is a major accomplishment, so my hat's off to the dev - a sincere congratulations. The artwork and ambient sounds are nice, but the gameplay is flat and the whole thing has too many rough edges. \n\n[i]Essentially, vegan customers come up and place an order consisting of various veggies.[/i] You toggle between two screens; one where you serve the customer, and another that is a shooting gallery of sorts where you 'kill' more veggies to keep your stock full. Ultimately this is a score chaser.\n\n[i]Here is just a few notes for the developer:[/i]\n[list]\n[*]In the shooting gallery, I think it would be much better to simply hold the mouse button down instead of spam clicking to kill the veggies. It grows tiresome and tedious.\n[*]The yellow lemon text is near impossible for me to read.\n[*]Why use two buttons ('a' and 'd') to swap screens? Wouldn't it be more efficient to just use one button, because there are only two screens? Perhaps 'tab' or middle mouse button therefore eliminating any need for the keyboard.\n[*]If you lose before one day is finished, the score is absent when it should probably read '0'/zero.\n[*]Another way to play may be to simply bind everything to the keyboard. This would probably be much better and allow faster and less tedious gameplay. Food for thought.[/list]\n\n[b]Best of luck with any future projects.[/b] I'd surely be interested in what you create next.","timestamp_created":1542903088,"timestamp_updated":1542903121,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.709627628326416016","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xqiMnucCeIjvsAE="}
