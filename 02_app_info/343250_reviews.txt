Given the low asking price, I suppose I'll have to give it a thumbs-up. For collectors and completionists, or people looking for a mindless game to play while listening to podcasts, Gene will be an interesting enough distraction for the four or so hours it takes to beat - or even less if you aren't trying to fully complete every level.\n\nGene is, from start to finish, an incredibly simple side-scrolling platformer. You play the titular Gene, a little blue alien with big eyes facing a bit of bad luck. After your space ship starts smoking for entirely unknown reasons, it crashes hard enough to break apart into twenty different pieces. Those parts, as well as a bunch of gems that one of the game's generic enemies steals for equally mysterious reasons, are spread across fifteen levels.\n\nThe main gimmick of Gene is mutation. You start off as a blue version of the character, whose abilities include being able to travel through teleportation spheres and moving faster when there are boost arrows in the background. From there, you'll find five other colors of Gene to become, each with their own uses, who you'll be constantly changing between throughout each level. These range from the somewhat believable grey Gene that can jump much higher to the red Gene that can.. place and detonate bundles of dynamite by remote. Three of the mutations center around placing explosive devices, and two of those are primarily ways to access parts of the levels that are otherwise blocked off. At times it can feel a bit too obvious that some of the choices were made simply as a way to pad out the play time.\n\nThe enemies in the game come in a few different flavors but they're really just a different paint job on the same exact obstacle. They move back and forth on whichever platform they're standing on, and cause damage on contact. The game does give you a mutation right from the start that lets you place land mines in their path, and a single one is enough to kill anything outside of the single boss encounter toward the end. It was nice to see all six of Gene's collected mutations being used as part of that final fight, though some of the ways you're forced to attack go against the ways you've learned to keep yourself safe until then.\n\nThe platforming controls are nice and tight, and I'm glad the developer didn't include some arbitrary \"your double-jump doesn't work if you haven't used it before half of your jump distance is completed\" mechanic. Sadly, there were more than a few times where I ended up clipping through a thin platform or even getting entirely stuck inside of a wall through normal gameplay. Then there were the times when the red Gene just stopped planting bundles of dynamite when I hit the E key during a level. Level introductions can be skipped, but if you do so before the part that includes an animation of the exit device appearing, then the exit simply won't be there when you finally get to that part of the stage. Issues like those brought me very close to giving up on the game on a few occasions.\n\nGene is an interesting enough game to play, so long as you've got the patience to deal with its shortcomings, and preferably have something interesting to listen to in the background. Given the price I pay for coffee each morning, I can't really fault having paid one dollar to get just under four hours worth of mindless platforming.","timestamp_created":1496095138,"timestamp_updated":1496095138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjYSOq9wCe+Gheg=="}
