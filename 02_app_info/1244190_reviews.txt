The game has a wholesome retro charm with a perfect learning curve to its simplistic but eventually maddeningly complex gameplay. A real hidden gem! The dev is quick to respond to any requests. One of the best indie efforts you'll come across on steam.","timestamp_created":1608384346,"timestamp_updated":1608384346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+a7LvfYCcLa3uwI="}
