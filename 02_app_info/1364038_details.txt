And now, through the talents of developer DTM, Union Pacific’s first-generation of turbines – in three authentic versions – is ready to take the rails in Train Simulator!<br><br>The Union Pacific GTEL pack includes the unique double-cab 4,500-horsepower turbine General Electric prototype demonstrator of 1948; Union Pacific’s initial order of “standard” 4,500-horsepower GE turbines of 1952-53; and the railroad’s distinctive “veranda” GE turbines of 1954, all with realistic and interactive operating controls! <br><br>Built to haul heavy tonnage at speed over long distances, the 4,500-horsepower turbines primarily worked Union Pacific’s main line between Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Ogden, Utah, including regular appearances on UP’s famed and challenging Sherman Hill.<br><br>Although equipped with their own fuel tanks, the turbines’ robust appetite for fuel resulted in Union Pacific adding fuel tenders, most of which were rebuilt from Class 18-C tenders from retired 9000-series UP 4-12-2 steam locomotives.<br><br>The prototype 4,500-horsepower turbine demonstrator was unique in having operating cabs at each end and was owned by GE. It served on the Union Pacific, wearing road number 50 and UP livery, from 1949 through 1951. Union Pacific’s order of ten turbines of 1952-53 (road numbers 51-60) was similar to the prototype in have a standard streamlined carbody, but with a single operation cab. Union Pacific’s final order of fifteen 4,500-horsepower turbines of 1954 (road numbers 61-75) were distinctive in having a “veranda” style carbody which allowed improved access to the engine compartment. All of Union Pacific’s 4,500-horsepowetr GTELs rode on a B+B-B+B truck configuration. UP’s 4,500-horsepower turbines operated until 1964, by which time they were replaced by the railroad’s 8,500-horsepower “Big Blow” turbines.<br><br>The Train Simulator Union Pacific GTEL pack includes all three 4,500-horsepower turbine variants, plus fuel tender and a selection of period-appropriate freight rolling stock including 46-foot gondola, 40-boxcar in multiple liveries, 4,000-gallon tank car, R-30-6 refrigerator car, and Union Pacific CA-5 caboose. The carbody details of the standard turbine can be customized and the turbines are provided in weathered and snow-dressed versions.
