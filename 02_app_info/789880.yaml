    review: "Turns out my friends were right - I am a boring person\n\nPros:\n\n-\
      \ Models and weapons\n- The maps are partially well...\n- The military insignias\
      \ as archivements for your profile showcase\n\nCons (Oh boy):\n\nThe AI requires\
      \ some improvement, running against walls and trains was rather an unintentional\
      \ feature?\nThe \"gameplay\" is just lame, considering servers are just a word\
      \ in that game, AI gameplay is to rely on.\nDidn't know \"Vlave\" was a thing,\
      \ alright?\nAs stated above, servers do not exist, quick play is just alike\
      \ in other games a bad \"meme\", nothing turns out, either have someone who's\
      \ as well stupid to buy it in order to play multiplayer... or... don't?\nNo\
      \ offense... but this game is abandoned to shit, even by the developer (Last\
      \ update according to changelog from 2018)\nBarely any noticeable afford placed\
      \ into this game, considering it does cost more than 10 euros under normal circumstances\
      \ and it's pretty much something alike a shooter, more afford and work could've\
      \ been put in.\nThe game as a whole is just dead, I've seen a cactus having\
      \ more activity in 50 years in a savanna than this game will ever have\n\nHereby\
      \ have to press my red buzzer, please leave the stage.\n\nBuy this game only\
      \ under the following conditions: \n\n1: You want military insignias for your\
      \ steam profile\n2: This game is on a massive sale (DO NOT BUY THIS 1 euro product\
      \ for 12, it is NOT worth it)\n3: You are used to games that don't even have\
      \ multiplayer servers / \"Quick Play\" as it claims to have - It does not"
