    review: 'This gives you some "Superior" parts for 1 bike (permanent to the bike
      you pick) to help you through the first season. You start the career modes first
      season with a 600cc bike before getting to the 1000cc''s, so keep that in mind.
      Once you have this pack in your library, it will open in the game and you have
      to pick a bike to apply the booster parts to at that point. My experience with
      this pack is as described below:


      If it''s possible, I would suggest starting your Career first BEFORE buying
      this and then buy the Pro Newcomer Pack after you pick your starting 600cc bike
      and team. For example with what happened to me, I picked the Kawi 636 for parts
      with my newcomer pack at the start, but the 636 didn''t have a team to start
      with and I ended up choosing the Honda CBR 600 at the start with the booster
      parts going to a bike I can''t use for the competitive events. To me, this pack
      was wasted and I am unable to change it to a different bike or buy a second
      pack. However, you are going to lose a lot in the first and second season anyway,
      so don''t stress on making a mistake like I did.


      I got this pack in a bundle, but I kind of wish I would have waited to buy this
      until I bought the 1000cc bike I wanted later in the game. However, I''m not
      sure if it will allow the pack to apply to a 1000cc bike or if the booster pack
      only works for the 600cc bikes.'
