      change your life.<h2 class="bb_tag">Diversified Occupations, the Way to Work
      </h2>You can choose different careers in the game to make a living and save
      money. In future versions, if you don''t like to work part-time or go to other
      companies, you can start your own business, or even work as a podcaster or game
      producer at home. Every time you start a new game, you can change your mind
      according to the limited conditions, and even change your life to become a local
      tyrant.<h2 class="bb_tag">Economic System, Large Framework </h2>There are some
      social and economic systems in the world that are somewhat similar to our reality.
      You even have to pay for water, electricity and electricity. In the bank, you
      can handle an emergency use of a credit card for yourself, but also in the initial
      bank interest to save a little more money to make profits, in the future version
      will also bring the Internet into the game, to achieve network financing mobile
      payment. In addition, you must also consider the physical condition of the day,
      according to the physical strength value, choose to eat to supplement physical
      strength, maintain a good mood, clean body, energetic. Keep in mind that you
      will also grow old, and there may be better ways to prolong life or let future
      generations inherit themselves. In random weather, unexpected events may change
      your original work plan.<h2 class="bb_tag">A variety of shops, entertainment
      and leisure </h2>Purchase food, food or personal equipment to meet working conditions
      and maintain good condition. You may need to buy a lot of necessities in the
      actual game and make more money to provide better conditions for yourself. When
      appropriate, you can buy some lottery tickets, speculate in stocks, go to entertainment
      places to relax, even if life is no longer difficult, you can not be overwhelmed
      by pressure.<h2 class="bb_tag">Open World, Diversified Life </h2>Game maps will
      grow slowly until we think they are big enough. Future versions of the game
      will allow you to own your own property and industry, and news and emergencies
      may sometimes surprise you, festivals and special situations will have some
      activities, maybe you can find another half and marry and have children. You
      should learn more new knowledge to improve your working ability and make good
      use of all the conditions you have. The world is your stage of development.
      <br>We will divide the game development into several scripts, and the current
      work is focused on perfecting the first year of the first script. It will take
      2-3 months to improve the content of the first year of the game development,
      and complete some of the planned content, so that the game can proceed normally.
      Then we will refine the content, reflect the change of time, and add more events
      and news, so that the game world continues to run. Follow-up development plan
      we will continue to improve in the future, now, you can prepare to start the
      trial version, provide feedback and help us continue to improve the game, if
      you have any good ideas can also tell us. <br><br><strong>Q: What happened to
      the RPG era? Will it be updated? <br>Answer: Because the overhead content of
      RPG era is too complex, we plan to build a better independent world view and
      perfect the game as far as possible. If conditions permit, we need to redo the
      game and ensure the quality of the game. Now RPG epochs are updated at least
      once every 1-3 weeks/month. </strong>'
