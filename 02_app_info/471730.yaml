    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>Hold the line
      as your booster rocket pushes you to increasingly insane speeds after every
      lap in this high speed, unforgiving, 3rd person racer! Watch out for blocks
      of ice and the edge of the track or you'll explode into a scattered pile of
      parts. It's all about speed and skill. You must pilot your rocket ski racer
      on the razor's edge. One small mistake and you're off the track, exploding into
      a million pieces. Drift off the fast line and an opponent will edge their way
      around you.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Game Modes</strong></h2><strong>Race</strong><br>Bump
      and bash 9 other rocket ski racers to stay on the track fast line and finish
      1st! Races are either 3 or 5 laps.<br><br><strong>Gate Chase</strong><br>Simple,
      fly through gates to earn points, but there's one small catch. The gates are
      racing around the track too!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Race Format</strong></h2><strong>Single
      Race</strong><br>Hone your skill and prepare for a run at the season championship!<br><br><strong>Season</strong><br>24
      Races on 6 different tracks. 12 Gate Chases and 12 Races. No do overs! Earn
      the most championship points and become king of the leaderboard!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Tracks</strong></h2><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Story</strong></h2>It's the distant future and
      the planet has changed. Now a frozen hellscape man has retreated and built a
      new civilization deep underground. How do these tech savvy neo cave people entertain
      themselves? By watching Rocket Ski Racing of course! A beautiful blend of rockets
      and the ancient sport of stock car racing. Everyone wants to see their champion
      come in first and if that doesn't happen then they love to see them CRASH &amp;
      BURN!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Review</strong></h2>&quot;Possibly the super
      hexagon of racing games.&quot; -DaveyJ
