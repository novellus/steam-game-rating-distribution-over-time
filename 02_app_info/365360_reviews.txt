But I must say this is one if not THE best game I ever played in the genre. I never felt so attached to my \"bros\". I give you an example : I recruited a pretty standard unit, a simple farmer who turned out to be quite effective with a polearm. So the days pass, he survives the early game nightmare (you basically struggle for food, money, everything) and eventually becomes the best soldier in the company. Then comes an orc ambush during the night, in the middle of the woods. I lose two guys including him, but... wait, no ! He's not dead the game says, he just lost a fking lung ! The other poor lad was clearly decapitated but the farmer survived a heavy blow by an orc warrior. Now, Roland the Breethless has become my banner man, his weakness makes him even more badass. This is just of my bros, I've got twelve of them and they're all special. No other game ever achieved that to me. Don't be fooled by the old school graphics, this game is a pure rpg for hardcore gamers. It is sometimes extremely difficult, I still avoid the undead when I see them and still s*** myself when I cross the path of a pack of direwolves. \n\nNo magic, just dudes with weapons trying to survive in one of the most hostile worlds I've seen in a game. Like in Darksouls, prepare to lose bros and fail in your quest, save after save. Or quick save every 9 seconds if that's what you want. But death is part of the trip, and looking at the names of the fallen comrades will give you chills I rarely felt in any game.","timestamp_created":1609857149,"timestamp_updated":1609857149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hNW96fYCebzbwAI="}
