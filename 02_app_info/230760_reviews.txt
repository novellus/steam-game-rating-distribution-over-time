There are plenty of better FREE tower climbing games. Don't get one that feels like your constantly skating on ice, even when airborne. It's a shitty game, with barely changing music (every few levels it finally changes) that loops forever, and with way too many collectibles. If you get it, I will not be to blame. Now if you will excuse me, I'm going to watch funny hamsters to remind me they aren't Satan.","timestamp_created":1469728150,"timestamp_updated":1469728150,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501004397869110107","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn/qnmdYCeufhXQ=="}
