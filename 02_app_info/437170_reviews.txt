The game is a horror-style one if you will, and is mostly puzzle-based but has a few RPG elements to it, such as the casual RPG fighting. The game stars a girl named Ashlee who gets invited to a party, but later needs to escape the house which the party took place, with everyone vanished and unable to help her. Only to discover the shocking truth behind who owns the house, and why souls are present within the house.\n\nI have just beaten the game as I'm writing this review. If you know about the other RPG Maker games \"Witch's House\" and \"Five Nights at F***Boy's\", you would say gameplay is like a mix between the two (Without the sexual themes of FNaFB, obviously). Most of the game is about solving puzzles within the house, and sometimes you'll come across a monster which you must fight and defeat RPG-style. So this game involves leveling up and gaining new abilities. But it's a bit cheezy how the minor combat feature mixes in with the major aspects.\n\nThis game MIGHT also be a \"Choices Matter\" type as I have been given feedback from the game after doing a specific set of actions. Such as taking an item only to realize I was accused of stealing it later in the game. But I'm pretty sure these choices don't matter as much as other games like Undertale.\n\nPeople were complaining that the game was poor for its puzzle solving, how it wasn't as difficult and convolluted as other puzzle games, which kind of make you think logically. But overall, this game is a pass for me. It's the kind of game you would expect from paying $2 for it, like something out of a dollar store.\n\nSTORY 6/10\nPRESENTATION 8/10\nGAMEPLAY 6/10\nVALUE 8/10\nOVERALL 7/10","timestamp_created":1467994817,"timestamp_updated":1467994817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nujT5dUCdKShXA=="}
