It was rebranded into Zeal series simply because it was made by the same company. So, if you like Raiden, you may like this game.\n\nCan save replay. Have online leaderboard. Can view replays from online leaderboard. I saw two replays that seems to not be a valid replay, but their scores are close to the valid top score. Either hacked or desync'ed.\n\nThe game starts with 3 credits and it will increase the more you play. It seems the maximum is 9 credits.\n\nThe original arcade name is called G-Stream G2020 in case if you want to emulate it.","timestamp_created":1601596476,"timestamp_updated":1607861276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52519381046295166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1oGArvYCf/WlpQI="}
