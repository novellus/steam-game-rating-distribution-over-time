The concept is brilliant and works really well, they executed it very well. Very unique take on tower defense.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, found it very difficult to stop playing and it was even challenging in places. I had to do a lot of thinking (thus strategy) and trial and error like a good tower defense game requires.\n\nDefinitely recommended for children and families too. \n","timestamp_created":1605484925,"timestamp_updated":1608488529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xuXYwPYCdqPRrgI="}
