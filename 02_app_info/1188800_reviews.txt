Basically, any rpg in which everyone is completely useless but you and you feel the undying need to help every single person that breaths!  \n\n[h1]Positives[/h1] \n\n[b][i]Gender choices: [/i][/b] Fairly soon in to the story you are able to pick both the gender and the pronouns that you would like the main character to take. Once you have made your choice, you are unable to change them again throughout. Although you play as a shapeshifter and become locked in to your decision, the initial choice is welcome as I feel it caters to a larger audience.  \nAnother nice touch is that you can pick the preferred gender of two of the love interests while the third will always be a female. Again, this allows more readers to select their personal preference and opens the market even further for the consumers.  \n\n[b][i]Real choices:[/i][/b] Throughout the entire novel you are given a variety of choices that will change the main characters personality and skillset. You are free to play as a grumpy elf who dislikes other people, an overly cheerful elf who adores everything Christmassy or anything in between.  \nAs for your skillset, there are several you may pick from such as Christmas magic, shapeshifting, trickery and so on. It’s advised to focus on just one or two of these skills to level through answers as the higher the ability, the more likely it will work as intended; However, it’s never a requirement as if your character fails a certain ability, someone else is usually there to step in and take charge (and be angry that you suck). This does put a slight dampen on the whole thing for me but it’s nicer than getting premature game overs and allows some RP. \n\n[b][i]This quote:[/i][/b] \"The tooth fairies continue their raids for the disposable bones of mankind.\" \n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1] \n\n[b][i]General errors: [/i][/b]As stated earlier, you are given the choice to pick your gender early on, however, there are a few times in which I was referred to as a “he” after playing as a she. I can’t speak for the reverse order as I didn’t read through the story as a man. At one point Candid is called both “her” and “he” in a single sentence. Slightly off-putting but easy enough to overlook.  \nThere is a minor number of grammatical mistakes that could benefit from another proof-read but again it isn't to the extent where it will cause confusion and force a re-read from the player. \n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1] \n\n[b][i]Story: [/i][/b] Sadly the plot had some very big ideas that just didn’t quite reach the mark for me. I felt as if there was way too much going on most of the time yet none of it was fully explored. If each sub-plot was given more time and detail it might have resonated differently with me.  \nBecause of the forced relationship I was given with Mrs. Claus I did feel a lot of pressure to constantly side with her and try to keep a good bond. This was even the case while playing as a self-serving and grumpy elf but only slightly less so. Everything just clashed together as if it were supposed to be an extended action scene but ultimately, just became exhausting. \n\n[b][i]Characters: [/i][/b]It is a huge problem for an interactive novel when none of the characters are relatable or cause any stir of emotion from the reader and this was exactly the case with [i]In the Service of Mrs. Claus[/i] for me. Yes, each of the characters has a ‘strong’ personality trait but that was the only thing that helps you tell them apart. As a reader, I knew basically next to nothing about any of them as backstories were very limited, both in detail and scenes. This is an enormous oversight from the author especially since the character you play as has known each and every one of these people for many, many years. As with the plot, I believe this could have been avoided with more time, effort and detail being put in to character development and interaction!  \n\n[b][i]Romance: [/i][/b]The romance was lack-luster and almost childlike. These characters are centuries old yet still blush like a smitten schoolgirl over a tiny compliment, are surprised by a quick hug or outright shocked that anyone would kiss them. I know this “shy” trope is a popular thing and although it’s not to my taste (I’m just so sick of being put in the shoes of little miss shy girl- like, why is it even so popular?), I was really hoping for something a little more mature! This whole novel is a darker side of Christmas after all; mature themes like politics, war and betrayal yet for some reason, that couldn’t be applied to the romance too.   \nWhile on the subject, the ‘romance’ feels heavily like filer. It’s basically non-existent, not explored and the love confession feels like it comes from someone I generally barely know at all. Interestingly enough, the romance is the only place you’ll really see any different scenes from your previous playthrough so that’s saying a lot really... \n\n[b][i]Replayability: [/i][/b]For an interactive novel there just isn’t enough replaybility. Yes, there are some minor differences here and there based on your answers but it could quite easily be overlooked at the same time. I struggled and failed to complete a second playthrough but did managed to drag myself through the majority of it: It was just so boring the second time. There have been other interactive novels which I’ve re-read a good six times and still find it exciting with text here and there I hadn’t managed to discover before. This, sadly, isn’t going to be one of those!  \n\n[b][i]Manual save/load function: [/i][/b] I wanted to point out that this novel doesn't have a manual save system. I believe this is normal for the program used to create these interactive novels but, if like me, you read a lot of visual novels you are likely as spoilt as I am and are used to being able to save/load at any time. \nThe book does, of course, remember where you are when you close the program and will load at the exact same place. Let's be real, my first one of these I had no clue how it worked and had to ask a friend. Thought I'd just add that bit of information in case you are as [strike]dopey[/strike] unsure as I was.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1] \n\nI highly doubt this would be something I’d recommend to anyone I know. The whole thing would need a serious overhaul before I even considered poking at it again to collect the remaining achievements – I'm an avid achievement hunter by the way; Take that for what you will.  \nEven for the low price I’d say no and would likely request a refund if I still could.","timestamp_created":1608798984,"timestamp_updated":1608816199,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.622288942337036133","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41eC6yvYCe67bvAI="}
