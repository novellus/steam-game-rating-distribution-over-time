    review: Doing a run through of all games in my steam library. Bought this years
      ago and remember it being a pretty solid let down. I wanted to escape WoW and
      instead stumbled into a mmo grindfest. Quests weren't that interesting and flying
      was simply gliding. This isn't flying. It's falling with style.
