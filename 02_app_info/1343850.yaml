    review: "Dr. Milo's Revenge... what can I say. \nGood game. \n10/10. \nFavorite\
      \ game of all time.\n\nDr. Milo's Revenge is a low effort troll comedy horror\
      \ game. The gameplay consists of... finding things, avoiding a slow moving doctor\
      \ cat thing and running when said doctor cat thing spots you. Revolutionary\
      \ game mechanics I know. \n\nYou start off as a science person who is doing\
      \ unknown research in a science facility in the middle of a snowy tundra. The\
      \ power is off and it is up to you to turn on the generators to bring back power\
      \ to your science facility. One of your fellow researchers \"Dr. Milo\" is also\
      \ mysteriously missing. Dr. Milo being a cat doctor hybrid wielding a pipe?\
      \ like weapon. Milo will try to stop you at each area where a generator is located.\
      \ By stopping you, I mean, running at you very slowly while making a very loud\
      \ earrape level sound, that is honestly the best thing about the game, it's\
      \ a fucking terrifying sound. When he catches you, Milo smacks you with his\
      \ pipe. You can take multiple hits from his pipe so it's not difficult to survive\
      \ him. \n\nThere are some strats I discovered when dealing with Milo. In 2 of\
      \ the 3 generator areas, you can have him chase you across the snowy tundra\
      \ for basically as long and far as you need, just keep triggering him. Once\
      \ you get him a decent distance from your target location, you can run around\
      \ him and head back. He will slowly walk back to the generator area but it will\
      \ take a couple minutes, giving you time to basically complete everything. In\
      \ fact I'm pretty sure each area has it's own Milo, so hypothetical you could\
      \ have all 3 Milo's meet each other. I'm not sure what happens when you do this\
      \ (haven't tested the theory yet) but the results could be catastrophic. \n\n\
      The first generator room to your left is the only challenging one because the\
      \ door locks behind you. You basically just have to find 2 keys while avoiding\
      \ Milo. If you can survive this, then the next two areas are a give away because\
      \ you can just lure Milo half way across the continent and then go back and\
      \ solve the puzzles. Puzzles which include, finding a key, opening a door, grabbing\
      \ bolt cutters and using them on a chained up door. The other puzzle is turning\
      \ wheels on pipes in a certain order. Groundbreaking puzzles I know.\n\nAfter\
      \ all the generators are on you will be treated to a final showdown with Milo.\
      \ You head back to main base to use the telecommunications to contact a helicopter.\
      \ I walked in and Milo spotted me, I ran to get away but he wouldn't stop chasing\
      \ me. I ran halfway across the ridiculously large map and back until I ran inside\
      \ the barn area, ran into the Milo of that area, he hit me, I turned a corner\
      \ and lost both of the Milos. Made my way back to the main base, contacted the\
      \ helicopter, went to the pad and beat the game.  I'm honestly not sure how\
      \ to get past the final Milo without losing him inside the barn or another generator\
      \ area. He killed me the first time I played and there are NO SAVES so you have\
      \ to start from the beginning... which is really, really painful and kind of\
      \ killed me on the inside. \n\nOnce you beat the game, you unlock Nightmare\
      \ Mode. Which is just an impossible troll version of the normal game. There\
      \ is no way to beat it. If you glitch out Milo and make your way to the telecommunications\
      \ room, you're locked in that room and cannot leave. \n\nI would not recommend\
      \ Dr. Milo's Revenge. The only enjoyment I got out of it was playing while a\
      \ friend watched me over Discord as I suffered through the grind of trolling\
      \ Milo halfway across the map as his awful earrape noise blasted every couple\
      \ seconds. If you wanna entertain yourself and some friends, buy this game for\
      \ a $1 during a steam sale. It 100% is not worth $5, a reminder that \"Tattletale\"\
      , \"The Music Machine\" and the first \"Welcome to The Game\" are also $5, please\
      \ buy those games instead, those are good games."
