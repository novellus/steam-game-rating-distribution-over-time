    review: "This retro wave that has swept over us over the past decade has, in my\
      \ book, for the most part only brought positive things. Somewhere in the late\
      \ 00's I stopped being interested in games. It became a climate of titles that\
      \ looked more or less the same and came in genres that did not interest me.\
      \ Unreal-brown FPS games were simply not my cup of tea and obviously I was not\
      \ alone. Indie developers around the world seemed to have the same kind of background\
      \ as me, with a penchant for platform games in pixel graphics, something that\
      \ had long been a scarce commodity since the happy 90's.\n\nSuddenly, both indie\
      \ games and pixel graphics exploded at about the same time. New titles are released\
      \ daily that appear to have been developed for Amiga, Super NES or Sega Saturn.\
      \ Even though the quality can often be questioned, I still sit and cuddle by\
      \ my digital fire. Finally, the games I wanted to play had returned.\n\nBut\
      \ I had not really counted on a counter reaction in the other direction.\n\n\
      Macbat 64 is a game that, in more ways than one, tries to mimic the style and\
      \ feel of early 3D games. Specifically for the first low poly generation of\
      \ consoles and even more specifically for Nintendo 64. These are, as you can\
      \ see in the pictures, low-resolution polygon models (which can possibly consist\
      \ of more than eight triangles ... In total) instead of exquisite pixels we\
      \ are dealing with here. A part of the gaming history that is often described\
      \ by many as the ugliest and which has aged the worst in terms of graphics.\
      \ Where many still finds a charm in old 8-bit games, few are crazy about elongated\
      \ textures, angular heroes and sugar cube models.\n\nReference marathon\nSiactro,\
      \ the developer behind the game, has chosen to focus its portfolio on making\
      \ so-called low poly games. Obviously, I and the creator grew up with roughly\
      \ the same titles, which I noticed when I tested their first real game called\
      \ Kiwi 64 (what else?). In this title, I took on the role of a kiwi with a red\
      \ backpack (of course) whose mission was to prevent the evil King Melon from\
      \ taking over the world by jumping between platforms and on enemies in some\
      \ sort of Super Mario 64 spirit. On an open 3D course \xE1 la Banjo Kazooie,\
      \ I got to collect kiwis, give a giant worm an apple to feast on and, of course,\
      \ collect shimmering golden notes.\n\nIf it was not obvious what the reference\
      \ product was, I can add that the melon rhymed and lived at the top of a mountain.\n\
      \nUnfortunately, the Kiwi 64 was not a pleasant platform experience. The game\
      \ was not only short (about 5 minutes) but also far too easy. In addition, I\
      \ could not use a controller, which of course feels obligatory in a platform\
      \ game. The camera also did its part to kill me (which is certainly a realistic\
      \ throw back, but still ...). At best, the Kiwi 64 can be considered a demo\
      \ to test the developer's skills, at worst as a poorly done parody of early\
      \ 3D platform games. Charming, absolutely, but completely unplayable.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ it was of course with great suspicion that I decided to download Macbat 64\
      \ on Steam. It looked nice in the pictures and maybe Siactro had learned something?\
      \ Not that I was expecting a masterpiece, but I was starving for cozy three-dimensional\
      \ platform games. A gamble, quite simply.\n\nUnfortunately, it did not start\
      \ well. Just like in the Kiwi 64, there is no possibility of a controller pad.\
      \ After a little swearing, I re-mapped my own controller to the controls that\
      \ the game instructed, which is an immediately necessary threshold to get over.\
      \ Playing platform games with a mouse and keyboard is as strange to me as jumping\
      \ on the up button on a joypad. In addition, the game had a preset language\
      \ in German, which has not flowed like running water since about 20 years ago\
      \ for me.\n\nAfter this minor debacle, Macbat 64 literally unfolds into a whole\
      \ fantastic gaming experience. Where the Kiwi 64 felt like a mockery of the\
      \ old school games, this whole adventure feels like a single long tribute to\
      \ not only Banjo Kazooie, but everything that the Nintendo 64 stood for. If\
      \ you have ever owned or played on this black console, you will recognize all\
      \ the references that lurks in this game. Or how about visiting a haunted house\
      \ with fixed camera angles (Resident Evil), looking for a sword and a shield\
      \ in a forest and figuring out puzzles in a temple (Zelda) or going go karting\
      \ (Mario Kart)?\n\nA bit into the game, I thought most things were charming,\
      \ but after a while it is no longer possible to defend oneself. When I got to\
      \ the two-dimensional Kirby level with the gaping tree and all the fluffy clouds,\
      \ I smiled with my whole face.\n\nI could sit here and rattle off all the references\
      \ thrown back and forth in this game, but it would also do you who are craving\
      \ a great disservice. A big part of the charm is to see for yourself what Siactro\
      \ has to offer, be surprised by the choices and chuckle on the sofa.\n\nLeave\
      \ it in the attic\nI have barely mentioned anything about the game mechanics.\
      \ There is a reason for that. From a purely gaming perspective, the Macbat 64\
      \ is not much of a video game, really.\n\nKiwi 64 suffered from a lack of control.\
      \ Even with a mapped controller, the camera was clumsy and awkward in combination\
      \ with enemies who wanted to kill me. Fortunately, Siactro has understood that\
      \ their strengths do not lie in making a tight control and compliant camera,\
      \ so now the camera follows you automatically, which works surprisingly well.\
      \ A big reason for this is that the enemies shine with their absence. There\
      \ are not many minions you should jump on or fight in Macbat 64. The challenges\
      \ usually consist of collecting objects (do you recognize this?), solving less\
      \ complicated puzzles and playing various mini-games. Add to that action segments\
      \ that, just like many other platform games from the 90s, is pure nonsense and\
      \ you will understand that there is not much useful food on this sandwich.\n\
      \nAll of this may sound dry.\n\nLack of enemies, ridiculously simple puzzles,\
      \ banal mini-games ... What is really left?\n\nThe charm. \n\nI understand that\
      \ this is really not a game for everyone. If you have never owned or even played\
      \ on a Nintendo 64, you will only see a horribly ugly game with superficial\
      \ game mechanics and strange bongo drums in the background. But it is also to\
      \ miss the whole point. The idea from Siactro's side has never been to make\
      \ \"the real sequel to Super Mario 64\", but rather to pay tribute to everything\
      \ that made the console fantastic.\n\nUsually when we judge games, we do it\
      \ objectively. It's about graphics, sound and control. We rarely talk about\
      \ how much charm it possesses and how it can actually change the overall judgment.\
      \ Sometimes yellow plus red multiplied with triangle is equal to ketchup, which\
      \ is an extremely much more difficult way to judge a game than 1 + 1 = 2, but\
      \ perhaps says more about the impression. It is simply not possible to just\
      \ add everything to a total number. That would do Siactro injustice.\n\nThe\
      \ whole treasure of Macbat 64 is to see all the references, laugh at everything\
      \ and to get a nostalgia kick.\n\nAfter Nintendo released its Super NES Classic\
      \ Mini, voices were raised that the Nintendo 64 would receive the same treatment.\
      \ To collect all the classics on a mini machine and to watch them on their HDTVs.\
      \ Honestly, I think those memories are best in being who they are and instead\
      \ of giving the rich Kyoto company more money, we can give some bucks to Siactro\
      \ on Steam and get The Best of N64. It is less than an hour long, but enough\
      \ to cure your withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIn addition, you do not have to go up\
      \ in the attic.\nSuch a thing can not be underestimated."
