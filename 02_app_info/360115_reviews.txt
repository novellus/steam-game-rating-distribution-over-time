This review is not specifically about this particular Core Book, but about how these work in general.\n\nFantasy Grounds comes stock with the 5E SRD and Basic Rules for 5E, so you don't strictly speaking need to buy the core books to play - that said, Wizards of the Coast did a great job when they created the SRD/Basic Rules, leaving exactly enough content out of the free version to make the free version feel fine to play, but also making the paid content vastly superior by comparison.\n\nAdding the Core Book DLCs to your collection grants you the ability to utilize the corebook material in place of the free content, which is usually superior with more listed options.\n\nAfter loading the module, you can access the content of the DLC by clicking the Library Button in the lower right corner and scrolling down until you see \"Core Rules\" where you can then click the title of the DLC Core Book in question and then a reference table appears.\n\nFrom here you can access and drag-and-drop any content from the book into your campaign and at the bottom of the reference list, there will be a \"reference manual\", which is actually a fantasy-grounds version of the book itself, that you can read page for page (though it isn't nearly as easy to read as a physical book, or even a PDF).\n\nThis still makes for an incredibly user-friendly and hassle-free supplement that any fantasy grounds DM can take full advantage of, but it isn't a particularly good replacement for the \"real thing\". If it comes down to buying the physical book or this DLC, I would say buy the book - the free content will carry you far enough - that said, having both is great.","timestamp_created":1603616991,"timestamp_updated":1603616991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48azBr/UCcvKAqgI="}
