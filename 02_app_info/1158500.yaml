    review: 'I own the physical board game and really enjoy it. I can''t recommend
      the digital game.


      PROS: multilingual


      CONS: buggy; distracting visuals (flashing lines) and annoying music (chimes),
      poor interface (scroll overs cover up important information), and keyboard shortcuts
      that don''t work'
