    review: 'It looks fun but it isn''t!


      First of all there isn''t a sandbox mode.

      The only modes are "Time Mode" in which you have 300 seconds to make as much
      money as possible, and "Debt Mode" in which a monthly amount is deducted, but
      it more then doubles every 30 seconds.

      Long story short: its boring!'
