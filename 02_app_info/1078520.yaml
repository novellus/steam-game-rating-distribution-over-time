    review: "A sort of horror meets hidden object adventure. You search a haunted\
      \ house for items on a task list and try to get it all accomplished before the\
      \ enemy AI 'Max' kills you. \n\nI found it to be fun for the price. Spoops weren't\
      \ great, but the tension of the ticking clock is there where you know you need\
      \ to hurry. \n\nIf you're quick and lucky, you can knock this out in less than\
      \ 30 minutes. For the price, it's not bad. Purchase at your own discretion,\
      \ my darlings. <3"
