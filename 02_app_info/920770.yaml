    review: "Great festive platformer. That is natural evolution of games such as\
      \ Santa Claus in Trouble from the early 2000s. I'm glad that Santa's Story of\
      \ Christmas revived festive theme in platformers. I wish more seasonal games\
      \ like this, because nowdays if you want to play something \"\u0421hristmasy\"\
      , all you can get is just some point and click searching for objects.  Again,\
      \ this is great festive game that will help you to get in the mood on the winter\
      \ evenings. But don't think this game is easy, oh boy, it is not. \n\nMerry\
      \ Christmas and Happy New Year!"
