    review: "Would rather watch a child drowning than play more of this game.\n\n\
      Other review was false, it's level 9 where it becomes unbearably toxic and bad.\
      \ This game promotes police brutality, shoddy security systems and endorses\
      \ Joe Biden over Bernie Sanders (in essence).\n\nHonestly, I wish the aspect\
      \ ratio was THINNER so there would be less of a level needed to complete. \n\
      \nOverall, \n1 spinning laser moustache or semen thing out of Ocean's 12"
