      /><br><br><strong><u>STORY MODE</u></strong><br><br>A dark cloud has sprung
      over the island of Izajima and its effects weigh heavily on the inhabitants.
      To top things off, mischievous spirits called <i>yokai</i> have returned and
      are running amok within the various hot springs. As Mu, you've been tasked with
      filling the shoes of your now missing sensei, the great &quot;Onsen Master&quot;.
      It is now up to you to restore the balance and uncover what happened to the
      previous master.
