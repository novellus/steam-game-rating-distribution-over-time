It gets really hard really quickly, but afaik there's certain elements that are not randomized, so its definitely manageable with repetition or good memory. If you liked the memorization and multitasking of Papers Please this is a game definitely up your alley.\n\nAs a person with terrible short term memory it was a pain to handle things after a certain point, but i definitely got farther than i thought i would. I think this game would definitely benefit from people writing down things on paper and checking them off screen.\n\nThe story is definitely filled with charm from the voicelines each night and on each egg nog review from the eggnog connoisseur, and theres a sense of humor which delves on the absurd, which i really enjoyed.\n\nThe art is pixel art and its pretty good and gets the job done because everything needs to be very legible at all moments, and it definitely does exactly that. I love the art on the window to show the city you picked, and also some of the ending screens were pretty detailed.\n\nSound wise the music is pretty chill and the sfx were pretty ok, nothing really spectacular, but it works. I liked the credits song even though its not my style of music.\n\nFEEDBACK: I do have a few really minor complaints, but hopefully the devs will fix them if they do agree with me. Mainly key turning is awkward, also the floppy and robot mouth hitboxes are really precise, or at least they are when you are trying to be quick. I also found it annoying that i realized i had to reject an eggnog after generating the QA sticker, and i had no option to generate a new QA sticker, i had to stick with my previous wrong decision even at a point where i felt i could fix it. Also i didn't understand the labyrinth part of the bomb, nothing looked clickable.","timestamp_created":1609556700,"timestamp_updated":1609556854,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609563344,"developer_response":"We will work on the labyrinth, we agree it's not clear how to operate the maze section.
