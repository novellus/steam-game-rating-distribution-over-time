    review: "Far more frustrating than fun and I'm not convinced this game can be\
      \ completed without cheating.\n\nIt's a tower defense with it's unique feature\
      \ being that there are checkpoints the enemy must go through. The idea is you\
      \ build a maze that forces the enemy to pass your towers numerous times. You\
      \ don't get much resources to build many towers and your towers do very little\
      \ damage, you rely on the enemies keep passing them to slowly whittle them down.\
      \ I didn\u2019t like this, I prefer a shorter route and my towers actually do\
      \ some damage. There are 4 standard towers which can be upgraded to a further\
      \ 8 special towers however, pretty much every tower is useless except for 2.\n\
      \nIf you are aiming to 100% this game you need to beat 9 basic maps and 8 challenge\
      \ maps on any difficulty and pass wave 50 of a random endless map on insane\
      \ difficulty. This is where my issues start. One of the challenge maps is considerably\
      \ harder than all the other maps. I beat it eventually on normal but I don't\
      \ believe it can be beaten on hard or insane.\n\nNext, I'm not convinced endless\
      \ wave 50 can be legitimately beaten. My playtime shows 44 hours but I've spent\
      \ around a further 20 hours off-line planning my layouts on a spreadsheet. I've\
      \ put a lot of effort in to trying to beat it and I can't even get close. On\
      \ the later waves your under powered towers have to contend with enemies with\
      \ huge amounts of health and have incredibly powerful buffs.\n\nAt time of writing\
      \ 4.2% of players have done this which is high and would suggest it's not that\
      \ difficult. However there is a glitch where it is quite common to get a blank\
      \ random map with no enemies and you can simply hit go 50 times to get the achievement.\n\
      \nMaybe I'm wrong, perhaps I'm overlooking something obvious but it's not a\
      \ very popular game so there is little to no help available. If anyone can prove\
      \ my accusations wrong I'll retract my negative review."
