Anyone who has seen the store page already knows that Maggie Dale arrived in the Sun Systems and the title infers there's some sort of \"reunion\" that occurs.  This particular installment in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] also features a class reunion!\n\n[h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]\n\nNothing has changed from [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Year 3[/i], so this category does not apply to this review.\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n\nEverything that fans of the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] love about the series is back so everyone can expect a great story with memorable quotes and funny moments with the occasional bad pun.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1702174058\n\nOnly in this particular installment, this is the most emotional game ever in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i], and that's not to mean \"sad,\" because while there is that, [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Reunion[/i] invokes many more extreme feelings. (Some good, some bad.) What the player feels (and the extremes to which they feel it) really has to make the player wonder why the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] is still an indie game made by a handful of people when it should be made by a AAA publisher with millions of dollars poured into it's development.\n\nGiven some of the scenes, [spoiler]particularly in Maggie's visions[/spoiler] [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Reunion[/i] is probably an amazing experience if the player happens to be watching those scenes while the player is under the influence of certain substances known to amplify visions.  (Particularly some leafy substances, or even the inspiration for the song [b]L[/b]ucy in the [b]S[/b]ky with [b]D[/b]iamonds.)\n\nFor the first time in the history of the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i], quotes are used at the beginning of every chapter, and the quotes recited are excellent mood-setters, and will hopefully be a feature in future games in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i].\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n\nIt's easy to just say that this category does not apply to [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Reunion[/i], but the author must try and grasp for straws to find faults anyway...  For starters, trading cards aren't making a comeback, which is obvious given the lack of demand for cards from the [i]Space Pilgrim Episodes[/i].  (If someone wants to get a level five badge for four different games for really cheap, the player can do that.  The player should also remember that Steam users do not have to own a game just to collect cards for those games!)\n\nLike all games in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i], the player needs to be one of the chosen few that was granted the magical powers to upload screenshots to games that do not support the Steam overlay.  (Or are these powers not magical, and were instead planted into the brains of Steam users by Marion Dale?)\n\nGiven how nobody sought to ask [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/25150682/]REXCurse[/url] to conduct an official review, that really sucks.  (Although it may be that this author is known to be a loyal fan of the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] and was going to buy the game anyway!)\n\n[spoiler]Being the apparent end of the [i]Space Pilgrim Academy[/i] series, it doesn't appear that the player will be able to play Maggie through year four of her days as a cadet, which means no interesting classes, and the player doesn't get to experience Maggie's learning of marksmanship and solo starship piloting first hand.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis author swears on his four level five [i]Space Pilgrim Episodes[/i] badges and four corresponding foil badges that the ulterior motive of this review was not to satisfy Steam's algorithm so that the achievements earned in the game officially count towards the player's profile for achievements!  Instead, a friend of the author wanted a review, so the friend gets a review.  Only it seems like blasphemy that the friend hasn't played a game in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] since [i]Space Pilgrim Episode IV[/i]!\n\nNominated by ol' Il Pallino for The Outstanding Story-Rich Game Award in 2019, this is anything but a biased decision. No better story in a game was experienced on Steam.  Once the player finishes this game, they'll be desperately waiting for the newest story arc. (Which will most likely be 2021.)\n\n[h1]The honest word of Il Pallino...
