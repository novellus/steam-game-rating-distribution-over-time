There's 2 short cinematics at the start and end which are quite cool but the main ride is very basic. There's a few jumps but boring ride getting there. When doing the big jumps you won't even land, it's just a portal which takes you back to the ground which is a very bad way of getting around having to do much work on the map. \n\nSo in conclusion, could've been made a lot better.","timestamp_created":1602324497,"timestamp_updated":1602324497,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pvD+iPUCfbL+pgI="}
