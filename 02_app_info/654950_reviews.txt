It was a simple one line text which stated...\n\n\"Labyrinths NEVER make GOOD games\"\n\nIs this true? I immediately started to think back to all the times I've played games containing mazes over my life time and sure enough I could not even think of one, which I was overly thankful for having played. What does this mean? Is it possible that making a 'Good' maze game is actually impossible? Are maze games simply the product of lazy game developers who are content to just pad shallow entertainment through aimless wandering? Why do we continue to buy these sorts of games if they are 'NEVER' any good?\n\nDon't get me wrong. I like mazes. Some mazes command my respect and awe. The George Lucas 1986 Labyrinth movie is one of my favourites. Maybe that's the problem. Not enough Muppets. Fill the 12 mazes in this game with singing Muppets that I can pummel to death with my rubber bullet totting machine gun and this could be the best game ever. \n\nAlas, on the contrary, there is nothing to shoot here other than walls in the hope that you will find the extension of a wall which is fake and easy to knock over. Continue doing this until you basically find the exit. There are obstacles to avoid, but since they are randomly placed this isn't particularly difficult, because most rooms will give you the space of a football field to avoid the obstacle. Also the obstacles don't really have alternating strategies needed to combat against them. Let me illustrate...\n\nThere are bombs, these can be avoided by jumping over them.\nThere are mines, these can be avoided by jumping over them.\nThere is lava, this can be avoided by jumping over it.\nThere is ice, this can be avoided by jumping over it.\nThere are half blocks, these can be avoided by jumping over them.\n\nSee a pattern developing here?\n\nThe best thing about this game which made me chuckle and probably something a speed runner might be interested in is that if you simply shoot the top right corner of a false wall, you more often than not, can pivot it into becoming a ramp for you, this allows you to climb to the top of the labyrinth and just walk along the top of the walls.\n\nOne day while roaming the city streets in my Armani suit, a taxi sped past me driving through a large puddle. Drenched head to toe in dirty water I chased after it hoping to get its details. Alas, I didn't catch sight of the trash can under my foot and went superman flying into a stoby pole. Now sitting down on the footsteps of an abandoned building, patting the blood from my forehead with some tumbleweed newspaper floating by, i was eventually approached by a beanbag sized lady from the Salvation Army. She drooped down to my level and in a kind voice of concern asked...\n\n\"Are you alright my dear? Would you like a place to stay?\"\n\nI mention this because. With the flood of negative reviews, with some trendy graphic assets now arrayed in tatters thanks to random haphazard placement and Tero Lunkka a Finland developer https://www.facebook.com/tero.lunkka trying to bury the pain of having created this, with crumpled up other projects, sitting on the steps of steam store, like a beggar, I feel this is my perfect time to pay the kind and thoughtful deed shown to me forward.\n\nâ€œAre you alright my dear? Would you like a place to stay?\"\n\nFull game below to settle curiosity...\nhttps://youtu.be/8Zh8xSvkuQo\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please subscribe to my curator page. Thanks...\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6843548/\n\nTips for developer...\n\n1. Groovy music needed for every level.\n2. Time requirement for every level.\n3. Lock the levels so that they need to be unlocked giving the gamer a sense of progression.\n4. Gun's aim is off.\n5. Make the false walls consistent. Some needed to be shot 30 times for them to fall others only need to be shot once.\n6. Placed enemies, traps or bombs that require more than just jumping over them. \n7. Proximity mines.\n8. Deadly lasers.\n9. Spikes. \n10. Closing walls.\n11. Achievements & trading cards.\n12. Finish something properly before moving onto another project or your shoddy reputation will follow you.\n13. Story, notes, collectibles. Money for gun customisation.","timestamp_created":1518224993,"timestamp_updated":1518241704,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.627497494220733643","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1518252806,"developer_response":"Thanks for very long and constructive review. Few answers for your tips:\n\n1. Yes it would be lot better if better music in future every level\n2. Probably not time limit every level. Maybe more levels where is time limit\n3. good idea\n5. Some walls are heavier than other\n8. Lasers and moving lasers would be nice idea\n10. Also very good idea\n11. Achievements not yet know. Cards maybe added if get in future permission for them"}],"cursor":"AoJwhL2Qv+ECdMu6mAE="}
