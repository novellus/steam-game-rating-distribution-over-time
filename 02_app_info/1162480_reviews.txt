I think this game is visually quite nice, but the UI is so intense and there is so much going on at once I couldn't take it all in.\n\nThe general mechanic is easy to understand with a tutorial on each, but the more in-depth mechanics are not well explained or just not at all. It doesn't help that the font is extremely small and there are brackets around some descriptions which complicates understanding. What exactly does this perk mean or do? How does this factor into how I play? I don't know. Progression felt like it was perhaps going somewhere, but I really don't know given my short time with the game.\n\nI realise the English translation is localised, and I appreciate it is undergoing revisions with updates, but I couldn't understand why sometimes I'd do more damage and other times I wasn't doing enough (aside from obvious elemental weaknesses), despite having the card state it was doing to do a specific amount of damage.\n\nThe premise of the game is good, but does need more polish. I think the developers do have something good here, but the story is kind of lacking and I found I just didn't care at all about the characters or the story to try another run. I was also concerned as there was a huge gap in months between updates. As it is EA, I decided not to take a chance and refunded.\n\nIf you're interested, I'd say wait until the price is cut considerably, because even with the Steam Winter Sale, I think it is too expensive. Wait until it is under $10 at least.","timestamp_created":1609617373,"timestamp_updated":1609617728,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwoKys4vYCcezqvwI="}
