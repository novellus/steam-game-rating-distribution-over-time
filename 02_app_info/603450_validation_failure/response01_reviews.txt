This game is very basic, it seems like it's a student project game. I don't know if it's a single developer, however it isn't bad. Coop works great, had fun playing with the wife, just is incredibly basic. You can buy all of these guns but I don't see any upgrade options, so the shotguns with very little spread are stuck that way making the assault hard the only real choice unless you go and get the rpg. \n\nI'm playing on hard and she's a pretty new gamer and it isn't that difficult. It's just about right, which is good, but the first boss basically has no obstructions while you easily get caush on the environment, and everything you upgraded in that areaa dissapeared, (upgrading as in you just bought it)\n\nAt its core it's an arcade twin stick. I was hoping for something like SAS Zombies with lots of upgrades and rpg elements to keep you playing for many times, but unfortunately it just isn't there. The story is short, there wasn't any reason to replay, and other modes don't seem appealing because you're just shooting at the same shit over and over, with no real progression.\n\nThe story is not very well written and it very cliche (no asteric) but it works well enough to move things along. Screen shake is nice on heavy guns tho like I said i'm soiled on SAS4 zombies and there isn't a game that does it. I thought this could, looks like it and has all the base gameplay, but no weapon upgrades, no reason to go through a mission again, just play it and you're done.\n\nWhy and I recommending this? Welll, maybe the developer will look at SAS4 zombie and make some gameplay adjustments and see how that flows and see how similar the game is (it's free on mobile devs and online at NinjaKiwi)\n\nI'll be refunding, but I don't think it's a bad game. It's just too simple and i'm looking for something deeper. This wasn't it and was an impulse buy; 99% of the time i''ll keep it but this is just too basic.\n\nThe black screen review is BS as i've not seen it at all and the dev commented immediately on my post on a topic. If they didn't reply it was probably because they went off to FIX the fucking bug. Small teams can't go and reply every five seconds, the people may have regular jobs as well being indies.\n\nSo try it out, it IS fun, but I wanted something like SAS4 and unfortunately hell divers and maybe solstice chronicles are pretty much it. OR sas4. I'd just rather not play flash, and the mobile is so much better but filled with IAP. I hate that, but I love the game and classes.\n\nI'll just have to make the fucking game it seems.","timestamp_created":1504057570,"timestamp_updated":1504057570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469804048538208008","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwraa0mN4Cc/f7gwE="}
