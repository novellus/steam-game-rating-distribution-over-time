    review: 'This is one of the best free to play games on the market right now. Dirty
      Bomb has often been compared to some of its contemporaries like Overwatch or
      Cities: Skylines. However, I would say these games should be compared to Dirty
      Bomb because Dirty Bomb exceeds all expectations for what a game can be and
      is the gold standard for the human expierience. Dirty Bomb can be compared to
      some of the finest art, films, and music ever made. Dirty Bomb is the Boss Baby
      of video games. Maps like Dockyard make this game stand out as a pinnacle of
      gaming and culture. Dockyard is good for sniping because of the long alley-ways.
      I would highly recommend this title to any person.'
