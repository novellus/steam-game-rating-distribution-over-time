    about_the_game: Judgement Silversword is the winner of the &quot;WonderWitch&quot;
      2001 game development contest, and was originally released in 2004.  Designed
      for the WonderSwan Color, Judgement Silversword has the unique distinction of
      being one of the few shooting games designed for a handheld console, and it's
      also one of the best!  Destroying enemies as quickly as possible is essential
      to scoring in Judgement Silversword, giving the game a ruthless tempo.  One
      of indie developer M-KAI's first games, it can be seen as the inspiration and
      predecessor to the gameplay ideas in Eschatos.<br><br>Cardinal Sins puts an
      interesting twist on shoot 'em up gameplay with a score trial marathon spanning
      7 different areas, each with a unique objective themed around the 7 Deadly Sins.  Collect
      lives in Sloth, Hoard enemy data in Greed, and avoid Destruction at the hands
      of Wrath.  Mastering the different objectives gives the game a great sense of
      variety.  Getting an S rank in every trial is very challenging!<br><br><img

    review: So this is where the soundtracks in Eschatos came from. The gameplay feels
      similar too. It makes me want to play Eschatos again. Also has online leaderboard.
