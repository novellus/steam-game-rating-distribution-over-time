Co-op or solo are both viable.  I love the colorful graphics and the music.  However, it's the frantic gameplay, and the way the difficulty ramps up in a way that doesn't just ground you into dust 30 seconds into your first play though.  It's still early access, and a lot of the translations still need to be polished/fixed.  Still, this game is more than worth your time and your money.","timestamp_created":1609985873,"timestamp_updated":1609985873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4xtqo7fYCe7GVwQI="}
