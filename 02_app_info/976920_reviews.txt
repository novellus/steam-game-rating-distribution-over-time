I really enjoyed the characters, Lady Fey in particular I thought was really well written. The voice acting helps bring the story to life, although it was lacking in the parts that involved being drunk.\n\nThe unique twist on a well known story. Even though I knew what was coming in the end (it is, after all, based on history) the ending still managed to surprise and sadden. It was also really refreshing to be involved in a mature story. By mature I don't mean just 18+. I mean, actually mature writing and story.\n\nIt's such a shame that there is much unpolished in the game. I hope this game brings enough money for the studio to release a second game with more focus on polish.","timestamp_created":1609519780,"timestamp_updated":1609519780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51629328727722168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwitq23/YCd8K5vwI="}
