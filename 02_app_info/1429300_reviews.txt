Def needs a day/night system with certain times that you catch certain fish depending on breed and exponentially larger lakes with different biomes/shaded areas that need different tackles/rods to catch different fish. I can for sure see the potential and the Dev seems to be putting out as of right now lots of updates fine tuning the fishing mechanic. I would hope these other things can be implemented in the future to take it to the next level. Also obviously animated fish/maybe fish hopping out of water while you fight it would ad a lot as well! For now I will recommend!","timestamp_created":1605331314,"timestamp_updated":1605386563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4292f5PUCf9mgrgI="}
