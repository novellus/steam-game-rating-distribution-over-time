But they removed the servers, no possibility to selfhost, rendering the game useless and a waste of space. A total pity, I loved this game :(\n\n\nMy previous review:\nIt's like a yes... but no... \nI was unfortunately not lucky enough to be playing this game while it was still blooming,  thriving and had bunches of people online... I've been lucky to meet some really nice senior-players in game to teach me the ropes, and I honestly hadn't expected that I'd be utilizing so many hours in this game but it's really my kind of game... \n\nNow, the reason I'd say YES I RECOMMEND THIS GAME is because despite the fact that it IS DEAD and probably done for when it comes to development for good (Devs seem to not give the slightest fak about this game anymore) is that I still managed to spent 51 hours in it, and I still haven't discovered everything yet, or completed every Taaz! This game is sort of grindy and not for everyone. \n\nPro-list:\n* Cute graphics \n* Much to do\n* Exploration\n* Creative elements (You get to put your artistic input in the world for everyone to see and recreate as everyone seems fit) \n* Everyone is on the same team, so everyone is usually always really nice and helpful \n* Visual upgrades as you level up\n* Skill development as you level up (opens up for more exploring) \n\nNow the CON list which for many can be dealbreakers so I suggest if you really wanna play you should read this first and really consider if you still want to... \n* Game is left halffinished. Quests(\"Taaz'es\") that will never unlock, you're stuck at status quo at some point\n* Not many people are online, and often none at all. It's hard to figure stuff out even using the wiki at times, so you could get bored easily\n* Many tasks can be repetitive in nature, which can be tedious\n* After one has reached level 25, every skill can potentially be unlocked and all you can improve on yourself is your hat... So that can be a bit boring considering the rest of the game is sort of dead\n\nI personally just binge play this by now, but I was pretty hooked when I just started, especially cause I was helped a lot through the confusing beginning phase","timestamp_created":1485542597,"timestamp_updated":1550344613,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.654075205326080322","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yK3v++gCcvLQcA=="}
