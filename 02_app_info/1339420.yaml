    review: "I'm curious about the target audience for this game.\nThe porn is awful\
      \ and unfappable. \nThe puzzles are either too easy, or generated unwinnable\
      \ and you have to restart them until you can finish them (easily).\nThe humour\
      \ is lame and the cinematic looks like a last minute addition. The boy's voice\
      \ during the puzzles gets on your nerves very fast.\nThe art is rather nice\
      \ and it's puzzling to imagine that someone spent their time drawing all that\
      \ crap.\nAchievements are broken.\nThe whole thing can be finished in one hour\
      \ (of which half the time was spent restarting broken puzzles)\nIt runs very\
      \ poorly because it's made with an app development kit and uses javascript.\n\
      \ \nMaybe you can consider it as a counter culture art piece, it's the only\
      \ angle this product would not fail. But then the dev should release more similar\
      \ items to prove he's not just a shovelware peddler.\n\nBut I'm more tempted\
      \ to think this should never have left the appstore it came from.\n\n[h1](follow\
      \ my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url]\
      \ for more retro and indie reviews)[/h1]"
