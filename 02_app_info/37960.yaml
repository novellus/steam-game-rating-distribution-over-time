    review: 'Want a quick, easy to pick up puzzler to fill your time? Then I would
      recommend the Jewel Quest series. I played this series years ago and for some
      reason always have the craving to come back to it every now and again.


      Pros:

      - Super easy to understand and pick up

      - Engaging and offers some challenging scenarios

      - Addictive


      Cons:

      - What you see if what you get. Match up jewels and fill in the whole chart.
      Not much beyond that.

      - Story is nothing to write home about.

      - If you know puzzlers, you will blow through this rapidly. I completed the
      first game in less than 4 hours and the other two took about 8 hours each.


      Overall, I''d recommend it as an older style, simple puzzler that will help
      bridge your bored times. If you are looking for anything beyond that, look elsewhere.'
