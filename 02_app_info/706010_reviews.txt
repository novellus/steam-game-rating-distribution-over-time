The Unseen is a poorly pieced together program with more than enough problems. Instead of doing my usual paragraph format, I am just going to list out several issues I discovered and allow the video to do the rest. \n\n- Uninteractable text that forces the user to hard reset the game just to leave the Video options menu. This also makes it impossible to adjust the settings or ready yourself/quit matches. You cannot even begin a Last Man Standing match for this same reason.\n\n- The maps are filled with terribly placed textures except for the one level that appears extremely similar to the Train Factory level found on the Unreal 4 Store.\n\n- The game continually allows the mouse cursor to click outside the game.\n\n- Sound randomly dies when firing certain weapons and when attempting to navigate the options menu.\n\n- Frame rate drops on the Industry level for some random reason.\n\nI wish I could talk more about possible hit detection or the blinding particle effects on certain weapons, but without other players (no bot support), it is not plausible to properly test. I recommend the developer look really hard on this work. The problems present could have been dealt with during the delays made prior to this initial release, at least the critical one regarding unresponsive buttons. All I see right now is another jumbled up mess of Unreal Engine Store assets, which is a damn shame. Final verdict: no recommendation.\n\nThis has been a EAW PSA.\n\nFollow up point: Above video is the fourth attempt at recording, which is why the game time played is longer.","timestamp_created":1509243379,"timestamp_updated":1509243550,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.606904923915863037","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwk5/7st8CdZPZiQE="}
