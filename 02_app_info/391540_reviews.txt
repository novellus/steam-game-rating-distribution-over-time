I judged games too much by their graphics in 2017, so when I completed Undertale I just sat at my chair and didn't say anything. I was so invested in the characters, the story and everything about this game that I was truly stunned. That is why the game is so special to me. The soundtrack is the best video game soundtrack ever made: every song is catchy and links in with one original song. Words cannot describe how brilliantly crafted this game is: it is disguised as a simple RPG yet hidden underneath is a well thought out masterpiece. There are many routes that you can take in the game, and for me the game never gets old. In conclusion, you should definitely buy this game. It is a gaming experience that will stick with me for a long time, and I highly recommend it to all types of people who enjoy video games. 10/10\nThanks for reading.","timestamp_created":1610123009,"timestamp_updated":1610123123,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k6O08fYCdNHJwQI="}
