It was just what I was hoping for. A fun little game that captures much of the essence of Might and Magic 3, 4 and 5. Most of what I experienced in those classic games is here. While my feelings are overall positive, I did have a few minor quibbles. While the dungeons are rather generic for the most part, they are filled with treasure and enemies alike. Unlike the grid based over world, the towns are simply single screens with icons that allow you to navigate to the usual locales. They get the job done though. There are plenty of characters to interact with and some of the dialog shares the humor of the games that inspired it. There are plenty of quests and side quests to complete. However, the game posed little challenge at the default level. Still the game gave me the nostalgic dose of a bygone genre of games that should still fully exist in my opinion. A little more content in the somewhat barren over world and dungeons would have been welcome. Maybe a secret door or wall here and there to make exploring every nook and cranny a more rewarding experience? A few more ongoing collectible hunts or something of that nature to flesh things out a bit more. Grinding isn't an issue and by the time I finished the game, I surprisingly made quick work of the final enemy. As fast as I completed the game, I enjoyed myself the whole time. Kudos to the creator of this title. An overall solid success! I hope that a sequel is being considered. I've already recommended this game to friends.","timestamp_created":1609879071,"timestamp_updated":1609879071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kaWR6vYCd4DowAI="}
