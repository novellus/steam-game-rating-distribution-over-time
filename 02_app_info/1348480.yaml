    about_the_game: Viking Butchers core gameplay is about collecting as much meat
      as possible and surviving the night. Every night all kinds of animals will try
      to steal all the meat you have stored, so in order to stop them you need to
      fight back. Every night the animals will get stronger, which is why you will
      need to spend some of your meat to buy new more powerful weapons. On the tenth
      night you will need all the skills you've learned in order to defeat a difficult
      boss.<h2 class="bb_tag">Weapons and helmets</h2>In order to better battle the
      animals you will be able to buy new and improved weapons as well as helmets.
      The helmets in Viking butcher act as ultimate abilities that you can utilise
      to give you the advantage over the animals. Both the weapons and the helmets
      have many variations that you can use in order to better combat the increasingly
      difficult animals.<h2 class="bb_tag">Difficulty</h2>Viking offers three difficulty
      settings that fit every type of player. There is easy mode, normal mode and
      hard mode:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Easy mode</strong> is meant for
      new players who aren't very experienced with the game.  <br></li><li><strong>Normal
      mode</strong> is meant to challenge the average player with fun times without
      being too difficult. <br></li><li><strong>Hard mode</strong> is only meant the
      truly hardcore players who love very high difficulty.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Multiple
      maps</h2>Viking butcher features multiple maps where you will battle unique
      and challenging animals. <br>The different maps in Viking Butcher will feature
      drastically different environments where each area has their own special weapons.
      Every map also has its own powerful boss that the player will have to defeat
      and overcome in order to progress.<h2 class="bb_tag">Artstyle</h2>Viking Butcher
      features a retro pixelart artstyle reminiscent classic arcade games. Viking
      Butchers artstyle was inspired by the retro artstyle used in classic arcade
      games and seeks to improve it with our own style.
