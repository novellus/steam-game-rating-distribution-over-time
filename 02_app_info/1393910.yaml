    review: "Great story. Very whimsical and amusing. \nIt should be clearer that\
      \ this is part one of three, but even so it is a very well written story with\
      \ great timings. While it does end on a cliffhanger, it does tie up enough threads\
      \ that it still feels like a complete experience. I look forward to the rest\
      \ of the series."
