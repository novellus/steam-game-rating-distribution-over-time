      [b]edit:[/b] spider and freecell variants got added, so I edited the review.


      [b]nofrills solitaire[/b] (formerly nofrills klondike solitaire) is just that:
      a simple card game for an affordable price, now with [b]1-suit spider[/b] and
      [b]freecell[/b] variants, on top of the original [b]klondike[/b]. the presentation
      is actually a lot better than one would expect and it took a while for some
      of the basics to make it in, but it''s pretty good now.


      while the graphics look too flashy at first, especially for something that claims
      not to have any bells and whistles in its title, it''s a really pleasant sight
      to behold. the music is great too, but unfortunately [b]you have to skip tracks
      manually[/b] when you''ve had enough of a song. it''s intentional and I have
      no idea why. the loops are also very short, so as good as the tracks are, they
      get repetitive really fast.


      windowed mode and volume settings got patched in first, and now klondike has
      [b]1 and 3 card modes[/b] and [b]shuffle[/b], and when everything''s uncovered,
      even [b]auto-complete[/b], skipping some busywork. without shuffle it took me
      about 2 hours to finally win, but that''s in the past. oh, and your wins are
      also shown now in the main menu.


      [b]controls improved a lot with the addition of drag & drop mode.[/b] before
      that single click was the name of the game, one to select a card, another to
      put it where you want it to go, no such thing as a double click. I guess it''s
      down to personal preference whether you like this or the dragging method more,
      but the way clicking works here is a bit problematic because when a card is
      clicked that can go to one of the foundations, it won''t wait for you to choose
      a destination but automatically go there, so if you wanted to move it somewhere
      else, you have to click on it again on the top, then move it elsewhere. on the
      other hand, if you want to send the top drawn card to a foundation, a single
      click won''t work there, so it''s inconsistent as well.


      shortly after release the game was already recommendable with a few caveats,
      but all fixed up and even expanded, [b]it''s a definite two thumbs up[/b], looks
      good, plays well and doesn''t cost much, even though the price doubled after
      the additional game modes got patched in for free for existing owners.'
