    review: 'My first impressions.


      Got surprisingly motion sick on the main menu, due to the embers floating up
      giving me the feeling of falling.


      The king started talking while I was at the other end of the main hall, I teleported
      closer to here him clearer but he got quieter and became so quiet I couldn''t
      here him. When I could here him it sounded like it was coming from the roof.


      The ghost chick said something like "shoot me with any spell" but it would only
      progress if I shot her with the one that does damage.


      when you make it in to the dining room, its not obvious that you are meant to
      kill the little ankle biter.

      (It would be handy for an indicator noise of some sort of animation to make
      it a bit more obvious that you are suppose to deal with it)


      Im unaware if the game goes any further then the dining room. (couldn''t figure
      out the painting puzzle)


      Briefly got stuck in an audio loop from the ghost girl.


      Throughout my 45 minutes playing I had No crashes and NO frame rate issues.


      TLDR: The game is looking good so far just needs a bit of polishing. A few small
      things to make it a little more user friendly would be appreciated.'
