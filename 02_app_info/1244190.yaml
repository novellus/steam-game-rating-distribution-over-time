    about_the_game: Maze Burrow is a Sokoban-inspired puzzle game that involves pushing
      and pulling blocks. Help the echidna escape its maze-like burrow by solving
      puzzles to activate the portal in each level and fight back against the moles!<h2
      class="bb_tag">Timeless Gameplay</h2>Push and pull blocks into matching tiles
      to activate the level portal in over 60 levels of classic puzzle goodness. Use
      your wits to optimize solutions and aim for the lowest scores and time possible.<br><br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Traverse the Burrow</h2>The moles have dug an elaborate
      burrow that contains many obstacles the echidna must overcome. Utilize switches
      and warps to tackle unpassable walls. Traverse through ice and mud, which change
      how the echidna can move blocks. Work with paired blocks, which move in tandem.
      These obstacles are more common as the echidna progresses throughout the burrow,
      and they often combine to create increasingly complex puzzles.<br><br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Boss Fights</h2>Every now and then, the echidna will have
      a run-in with the moles and get a chance to show them who's boss! These unique
      levels add a hint of action to the puzzle-solving done throughout the burrow.

    review: I havent played much on steam but I have spent several hours playing this
      game on the developers other platform; TwitchPlaysPaperMario (you can play this
      game using twitch chat inputs!). The game has a wholesome retro charm with a
      perfect learning curve to its simplistic but eventually maddeningly complex
      gameplay. A real hidden gem! The dev is quick to respond to any requests. One
      of the best indie efforts you'll come across on steam.
