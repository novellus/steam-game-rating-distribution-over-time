    review: "I really liked this and am going to be getting the full game. This demo\
      \ seems to revolve heavily around the odd relligion of discordianism. Each member\
      \ of the world that you encounter has their own perspective, and their soundbytes\
      \ help fill in the story. The setting is very strange, and very intriguing,\
      \ it pulls you in, In terms of mechanics there are various puzzles through the\
      \ demo, mostly involving logic puzzles, or overcoming something. The last stage\
      \ of the game featured a logic puzzle that seems to be missing information and\
      \ therefore required a bit of guessing - but its very possible I missed something\
      \ playing though. I would highly recommend this demo, and I think its really\
      \ great of the developers to have the demo not share any content from the main\
      \ game. \npotential players should note that these screenshots don't match this\
      \ game, but the full game."
