      /><br>Toupei55 is an arcade top-down tactical cooperative tactical shooter experience,
      where you play as US Navy Seals fighting off a gang of brazilian terrorists
      that speak Russian, clearing out procedurally generated tile-based levels as
      you progress through levels and upgrade your character. Damage, reload speed
      and range affect both you and your enemies, while resistance affects only yourself
      and your teammates - giving you ample opportunity to customize the game''s difficulty
      to your personal preference. The game supports up to 5 players coop - 4 controllers
      and one KB/M. You can play it solo as well if you''d like, though it''s not
      recommended.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1417230/extras/store_navy.png?t=1604358976"
      /><br>A top-down perspective coupled with simplistic 3D graphics make the game
      able to run on pretty much any computer you put it on - from your old laptop
      to your grandpa''s Positivo, and intuitive and simple design means gramps can
      even join you in the fight!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1417230/extras/store_baddie.png?t=1604358976"
      /><br>At the start of every level, every player and enemy gets one of four weapons:
      a shotgun, a pistol, a rifle, or a submachinegun.<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>The
      shotgun fires several projectiles at once, but its range, individual projectile
      damage and reload speed are the worst.<br></li><li>The pistol reloads quickly,
      but has range, damage, firerate and range worse than the SMG and rifle. Not
      to say it''s the worst one, but.. it''s the worst one.<br></li><li>The rifle
      has the best range and damage, but its firerate and reload speed are slightly
      slower than that of the SMG. Good for long range combat.<br></li><li>The SMG
      is a good all-rounder - it has middling range and damage, the best firerate,
      and a reload speed between the pistol and the rifle.</li></ul><br><br><br><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1417230/extras/powerups.png?t=1604358976"
      /><br>Upon killing an enemy, you may also luck out and get one of three powerups:
      <strong>point</strong>, <strong>rndwep </strong>or <strong>vest</strong>. The
      vest adds one health point to your character, rndwep re-rolls your current weapon,
      and point gives you a point to spend in the upgrade system, which you can do
      at any point during the gameplay - though reload speed only goes into effect
      when your weapon gets re-rolled, be it at the start of a level or upon grabbing
      a rndwep. The details of the upgrade system can be found in the game''s manual,
      located in the install directory.<br><br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1417230/extras/store_bigbad.png?t=1604358976"
      /><br>Apart from the standard white-shirted baddies, who just use the same weapons
      as you, there''s also the <u>big bad</u>: a brute wearing oversized shoulder
      pads and using a weapon that''s probably heavier than him. He''s tough, rare,
      and his weapon will shred you the moment you walk into its line of fire - but
      at the same time, his rotation speed is slow enough that if the environment
      allows it, you can easily play ring around the rosie with him and shoot him
      without getting hit once. Basically, make sure you see this guy before he sees
      you, or you''ll have a bad time.<br><br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1417230/extras/icon.png?t=1604358976"
      /><br><i>Note: both bad guys'' faces in the game are people that do not exist
      and were generated by a generative adversarial network. If one of them looks
      like you, that''s just random chance. Any similarities to real world people
      is completely coincidental.</i>'
