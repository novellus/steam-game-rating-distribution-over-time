    review: "So I've played this for about a day and first impressions are pretty\
      \ good, but not great.  The Good:  Visuals are nice, voice acting is fantastic,\
      \ story seems interesting (tbd?)  The bad:  Its a standard RNG resource management\
      \ sim that is absolutely punishing if you make a mistake in layout or resource\
      \ management.  My first campaign started me off with 1 node (you do find more).\
      \  Next go had a handful of nodes right at the start and I actually made very\
      \ good progress...  right until my repair centers just couldn't seem to get\
      \ enough resources to actually repair anything...  leaving the factories that\
      \ I needed to feed the repair centers as piles of scrap.  After fighting that\
      \ endless cycle for what seemed like forever a meteor finally put me out of\
      \ my misery and I restarted...  again.  3rd shot - almost no resources, then\
      \ when I started finding them, I had one show up right between 2 factories,\
      \ requiring the tear down of both to  access the resource node.  Of course,\
      \ I did not have the resources to rebuild the factories...  so yeah.  Quit that\
      \ one out of frustration...  4th go resource nodes were so far away that I didn't\
      \ have enough resources to actually reach them.  \n\nSo in short, I want to\
      \ like this game, but if it turns into a \"you have to afk for hours to collect\
      \ enough resources to play\" I'm going to be uninstalling it and regretting\
      \ the 30 bucks it cost me to learn the lesson.  Starting another round now...\
      \  will let you know how it goes.  Giving it a thumbs up for now, will revisit\
      \ if frustration meter breaks."
