    about_the_game: "CastleMiner Warfare is a competitive FPS with modern day firearms.\
      \ It takes place on block based maps that are completely build-able and destructible.\
      \ While playing you can freely switch between build mode and fight mode allowing\
      \ you to build fortifications in the heat of battle. In addition there is a\
      \ free build map mode where you can build your own maps, host and distribute\
      \ them online.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring your battles you will gain points for\
      \ kills and progress through a series of ranks, unlocking new weapons, equipment,\
      \ and blocks to place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur fluid dynamics simulator, simulates\
      \ fire, flammable oil, flowing lava, water, ice, and explosives. These materials\
      \ flow through the map and interact with each other creating interesting challenges\
      \ during battle. Imagine ambushing your enemy by blasting open an oil tank next\
      \ to a fire, and engulfing half the map in flames.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCastleMiner\
      \ Warfare is a direct port of the Xbox 360 title released in 2014. For this\
      \ reason you can still plug your Xbox 360 controller in and play in the exact\
      \ manor that you did back then. For this reason we have left in many of the\
      \ Xbox 360 icons and help screens."
