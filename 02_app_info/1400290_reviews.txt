It didn't took too long to make me feel nervousness. Everything that is related to Japanese legends and their spiritual world, they always transmitted to me that feeling of negativity. \nBizarre atmosphere, grotesque demons lurking and waiting, eerily echoes of pure evilness....\nThis one is similar to Onryo gaming style. Has to do with the urban legend of Hanako-san, including some other Y≈çkai demons!\nEstimated time to complete: unknown hahaha!\nIt depends! If you want to wander endlessly to the long hallways, looking for keys (and there's a lot many keys and rooms) and important objects inside the class rooms, without knowing what may come after you in every dark corner and run with panic later...fine by me! \nFor me that plan didn't stand a chance! My plan B was to watch a walkthrough guide! \nI still kept running with panic but at least i knew where to run lol. Hanako gave me some real scares. I was crouch walking during the whole game hahaha! \nAnd still two different endings waiting for me to enter their terror...\nOnce again Chilla's Art team hold the lead in Japanese horror!\n10/10!!!\n\nLights off! And wear headphones!\n","timestamp_created":1609887184,"timestamp_updated":1609887184,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569879293441772461","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyJ6w6vYCdYXswAI="}
