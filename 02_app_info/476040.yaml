    review: While I can understand a lot of what the other people who reviewed this
      pack are talking about, I myself enjoy this pack. Plus I feel like there should
      be more sprites, like additional monsters and stuff like that, as well as versions
      of this for RPG Makers MV and MZ. Still, keep up the good work on this.
