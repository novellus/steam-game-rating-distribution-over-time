Not even worth the .99 price tag.\nThe barbaric saving system and extremely limited UI will give you a blast from the past, all the way back to the late 90s. I would like to see some of that get fixed, because as I said I believe the game has good intentions.\nThis game is certainly nowhere close to being called \"finished\", and I understand that. However, if the creators do not decide to apply some extra effort to this game, I would not recommend getting it at all.","timestamp_created":1464198523,"timestamp_updated":1464199158,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50653076171875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwj8PE9NQCe9vCWA=="}
