The option to choose a male or female voice, or neither, for your character is an example of the game's quality.  The voice acting isn't perfect, but it's good by HOPA standards. In this third chapter of the League of Light series, the focus turns to problems within the League itself.  In the main chapter, you are tasked with finding and retrieving a colleague who has stolen an important artifact - and she happens to be the League Master's daughter.  In the bonus chapter you must hunt down a spy within the League's own building.\n\n[b]Overall:[/b] Get the whole series, especially if you enjoy a fantasy or quasi-fantasy setting. These are well designed and nicely drawn HOPA games.  I was sorry to discover that Steam only has the first three in the series (the third game indicates there is a sequel).  These games aren't especially innovative, but they're enjoyable.\n\nPros:\n- lovely art and reasonable voice acting\n- good variety or both HO scenes and puzzles (mostly easy/medium, a few challenging)\n- collectables\n- reasonable in-game achievements\n- coherent story that feels at least somewhat connected to prior games\n- good world-building for a HOPA game\n- customizable difficulty level\n- fully interactive map\n\nCons:\n- music is inconsistent (as with the first two games, it tends to play for short periods at a time)\n- minimal reuse of helpful items (i.e., \"why can't I keep that knife?!\")\n\nGood luck, Detective!","timestamp_created":1605411218,"timestamp_updated":1605411269,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.592183470726013184","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mP395PUCevm5rgI="}
