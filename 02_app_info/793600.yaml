    review: "I am a huge fan of beat em up titles, and had been wanting to try this\
      \ one for a while. Now that I have, I can say it was actually a lot better than\
      \ I expected it to be. First of all, the art is really great. There is a fair\
      \ amount of diversity within the enemies. Cheerleaders, jocks, rockers, football\
      \ players, security guards, school mascots, and more will put up a fight! The\
      \ cutscenes are well done too. They are each told in a comic book style scene,\
      \ but don't drag out and get to the gameplay quickly.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty\
      \ standard for a beat em up, though they update your moves the more you use\
      \ them, and a lot of the fun comes from getting gradually more powerful over\
      \ the course of the game. The boss fights were also really fun, most enemies\
      \ having multiple phases before finally beating them in a one on one fight.\n\
      \nI do think this game can improve in some ways. For starters, they force you\
      \ to play in fullscreen, and I would prefer a windowed mode as an option. Finding\
      \ out how to use specials was a bit strange as well because the game doesn't\
      \ explain it. You have to hold down Y then press the direction of your choice\
      \ to make it work. After I learned how to do it, it was easy enough, but the\
      \ information was not well articulated in the game and has caused some players\
      \ to actually get stuck at the tutorial! This game also has a lot of gross humour,\
      \ which is not everyone's cup of tea, so just be aware of that. \n\nThere are\
      \ better beat em up titles out there, but if you want an inexpensive and quick\
      \ source of fun and can handle some roughness, give Bully Beatdown a try!"
