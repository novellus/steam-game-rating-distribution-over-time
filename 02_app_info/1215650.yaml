    review: "Man, I had this game on the backburner for quite a bit. I finally decided\
      \ to pick up the game, and play, after a bit of some bit of time to kill, and\
      \ enjoy some Kemono content on Steam. While the game was overall pretty alright,\
      \ it's far from being bad.\n\n(Because I would be updating my review, and the\
      \ review character limit is dumb, I'll add additional comments in the.. well,\
      \ comments)\n\n Art\nThe art of the game is pretty cute. The main menu screen\
      \ having a uniquely cute forest sprite with a very pretty lighting effect, but\
      \ I wished that would've been the style of backgrounds used for the game. The\
      \ menu art of the game is pretty cool, being a more storybook style. The character's\
      \ designs are pretty simple, which thanks to that does allow for all of the\
      \ background character sprites to be unique from each other without having too\
      \ much details being added to them. In combat, your character sprites are also\
      \ pretty simple, but are animated based on their condition, their stance, and\
      \ their attacks. It's all pretty neat stuff, so it's not just a static sprite.\
      \ The enemy sprites are a bit weird, as they are portraits than sprites, but\
      \ it's not much of a problem outside of that and it does compliment the more\
      \ cutesy style of the game for all the regular enemies, and the boss sprites\
      \ do at least look more menacing in contrast.\n\nThe music of the game is pretty\
      \ nice too. Each of them having a distinct track for certain areas, where they\
      \ won't be played at the same area, save for the battle music. The beginning\
      \ areas first starting as more peaceful, lush and pretty, then later on gradually\
      \ becomes more foreboding and mysterious. The battle musics are all pretty energetic\
      \ and really bombastic, which it does at least help in making the battle parts\
      \ of the game nice to play through. Not much to be said, it's a pretty decent\
      \ soundtrack.\n\n Gameplay\nThe gameplay is pretty simple, but a bit generic,\
      \ and doesn't have too much that really deviates from most JRPG games, sort\
      \ of save for one mechanic in the game. The combat system is pretty simple and\
      \ something that everyone would be familiar with; a usual attack, skill moves\
      \ with varying damage and afflictions and AP moves. The main character (William)\
      \ is your usual ranger class that much deals afflictions with some moves, and\
      \ is balanced. The other character plays like a paladin, a strong damage dealing\
      \ tank with slow speed with the ability to heal.\n\nThe one thing I do like\
      \ about the battles is that they're not static. Even with a regular attack,\
      \ the camera would move and zoom in to the characters and enemies, so to give\
      \ the attacks a bit more impact, which is nice. Some of the stronger attacks\
      \ do show a portrait along with really satisfying effects and a longer animation\
      \ to make the attacks feel really strong and sure the combat feel more dynamic.\
      \ A pretty cool part of the game, even considering its somewhat simple gameplay.\n\
      \nThe enchantment system of the game is a bit more of the smithing mechanic\
      \ in most games, but you're given the choice to upgrade your gear to fit a certain\
      \ playstyle, depending on which items you put in. Each item used would fill\
      \ in a slot, meaning that you have to carefully mix and match to create a semi-build\
      \ from the items you collected, and because you can only fit so many at once,\
      \ and you can't remove them once they're attached, there's a sense of commitment\
      \ to the build that can be made.\n\nIt's a neat idea on paper that helps make\
      \ your characters more stronger on certain areas, which is not uncommon in some\
      \ other RPG games, but in practice it does make kind of put itself in place\
      \ for the lack of weapons and armor themselves. I kind of felt that the limited\
      \ choice of weapons and armor limits the possible builds that a player can make;\
      \ sure the enchantments have pretty tangible differences that actually matter,\
      \ but it does kind of feel like a shame where it doesn't have some unique equipment\
      \ that can further boost a certain playstyle more in combination with the enchantments,\
      \ with the only unique items being rarer accessories. Not a bad system, as it\
      \ is pretty cool, but I do wish to see some unique equipment that allows for\
      \ stronger boosts in certain playstyles. Other than that, it works well, but\
      \ with a bit of extra adjustments, would've been a cool system. \n\nThe exploration\
      \ of the game does work by having you find chests and sparkling areas that can\
      \ give items and unique materials respectively. It does a pretty good job in\
      \ making you look around the area for treasure full of loot, since there are\
      \ times where you could blink-and-miss a chest if not paying attention. Usually\
      \ they would hold onto strong potions, and even some of the rarer items that\
      \ you can't buy from at all, making it all the more rewarding to appreciate,\
      \ with the absence of unique/diverse weapons and armor.\n\nThe story of the\
      \ game is probably the only issue that I ran into in the game. The story itself\
      \ is not really a bad part of the game, but more or less the story plays through\
      \ a fair bit quick, and is short. While I understand that the game is pretty\
      \ small, and it doesn't need to have a long complicated story to be enjoyable,\
      \ but the pace it goes at does make it a little quick, that so it feels a bit\
      \ short. Nothing too bad about that, but it was something I felt was a simple\
      \ story that would've at least be nice if it goes a bit longer. \n\nThe character\
      \ interactions also do feel a bit short, and I do wish that it was a bit more\
      \ fleshed out so we can learn more about the characters. By themselves the characters\
      \ are a bit simple, but the two playable characters do at least have a bit of\
      \ a dynamic with each other, with the young but overly eager, naive and reckless\
      \ adventurer William, and the older and wiser paladin that has to ensure the\
      \ adventurer doesn't risk himself into too much danger. Their interactions are\
      \ pretty cute, where William wonders about what they're interacting with, with\
      \ the other character interjecting with something that would excite, spook or\
      \ have William contemplate about his journey. While I did have issues about\
      \ the story, the interactions from the two as the part of the story looking\
      \ back did at least have me feel the sort of father-son relationship between\
      \ the two, even despite the shortness of the game.\n\nNot sure where I would\
      \ put this part of the review at, but here goes. As a native English speaker,\
      \ some parts of the grammar that can be seen in the game is a bit off in some\
      \ parts, where it's most noticeable in combat, the story parts of the game have\
      \ a pretty comprehensible grammar to at least understand well enough, though\
      \ it is a bit distracting. Definitely needs fixing.\n\n Overall\nWhile it does\
      \ have some minor gripes that does make the experience feel a bit too short,\
      \ and some parts of the story doesn't catch me on as much, some things like\
      \ the combat and its animations, the enchantments and some of the character\
      \ interactions did help make me push into finishing the game, where it got me\
      \ to be able to complete 2 of the 4 endings(still need to get the other 2).\
      \ I love the art and music of the game which could be attributed to my bias\
      \ towards kemono, the gameplay is at least enjoyable to watch(though it might\
      \ get a bit repetitive later on but that can be managed), the exploration feels\
      \ rewarding with stronger items and materials, and the enchantment system being\
      \ a pretty good idea that could be tweaked to be better. Although I'd agree\
      \ the price drop/sale would be nice, 10$ does at least feel like an alright\
      \ price to pay for, and I'd be in to give full price to the indie devs to at\
      \ least appreciate the game.\n\nAnd from what I heard, the game is also going\
      \ to be released on the Switch, so hopefully I do hope that the Switch version\
      \ does fix its English translation of the game."
