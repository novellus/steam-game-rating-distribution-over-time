    about_the_game: Today is a special day. The government decided to make an extraordinary
      and unpredictable experiment. Its objective is to learn how people are going
      to behave and what they will do if given full freedom and thus allowed to do
      just whatever they want for a period of 24 hours. Today, everyone can do anything
      they want. And everyone has been warned that any kind of crime is now considered
      legal, so nobody is coming for help if something bad happens. Some people will
      be hiding from all that madness in their homes, others will get a perfect chance
      to make their dreams come true, and there will be those who will simply try
      to have some real fun. The scene of the game is a little town called Palomino
      Creek. It is all up to you now what you are going to do in the next 24 hours.

    review: 'This game is TRASH. Once the buzzer goes off and the 24 hours starts
      EVERYONE is coming for you, your health and ammo is so low and the physics are
      really bad, you can''t see bullets at all, if you play with headphones you''ll
      notice that all the shooting audio comes out of the LEFT side, that''s it. DO
      NOT buy this game, even though it was only 50 cents on sale, I''m getting a
      refund for it it was so much of a waste of money.


      PLEASE, MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION AND DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, EVER, IT DOES NOT
      MATTER, UNLESS THEY UPDATE IT TO MAKE IT BETTER THIS GAME IS SO BAD IT''S NOT
      EVEN FUNNY, honestly.'
