    review: "EarthNight is an absolutely fantastic runner game, where you skydive\
      \ (spacedive?) though each successive atmosphere, while landing on, running\
      \ across, and slaying massive dragons. You can tell how much love and passion\
      \ was poured into this game from every angle.\n\nEvery run, you collect pieces\
      \ of the dragons, which unlock new temporary power-ups when collected for the\
      \ first time. These power-ups then show up on runs, and you have to collect\
      \ them to get their temporary effects. You can also use your currency, water,\
      \ to buy the power-ups early, if you're finding a dragon too difficult or not\
      \ fun and just want the power-up. You also collect eggs each run. Every dragon\
      \ has 3 eggs, each one makes you do more damage against that dragon on that\
      \ run. Eggs and dragon pieces are also used for upgrading your items and water\
      \ tank.\n\nA very minor negative point would be that not every power-up is helpful.\
      \ There are 2 power-ups that do nothing but make the game harder to see. Sure,\
      \ it's fun that discovering that getting 3 specific power-ups (including these\
      \ two) at the same time makes the screen turns pretty colours, but otherwise,\
      \ I don't see a reason why these are here. Maybe there's actual reasons for\
      \ these to exists, perhaps a secret I haven't discovered, but nevertheless it's\
      \ just kind of annoying.\n\nThe random generation never feels unfair, probably\
      \ because it's got set layouts that are mixed and matched to form the level.\
      \ Each dragon has specific enemies, layouts, and secrets, play this game for\
      \ long enough, and you'll end up mapping out the intricacies of each dragon\
      \ variation. \n\nThis game has a fantastic sense of discovery for a randomly\
      \ generated runner. Each run you'll find little things you didn't know existed.\
      \ An egg location, a new shortcut to a lower atmosphere, or a specific path\
      \ where you bounce along a conspicuously placed row of enemies to find a power-up\
      \ location or egg that you never found before. Perhaps you'll even hear the\
      \ song of a mysterious creature, cradling a single piece of a larger whole.\n\
      \nDid I mention that the art and animation is beautiful, and the soundtrack\
      \ SLAPS? \nSeriously this soundtrack is so good, it reacts to what you're doing,\
      \ have different variations on the same song depends on the type of dragon,\
      \ and even switches between chiptune and a full band version!\nThe art perfectly\
      \ captures the weird creatures that live on the backs of the dragons, while\
      \ also being capable of sprawling landscapes of space, cloud formations, and\
      \ a ruined planet.\n\nEarthNight is magnificent. I made this review right after\
      \ my first win, and I still have more secrets to uncover. Buy it if you want\
      \ something to play while doing something else, or a game to sink into and enjoy\
      \ the atmosphere for a couple hours."
