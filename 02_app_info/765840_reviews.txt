Picking up after the events of the first game, Larry has been dumped by Eve having mistaken their one-night-stand for a real relationship. Now in Los Angeles, Larry heads off on a new adventure after some luck winning a large sum of money and a free cruise. Meanwhile, Larry unknowingly runs into some agents of the KGB and gets involved in an international evil scheme.\n\nAs with the first game in this series, you again control Larry through a text parser as was common for adventure games of the day. This game was first released in 1988.\n\nThe graphics are definitely a step-up from the original game and makes good use of the advancements available during its development to create more environments and more detailed characters. While obviously quite dated by today's standards, it still performs its task well and is enjoyable.\n\nContinuing with the tradition of Sierra On-Line games, this game has some rather difficult and obtuse puzzles, much like the first installment. Many of the puzzles and experiences in this game can often only be solved using trial-and-error. I did find this to be a frustration during my play-through and I did have to resort on a few occasions to looking up hints to get through certain puzzles. This issue is compounded by the fact that it is possible to miss certain items that would render the game unwinnable. Along with the numerous possible deaths, this is definitely a game where saving often is a necessity.\n\nOf course, the reason to play any [i]Leisure Suit Larry[/i] game is more for the story, writing, and humor. [i]Leisure Suit Larry 2[/i] definitely has much less sexual content than the first game instead focusing much of the story and jokes on a truly absurd and unlikely series of events that Larry finds himself in. Unlike the more straightforward goal that Larry sets for himself in the first game, this game is driven more by Larry finding himself in very unexpected situations from being chased by KGB agents to winding up on a tropical island. The story and humor are actually quite enjoyable because these various events gave the writers many opportunities to cram in all sorts of jokes.\n\nOverall, even though I felt the gameplay was rather hit-and-miss with some obtuse puzzles, the writing made this game an enjoyable experience. I would recommend this game to those looking for a classic adventure game with a sense of humor.","timestamp_created":1606010886,"timestamp_updated":1606140241,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xuTa+vUCfIflrwI="}
