For a 4 dollar title, you get a nice relaxing experience that not only has some good level design that will challenge you with the mechanics it puts place, but one that will put you in a zen state of mind, even if you get frustrated. While the biggest problem it has is the games length (which lets be clear, seems appropriate for the 4 dollar price tag), the strong presentation carries the game by making it something you just want to look at, despite the limited color scheme. Mechanics don't stick around for too long before moving on to the next one, and sometimes you do have to think a little outside the box in order to move on in a stage. All in all, if you're looking for something to test your mind but not stress it, 6180 The moon is a solid pick up. \n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfHm0jJ2W2Q\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Solid puzzle elements that introduce new mechanics in a timely fashion. Just as you master the last element, you are introduced to a new one, or a shift in thinking to use it in a new way. \n[*] Great presentation, using the limited color scheme to make it feel.\n[*] Timing is tested here, and its in a good difficulty setting.\n[*] Pleasant piano music really puts you in a relaxed mode. \n[*] The reversal of stages on the way back shows some really good level design understanding and giving a challenges. \n[*] Sound design is good, giving you the little hints you need to react appropriate.\n[*] Animation is fluid. Yes, it's not that difficult to get animation working, but hey, it stills is good. \n[*] The story is touching, even in its simple, cute form. \n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]  Little hiccups with controls here and there on respawn. \n[*]  Story may make you groan at times. It can be too cute.\n[*]  A little short. Would like to see more given the big picture, although to be fair, at 4 bucks, that's asking a lot. \n[/list]\n \n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.
