Really REALLY LOVE THIS GAME. \nbeautiful art, funny interactions btw character. \nAt first, I felt a bit overwhelmed by all new info/lore/politic/etc it threw in my face(especially when you are the type of person...you know, who has to root everything, go to every possible corner to clear the entire surface of the map, read all the codex, ...etc) BUT, its engaging enough to keep you on board....and then you will find yourself in the middle of Raider territory with the crew in no time.\nEvery important scene has a CG, and its not necessarily romantic scene CG. Which I feel is rare in otome games nowadays. and I super appreciate it! This really helps you immerse in the story. \nAaand it has beautiful art. did I mention that already?","timestamp_created":1610061663,"timestamp_updated":1610061663,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4senJ7/YCdcyzwQI="}
