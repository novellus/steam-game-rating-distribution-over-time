    short_description: Wolfsong is a story-rich experience detailing how a simple
      mistake can be the beginning of immense and terrible things. The heroes will
      attempt to stop a great war that could plague the land for generations. Heavily
      inspired by classic rpgs from the snes era and attempts to pay homage to them
      in many ways.

    review: So I just finished this game and absolutely loved it! The characters were
      super endearing and the world is beautiful and fleshed out. I normal start getting
      bored with doing extra exploring and just start moving through the story as
      quick as possible but with this game i really enjoyed slowing down and going
      around the world and interacting with the npcs and finding treasure chest. Also
      I thought the combat system was fun and different enough to be unique. I kinda
      tend to be a hoarder and a tank and spank kinda guy when it comes to turn based
      games, but in this game i felt like the strongest way to fight was also the
      most fun, which isn't always the case imo. Use your strong expensive abilities
      and use mana regen abilities and items to keep going. I do agree with the other
      reviews however about the story ending abruptly. It wasnt even the length of
      the game that was the issue, it was more like It felt like you were just really
      getting into the meat of the story(which i was really enjoying) and the final
      scene kinda feels like the scene where you were supposed to be introduced to
      the final boss. and be like okay this is the guy im suppose to hate for the
      rest of the game, but its the final confrontation. Even still for $1.50 you
      get a bunch of game with endearing characters, a beautiful well built world,
      and fun engaging combat. super worth it if you are into these types of games
      at all.
