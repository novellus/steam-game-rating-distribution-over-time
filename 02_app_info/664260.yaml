    detailed_description: "<h1>About Europe In Ruins</h1><p>Europe In Ruins is a unique\
      \ multiplayer-only persistency mod for Company of Heroes, utilizing a stand-alone\
      \ launcher application, that gives you command of your own company as you take\
      \ them from fresh recruits to battle-hardened veterans. Set during the period\
      \ of Operation OVERLORD (beginning 06 June 1944), Europe In Ruins offers persistent\
      \ cross-battle XP, hundreds of doctrine selections, and an ongoing PvP warmap\
      \ campaign. Decide which of 12 battlefield doctrines to follow, then customize\
      \ your company by selecting from a range of units and upgrades available. Build\
      \ your company one unit at a time by purchasing them with Manpower, Munitions,\
      \ and Fuel resources, and then take your company into battle against other players\
      \ across a wide variety of maps and game modes. Battles are fought over the\
      \ ongoing warmap campaign, as both Axis and Allied forces fight for control\
      \ of Europe!<br><br>Europe In Ruins receives regular updates. We are constantly\
      \ working to develop the mod and to consistently improve our players' experiences.\
