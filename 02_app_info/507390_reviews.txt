I like this game. It was good for the 49 cents it costs right now, but I wouldn't recommend it. The story is short, the text is confusing, and I felt like it didn't really convey the theme it was trying to. It was a cool experience, but very chaotic. I never truly understood what was going on until near the end.","timestamp_created":1609298950,"timestamp_updated":1609298950,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw96bs2PYCe4jUvgI="}
