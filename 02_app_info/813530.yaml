    review: Please update this to work with the frsky usb sim receiver.   It only
      works usb cable direct to radio.  The endpoints of the throttle loops over from
      -100 to +100 when using the usb sim module. Love the game but i don't like  playing
      with a usb cable.  This is for both Freerider games..   Update patch please??
