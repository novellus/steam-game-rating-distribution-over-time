The only thing of fault that I have noticed so early on in the game is that there are a lot of grammatical errors in the game text (spelling mistakes/incorrect use of punctuation) which, if they were resolved, would really improve the feel and quality of the game. It's the only thing that lets this product down because otherwise, it's a really good game and I like it a lot. Another thing to maybe consider would be to add keyboard commands for different actions in the game because I was using the mouse for the first five minutes and then reverted to the keyboard but had to press all the buttons on the keyboard to find out which did what.","timestamp_created":1565799308,"timestamp_updated":1565799308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrqu6yOwCcYys0AE="}
