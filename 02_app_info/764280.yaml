    review: 'This game is not bad at all. It has a the feel of a game you might find
      in an arcade which those are a blast! You are a hero trying to save a mayors
      wife and as you try to acomplish this goal you encounter many different types
      of enemys. You can destroy them with yuor atomic powers. Great game! Still dont
      belive me? Go ahead and check out my video I created on it.
