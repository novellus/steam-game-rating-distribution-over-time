It was my first purchase on a Steam sale, and I thought it might give me a little bit more flexibility when designing games than some of the game engines out on the market. It didn't.\n\nSoon after buying this, two major game engines started putting more free content out there and the tutorials were really helpful. Leadwerks just didn't have the free content or the tutorials to help me to use the engine. It's a shame, because it looks like it can be used to make decent games, but I've had way more success using other engines and haven't been able to even get one room working on Leadwerks.","timestamp_created":1608404212,"timestamp_updated":1608404212,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkpOXvvYCfcXAuwI="}
