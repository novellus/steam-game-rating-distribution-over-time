    review: "If you looking for a new experience and more units and tactics then I\
      \ recommend the DLC. However, we live in islamophobic era and this DLC is far\
      \ from historical accuracy as it shows Salah El Din as un mercyful and barbarian.\
      \ the truth is \"According to Jonathan Riley-Smith, Scott's portrayal of Saladin\
      \ was that of a \"modern [19th-century] liberal European gentlemen, beside whom\
      \ medieval Westerners would always have made a poor showing\". Despite the Crusaders'\
      \ slaughter when they originally conquered Jerusalem in 1099, Saladin granted\
      \ amnesty and free passage to all common Catholics and even to the defeated\
      \ Christian army, as long as they were able to pay the aforementioned ransom\
      \ (the Greek Orthodox Christians were treated even better, because they often\
      \ opposed the western Crusaders).\n\nNotwithstanding the differences in beliefs,\
      \ the Muslim Saladin was respected by Christian lords, Richard especially. Richard\
      \ once praised Saladin as a great prince, saying that he was without doubt the\
      \ greatest and most powerful leader in the Islamic world. Saladin in turn stated\
      \ that there was not a more honorable Christian lord than Richard. After the\
      \ treaty, Saladin and Richard sent each other many gifts as tokens of respect\
      \ but never met face to face. In April 1191, a Frankish woman's three-month-old\
      \ baby had been stolen from her camp and sold on the market. The Franks urged\
      \ her to approach Saladin herself with her grievance. According to Bah\u0101\
      ' al-D\u012Bn, Saladin used his own money to buy the child back:\n\nHe gave\
      \ it to the mother and she took it; with tears streaming down her face, and\
      \ hugged the baby to her chest. The people were watching her and weeping and\
      \ I (Ibn Shaddad) was standing amongst them. She suckled it for some time and\
      \ then Saladin ordered a horse to be fetched for her and she went back to camp.\"\
      \ I do not mind if you want to add some drama to make the game more exciting\
      \ but changing the character completely is un acceptable and shame on developers."
