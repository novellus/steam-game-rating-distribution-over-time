    about_the_game: 'With over 20,000 objects and 1000 separate animations, it will
      take you a long time to see everything at this airport. There is all new lighting,
      airport vehicles running around, new overpasses, trees, airport and road signs,
      cars, taxiways, buses, vans and limousines on the &quot;city-side&quot; of the
      terminals.<br><br>Animations include: aircraft, cars, fuel trucks, catering
      trucks, cargo trucks, cargo loaders, cargo trains, forklifts, portable a/c units,
      mobile stairs, security gates, aircraft, belt-loaders, baggage workers, a couple
      jetways, lavatory service vehicles and workers, baggage cart trains with drivers,
      tractors pulling GPU''s, aircraft, ticket gates, aircraft maintenance workers,
      toll booth gates, etc., etc. And, oh yes, did I mention &quot;aircraft&quot;?
      There are also a few surprises for those in the right place as the right time.<br><br>This
      package also includes Marginal''s excellent Safegate Docking System and automated
      jetways.<br><br>KJFK is completely drivable in your favorite ground vehicle.
      Want to park your car at the 4th level of the Terminal 1 car park? No problem.
      Just follow the road signs to navigate your way around the airport just as you
      would in real life. KJFK also has full working ATC with programmed runway flows
      according to wind direction. Three and a half years and 7000 hours of hard work
      went into making this KJFK as life-like and fun to visit as possible!<br><br><img

    review: 'The installation process is easy: just get opensceneryx and you''re good
      to go. There are other posts that explain how to do it step by step.

      As far as the addon itself, I wasn''t very impressed with it. Doesn''t look
      that different from the vanilla version (I made sure it matches the photos)
      + the terminal train is missing lol. That''s probably the main thing I love
      about JFK and it''s not there.

      My verdict - not really worth paying for.'
