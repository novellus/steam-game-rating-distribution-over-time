This game is the perfect balance of challenging yet rewarding gameplay. The gameplay is simple enough virtually anyone can play and yet certain moments will leave even the most experienced gamer trying their hardest. It also balances the feel of an old-school 8 or 16 bit game with the visuals of a futuristic one. The developer continues to work on DLC and adding to an already great game. Once again I can highly recommend this game and give it a 10/10.","timestamp_created":1534620090,"timestamp_updated":1534620090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6Yefp+UCcvLfqAE="}
