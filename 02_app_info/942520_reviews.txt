I just spent 2+ hours in the level-editor making an awesome labyrinth. I have only played about 5 of the World One levels because I was so eager to make a level. I love level editors and this one is easy to use and robust!\n\nGame Mechanics and performance 10/10:\nFun mechanics, purposefully hard to steer. Many different mechanics that can work together to create some insane moments.\nButtclencher to say the least.\n\nLevel Editor is 10/10:\nLets you use all in-game objects, such as warp-holes, blackholes, switches/doors, lasers, etc.\nNo explicit max size of level area.\nSteam Workshop integration!\n\nFUN FACTOR: 9/10!\nNothing more to say really!\n\nOverall: Recommended for anyone who likes playing around in level editors and anyone who likes HARD platforming and puzzling!\n\nTOTAL SCORE: 9/10.\nBecause even without explicit max size when you make the level 10 times larger than the viewport it can start lagging out a bit. Don't make your own levels gigantic squared basically haha","timestamp_created":1574838828,"timestamp_updated":1574852691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w6Ci1u4CePPP3QE="}
