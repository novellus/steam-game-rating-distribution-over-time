Plays in under an hour...perfect for the sorts of games I enjoy. Replay value because of the impressive quality of the game is high.\n\nSo a big Thank You to the Developers for this great game!","timestamp_created":1605571253,"timestamp_updated":1605575726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu6rx6fUCd4rtrgI="}
