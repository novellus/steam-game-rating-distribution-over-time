    review: 'Great game, the online coop is enjoyable especially with friends; if
      it works that is. At the time of this review I''m at 6.5 hours. Literally half
      of my playtime was just me trying to login with my Uplay credentials so I could
      play on the online servers, but it keeps giving me the "Operation Failed" error.

      Went for Gameranger instead and then I was faced with an infinite gunfire loop
      earrape bug, but I''ve heard that happens on the official online servers as
      well.

      So if you''re looking to buy the game for the online, then be aware that there''s
      a 50-50 chance it may or may not work for you.


      edit: now at 7.6 hours, online still isn''t working'
