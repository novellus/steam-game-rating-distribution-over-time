UI不够友好，在14寸笔记本上字体极小;\n 2. 英文不好的人请远离，需要一定的英文理解，才可以搞清楚各模块作用，感觉不比托福简单;\n 3. 配置要求似乎较高，i5-7200U加940mx很是卡顿;\n 4. 有个bug，在命名了我的世界后，我就不能通过WASD C Space移动了，只能动视角，很是烦人，不知有没有遇到相似问题的朋友;\n\n-----English-----\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic game. The concept is cool and the flexibility is extremely high. I played it for a while but got stuck for following reasons. Since this game is under EA status, players who are afraid of BUGs should wait for a while.\n\n1. The user interface still need to be improved. On my 14 inch laptop, words are too small to be recognized clearly. \n2. Guide needs to be improved as well. I understand that developers want players to explore functions themselves, and pressing Q to see instructions is a really good design. But I think helping a beginner to make a jellyfish is necessary since it can prevent him or her from giving up. So I would like to see how to make a jellyfish right after I learn basic operation, intead of after I press Q in \"Molecule Editor\" and press other several buttons. Also, the notofication of hidden panels in corners are not very clear. Maybe it is because of my 14 inch screen.\n3. The hardware requirement seems to be high. At least, on my i5-7200u+940mx laptop, the game can not run smoothly. I need to wait for half a second after I click every button. I can play it on desktop, but I still hope to see further optimization.\n4. [b]  A BUG!!!\t[/b]. In first few minutes, I can move around with WASD C Space. However, after I name my world, I can't move any more. It causes many troubles when tracking or observing a creature. I am running the game on newest stable WIN10.\n\nThanks again for such interesting game. I am not sure whether it is a right place to report BUGs. I am looking forward to see improvements and I am willing to help the game become better.","timestamp_created":1517731888,"timestamp_updated":1587405911,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.400630474090576172","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4vf6wzPECfL77lwE="}
