The game has quizzes on each planet which let you test your knowledge about the solar system. I'm surprised that this game isn't very popular since its quite cheap and also pretty fun. It would also be a good game for younger kids to play too. Decent game, recommend you buy it.","timestamp_created":1601894120,"timestamp_updated":1601894120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557291626930236816","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwpI+V/PQCdK+ApgI="}
