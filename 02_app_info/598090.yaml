    about_the_game: Absent Mind is the first of many games to come from me, Dylan
      Latham. I am an indie video game developer and this game was made by me alone.
      Absent Mind is a game that tells a story about the life you lived before death.
      It leaves clues about your past in a hospital that acts as the bridge to the
      afterlife. The story is supposed to be left to the imagination while being fueled
      by these clues at the same time. This is a horror game, but it is more of a
      puzzle game with a horror element. You have to look around the hospital and
      look for things that aren't quite right. Sometimes you have to look closely
      to see a beer bottle in a plant vase, or it could be obvious like a trashcan
      that doesn't belong on the wall.<br><br><u>Key Features:</u><br>- A &quot;spot
      the difference&quot; puzzle aspect<br>- An element of horror<br>- Atmosphere
      of an abandoned hospital<br>- Semi-Realistic graphics<br>- A story told through
      clues<br>- A demon lurking in the halls

    review: I read the game reviews and thought that it could not be that bad, but
      it is quite disappointing. The game concept seems fine, the artwork is nice
      as well, but the game has technical issues which nerved me. I had to switch
      to low quality graphics and I barely could see some key objects which were needed
      in order to advance in the game. The grassy room part seems to be bugged as
      well, as I did everything I could but the puzzle was never solved. I bought
      expecting some good indie game to relax and now that I played it I am even more
      stressed. I would love if the game were fixed so I could finish it :(
