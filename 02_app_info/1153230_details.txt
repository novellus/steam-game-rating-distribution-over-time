The village's half-ruined temple of Law, dilapidated inn, drunken blacksmith, exiled trader and a few fur-trappers are enough to keep the bloody-minded denizens of the dark forest at bay, but nobody really expects the village to still be there in another ten years. The woods have become too dangerous for the trappers who once caught animals for fur, and merchants no longer travel the poorly-maintained road because of bandits. None of the nearby barons are willing to accept responsibility for the village, because the one and only attempt that was ever made to subdue this part of the wilderness, a patrolling troop of knights and soldiers, completely disappeared in the forest without leaving a trace.

Other GMs enjoy playing the game but prefer to use pre-prepared modules like this one. This adventure is a good introduction to running a Fifth Edition adventure even if you never plan on using a published adventure module again. One tip to start out with, though.
