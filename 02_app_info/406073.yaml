    review: "Perhaps not reccomend is rather harsh, but it is justified, allow me\
      \ to explain. \nTile sets A are fine. The walls and floors are fine, what is\
      \ the issue are the objects. None of the objects in B or C are scaled correctly\
      \ for VX Ace's engine. It isn't even meerly an alignment issue, to make any\
      \ of the desks usable (so there isn't a massive invisible forcfield stopping\
      \ characters from getting within several feet of them) I've had to mannually\
      \ edit them in ClipStudio using a custom tile set template. This has taken many\
      \ monotonous hours that shouldn't be nessicery for a \"finished\" product. I\
      \ would expect this is this wasn't being advertised as an VX Ace product and\
      \ therefore it could be optimisation issues between versions, but it is, and\
      \ therefore the tile sets should work from import. \n\nNow I haven't asked for\
      \ a refund because much like with the A sets, the painting and the actual artistry\
      \ of the sprites is very good, much better than what I personally could acomplish\
      \ not being a sprite artist, and have enabled me to begin testing of my idea,\
      \ they're just not scaled or aligned correctly. Which is very frustrating, having\
      \ to manually correct them, but more acomplishable than trying to recreate the\
      \ tiles I wanted from scratch. \n\nIn conclusion, unless you're okay with spending\
      \ \xA35 on something you will need to manually edit yourself before they're\
      \ usable, then go ahead, if you are expecting to buy, plug in and play. Save\
      \ yourselfs the disappointment and look elsewhere. Only would 100% say go for\
      \ it if it was in a sale for a fraction of the price."
