    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag"><strong><u>Survive or Thrive</u></strong></h2><br><strong>Crikey,
      mate! You shouldn't be out here all on your own! There's big MONSTAS' out here!
      Do you really think you've got what it takes to survive? Or do you think you're
      cut out for much more than that... You don't think you could actually... THRIVE...
      do you? Besides... It's not always the big, scary beasts that you should be
      afraid of...  Beasts are easy to predict. They just want to kill and eat ya!
      Humans are much harder... They pretend to be your friend first...<br><br>What
      is <u> Survive, or Thrive? </u> Well, in essence, <u> Survive or Thrive </u>
      is a survival simulator. It's our way of reading the feedback players have left
      for us on our previous titles such as The Test, The Horrorscope, and The Confession,
      taking their words into heavy consideration, and creating new experiences that
      players want! Everyone imagines being trapped in a zombie apocalypse... Everyone
      thinks about surviving on a desert island at one point or another... But how
      many people would actually cut it? How many people would actually survive, how
      many would die, and how many would thrive? Well, this simulator asks you a series
      of questions, and through your answers, will let you know what survival situation
      it believes you'd excel in! Would you survive being kidnapped by a serial killer?
      What if you were stuck in the caveman days, would your bloodline continue on?
      Stranded in the ocean? Earth overrun by robots? Would you Survive, or would
      you Thrive?<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong><u>Features:</u></strong></h2><br><ul

        suitable for all viewers, such as text-based zombie-killing reenactments or
        text-based dangerous or criminal situations such as kidnapping, murder, and
