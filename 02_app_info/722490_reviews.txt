Also I am done buying anime on Steam.  Several times now I buy something and then within days it comes out on a different platform with the English dubbed version.  The dubbed version should alway be offered if available.  For the so called purist who want to watch the subbed version they can switch the settings (just like on a Bluray) and everyone is happy.  I don't even know if the show is good yet and Steam has pissed me off on 2 acounts (censored version not mentioned and cheaping out on subbed only version).  I'll pay a little extra for the dubbed version.  Figure out how to win me and my money back Steam!","timestamp_created":1531733036,"timestamp_updated":1531733036,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvumZ0eQCdLGWpgE="}
