      crossorigin="anonymous"/><br>Psychoballs is a single player puzzle game, where
      you try to eliminate all the spinners on the board by making them contain four
      balls of the same color at once. Balls travel down given paths around the board,
      and get caught by a spinner if an available slot is facing them. Spinners are
      the only parts in the game that can be controlled directly by the player. Players
      can rotate the spinners clockwise, and can release any of the captured balls
      into the pipes to move them to other spinners. The goal of the game is to move
      the different colored balls between the spinners in order to get four balls
      of the same color in any specific spinner. This straightforward task becomes
      more and more challenging with the addition of new gameplay elements over the
      course of the game.<br><br><img src="https://media.st.dl.pinyuncloud.com/steam/apps/801840/extras/description_feature.png?t=1588687833"
