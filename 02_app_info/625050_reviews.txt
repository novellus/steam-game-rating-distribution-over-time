Gives you the options of increasing patriarch authority by 5 OR losing 5 patriarch authority, but gaining some other short term benefit.\n-Once you have 10 patriarch authority you can activate one of 5 icons, which awards you a 20 year benefit. \n-Increasing patriarch authority: Increases missionary strength, lowers unrest, and increases manpower. \n\nConclusions:\n-Basically this DLC makes Russia much harder to defeat in war. They have a huge army+reserve of manpower, and it's easier for them to suppress rebels. You must stop Russia early game. The only success I've had mid-late game is having 2-3 great powers on my side, and even then it's a slog. \n-On the positive side, it's great for smaller Orthodox nations. \n\nFinal Verdict: \n-Get it at half off if you want to play as an Orthodox nation, otherwise it's not worth it and you can leave it turned off.","timestamp_created":1561950730,"timestamp_updated":1609544949,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40NuW4PYCfKWJyQE="}
