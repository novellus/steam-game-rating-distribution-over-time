    about_the_game: "Zball is a physics puzzle game. The goal is always the same -\
      \ deliver the green ball to the green platform, but the ways change. Blocks\
      \ can have different properties, some are destroyed when colliding with other\
      \ objects or from an explosion, some are monolithic but mobile, some moves the\
      \ green ball.<br><br>Usually there is no specific algorithm of actions, you\
      \ should rely only on your intuition to solve the problem. Every new level is\
      \ more difficult. Some require dexterity and reaction, some will require patience\
      \ and caution, others will make you think about the sequence of actions. You\
      \ can see how to interact with an object by the color of the block. For example,\
      \ green is the main ball, and you need to deliver it to the platform of the\
      \ corresponding color. Yellow reacts to explosions from mouse clicks. Blue objects\
      \ are destroyed when they collide with yellow ones. Blue ones are not destructible,\
      \ but they can be moved by yellow objects. Red breaks down from the explosion\u2026\
      \ Gradually you will understand how the system works and will be able to pass\
      \ all levels<br><br>Exciting gameplay will not let you get bored! To the victory!<br><br><strong>Game\
