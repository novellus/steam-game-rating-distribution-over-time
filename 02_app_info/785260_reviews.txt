All-Stars Racing Transformed, while dead in multiplayer, has enough single player content to make it worth the purchase, and is a much, much better game. This game has almost no redeeming qualities and probably isn't even worth it on sale.","timestamp_created":1609797852,"timestamp_updated":1609797852,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtrvb5/YCeYTDwAI="}
