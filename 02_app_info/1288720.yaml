    about_the_game: "War of Velana is a single player 16-bit RPG that combines world\
      \ exploration and interaction with an orthographic grid-based tactical battle\
      \ system. In many ways, War of Velana is in many ways a spiritual successor\
      \ to the Shining Force series on the Sega Genesis. Elements of those games are\
      \ the core, and combine with some design ideas from Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy\
      \ Tactics to create a new tactical experience. In War of Velana, your characters\
      \ have static classes and gain a variety of skills and equipment upgrades as\
      \ you progress through the game. In between combat, you\u2019ll be able to explore\
      \ and interact with the world around you.<br><br><strong>Setting:</strong><br><br>The\
