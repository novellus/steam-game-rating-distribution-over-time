The amber lighting inside the drivers cockpit really makes it feel like the 60’s and the driving mechanics take some getting used as they feel old but right for the era that it’s based in, this makes me appreciate how far technology has gone since the 60’s. I would recommend this track for people who enjoy historical experience.","timestamp_created":1609406142,"timestamp_updated":1609406142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw45qF3PYCfLGGvwI="}
