    review: '[h1]An Underrated Indie Gem[/h1]


      Firework is a Megaman-inspired action platformer that feels polished and responsive.
      It has a few interesting ideas (particularly the way the weapon functions, some
      of the boss designs, the fire effects and shard system) and uses a lot of established
      mechanics fans of the genre will be immediately familiar with, such as gaining
      abilities from bosses. The gameplay is on the short side at around 2-3 hours
      but is a bargain for the very low price.


      Areas where it could improve include the writing (there''s some awkward phrasing
      and a few spelling mistakes) and the controls (wall climbing could use a little
      work, as could the direction of dashing when using an analogue stick) but these
      feel like relatively minor points in what is otherwise a very strong game.


      Overall, Firework has a lot of heart and really feels like it was made with
      passion. I''m hopeful that more people take the time to experience it as it
      deserves way more attention.'
