      \ /><br><br>Galaxy Combat Wargames is a multiplayer PvP space shooter that engages\
      \ you in challenging and intensely competitive space combat matches against\
      \ other fighters from around the world. Face-to-face battles put your maneuvering\
      \ skills to test; where you employ your reflexes on evasive actions to avoid\
      \ bullets and deadly missiles; and you carefully choreograph attacks intended\
      \ to destroy the opponent before they destroy you. <br><br>Your spacecraft is\
      \ equipped with deadly weapons to destroy the opponent and their base. Fighters\
      \ with better combat skills and maneuvering strategy earn wins and rewards to\
      \ reach higher ranks in the force. Galaxy Combat Wargames offers a thrilling\
      \ space combat experience with intuitive fun controls and third person camera\
      \ that shows a true and immersive head to head view in 3D. <br><br><img src=\"\
