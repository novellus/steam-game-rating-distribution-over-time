I put in a ton of time with the 2018 version and it was refreshing to start this year's version and see that the computer is tougher - the opposing WRs don't drop so many wide-open passes and the computer controlled teams seem to show no mercy if they get a lead. The only suggestion I would make is to bring back Hollywood Sports! :)\n\nUpdate - I have never seen a game have so much difficulty with gamepads. You can literally play the game for a couple days, changing nothing about your gamepad setting and then come back and see that it won't accept input from the gamepad any longer. (Well, it will take a button to get off the splash screen, but anything AFTER that doesn't work.) So frustrating, so completely frustrating. It's still a good game, but Christ do I have a million other things to do than chase gamepad issues with this franchise every month.","timestamp_created":1593611418,"timestamp_updated":1606688419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498764663934707642","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y/WFi/YCd5/2kQI="}
