    review: GW started as an arcade mini-game which you could find in your garage
      in Project Gotham Racing 2, so I mostly bought it because of that nostalgia
      feeling. This version is improved, they added music, new enemies and a grid
      which breaks in the direction you shoot. The longer you play the more difficult
      the game gets, kinda simple. If you like asteroid-type retro games then give
      this a try.
