    review: This game is well compared to Angela, Amber and Emily games this is very
      slow, achievements are way too hard, new minigames aren't clear enough at least
      to me to understand. Even walktrough guide doesn't help me with some tasks to
      complete them. It's a shame because the other series were so good. But this
      one I can't personally recommend.
