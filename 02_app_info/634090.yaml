      the world of <i>Interia</i> and save it from being thrown into darkness. <br>Defeat
      hordes of enemies, from foot soldiers to mighty dragons, to make your way through
      a mysterious tower that appeared out of nowhere. Discover its secrets and stop
      the evil <i>Scak</i> from accomplishing his plan that would seal Interia''s
      fate.<h2 class="bb_tag">General Gameplay</h2><i>Suncore Chronicles: The Tower</i>
      mixes several genres to give a fresh and unique gameplay experience. Beside
      classical action adventure elements like puzzle solving, minigames, combat and
      looting in a third person setting, the game also includes several other gameplay
      elements. Those involve platforming sections with 2D movement or &quot;Beat
      em up&quot; styled levels, which are influenced by the good old console or arcade
      classics.<h2 class="bb_tag">Combat System</h2><i>Suncore Chronicles: The Tower</i>
      has a fast paced realtime combat system, focussing on dodging enemy abilities,
      crowd control and using your strong abilities if the timing and positioning
      allows for it. The numerous bosses require the player to figure out the mechanics
      and timings to be able to succeed. The game also includes special dungeons meant
      for group play, which can require a whole group of four players to coordinate
      their actions in a reasonable way.<h2 class="bb_tag">Specializations and Skills</h2>The
      player can change between four different specializations at any time in the
      game, which include two melee classes and two more range oriented caster classes.
      Each class has their own abilities, which can be learned throughout the game.
      Abilities can be leveled up to increase their strength and add additional perks.
      In addition, each class has a specific strength like inceased health or a higher
      chance to perform critical strikes.<h2 class="bb_tag">Equipment System</h2>Each
      enemy in the game can drop loot of different kind and quality, including armor,
      weapons, materials for upgrades, runes, recipes for runewords and more. <br>The
      player can save all of his equipment in sets, which (like the specialization)
      can be changed at any time to fit the current play style. High quality pieces
      of equipment can modify player abilities, proc certain effects or even form
      powerful sets.<h2 class="bb_tag">Development Philosophy</h2>The base version
      of the game is free to play, allowing the player to get to know the main features
      and feeling of the game. However, the world is restricted to the starting areas,
      including two tutorial sections and the first world regions. The game will be
      extended frequently with low cost DLCs that include new features and add more
      regions, enemies and of course loot.<br><br><br>For optimal experience, it is
      recommended to play with a gamepad.'

    review: 'So far I like the game, the graphics/environment is great looking. The
      UI is great very simple and clean. The controls are terrible and if they fixed
      that it''d be awesome! So far I''ve completed the starting area but it was very
      frustrating figuring out all the controls and how to change them, if they just
      implemented a simple hit ESC key and navigate with your mouse cursor it''d be
      great but it''s very annoying but I gave it some time! Also as a game design
      student myself I loved the fact it was made in Unity! <3


      You can check out my starting area gameplay here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UerJTwKIv1s&t=9s'
