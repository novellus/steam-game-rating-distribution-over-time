Sure its a little dated but that doesnt make it a \"bad\" plane. It looks pretty good actually just not as good as by todays standards. However on sale I feel it was worth the purchase. \nIt isnt a fast plane but it will cruise better than a Skyhawk or Archer at about 140+/- depending on load and of course a bit more when east bound. It feels like I think it should but to be fair ive never actually been in a real world version. \nyou get 3 liveries and one blank white, so not much to get excited over there. At any rate I like this little low wing.","timestamp_created":1575160743,"timestamp_updated":1575160743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xbC53+4Cfsux4AE="}
