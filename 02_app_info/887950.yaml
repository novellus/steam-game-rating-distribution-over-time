    review: '[h1]Short version: 71%[/h1]

      Danse Macabre 4 features jaw-dropping art and an exciting murder mystery that
      brings us to the world of figure skaters and love drama. As a game though, it
      is both effortlessly easy and annoyingly tricky.


      [h1]Long version:[/h1]

      Danse Macabre 4: Thin Ice has a strange duality. From a certain aspect, it is
      easy as the chapters are short and compact, the adventure segments are fair,
      and the puzzles are varied.

      However, the hidden object scenes can be annoying with their similar-looking
      items, cluttered space, and their tendency to use several lists per screen.
      They are entertainingly challenging yet drag on uncomfortably long.


      As usual for this series, we come here for the story. We investigate a new art-related
      murder, namely, the death of several people associated with a famous figure
      skater. As we progress, the mystery deepens and the body pile increases, giving
      us a sense of urgency few HOGs can bring.


      Sure, this is still a HOG and limited by its genre, but as far as casual crimes
      mysteries go, Thin Ice will be among the more memorable and high-quality ones.
      It is just the bonus that as an Eipix product, it also has plenty of content
      to make up for its price tag.'
