    review: "Greetings!  Today we will be looking at \u201CGrim Penance\u201D a small\
      \ DLC that includes a new priority assignment.  It\u2019s only $3 but is it\
      \ worth a purchase?  Let\u2019s discuss.\n\nI\u2019m so Sorry:  This is another\
      \ priority assignment, which include another series of themed missions that\
      \ you could encounter through the normal random assortment, like the others\
      \ not even the voice overs are unique.  As the previous ones I enjoy the choose-your-own-adventure\
      \ style story but this one is really lacking in the rewards department.  The\
      \ previous ones include unique Tarot Cards or character cosmetics, this one\
      \ comes with a hub cosmetic that is basically braziers in the far corners of\
      \ your mission hub area (where you talk to the NPCs).\n\nIf I\u2019m being honest\
      \ the cosmetic rewards are very lacking, they appear to the far corners of the\
      \ hub and you basically never notice them unless you look for them.  Additionally\
      \ the rewards aside are lacking but the story is unique as always.  Ultimately,\
      \ I\u2019d avoid it unless it is on sale and you want to complete your set or\
      \ it is just part of a bundle.  Enjoy!"
