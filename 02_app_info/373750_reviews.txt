It's a real challenge to actually make it though the first winter. This game makes hunting much more dangerous, much more realistic and very rewarding. If you manage to hunt something down or even manage to scavenge off a creature killed by something else, then you are set for quite a while. The game actually feels like that history channel show \"Alone\" where they send 10 folks out into the wild and see who can survive the longest and win that $500k.","timestamp_created":1606878047,"timestamp_updated":1606878072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwzLHZkPYCeK/UtgI="}
