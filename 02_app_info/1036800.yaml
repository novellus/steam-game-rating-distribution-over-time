    review: 'i left one review before and i don''t feel i served this game justice!

      i left a negitive review because the game didn''t work for me

      but its not bad top down resident evil shooter type game

      what this game needs is better english support, a exit button controller support,
      a save menu, option menu

      please fix this game'
