    review: 'pros:

      -clicking on heads is fun i guess

      -cool scenery and wide open levels


      cons:

      -stealth is unintuitive and often feels broken, either in your favor or against

      -sensitivity gets lowered when you aim, i''d rather it didn''t but there''s
      no way to change it

      -enemies can suddenly become aimbots from a quarter mile away or shoot you through
      walls

      -the other reviews weren''t lying, there really do be a huge difficulty spike
      in the late game. even on Medium difficulty it feels way too unfair, and having
      to cheese even the most basic of encounters is not fun

      -shallow plot with cheesy cutscenes and voice acting'
