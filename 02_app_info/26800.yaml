    review: "This is one of the best game's I have ever played, and my favorite puzzle\
      \ game of all time.\nThe puzzles are really good, while some are exceptionally\
      \ hard. That's exactly what you want from a puzzle game: challenge and innovation.\
      \ \n\nThis is *the* game that utilizes time-manipulation mechanics to their\
      \ fullest, while others can only do time re-wind.\n\nEven the art style is spectacular.\n\
      \nThe \"Hidden Content\", as well as the story underlying it all, which you\
      \ don't really get from the get go, blows your mind."
