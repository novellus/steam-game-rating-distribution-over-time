    review: "Very simple tactics game, pause, aim team at enemy, un-pause, repeat.\
      \ Fail to respond with pause fast enough, fail.\n\nThere's some pseudo-replay\
      \ value in the fact that the city and each mission location is random-generated,\
      \ but unfortunately most of it feels identical no matter how theoretically random\
      \ it was; there really just isn't enough variety to support it being random.\
      \ The game probably would have benefited from being more hand crafted. \n\n\
      The biggest downfall is that the game is not balanced at all. Starting areas\
      \ are super easy with almost no challenge, but the game almost immediately ramps\
      \ up into super hard as it plops down random high level areas with massive zombie\
      \ swarms far beyond what your little squad can handle. Other poor design issues\
      \ creep up as you will fail pretty quickly if you were not lucky enough to get\
      \ extra survivors early on or the fact that stores to buy things are not only\
      \ rare, but vanish entirely if you try to secure the zone they are in. So to\
      \ use a store more than once you have to leave a gaping hole in your secured\
      \ path. There's also no guarantee you'll find enough loot to actually make progress\
      \ and your carrying capacity is terribly small even if you do.\n\nIt's not a\
      \ terrible game and it's cheap enough that if you want to mess around with a\
      \ squad-tactics rogue-like you might find some fun with it, but trying to finish\
      \ it is a lot of frustration and repetition. $3 is pushing the limits of what\
      \ it's worth, but it's often on sale for cheaper or tossed into bundles.\n\n\
      I think I paid $1 for it on sale, and I did get some hours out of it, so it's\
      \ cheap enough to still give a thumbs up despite the flaws.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While\
      \ you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want\
      \ to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]"
