The small amount of reviews and one total walkthrough online do not reflect the game’s quality. In silver grapple, you play as a janitor in a scientific research building where an earthquake occurs.  it’s your job to round up any other survivors and make your way out of the building. The main mechanic is the grappling hook, which allows you to swing on certain walls. The momentum of this feels amazing, playing this game makes you really feel like Spider-Man. This game reminds me a lot of Celeste. One very simple concept, but used in many very clever ways with new mechanics in each area. It’s also really hard (I died like 4500 times over the whole game), but you restart at the beginning of each area like Celeste, allowing you to get right back into the action. What silver grapple does differently, is that it’s a metrodivania. There is a big focus on exploration, and gaining upgrades to use in previous areas. A lot of the game is fairly linear platforming, but unlocking things and having to go back made me feel smart. I really liked getting a new upgrade, getting to experiment with the controls of the new mechanic, and then go back to where I remembered needing it earlier. It keeps the game fresh, but still keeps the focus on the grappling hook. On the other hand, this brings in one of my gripes with the game: there’s no way to mark the map. Many times I found things to go back to, but I had no way to remember where they were. This made me heavily reliant on the one walkthrough that exists. Another thing that made exploration difficult is that sometimes it’s hard to tell if certain elements are in the background or not. More than once, I consulted the walkthrough only to find out the next place I had to go was a door in a room I had already explored but didn’t see because it was a black door over a black background. Also the map is incredibly expansive, which makes backtracking tricky. But overall, these issues were minor compared to my enjoyment throughout the rest of the play though. The game also has a pretty interesting story (at least for what it needs to be, it does take a backseat to the gameplay.) There’s an interesting twist, two different endings, and even a side romance. You get to learn a lot more about what’s going on with the plethora of notebooks you can collect, which are a fun distraction. All this together, makes me really sad for the creator. Because it’s clear he put a lot of love into this game, but it didn’t get a lot of attention. Apparently I have 16 hours logged into the game, but some of that might have been when I left the game on to look up a walkthrough. If you like Celeste or even just tough platformers I would highly suggest it.\n\nAlso, here’s how to get the good ending because I found that no one discloses that information and you’d have to play the entire game over again if you wanted to get it: [spoiler] When Zach says he needs to go and find someone, you need to save the person he goes to find [/spoiler]\nIf you would like to know where that is, look here: [spoiler] In the hospital, you go into the door with the cross above it. Then you go into the room with the elevator and take it down. You’ll need the red, yellow, and blue keycards to open doors, and then you’ll come across that character.
