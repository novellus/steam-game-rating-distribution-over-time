    reviews: "\u201CIt\u2019s great value, and I feel it really adds a different focus\
      \ to the familiar places in the game. Whereas before, you\u2019d be idly driving\
      \ along, sure of what you could manage, Special Transport adds a certain apprehension\
      \ to looking at your truck\u2019s GPS, wondering when that chill straight line\
      \ will veer into tight turns and bottlenecks, and wondering if you will be able\
      \ to squeeze through, or end up paying a bucket-load of fines for unintended\
      \ collisions with things.\u201D<br>4.5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://geeksyndicate.co.uk/games/game-review-american-truck-simulator-special-transport-dlc-pc/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Geek Syndicate</a><br><br>\u201CAnd finally,\
      \ we now get the amazing Special Transport DLC for ATS. Something that ETS2\
      \ players have been playing for a few months already, it now makes its way across\
      \ the pond. It's not for the faint of heart as the cargos are also much heavier,\
      \ they are also much longer and much wider, making it very difficult to maneuver;\
      \ it's why the escort vehicles are there. It's quite a bit more difficult then\
      \ any other cargo and any kind of damage will ruin a perfect delivery, all the\
      \ road must be used when making turns and driving on back roads. Overall a very\
      \ well done DLC, just as SCS has done in the past.\u201D<br>8.3/10 \u2013 <a\

    review: "This is supposed to be the peak of truck delivering, it can't get much\
      \ harder then this. I played it on ets 2, but still it is a big challenge to\
      \ turn into corners without clipping the trailer, but after getting used to\
      \ it, it is pretty easy to do 0% damage and deliver them safe. \nI would recommend\
      \ this to people who can easily transport regular deliveries without any problems.\n\
      To those who are still new to the game and have trouble in regular deliveries\
      \ I would say, it will be way too hard for you, but still you can try it. I\
      \ mean seriously on this game I had to deliver a house xD like for real a house\
      \ was on my trailer, (Turnkey House Construction) I could barely look behind.\
      \ \nOverall. I would say give it a try."
