    review: Super preachy. No actual history of the Mohr laws, which were the reason
      the south pushed for the constitutional convention where the 3/5th copromise
      was devloped. The Moore / Morh (Can't remember the spelling of the guys last
      name, which the group of laws were named after.) This is just a white plantation
      owners are evil monsters and there was.is no other reason for the war:( Yup,
      lets make an incredibly complicated war down to what was a war cry from the
      North in the 3rd year. Slavery arguement was that a rally cry, because the North
      was losing interest in the war and the sentiment was devloping just let them
      leave. The war was suppsoe to only take a few months, which as we know it didn't,
      whoever wrote this really needs to bother learning history beyong elementry
      school teaching if they are going to make games like this.
