The application that you launch from steam is more of a UI for the program, the actual functions run on the service meaning you don't need to worry about starting it from steam every time you boot your pc.\n\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend it to any sysadmin with a network they want to keep safe, but for the every day user this is a bit over the top and not worth the price. If you are not sure why you'd need this I recommend getting something like malwarebytes for your home network instead of this - this does not protect your home network, it's more of a tool to help you protect it yourself.","timestamp_created":1574953821,"timestamp_updated":1574953821,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tISk2e4Cf9nu3gE="}
