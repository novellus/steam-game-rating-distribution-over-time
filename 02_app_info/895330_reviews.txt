However, there are a lot of levels, some of them being challenging enough that you will have to try a few times before resolving them. The other ones are pretty easy.\nIn the end, nothing fancy, but the core game mechanic works well. This puzzle game is enjoyable to play and I would recommend it if you have a couple of hours to spend.","timestamp_created":1602965106,"timestamp_updated":1602965106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1c2KnPUCeb++qAI="}
