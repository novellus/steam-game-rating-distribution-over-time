    review: "Greetings!  Today we\u2019ll be looking at the Cosmetic Pet DLC \u201C\
      Monotask Servo-Skull\u201D which is a little servo-skull (flying skull robot)\
      \ that follows you around when summoned.  This is similar to the cherubs and\
      \ other non-combat pets you get in the game.  Is it worth it?\n\nYou will Serve:\
      \  Like the other cosmetic pets this flies around annoying some NPCs but doing\
      \ nothing else.  No voice lines or mechanic changes and gives you no buffs of\
      \ any kind.  Nothing much to note here as it is more for flavor and atmosphere.\n\
      \nThis is my favorite cosmetic pet that I have access, though there are that\
      \ I\u2019d prefer of course I haven\u2019t unlocked them yet.  I\u2019d recommend\
      \ this if you feel you need something flying nearby but you probably won\u2019\
      t be missing it not being there.  Enjoy!\n"
