    short_description: You are a new recruit aboard a trade ship, set to make a standard
      route. However, things go wrong and the ship gets lost in space. You will need
      to build rep with your crewmates, make hard decisions, and avoid organized gangs
      operating in space in order for you and your crewmates to get through this.

    review: 'The story and puzzles are great, but influences from dating sims and
      RPGs which aren''t utilized all that well make Pegasus-5 seem a bit confused
