      \ the solar system is composed of the sun, 9 planets and their satellites.<br\
      \ />\r\nFor example: Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,\

      \ select the planets or satellites they want to explore, and then start the\
      \ whole solar system exploration tour.<br />\r\nDue to the long distance of\
      \ the spacecraft to the target planet, the fuel carried by the spacecraft cannot\

    review: "Despite what my dear friend \"English Teacher Plays\" has to say about\
      \ this game, there are many incorrect points he has brought up, and I wish to\
      \ disprove them. \n\nFirstly, English Teacher Plays claims that the game does\
      \ not function, however, I just recently played the game just fine, and I even\
      \ landed on the moon (take that, English Teacher Plays).\n\nSecondly, I wish\
      \ to address his wild claim that the loading screen flashes wildly. To that\
      \ I say, how can the loading screen flash wildly, if there is no loading screen?\n\
      \nMy last point is, how can an English Teacher, or rather, a self proclaimed\
      \ English Teacher, judge such a work of art, when it clearly states in the wall\
      \ of text in the beginning of the game that you require vast knowledge of interstellar\
      \ travel and the solar system to be able to play the game correctly. \n\nThe\
      \ game is not broken, English Teacher Plays, but it is you, who are broken.\n\
      \n"
