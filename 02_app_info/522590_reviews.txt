Just an asset flip cash grab that you beat in ~5 minutes but you don't realize you beat it being that you just jump back to the menu. Pistol is useless and everything is so dark I couldn't see the bitch most the time before it would make a noise as she teleports away. First 3 times I saw her, I just thought she was a statue of some sort before I realized she was the bitch that killed her parents and started haunting the shit outta there. Anyways, the game existing on Steam is more scary than the game itself. 0/10 and any good reviews of this shit were probably paid, friends of the devs or just jokes.","timestamp_created":1585898950,"timestamp_updated":1585898950,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.600725948810577393","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw17G8n/ECeqbN/QE="}
