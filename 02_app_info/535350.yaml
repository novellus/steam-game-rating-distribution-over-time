      An ordinary boy, who finds himself in the least ordinary of circumstances. Jason
      always wanted to live in a fantasy world, to escape from homework, school, his

      destroy the dark evil engulfing the lands.<br><br>At every turn, they are constantly

    review: 'I wanted to like this game, but it turns out that no amount of interesting
      ideas can make up for a... frankly /terrible/ execution, at least out of what
      I''ve seen of it. The combat is just ''walk up to enemy, click the mouse.''
      But you can''t avoid the combat, because enemies can arbitrarily teleport into
      melee range if you try to run past them. The puzzles that I''ve seen up until
      the point in the game I played are mostly either glaringly obvious or pointlessly
      cryptic. It''s also kind of glitchy.


      But the thing above all others that really made me not like this game is the
      fact that it''s just, /absurdly/ slow-paced. I was willing to give it a chance,
      until I got the shovel from the farmer, at which point he told me to dig up
      his crops. Each crop I had to dig up locked the character in place for several
      seconds while a sound-effect played. And with how on the edge I was about the
      game up until that point, that was the tipping point, at which point I realized
      that the game has no gameplay flow to speak of. I realize some of this is because
      it''s built in RPG-Maker, but really, you can only blame the engine so much
      before you ask why the devs didn''t just use a different engine.'
