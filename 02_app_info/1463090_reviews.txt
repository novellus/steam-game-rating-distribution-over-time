Very disappointing. \nThe whole environment seems more generic, I miss the beautiful rounded and larger mountains, every places here are just boring and uninteresting. They simply did not capture the potential of the real beautiful nature of New Zealand. \nIt feels more like an unknown fictional tropical island. :(\nPS: Very short story, lack of new or exotic animal species and everything is in cold blue filter which is a bit boring too.","timestamp_created":1610038255,"timestamp_updated":1610060514,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrbjF7/YCeseowQI="}
