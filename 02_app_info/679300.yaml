      [b]pathos[/b] is a really difficult sokoban-like where the goal isn''t to push
      boxes to their designated places, but for you to reach the exit by pushing boxes
      out of the way. sounds easy, it most certainly isn''t. there''s even a story,
      from what I''ve read it seemed a bit pretentious, but it can be turned off if
      you only want to concentrate on puzzling.


      [b]150+ levels[/b], you need a certain amount of ''bits'' from solving them
      to unlock further chapters, but every level within each is accessible at once.
      wasd or arrows to move, can''t be held to move more than one tile, annoying,
      but steps are numbered, nice. mouse wheel to zoom, but the mouse cursor never
      disappears, another oversight, and there''s a [b]mandatory move limit, once
      reached, the level resets[/b] for one more unnecessary annoyance. the next (and
      far from final) nail in the coffin is the [b]lack of undo[/b]. as always, it
      doesn''t make the game more difficult, just a lot more cumbersome and tedious
      than it should be. some of the later levels involve hundreds(!) of moves, which
      would be painful to figure out even with undo, let alone without.


      and if you haven''t suffered enough, be it from puzzle difficulty or having
      to re-do everything on a level after a misstep, there are also [b]breakthroughs[/b],
      additional challenges in the game. they can be brought up from the menu in alphabetical
      order, each has an accompanying image as a clue, the achievemenet list has a
      bit more info, and not only do you have to figure out [i]what[/i] to do, but
      also [i]where[/i] to do it, on which level. [b]some of them need audio clues,
      but they were stored on the game''s website, which is not available anymore[/b],
      so check the forum for download links. honestly, who thought this would be a
      good idea? why not just store them with the rest of the game? and if you can''t
      be bothered to change it, at least don''t let the domain expire. one takes some
      effort, the other some money, pick one.


      the presentation is pleasantly minimalist (except one of the fonts for the in-level
      story bits, too basic) and the audio is fantastic as well, but there''s only
      a master and sfx volume slider, plus resolutions and windowed mode via the unity
      launcher. and for such a story-heavy game, [b]there should be an in-game place
      to re-read all the story bits without launching every level separately[/b].


      gotta cater to masochists, no problem with that, but some of the design decisions
      are questionable at best. [b]with a few improvements it would be a truly excellent
      game[/b] for a more than reasonable price, except [b]it''s broken, the final
      level set hasn''t been accessible for years[/b] without editing the save file
      (there aren''t enough bits otherwise), and some breakthroughs are also broken.
      not sure how something like this can result in all those positive reviews, people
      (including developers) really have no standards these days. [b]obviously don''t
      waste money and time on this until (if ever) they decide to fix what they''re
      asking money for.[/b]'
