The graphics are nice, the mystical atmosphere and the sense of exploration while navigating the forests and abandoned buildings are right up my alley. At its best, Lake Ridden feels like a mix between the melancholy storytelling of Gone Home/Firewatch and the no-nonse logic puzzle-solving of, say, Myst. Sadly, Lake Riddens atmosphere only works up to a point. The environmental storytelling gets increasingly confused as the game progresses, and lacks the emotional punch that one demands from the story-driven adventure game genre. And despite some good puzzles, sadly most of them are far to repetetive and uninspired. Lake Ridden is all right, but in the end, a bit of a disappointment.","timestamp_created":1609953470,"timestamp_updated":1609953470,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw44yt7PYCdY6HwQI="}
