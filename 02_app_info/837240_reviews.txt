In game you manage a store by setting prices on your goods and then selling those items to customers who come in with a preset list. As the game progresses you can buy additional equipment to help you out. The game is simple to learn and easy to play. \n\nThe only issue I have come across is after day 1 the \"hands\" that you control seem to shutter and you lose a bit of functionality when operating the buttons in game. for example if I were to buy a tomato I would click the buy button once and yet the game registers that I bought 4 or 5 of them.  But I can't be to harsh the game was less than $10. Hopefully they fix these issues soon rather than later.\n\nEdit: So the developer reached out and said that the issues that I ran into have be resolved. I will change my recommendation to YES.","timestamp_created":1550228442,"timestamp_updated":1597877705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534538149833679199","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1552381440,"developer_response":"Hello,\n\nI just wanted to point out that the issues with losing hands functionality and the buy buttons have been addressed in the latest update:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791462173953/announcements/detail/1794026904642652998\n\nIn summary, controlling the notebook has fundamentally changed in that you don't touch the buttons anymore but use a finger pointer to select buttons. \n\n"}],"cursor":"AoJ4ktu7hPQCc5z4ugE="}
