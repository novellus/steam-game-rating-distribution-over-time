I appreciate the lower price of the dlc if it didnt just feel like what shouldve been implemented to begin with.\n\nSadly i recommend picking up this game on sale but current price is a slap in the face for how they are handling the game itself.\n\n*Couple years later*\n\nYears later, more hours logged in, i stand by my review... it feels incomplete for any level of a tycoon game... it plays like a \"Game tycoon\" like sim in the sense of guess what proper combination of items (AND ORDER) that you need for your adventure... god forbid if you pack that map before them weapons on a fishing trip! Not really any desire for replayability. Hell the only point to leveling your heroes is to go off and do more of the same idle repetitive quests. Then stare at the progress bar of the quest till you get slapped with one of their \"random events\" which you generally pick the circumstance that favors your heroes... intelligent approach if theyre smart, brute force if their beefy. Thats it.\n\nSuccess contributes to settlement popularity which is just used to ensure you can keep YOUR town going income wise. Beyond that the other settlements are just one more thing to micromanage just to keep your own town going.\nYou can certainly sustain your own town without their help right? Absolutely... if you spam quests and have enough heroes to make up for the others resting... which costs more of course.\n\nPut em to work in the tavern... probably the laziest form of contributing a hero to the town businesses themselves. Their skills contribute in no way to the businesses let alone types... for example brute force could make good blacksmiths... naw theyre basically a fill in slot to make it hardly more efficient. \n\nThis game was definitely just a cheap attempt to get budget to go do other stuff. I hate to encourage microtransactions but this game shouldve been a free game with microtransactions slapped in because there isn't much of an independent offline single player game here...","timestamp_created":1545436224,"timestamp_updated":1609626036,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8oTM4vYCdYz3tQE="}
