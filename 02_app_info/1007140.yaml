    review: Criminally underappreciated AG racer. The game feels great to play, there's
      some good mechanics, the track design is really good, it's challenging. It's
      just REALLY FUN. The only problem I have with it is that there isn't enough
      of it. There's about 12 tracks, and some of those get reused in the championship,
      just reversed and maybe with different conditions. There's also only one gameplay
      mode in the campaign, so you'll be done with it in a couple of hours. There
      are a LOT of difficulty levels, and your cars get incrementally faster, so there's
      good replay value, but if you're not into replaying it'll be a real short game
      for you. Overall one of the best AG racers on steam. Not as good as Redout and
      BallisticNG, but on about the same level as Super Pilot.
