    review: 'Hellraizers is a new action-adventure platformer game from indie studio
      Omcor, creator of ace of space, set in a fantasy medieval setting.

      The game meets us with a plot, atmosphere and, of course, gameplay. Everything
      in order.

      The plot of the plot is that you acquired an island, knowingly knowing about
      the riches and treasures located there, but upon your arrival, a demonic incursion
      happened to your own island and now you, left penniless in your pocket, set
      off to destroy the heresy, demons and xenos that were waiting for you in the
      bowels of the island.

      The game has two endings and their receipt depends on how much effort you spent
      on clearing the island, according to the classics, one of the endings is positive,
      and the other is deplorable. Only a blessed martyr will be rewarded with the
      opportunity to see a happy future. The ending depends on the level of difficulty
      of your passage, respectively, easy is bad, and more intense is a good ending,
      respectively.

      As your adventure progresses, you go through eight unique locations, not counting
      the tutorial and the final location of the heldrazers.

      Each location has a unique original music and level design that immerses you
      in the world of the game. The structure of the locations, both geometrically-geographically
      and visually, give a sense of real presence and uniqueness to these locations.

      With each new district design, unique opponents and traps only increase in quality,
      consistent with the design of the level and add more surroundings to the locations.

      As an example, I will take my favorite and at the same time the most difficult
      location for me, the fortress, saturated with bats and rotating spiked spheres,
      creating the atmosphere of an abandoned castle supported by an original unique
      sauna track.

      Each district is divided into 6 levels, the first of which five are exploration
      and platforming. And the sixth level is always a battle with unique bosses with
      unique combat mechanics.

      For example, the boss of the third forest location will spawn four opponents
      at a time from more difficult locations that will be further.

      With the exception of the last location, which contains 2 levels, one of which
      is research and the second is a boss battle, these are the most interesting
      and difficult locations to pass.

      At the beginning of the game, you are given three heroes to choose from, and
      you make this choice once:

      Knight

      Magician

      Assassin

      Each hero is equipped with melee, ranged, and superpowers.

      Each hero has 2 specializations at the start, which can be changed on the go
      via the escape button. The third specialization opens upon passing the game
      for all classes and is the best combat unit with unique anomalies, but this
      does not mean that you will forget about other specializations, I will analyze
      it using the example of a knight for whom I passed the game.

      The first specialization is the melee fighter with the highest damage per hit,
      the ranged is a gun built into the sword, shoots 5 projectiles that fly vertically
      like a fan, and a super strike is a slap with a sword in a jump that deals 5
      times damage.

      Each specialization is spelled out and described when choosing.

      Gameplay locations consist of enemy traps and interactive objects:

      Enemies are mainly divided into two types of shooters and brawlers, but there
      are powerful opponents mini bosses, with a barrage of melee attacks.

      In the game, an attack can be made only while standing on the surface, the protagonist
      has double jumps, but their height depends on the hero and specialization, as
      well as the speed of movement.

      Traps in the game do damage and are also definitely of two types, hidden and
      visible. Hidden traps like stakes pop out of the ground and deal damage, while
      visible traps like circular saws immobilize movement. As you progress through
      the game, the arsenal of traps increases and is also associated with the design
      of locations.

      Interactive objects are things that directly help you pass the location, you
      can easily notice them, their design is unchanged for ease of understanding.
      These are boxes lifts to jump higher or defuse traps. There is also a chest,
      they will help you replenish ammunition and the number of super attacks, but
      they need a key, so exploring locations is encouraged.

      Coins are scattered on the level, one of the main gameplay parts, different
      coins or jewels add points to you at the end of the passage, which means how
      well and carefully you passed the location. The game also has a so-called sulse-like
      element, backtracking, and truly interesting and exciting bosses that do not
      fall from one poke.

      In general, Hellraizers is an exciting adventure in the world of fantasy from
      scratch, created by the author6 original musical accompaniment, design of locations,
      enemies and characters. Hellraizers does not make a martyr of you forcing a
      thousand times to pass, the same moment, it is pleasant to play in Hellraizers,
      interesting locations and their varied exploration is deeply encouraged. I advise
      you to play Hellraisers because of the above, the game is sincere and kind.'
