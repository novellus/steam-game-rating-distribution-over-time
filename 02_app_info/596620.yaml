    review: "[b][i]PLEASE READ:[/i][/b] The store claims this game has split screen,\
      \ but it doesn't, meaning it also doesn't support remote play together. However,\
      \ the devs haven't fixed the issue yet. This is a warning to not buy this game\
      \ if you just want it for split screen! Secondly, the ram requirements are wrong.\
      \ They should be in GB rather than MB. Keep that in mind!\n\n[i]My review down\
      \ below:[/i]\nGas Guzzlers: Combat Carnage is in a weird place with the release\
      \ of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/243800/Gas_Guzzlers_Extreme/]Gas\
      \ Guzzlers Extreme[/url]. Who would want a older version of the Extreme, especially\
      \ when I've seen Extreme discounted to as low as the price this game is listed\
      \ for. Yet, I picked it up because I was curious, and to my surprise, the game\
      \ is actually different in many ways.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[b]Different Artstyle[/b]\n\
      I love the orange UI, with the menu, and HUD just looking better, and cleaner.\
      \ It kinda has like a 70s or early 80s type of vibe with the orange color, and\
      \ bubbly letters, compared to the edgy, fire, and burnt look of Extreme.\n\n\
      [b]Graphics[/b]\nRight away when I played Combat Carnage, everything looked...\
      \ better. I did a video to compare both games, and I found that Combat Carnage\
      \ looks a lot better than Extreme, with better lighting, particle effects, the\
      \ color grading, and atmosphere. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scl67kcdLDQ\n\
      Most likely this was done because people complained about the effects making\
      \ it hard to see, rather than just an artstyle change like I thought so before.\
      \ It doesn't explain away all of the changes done with the graphics, but that\
      \ could be a factor in why the lighting, and particle effects were toned down.\n\
      \n[b]Powerups[/b]\nPowerups in this game last for 3 times, compared to Extreme\
      \ where they only last 1 time. Sure, this means that there is less skill, as\
      \ you can just spam powerups. However, this means that the tracks are way more\
      \ hazardous, with oil spills, and mines littered all over the track. Rounding\
      \ a bend to see 3 or more mines right infront of you is a butt clenching experience\
      \ you don't get in Extreme. *Side note: In multiplayer, powerups only last for\
      \ 1 use like in Extreme.\n\n[b]No Sponsors[/b]\nIn Extreme, you could get companies\
      \ to sponsor you. This would mean you were have to wear their sticker, and go\
      \ to sponsored events, in turn gaining extra cash. \nWhy do I see this as a\
      \ bad thing? Well, because it makes it way easier to get money, making it less\
      \ of a challenge to manage, and save money. In Combat Carnage, I was a little\
      \ stressed for money, and I had to sell my old cars just to purchase upgrades\
      \ on my new vehicle. This doesn't really happen in Extreme, unless you are a\
      \ bad driver. So why would someone want to go with a basic color paint job if\
      \ they are going to miss out on money, and sponsored events? \nSince there are\
      \ no sponsors in Combat Carnage, you don't feel 'forced' into going with them,\
      \ so you can customize your car with the paint job, and stickers of you liking.\
      \ This also means that the AI drivers also have these paint jobs, which help\
      \ them stand out, and look better compared to every single AI in Extreme having\
      \ a worn out, tacky sponsored sticker.\n\n[b]Camera[/b]\nFirstly, the default\
      \ 3rd person camera is way too close in Extreme, but this can be fixed by changing\
      \ the FOV values in the GasGuzzlers.xml file. \nIn Combat Carnage, the default\
      \ camera FOV values are bigger, causing the camera to be set back further. They\
      \ also removed a camera view in Extreme, which is a more of a top down look.\
      \ You can see it in my video [url=https://youtu.be/scl67kcdLDQ?t=280]here[/url].\n\
      \n[b]Not Only Just on Steam[/b]\nYou aren't 'forced' to use Steam. You can still\
      \ get the game on GamersGate (DRM free), however it is still listed there at\
      \ $20. You can also get physical copies on places like eBay which are also DRM\
      \ free. However, this means that this game does not have any Steam achievements\
      \ or leaderboards compared to Extreme, so that is something to note.\n\n[b]Very\
      \ Cheap[/b]\nAt $5 USD year around, this is a bargain. Extreme normally is $25\
      \ (not including DLC), though I've seen the base game, and the DLC on sale for\
      \ around a few dollars more than Combat Carnage. So if you are looking to try\
      \ out the Gas Guzzlers series without waiting for Extreme to go on sale, this\
      \ is a perfect option!\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[b]Less Content[/b]\nLess maps, less\
      \ gamemodes, less vehicles, less customization options, and no DLC. With the\
      \ less content, career mode becomes a lot more boring quickly as you cycle through\
      \ the same 3 modes on the same tracks, while in Extreme, there is a lot more\
      \ variety, and the game doesn't get as boring as quickly.\n\n[b]Heavier Vehicle\
      \ Handling[/b]\nVehicle handling is better in Extreme. With Combat Carnage,\
      \ it feels heavier, making it much hard to control. I even matched up the same\
      \ controller settings to Extreme, and still found the vehicle handling to be\
      \ different. If you prefer the heavier handling, you maybe see this as a plus,\
      \ but I struggle to drive with the heavier handling model in Combat Carnage.\n\
      \n[b]Less Refined AI[/b]\nThe AI does seem less refined compared to Extreme.\
      \ AI tends to not put up as much of a challenge compared to the same AI difficulty\
      \ in Extreme. Even on the impossible difficulty, I tend to outpace the AI in\
      \ Combat Carnage, while they are more on my tail in Extreme. If you are a hardcore\
      \ vehicular combat player looking for challenging races, Extreme has much better,\
      \ and more challenging AI.\n\n[b]Multiplayer[/b]\n[list]\n[*]There are no AI\
      \ bots in online multiplayer, which there are in Extreme. \n[*]No one plays\
      \ multiplayer. Extreme doesn't have many players on either, but you are better\
      \ off trying to get people for Extreme rather than Combat Carnage's online multiplayer.\n\
      [*]People can not be banned or made admins as the game doesn't have a way to\
      \ track user IDs. Extreme can track this using Steam IDs, so you are able to\
      \ ban people, and make them admins.\n[*]The arena maps, and gamemodes were only\
      \ added for multiplayer. In Extreme, you can play them offline in singleplayer\
      \ and career.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Old Code[/b]\n[list]\n[*]This version was last\
      \ updated in 2013, while Extreme received its last update in 2016, so you might\
      \ encounter glitches that were already patched in Extreme. \n[*]There are longer\
      \ load times due to less optimized code. Extreme has the option of DirectX 9\
      \ or ll, in either 32bit or 64bit exes. Combat Carnage is limited to only DirectX\
      \ 9 in 32bit.\n[*]The HUD seems to be designed for 720p and lower, so it can\
      \ look small on larger resolutions.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Other[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Even\
      \ though the William voice is credited in Combat Carnage, it is not a choice\
      \ of one of the character voices.\n[*]You can't look to the left, and right\
      \ like you can in Extreme\n[*]Less variety in the soundtrack.\n[/list]\n\nIn\
      \ short, Gas Guzzlers: Combat Carnage is still a good buy, and a very fun game\
      \ even with its short comings to its bigger brother."
