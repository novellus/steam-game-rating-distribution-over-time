My laptop is about 5-6 years old now, so I know some things is not part of the game's issues. \n\nI would rate this game 8/10. \nPros:\n-Beautiful animations and details in the environment. \n-Unique but simple style of game play \n-Fresh new idea that involves postal service in space. \nCons:\n-No save system in place. Once you exit out the game, you lose all progress you made. \n-When you're zipping around in space, sometimes you crash into objects and I find that I become immobilized/glitched in object until I teleport out of it. \n-Explanation of the controls. I think they could have either been explained easier or have a practice round of you pressing the buttons to learn controls and not proceeding until you complete the tasks.  \nOverall:\n-It is a pretty cool game that just needs a bit of tidy up to fix some things and add new system features.","timestamp_created":1605142684,"timestamp_updated":1605142684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlrT93PUCfdHsrQI="}
