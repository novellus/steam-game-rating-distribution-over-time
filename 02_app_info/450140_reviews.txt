I stumbled upon a random demo disk in our garage from an old PC Gamer magazine, if I recall correctly. I was immediately enthralled. The soundtrack, the civ choices, the simplicity were all exactly what I wanted.\n\nThis game can be both challenging and a breeze, depending on your goal. Very Hard AI will stomp. Easy AI will do very little to stop you. \n\nThere isn't a big learning curve with 7K, just explore, train, take over towns, destroy frythans, build seats of power, war machines, and take out your enemy in any manner you see fit.","timestamp_created":1609621349,"timestamp_updated":1609621349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qJS64vYCeJftvwI="}
