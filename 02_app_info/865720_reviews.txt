I picked it up at around $4.50 and I'm enjoying it. Don't go into the game expecting something crazy in-depth. However, the characters are interesting enough to make it fun. I really like how Dr. Jekyll plays in particular. If you're familiar with classic fairy tales, then you will definitely enjoy this game with all of its references and enemies you encounter. I say give it a try if you catch it on sale. It's very easy to pick up and play a chapter or two when you have time.\n\nEDIT: I just hit chapter four and there's a bug where the game loads underneath the stage, so you can't progress. I can't recommend the game with a game-breaking bug like this. Once it's fixed, I'll switch it back to a positive review, but I can't in good conscious recommend this game when it has a bug that prevents you from finishing the game.","timestamp_created":1604843876,"timestamp_updated":1606104186,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyZ/R+fUCfNCSrQI="}
