Don't be folled like I was by the preview screenshots; this is a very solid and fun game.\n\nDefender's Quest is a tower defense game with a fantasy spin: the \"towers\" are heroes and there's a meta progression where they level up and you can spend skill points to focus each hero on a specific role, as well as equiping weapons and armor on them.\n\nThe game is very polished and it has lots of quality of life features. It has a surprising amount of maps and challenges to replay. There's a surprisingly big amount of content packed in here with extra difficulties for each battle, different skill builds, bonus challenges and an entire new game+ which all togheter lead to a whole lot of replayability.\n\nAlso it's very well designed the fact that it is up to the players to decide how much of the grind they wish to engage with, so you're not forced to grind if you don't want to and can complete the game easily. But if you wish, you can grind to get better gear, money and experience. I generally dislike grind so it was a pleasant surprise to discover that not only the grind is opitional, the grind that is there is actually quite fun and rewarding!\n\nIt's funny because I'm not even that much into tower defense games but this one is honestly amazing and fun so I'm highly recommending this game even at fulll price!","timestamp_created":1609609391,"timestamp_updated":1609871424,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoI/06fYCc/vlvwI="}
