I thought I'd give it a shot, but it turns out it's a simple, pretty boring take on a pseudo-snake game, where you simply use WASD to mow strands in a line. If you turn the difficulty up enough, a dog will impede your progress only because you run him over and splatter blood everywhere, hindering your vision to see where to mow next.\n\nIt's not fun, the formula is boring and in just 10 minutes I encountered all the enemies through the harder difficulties and felt unchallenged and unsatisfied. I'm overall pretty angry at how hyped this game got, there's just nothing to it. This is something I'd expect to see included in a crappy Bundle Stars $1 bundle, not $10 retail.","timestamp_created":1514939425,"timestamp_updated":1514939425,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549986898899078369","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jqTb3OACefPflAE="}
