Not too difficult, though there were a handful of levels that kicked my butt for a teeny bit. The music is pretty banging! Got 100% achievements in just under 7 hours in one sitting. The extra game modes you unlock, \"Faster Than Light\" (race against the clock) and \"Not Him Again\" (Boss Chase), were pretty fun and challenging additions to the game! I didn't really care much for the \"Square Fights Back\" (arena) mode but others may enjoy it!\n\nI can't believe I missed that first C-C-C-C-Cube though! I went through each level like 3 or 4 times before I found it. >_< And there's literally NO Achievements Guides anywhere on the Internet nor Steam. But I did find 48/50 of them on the first play-through so they were pretty easy to find! :)\n\nFunny story: I guess because of my setup, when I was first streaming this game in full screen mode my square was moving in like a \"Low Gravity\" pace while the rest of the game was going normal speed so originally I was incredibly frustrated with the game because I got to level 52 [spoiler](out of 67)[/spoiler] and this level seemed impossible! I went to the Steam Store page and watched the trailer to see how fast the square was supposed to move and was so confused. So I went back into the game and just for kicks and giggles put it in windowed mode and sure enough my square started RACING! I was also experiencing some odd enemy glitches in the game but that also corrected itself in windowed mode. And then furthermore when I ended the stream the game ran SEAMLESS, which is crazy because I was literally a second away from writing a SCATHING review, but turns out it was my fault LOL! Nothing wrong with the game!\n\nOverall worth a playthrough! Can't wait to try the Prologue and Vol. 2! I got the 3 game bundle on sale for $5.83 and so far definitely seems worth it!","timestamp_created":1606205704,"timestamp_updated":1606257131,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ439eY/vUCd+CZsAI="}
