      >LIVE THE LIFE OF A WILD WOLF</h2><br>You are a young gray wolf. Born in the\
      \ Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park, you learned the ways of the wolf\
      \ in your family pack. Now you are venturing out on your own \u2014 to explore,\
      \ hunt, find a mate, establish territory, and raise your own family.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">EMBARK ON A QUEST FOR SURVIVAL</h2>Your quest begins on the slopes\
      \ of Amethyst Mountain. Here you must test your hunting skills against elk,\
      \ moose, and mule deer. Once you're a skilled hunter, you can seek out another\
      \ wolf to become your mate.<br><br>Then, together, you venture to Slough Creek,\
      \ cutting through the the mountains north of the Lamar Valley, to establish\
      \ a territory and den site and raise a litter of pups. You must feed them, play\
      \ with them, protect them from deadly competitors, and take them on a cross-country\
      \ journey to a summer home. Can your little family pack succeed?<h2 class=\"\

      \ roam the sagebrush steppe grasslands, alpine forests, and magnificent high\
      \ ridges.<br><br>But watch out for packs of stranger wolves, who patrol their\
      \ territories and don't look kindly on intruders. The wilderness brims with\
      \ other dangers as well \u2014 grizzly bears, cougars, and coyotes \u2014 who\
      \ all vie with you for territory and food.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">REALISTIC ECOLOGY\

      \ predators challenge you over your kills -- and protect theirs.<br></li><li>Wolves\
      \ communicate with each other using natural actions and vocalizations.<br></li><li>Dynamic\
