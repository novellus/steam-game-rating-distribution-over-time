    short_description: Your orders are to surrender, but you prefer death to dishonor.
      As you take on the enemy, their general will devote more resources to the fight
      in hopes of crushing you. He will send helicopters, tanks, planes, artillery
      barrages, and eventually grab his shotgun and come after you himself.
