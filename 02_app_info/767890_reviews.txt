This is a pick of what seems to be fan made music that pay tribute to the game in some way, all songs have vocals and range from synths, rock, rap, and are all very in your face kind of tracks. If you're looking for the music from the trailers, involving nice calm guitar, then don't get this DLC as you'll be disappointed. They did state it was a specially made selection in the description, so I guess I should've seen it coming, but I was hoping at least a few of the games tracks in there. Though technically my fault for not reading it properly, it does deviate from the usual, as I do not see a seperate entry anywhere for the games music, just this selection, which is not great.\n\nBy the way, all the people who state they have to go the the game directories to play the music apparently never discovered the Music Player that has been integrated into steam for years and years (Well before this games release in 2018), and has recently been updated so you can now install OSTs seperately and choose where to put them on install (But you have to buy the OST outside of a bundle to do so, otherwise you'll either need to buy it again outside of the bundle you just got, or you'll need to install the bundle that it was included with and use the music player in steam to play the music (Or you can do what the complaints mentioned which is to go to the games directory and move the music yourself, though not necessary with the steam music player)). To install soundtracks seperately if you've added the OST to your basket and checked out, then go to your library home and you'll see an entry for the game, select it and on the main screen to the right under DLC you'll see the ability to install the soundtrack seperately, it'll ask where as you install it.","timestamp_created":1598796488,"timestamp_updated":1598796488,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1Mvsn/QCdcXfngI="}
