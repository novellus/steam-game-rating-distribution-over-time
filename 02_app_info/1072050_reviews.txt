It almost feels like I've come across something very hidden. The presentation overall isn't really up to par with some more polished experiences, reminding me of when Xbox Live had indie games and some of them were either crap or gold.\n\nI'm gonna be a bit blunt: This game ain't gold.\n\nThe game is another top down dungeon crawler roguelite where you slice baddies in a dark and gritty atmosphere. A majority of the early game involves lots of circle strafing baddies with the usage of the sprint key and the sword. As you progress, you find various spells that aid you in your little adventure. The cooldowns between using your offense feel very slow, and combat doesn't really feel satisfying, at least until you can get some spells to pepper some enemies with. The spells not only make the game more fun to play, but make confrontation easier when you play at a distance. The starting weapon you have could deal a bit more damage in the early game, since it takes a good chunk of time to both evade and kill enemies.\n\nYou progress in the game by going through doors or holes that have numbers and decimals in them. From my understanding, they determine how far you progress in the game. Things spike up greatly in difficulty on the 3rd level where your mistakes become more punished. There is less leeway and you quickly have to start from the beginning. At one point, I also reached the \"Engineer\" boss. I tried to get to the boss, but before I could, I kept falling downward as if I was transitioning into another level. I kept arriving at the same spot over and over, until I felt like enough was enough.\n\nCore Of Darkness is a fair attempt at game development. While it isn't a good game, it does have some creative ideas with how it handles its spellcasting and enemy/hazard design. The game really would have benefited from more polish and more play testing before being tucked away under steam's storefront. At the very least, this game tried to be a game, rather than something more bland or generic. With that said, I can't think of who I'd recommend this to.\n","timestamp_created":1564159068,"timestamp_updated":1564159068,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593116939067840576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9qjJl+wCfJmVzwE="}
