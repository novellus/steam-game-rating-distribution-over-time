The only reason I would give this a 4/10 is that I played a lot of total garbage shoot-em-up games on Steam and it would be unfair to give this a negative while it's just mediocre in my opinion and the price was quite fair.\nKeep in mind that this is far from being a good game and there are a lot of better options out there.","timestamp_created":1549357954,"timestamp_updated":1549358010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6eG73ugCduOFugE="}
