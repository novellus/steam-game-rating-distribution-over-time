    review: It was really overwhelming and complicated when I started out, but I got
      the hang of it quickly and started to enjoy discovering new strategies. The
      livestream is an amazing source of inspiration, glad they have that. I enjoy
      the game, especially that I was a huge fan of the show, I can recommend it to
      everyone.
