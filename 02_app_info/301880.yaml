    review: Good overall soundtrack that fits the game well. Not perfect as it sometimes
      has what sounds like the same quality issues as the game has in certain tracks,
      particularly the title/main menu music. Minor complaints to me though, not enough
      to say don't buy. Recommend this one over the AST-if you're going to buy one
      of the 2 soundtracks for the game, buy this one.
