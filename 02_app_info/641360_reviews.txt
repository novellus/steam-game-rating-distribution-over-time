What pushed me towards making the purchase was 1. the sale. and 2. recognizing Jason Tobin (from Better Luck Tomorrow and Tokyo Drift) and Byron Mann (from The Big Short and Street Fighter). Did not recognize anyone else, but all the performances were fantastic.\n\nOverall, very impressed by this movie. Everyone involved did a great job.\n\nThe movie relies heavily on it's pacing and build up of tension, which is superb throughout. But I can see it being a problem for some people. The finale is slightly predicatible but its delivery makes up for it. Again, I think the acting is great, the location unique, and the plot is dark. I highly recommend.","timestamp_created":1513925050,"timestamp_updated":1513925050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550233662128448486","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6d+9vuACdrn4kgE="}
