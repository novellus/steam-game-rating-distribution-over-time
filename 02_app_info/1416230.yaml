    review: "The game is still in early access so lower your expectations. If you\
      \ came from the early days of the World of Tanks, expect it to be like an alpha\
      \ release with periodic update to become a full game.\n\nCore functions are\
      \ ready: tank controls, shell logic need minor corrections, few tank missions,\
      \ etc. \nSome minor fixing:\n- few in-battle dialog lines not translated\n-\
      \ shell vs game objects logic (e.g. how the shell behave versus wooden & stick\
      \ fence, very thin tree) \n- FPS drop when there are so many tanks destroyed,\
      \ optimization needed \n\nSo far, no major gameplay bug. No progression is to\
      \ be save anyway."
