The gimmick of only casting spells when you're on the associated row feels fun at first but really opens itself up to more depth as you unlock more characters and familiarize yourself with each area. Each encounter uses the same enemies each time, but their abilities are interesting enough that just placing them randomly around the board each run still makes them feel like a unique puzzle each time. The play field is a little overstimulating at first but was easy to get a hang of, which is really helped by the vibrant and expressive art. I especially loved the player character art. Each PC option radiates overwhelmingly smug energy in a new and unique way. Overall: recommended!","timestamp_created":1590283712,"timestamp_updated":1590283712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.444444417953491211","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4PaSovICf7DwiQI="}
