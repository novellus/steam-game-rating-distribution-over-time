    review: 'DO NOT BUY!


      Bought this pack and only got one item out of it. No help from support... only
      answer is to wait for devs (?!) to fix it or I can try to buy it again... well....
      really.

      I highly recommend NOT to spend any money in this game until they fix their
      shop and support.


      It''s been a long time now waiting with no progress and I am sick of it that
      is why I make this public, but I am willing to update this if I get any useful
      help from the support.'
