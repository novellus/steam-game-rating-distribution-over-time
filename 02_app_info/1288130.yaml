    review: 'Where''s the "mid thumb" option when you need it?


      The concept for this game is honestly amazing, but the execution is a little
      rough around the edges. Where to begin...


      Story mode:


      Chapter 1 - Managed to beat all the levels here. Level 2 took me 2 or 3 attempts
      to complete since that had a slight difficulty spike, and the last level of
      the chapter... holy frick is the timer tight (managed to get it second try,
      somehow). Fun overall, though.


      Chapter 2 - The first level of this chapter is hot garbage. It''s too dark,
      and even if you turn the brightness up to max, it doesn''t really make it fun,
      even if it makes it playable. Like, you get poked by an enemy and you gotta
      restart, mister. What even is my goal in this level? lol. So yeah, I never cared
      about chapter 2 because of this.


      Challenge mode: Level 1 took me 3 tries to complete because the jump in this
      game is a major cuck (try jumping along the back bit of the level... ugh). Level
      2 was super creative; loved that one. Level 3... very cool idea, but the jumps
      are WAY too precise, and ended up giving up after a few attempts. What''s worse
      is that if you die, the level doesn''t auto restart, you need to pause and restart
      yourself lol (the game basically just softlocks until you do that). I actually
      did make it to the final jump once, but when I failed that, that was the final
      straw.


      Multiplayer: Had 1 game against myself and won 9-0. In other words, this mode
      is dead because literally nobody bought this game. Which is a shame.


      General stuff: If you''re wearing headphones, depending on what camera angle
      you''re at in the story levels (and multiplayer, I guess), the audio will sometimes
      only play in 1 ear, which can be super annoying. I actually had to check my
      headphones and ears the first time to make sure they were working properly,
      lol.


      Overall? It''s ok, 6/10 for the concept and effort. Not sure if I''ll play anymore
      though, and still on the fence about refunding it or not. But err...


      BUY THIS GAME SO MULTIPLAYER WON''T BE DEAD ANYMORE, DAMMIT!'
