    review: Even though it's only made by one person, it is very well made so far.
      It is surprisingly accurate and is extremely fun to play with friends. Increased
      enjoyment if you like playing paintball. 10/10 Community is very helpful and
      supportive and the game dev always listens to feedback and critiques.
