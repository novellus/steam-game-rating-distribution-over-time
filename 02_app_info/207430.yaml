    about_the_game: There are dark places in the world inhabited by evil denizens.
      Places filled with danger and foreboding where no ordinary man would dare to
      journey. However, there are a few who are willing to risk death in the name
      of good, in the name of justice, in the name of.. valuable loot!<br><br>Hack,
      Slash, Loot is a single-player turn-based dungeon crawler. Take control of a
      lone hero and explore sprawling dungeons, fight dangerous monsters, and most
      importantly, plunder valuable treasures. With a new dungeon created every game
      you can be sure that no two playthroughs will ever be the same. Boasting easy
      to master controls you'll be adventuring in no time, but there is still enough

    review: Great time waster. Not sure about negative reviews. I chalk it up to living
      in a time where being "Overcritical" is the norm. If David Williamson decides
