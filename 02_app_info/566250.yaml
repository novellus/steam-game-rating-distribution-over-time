    review: I tried this because it went on sale, and it looks like nobody has commented
      on it in a few years.  The UI is full of game-breaking bugs, making it almost
      unplayable.  Regardless of what the developer has said in the discussions, this
      appears to be an unfinished, abandoned project.  It looks like it was developed
      using straight assembly language or C, and direct pixel drawing instead of standard
      UI controls, which is commendable in terms of programming effort, but with so
      much effort put into building a hackish UI from scratch, there was nothing left
      to put into screen layout or graphic design, making for a confusing and unpleasant
      eyesore.  The game concept seems like it could potentially be fun if this were
      rebuilt from scratch using a modern game development framework and a standardized
      UI.
