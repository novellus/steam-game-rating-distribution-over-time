    review: "The Moto Racer Collection includes the legendary Moto Racer, that I have\
      \ played with an 3dfx Voodoo card on the PC over 20 years ago. A simple, but\
      \ fun arcade racer, that impressed with its high speed and great responsiveness.\
      \ Just race and have fun.\n\nWhile the Steam edition of Moto Racer works on\
      \ 64bit Windows 10 out of the box with poor SW rendering, but applying the patch\
      \ from the Guide section greatly improves the experience by enabling D3D or\
      \ glide. \n\nOn 64bit Windows 10, the Moto Racer 2 requires another patch to\
      \ run at all (see Guide section).\n\nBoth games support (digital) game controllers\
      \ (or keyboard). A Xbox 360 controller with analog controls is not well working.\n\
      \nMoto Racer 3 works out of the box and supports analog game controllers.\n\n\
      Moto Racer 15th ANNIVERSARY is the port of a mobile phone game. Not as good\
      \ as the classic series. It aims to be more realistic, but is rather disappointing,\
      \ much less fun.\n\nI have bought the entire collection at just $1, a real bargain.\n"
