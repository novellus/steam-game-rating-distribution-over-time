    review: "I've heard that the VR version of the game works quite well - but for\
      \ that you need to have the VR hardware to play.  This review is specifically\
      \ targeting the non-VR version's shortcomings.\n\nIt seems like it could be\
      \ a fun little space adventure WITH A BIT MORE WORK TO FIX A COUPLE OF BUGS\
      \ THAT SORT OF MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY PROPERLY.  You are a pilot of a mining\
      \ spaceship, you have to mine various minerals from asteroids to make money\
      \ that will allow you to buy oxygen so you don't die out there in space.  Well,\
      \ that's your official job anyway.  The thing is, due to a fluke in your ship's\
      \ onboard computer system you get flagged as \"abetting a wanted criminal\"\
      \ and your employer marks you for termination by drone fighter ships.  So you're\
      \ on the run.  You turn to the people who accidentally got you into this trouble...\
      \ they're building a system that will terraform Mars and free the people from\
      \ the corporation's greedy grip.  So they send you to... wait for it... mine\
      \ various minerals from asteroids to find supplies for their project.  In turn,\
      \ they pay you so that you can upgrade your ship's engines, mining systems,\
      \ and weapons.  So yeah, you're an asteroid miner who frequently has to fight\
      \ off enemy drone ships.  You have a selection of a few different weapons to\
      \ help you mess up your foes, and a small amount of skill is required to truly\
      \ profit from the mining activities.  See, it could have been a pretty fun little\
      \ space adventure game.  But...\n\nGame-killing bugs.  ARGH!  WHY???  One of\
      \ the features is your email system in your spacecraft lets you listen to messages\
      \ from various people, starting with your first employers at the mining corporation.\
      \  These are meant to add to the flavor and story a little bit, but alas if\
      \ you ever let one of those messages finish playing you freeze your view so\
      \ you're focused on whatever you were looking at when the message ends, no other\
      \ controls work, and you're effectively stuck.  The only two ways to \"fix it\"\
      \ are to Alt-F4 quit the game or else go full throttle until you crash into\
      \ something enough times that you explode and die... but it's OUTER SPACE so\
      \ there really isn't much stuff out there for you to crash into.  This needs\
      \ to be addressed before I can put my seal of approval on this game.\n\nAlso,\
      \ the flight controls are pretty horrible and clunky.  I'm sure as a VR game\
      \ it was pretty good, but when they tried to port the controls out of VR and\
      \ map everything to keyboard/mouse or gamepad things did not go well.  Worst\
      \ flight control system I've ever tried in a space-flight game.  \n\nAnd then\
      \ some of the missions require you to scan special things (parts of a giant\
      \ cargo ship, or special mineral deposits inside a demolished moon) by using\
      \ your ship's searchlight and a special scanner function... these parts of the\
      \ mission just don't work well at all, technically speaking.  The flashlight\
      \ thing points STRAIGHT DOWN below your ship so you can't even see it, so you're\
      \ flying in the pitch black darkness even with it turned on.  And the special\
      \ scanners only function if you're already parked directly on (as in 5 cm or\
      \ 2 inches away) the thing you're supposed to be searching for.  IF you're any\
      \ farther away you get a negative scan that says there's nothing there.  So\
      \ these special material searches are a PAIN IN THE NECK, I played 3 hours and\
      \ 2 of them were just searching a tiny hole in a demolished moon looking for\
      \ three little sulfur deposits that the person on the communicator said would\
      \ \"have a yellow color\" but they really don't, and you MUST hit them with\
      \ your special scanner before the game will let you mine the minerals out of\
      \ them.  \n\nSo it was a good idea, seems like a nice little space adventure\
      \ game... but a couple of deadly bugs make it so that you can't experience the\
      \ full story, and the controls ported from VR to gamepad/keyboard are terribly\
      \ implemented, and some of the special mechanics used in certain missions are\
      \ just plain annoying.\n\nI'll probably finish the game anyway, someday, maybe...\
      \ just because it's in my Steam Library now.  But I don't recommend it to anyone\
      \ else unless the developers can address the issues I had with it."
