For $1.50 (sale) you can't go too wrong.\n\nIt's basically Where's Waldo but with moving parts and a different target each time. It is the same thing over and over again with more of everything as the levels get harder. The backgrounds also switch from dark to light which can really mess with you depending on the ships you're assigned to look for. Even on Easy mode, I was alternating between finding my target instantly to staring at the screen for the entire time limit and never once seeing any of the ships I was looking for thanks to the background being a color that camouflaged the ONE little thing that would have made my targets stand out on a different background.\n\nHard mode really amps up the number of ships (from 400 to 800) scrolling across the screen and gives you more targets to keep an eye out for. Everything moves faster, too.\n\nYou get a score based on how much time you have left after shooting your last target but that score doesn't seem to do anything or unlock any fun new goodies. There are also VIP ships that show up randomly, but only in hard mode. The game could probably benefit from some power-ups or unlockables.\n\nAs for the other aspects of the game:\n\nMusic/sounds: Only able to turn off or on, no sliders.  Music is actually not too bad, even if it's the same tune forever and ever.\nResolution: I can't find any options in-game for resolution other than the + button in main menu that either makes it fullscreen or some preset windowed resolution that you don't get to choose.\nAchievements: There are NOW achievements pertaining to shooting the VIP ships but there aren't any based on scores, so I have no idea what good scores are.\n\nTo wrap it up: as I opened with, it's a nice time-waster for the price. Simple, it works, and it's chill. Probably a good one for winding down before bed but once you've got all the achievements, there probably isn't much reason to keep going.","timestamp_created":1522530753,"timestamp_updated":1522593413,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571368515491485596","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1522552655,"developer_response":"Thank you very much for the taking the time to review and provide feedback, i will add achievements for the VIP ships and i also add a penalty for shooting citizen ships. very good suggestions, happy easter and have a good day!\n\nUpdate:\nI have now added achievements for VIP targets and also you are limited to shooting 3 civilian ships before your mission fails"}],"cursor":"AoJ4+PbowOICd4SQnQE="}
