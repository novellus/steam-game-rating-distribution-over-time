    about_the_game: "Through a large part of the 20th Century, most coal was transported\
      \ throughout the majority of the United Kingdom in open wagons with a capacity\
      \ of up to 16T. In the North East of England though, a 21t hopper was a more\
      \ common sight. The North Eastern Railway (and then LNER) served many locations\
      \ where the bottom doors were more practical than the side or end doors of traditional\
      \ open wagons. British Railways continued with the building of this design of\
      \ wagon, with the very first design to Diagram 1/141, as represented in this\
      \ pack, being almost identical to the last LNER examples.<br><br>There were\
      \ a total of 1,200 wagons built to this diagram, with the distinctive long LNER\
      \ type brake lever and LNER clasp brakes that were only fitted to one side of\
      \ the vehicle, these vehicles were built with hand brakes only. The hoppers\
      \ were all built during 1949 in 3 lots. Lots 2052 and 2053 were of 500 wagons\
      \ each, built by Cravens in Sheffield and Head Wrightsons at Thornaby respectively.\
      \ The final 200 wagons of Lot 2054 were produced by Teeside Bridge &amp; Engineering\
      \ Ltd of Middlesbrough.<br>Some of these wagons had their bodies replaced in\
      \ the late 1960s with the later, heavier type of body bracing. Further examples\
      \ were included within the large body replacement program that took place in\
      \ the 1970s, but they kept the LNER style brakes until withdrawn from service.<br><br>These\
      \ alterations are not included within this pack, but are mentioned to illuminate\
      \ the changes that happened across the life of these wagons.<br>The dia. 1/141\
      \ HTO 21t Coal Hopper Wagon Pack for Train Simulator includes original pattern\
      \ body and long LNER pattern brake levers in unfitted grey livery. <br><br>Other\
