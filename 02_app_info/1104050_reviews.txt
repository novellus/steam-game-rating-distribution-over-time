Seemed like a good idea at first... when i first swam forward it felt great.  But everything beyond that is not intuitive and feels horrible. \nThe game looks good.  Objects that you can interact with seem repetitive. It seems like an interesting idea. Pick it up on sale and give it a shot, but I definitely don't recommend picking up at full price.\n\nWill recommend for sale price. Can't bring myself to put in a bad review for VR games that seem to have heart.... Hopefully they make improvements.","timestamp_created":1597206425,"timestamp_updated":1597206425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42v268PMCccj3mgI="}
