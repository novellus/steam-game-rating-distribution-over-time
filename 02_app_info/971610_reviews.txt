I survived for 5 minutes my first try and just ended up killing myself (in game) on purpose because I got bored. Its possible that I just got a \"lucky\" set of easy patterns, but I had zero interest in continuing to play in the hopes that maybe it would get slightly harder.\n\n#2 Frame rate, for whatever reason it seemed like maybe i was playing the game in slight slow motion. It looked like it was locked to 45ish FPS, and the gameplay trailer for the game looks to play way faster and smoother than what i was actually experiencing in game. For reference Im running windows 10, gtx 1060 6gb, i5-7600k, 144hz G-Sync monitor\n\nI tried setting my monitor to various refresh rates and resolutions and it didn't help. The game has no settings menu as far as I can tell. And tbh even if the game ran at 2x speed it wouldnt be much more difficult just because of how simplistic the patterns are.\n\nOn the + side, the game looks like it could maybe be a decent party game with a group of friends, even then it is still way too easy IMO unless you made it into a drinking game lol.","timestamp_created":1593984275,"timestamp_updated":1593984851,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472222238779067993","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w9O5kPMCe/2OkwI="}
