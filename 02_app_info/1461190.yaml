    review: "EDIT: After playing nearly one hour, and making almost zero progress,\
      \ I have to say I would not recommend this game in its current form, except\
      \ to elite players. This is very disappointing, and I hope my review shows how\
      \ much I wanted to like this game. But when it's often not possible to see both\
      \ the ball off the flipper and the target at the same time, it's quite difficult\
      \ to gauge shots. And gauging shots is critical in jetPIN, due to the time element\
      \ involved. (An option to zoom in and out might help greatly.) The great probability\
      \ to lose all progress in an instant makes this the most frustrating PC pinball\
      \ I've yet played, and I say this as an original moderator of one of Steam's\
      \ more popular pinball titles. (Somewhat the feeling of climbing a mountain\
      \ in a bucket using only a hammer, if you know what I mean.)\n\nStill, with\
      \ some changes I think this could be a LOT of fun. And I currently intend to\
      \ keep it, if changes are made within the refund period.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\
      Friends, I think we\u2019ve all played some pinball \u201Cgimmick\u201D games.\
      \ Some are fun\u2026..for a bit. Some are well thought out but aren\u2019t quite\
      \ \u201Cthere\u201D. Some really aren\u2019t pinball at all.\n\nAdmittedly,\
      \ I\u2019ve only been playing jetPIN for a few minutes, but I wish to relate\
      \ my first impressions. \n\nFirst, yes, jetPIN is indeed pinball, and I confess\
      \ I\u2019m challenged from the first seconds. The goal is to send the ball up\
      \ through what is basically a flooding gully while evading the rising waters\
      \ and collecting points from bumpers and targets. I'm speaking as a decent pinball\
      \ player with four #1 (strictly) pinball scores in ZP. Yet in three tries, I\u2019\
      ve still not completed the first level of jetPIN. Aiming is such a critical\
      \ aspect, I question if this is a game that beginners will have success with.\
      \ Just whacking the ball is definitely a losing strategy (if, indeed, a strategy\
      \ at all.)\n\nPlaying more, I can see that much of my difficulty has been in\
      \ playing in portrait mode. Because of the nature of jetPIN, portrait mode appears\
      \ to actually show LESS of the table at any moment than does landscape. I'd\
      \ suggest trying both to determine your preference.\n\nAn issue that will stop\
      \ many pinballers in their tracks is the lack of option to rebind keys. In fact,\
      \ there are really no options at all for gameplay. As well, the physics aspect\
      \ is acceptable, but nothing special. (About what one might expect at this price,\
      \ and w/o other options.) Considering the \"one size fits all\" feel of jetPIN,\
      \ I suppose it's not unexpected for difficulty levels to lack inclusion. (Even\
      \ something as simple as a larger ball and longer flippers for beginners, for\
      \ example.) But unfortunately, there is no provision for the vast range of skills\
      \ displayed by Steam pinball players.\n\nObviously, I\u2019ve not learned strategy\
      \ or nuance yet, and knowing the table(?) seems perhaps even more critical in\
      \ this game than most, as only a quite small section of the map is shown at\
      \ any one moment. And all it takes is one mistake, and you can lose every bit\
      \ of your progress (and more, since the water is rising as you play. The starting\
      \ point is underwater very early on in the game.)\n\njetPIN can be played with\
      \ a controller or a keyboard. Also, in either landscape or portrait mode. Obviously,\
      \ no one should \u201Csit\u201D right out and buy jetPIN on my recommendation\
      \ alone (and I\u2019m not yet sure exactly what my recommendation will ultimately\
      \ be.) Still, if you have $5 to spend, and are interested in a new-ish and challenging\
      \ pinball experience, I\u2019ve paid more for less more than once.\n\nThank\
      \ you."
