    review: "This is one of the worst Steam VR games I have ever played and I have\
      \ played a ton of bad Steam VR games. It's not the worst game, but still horrible.\
      \ The game didn't crash, it ran well, & as far as I know, no viruses were detected.\
      \ However, the core game, if you can call it that, is just horrible. Low effort\
      \ crap. \n\nThe gun doesn't even shoot bullets, just has a laser pointing out\
      \ and a horrible sound when you press trigger. You are floating in space for\
      \ some reason. Everything is blurry, especially the background. Your gun models\
      \ look horrible, maybe it was on clearance at the Unity store. There are flashing\
      \ lights and poor sounds / music. There is nothing artistic about this experience.\
      \ \n\nI'm honestly hoping the dev turns out to be 15 years old, because at least\
      \ then, there's some justification for this low effort crap. Maybe it's a high\
      \ school project for an enterprising student who decided to turn his or her\
      \ weekend learning Unity project for their Computer Science class into a money-making\
      \ proposition on Steam. This probably earned a B on their final project grade,\
      \ but definitely failed at turning a profit. \n\n[b]Rate 2/10.[/b]\n"
