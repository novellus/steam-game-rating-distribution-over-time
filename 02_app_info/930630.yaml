      \ Castle, an abandoned fortress built over a large lake near the River Moss.\
      \ It was taken over by the wildcat Verdauga Greeneyes and his Thousand Eyes\
      \ army of vermin. Upon his untimely demise, his daughter Tsarmina began her\
      \ evil rule. Subjugating the woodland inhabitants of Mossflower, this cruel\
      \ Queen reigned using the army of a Thousand Eyes to collect food tribute from\
      \ the peaceful forest dwellers. In her arsenal was a very special living weapon.\
      \ A murderous insane creature kept deep in the bowels of the castle. Captured\
      \ by her father, Gloomer the Greatrat was rightly feared by all. In these ancient\
      \ days lived mighty heroes such as Martin the Warrior and Gonff Prince of Mousethieves.<br><br><br>Now\
      \ our would be champion, Gillig directed by the otter leader Skipper, has been\
      \ given a very special solo mission. Retrieve an ancient scroll once belonging\

      \ this as an opportunity to prove himself to the otter tribe \u2013 <i>if</i>\
      \ he can overcome his weaknesses.<br><br><br>Your story begins with a descent\
