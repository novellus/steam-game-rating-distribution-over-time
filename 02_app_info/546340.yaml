    review: 'The game basically conists out of three worlds with a tiny amount of
      levels each. My first experience of the game was actually nice, though after
      playing it for a bit I kept noticing what low amount of effort was put into
      actually fixing the Bugs. I was gifted this game, though honestly I would have
      fallen for it and bought it by the screenshots. The art style as I have said
      is amazing, though there''s so many flaws behind it. Here''s a few:

      - You keep getting stuck on edges

      - You die randomly out of nowhere

      - The game crsahes out of nowhere


      Here''s a few more things about it:

      - The mouse/keyboard combination is terribly done. If you fail a level your
      cursor stays in the middle of the screen and annoys you

      - The game takes ages to load

      - Some bugs could have been fixed through a simple playtest, therefor I can''t
      believe an appropriate amount of time was put into the game''s testing whatsoever.
      Making a game is hard though some extents of playtesting are just needed.'
