[b]West of Dead[/b] looked very interesting, with a dark cartoony vibe and they even got [b]Ron Perlmen[/b] to do the voice of the main character. From what was being shown with some interesting gameplay looked very promising and I wanted to try it out. Then it hit me, looks can be deceiving. What I got was a game that had a ton of issues that makes the game not polished in any way.\n\n[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The lightning mechanic was an interesting feature to use to stun enemies. \n[*]The art style and soundtrack are really nice and set the dark atmosphere that the game had. \n[/list] \n\n[b]Cons[/b] \n[list] \n[*]The story is very confusing, nothing makes sense. \n[*]Some melee enemies made the cover feature pointless. \n[*]Gameplay is buggy, there are bugs that can screw you over. \n[*]Every time I picked up a rifle it would show me how to use the weapon on every new run and they were not useful either. \n[*]Not a lot of variety of weapons and most were not even worth using. \n[*]Getting new weapons and abilities is a huge grind. \n[*]Bosses and [b]Outlaws[/b] are either broken or just not that fun. \n[/list]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1] \nThe year is 1888. [b]William Mason[/b] is brought back to life and awakes in a strange bar, there he meets a barkeeper, who tells him that he is in [b]Purgatory[/b] and finds out that he has no memories of who he is. So, he sets out to go and find his memories while fighting enemies and getting answers to his past. \n\nThat is all that I can remember from [b]West of Dead[/b]. The story makes no sense and is entirely forgettable. The characters have nothing special to them in any shape or form and they don’t even speak, all they do is repeat the same textboxes every single time with nothing new to say. They are not even worth interacting with, literally, the only character that actually develops is [b]William[/b] himself and he is also completely forgettable as well. Whenever I got a new memory from him, I forgot about it five minutes later and it never made sense in the first place. I actually forgot about one of the characters, there is this one character called [b]The Preacher[/b], and when I found him, I was like who is this guy? Only to find out it was a character I meet before. \n\nIn all honesty, [b]William[/b] could have just been the only character and nothing would change from the story. It’s just that empty with nothing interesting going on and it’s sad to see that as there are some nice ideas that it had going for it. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1] \n[b]West of Dead[/b] is a top-down shooter with many gameplay issues. There is a cover mechanic where that protects you from getting shot. The problem here is that some enemies are melee-based, so it’s completely thrown out the window with some enemies, as they will actually go through the wall you are behind, which will result in you getting hit. The gameplay is also very buggy, one time I was hit by an enemy in which [b]Whilliam[/b] completely disappeared and it resulted in my death, or when you start a new run you will always get a tutorial on how to use the rifles. The rifles are not really useful as the hitboxes on them were small and sometimes did not hit the target. That is also another issue, the weapons are not really worth using, as I always ended up using the same weapons, [b]Freezer[/b] and [b]Fifth Time Lucky[/b] were the two weapons I went after, no other weapon I came across was worth using. However, getting weapons is a huge grind on its own. To get weapons and abilities, you will need [b]Sin[/b], however, to get that, you will need to kill the enemies that are in the areas, there are two problems with this. The first problem is that the stuff you want to get will cost at least 100, 200, 300, or more [b]Sin[/b] and the second problem is that you will only get a certain amount depending on the area you are in, as there is a limit on how much you can get per level. Games like [b]Dead Cells[/b] will give you many opportunities to get [b]Cells[/b] and the game rewards you for beating the levels in a certain amount of time or killing a certain number of enemies. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2297740981 \nEvery time I died, I felt a pit in my stomach open, as I did not feel encouraged to do another run. I really just wanted to quit, however, I kept playing hoping that something might have shined and made the game fun but to no avail, there was nothing. Sometimes you will fight these mini-bosses called [b]Outlaws[/b] and they are fun to fight when they work. They will either stand still or jump over the cover spots and not fight back. There are also some bosses you will fight and they were ok but not at all memorable and fun. \n\nThe one thing I have to give the game some credit where credit is due is the lighting mechanic. The rooms you will enter will be all dark and you have to light them up to see them. This will stun the enemies and you will have a chance to kill them more easily. \n\n[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1] \nMy favourite thing about [b]West of Dead[/b] is the art style. I love the dark cartoony atmosphere that the game has going it felt. It shows us how dark and messed up [b]Purgatory[/b] actually is, something that I enjoyed. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, 16 GB of RAM, and an AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50. The game does run really well at 60 FPS. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2297740663\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1] \nNow I have to admit that the soundtrack for this game is awesome. I loved the guitar jiggle that would play after every battle you do; it just feels so fresh. The [b]Outlaws[/b] theme is my favourite song to listen to, it’s just a shame that they are sometimes buggy to fight against as the theme is just that good. Makes you feel like you really are in a fight with a gunslinger. \n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1] \nI really wanted to like [b]West of Dead[/b]. It had promise and potential to be a unique game out of the [b]Rouge-Like[/b] genre. However, what I was presented with was a game that had a forgettable story, broken combat, weapons that are not worth using, pointless grinding, and a feeling of just wanting to quit playing. While I was writing this review, I was kind of frustrated because the game just has all these problems and it really sucks. I will admit that some care and passion was put into this game and getting [b]Ron Perlmen[/b] to voice [b]William Mason[/b] does show that they tried. The issue here is that there can only be so much charm and promise that a game can have, that it falls short of what the actual product is. I want to like this game, I really do but with what I was shown, I just can’t find myself to play it again, rather, I want to forget about it.","timestamp_created":1609832438,"timestamp_updated":1609870928,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55627518892288208","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiJ3y6fYCf9nQwAI="}
