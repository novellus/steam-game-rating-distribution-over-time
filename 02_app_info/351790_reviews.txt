Above average art, an okay premise, and some interesting character interactions are marred by poor UX and a pretty bad story. This barely skirts the edge of acceptability.\n\nInvisible apartment is technically one (prohibitively short) VN, but is also the name of the series, with a prologue and two sequels being folded in as DLC to the original. It's recommended by the devs to buy the other games as DLC, so that's what I did, and I'll be reviewing all of them here together because of that.\n\nThe \"presentation\" or UX of this VN immediately stands out as...atrocious. It was made using a custom-designed engine for some unknown reason (Ren'py has been free and widely available for years, first created nearly 15 years ago according to Wikipedia), and lacks some really, [i]really[/i] basic features that I could put together in a freaking WinForm application in less than a day. These features include things like a \"backlog,\" configuration settings (text speed, audio levels), skip/auto functionality...these are all extremely, extremely basic things that even other VNs using really rudimentary engines (like Himawari) support. About 10 minutes into the first story (IA 0) the game crashed on me repeatably, and I found through the forums that this was because of the music being on. I turned it off and never decided to turn it back on. You get a set of saves per game, but it's only six each--not enough to cover all of the choices available for the last two stories.\n\nThe art's a bit better than the standard for OELVNs. As you can see from the main page it's set in a futuristic world, so the clothing designs are usually interesting. The artist also clearly has a penchant for hair, because the main character goes through like 5 different styles (usually at least 2 (sometimes 3) during a story). It's a nice touch in a medium where a character frequently has one outfit, two if they have a route.\n\n\"Gameplay mechanics\" are standard VN fare--you pick choices. It treats \"wrong\" choices very strangely however: during the earlier VNs (and possibly during the later ones, I didn't go through every permutation), when you pick a wrong choice you travel down that path for a little bit, then when it ends poorly you're immediately booted back to the point of the original choice, with the \"right\" choice already chosen for you. It's very disorienting. The story has a habit of disorienting scene shifts during the regular story as well. Speaking of which...\n\nThere are a few different elements to the story that are worth separating: the writing quality itself (things like grammar and syntax), the plot (or the sequence/design/logic of events that you go through), and then the \"execution\" of story elements or a character's portrayal.\n\nThe first is substandard ESL, and I apologize if that sounds harsh, but as a writer it's always been very obvious. It makes the experience feel stilted and a little unemotional. After a scene shift, frequently a character will painstakingly describe the process that brought them to their new location in a manner that doesn't at all fit an \"internal monologue\" a person might have.\n\nThe second is mediocre to poor. If you look at the entire plot across the series, it's made up of a bunch of actors putting each other into situations and then doing nothing when they're there. Entire swaths of time where a character has the ability to act, but does nothing. Their actions belie their motivations. The main character comes off as...I can't think of the word right now, but several times she takes an action and then, 5 minutes in real-world time, she goes back and does what she was avoiding with her first action. One character is said to have been \"building a personal army,\" but they do absolutely nothing with this so-called army so this (also) feels half-baked. Spoilers here, but the entire \"conflict\" is resolved by a third party with no interaction with any of the \"main\" characters until the last 5 minutes or so of the final VN--he's acting largely of his own volition, and he has no reason whatsoever to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe final aspect, the portrayal of these events or characters, was okay. At one point a character spends a bit of time interacting with a surveillance AI in the shape of a parrot, and for some reason I found these sections pretty funny. Most character interactions feel okay, though a couple times they're deliberately molded to fit a plot contrivance and feel bad. The specifics of certain scenes also work okay-to-well, tying back to things (characters or events) across each VN.\n\nAll in all this was a very weak experience.\n\nI don't always do this, but considering the play time and the price for everything, I feel compelled to caution against getting this at full price. It's not worth it. I would say 50% off at max, personally. Even though this is incredibly short, for the majority of the experience I really was not interested. A few moments during IA 2 produced some intrigue that engaged me, but even that fell away with the lackluster ending.","timestamp_created":1548486348,"timestamp_updated":1548486348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwztG+xOgCe8KeuQE="}
