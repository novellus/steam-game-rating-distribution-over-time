I don't play a lot of horror games but this one struck me as being pretty formulaic and straight-forward in terms on mechanics and game-play.  You can't do much against the \"bad things\" so it is mainly running and hiding while trying to progress.\n\nThe main goal is to not die (surprise) and find out what happened to your daughter.  You do this by finding her diary pages and finding things to help you progress through the hospital.  That's it really.  The layout changes randomly so it can be pretty disorienting.  Is it scary?  I would say it is more tense then scary but it does have it's jump scare moments.  The game only lets you save in certain places and with the layout being random, it can sometimes be a while before you can save so it can get somewhat frustrating too.  Not the best system but does make the game a little more tense.\n\nThe game has some pretty big problems though.  The controls are really bad.  Trying to equip an item usually means pressing the appropriate key 4 to 5 times.  No clue why, no other game I've played has had that problem so assume it will happen for everyone.  Also I ran into a bug that made me lose my saved game.  I could load it but the screen was black and I couldn't do anything.  Of course it happened when I was pretty far into the game.  If you play you might want to back up your saves (AppData/LocalLow/GameMechanics/The Hat Man _ Shadow Ward).  The game is very short though so it wasn't that big a deal in the end.\n\nSo the game is simple, short, not that scary and is also held back by outdated graphics, bad controls, poor save mechanics and a potential save bug that can make you lose your progress.  It's not the worst game but I certainly wouldn't recommend it.","timestamp_created":1609131805,"timestamp_updated":1609131805,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lNnu0/YCc6X/vQI="}
