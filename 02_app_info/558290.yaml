    review: "This pack actually features the most sedate songs so far released in\
      \ a challenge pack, and they're all songs from J-Punch. Honestly, this one is\
      \ subjective, though. Some people prefer more calming songs, while others (like\
      \ me) have a greater preference for a more frenetic experience.\n\nIf you loved\
      \ J-Punch's 5 songs that are included in the base game, you'll also love this\
      \ pack too. 3 new songs, and as advertised, soothing and mellow for you to bop\
      \ along to. This also means that the note charts are far less frantic than the\
      \ earlier challenge packs - but there is still ample enough challenge for you\
      \ to hit the patterns accurately, especially if you're a highscorer. For this\
      \ I have to single out the charting for Make It Blue for particular praise,\
      \ as it combines triplet patterns with straight beat patterns.\n\nThat's not\
      \ to say the songs are bad - rather, like all the J-Punch songs that were in\
      \ the base game, they were [strike]ludicrously[/strike] ridiculously ([i]poor\
      \ choice of word[/i]) catchy. I still have some snippets of the songs stuck\
      \ in my head, even now as I type this.\n\nPersonally, I found this to be the\
      \ first pack where the items are actually the better of the two offerings (of\
      \ songs versus items). The item that increases the amount of time spent on the\
      \ lanes, Impatience Overwhelming, is a solid aid to highscorers who want to\
      \ remain on one lane. The other item that I like, which is named after the winner\
      \ of the Metronomicon Speedrun Tournament, is a fond memory of the speedrun\
      \ fun I had during the tournament. \n[url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeTAkesjC3v4NNk8j_3QGJw8lcGa9btso]Playlist\
      \ of tourney videos here[/url]\n\n[h1]When to buy[/h1]\nStill, it's only $2.\
      \ You can't go wrong getting this if you love the game and want to support the\
      \ developers, like I do.\n\n[h1][b]9.0/10[/b][/h1]"
