      \ /><br><br>Adventures of a Dragon tells a story about tolerance, acceptance,\
      \ and personal growth. Fun and playful humor guides the player through an amazing\
      \ tale, which brings the main character to make discoveries about their sexuality,\
      \ personality, and the concept of redemption. They must make choices that impact\
      \ the ending of the game, some of which lead to one ending, which allows the\
      \ player to become immersed in the world of the game. The distinctive personality\
      \ of the main character lets the player empathize with their struggles, both\
      \ physical and emotional. This makes the game much more immersive, and helps\
      \ the player to better understand their character. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/770370/extras/kickstarter_story.png?t=1591109699\"\

      notes: Sexual content exists within the game, however it is optional. All the
        nudity is located in "Lewd journal", the nudity is not obscene. Sex scenes
        are more silly than erotic and don't show actual sexual content. This game
        is Ecchi, not Hentai.
