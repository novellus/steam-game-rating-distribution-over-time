The setting and especially the score is quite impressive. It's obvious they wanted to try something different and seeing all the effort going into this, it is quite a shame that I had little to no enjoyment out of this one.\n\nThis time around they try themselves at a more traditional game-type of story-telling that, sadly, doesn't fit well with the overall design of the game. There are a lot of scripted scenes that feel jarring, there is little to no exploration, the fight system is quite annoying, the story isn't particularly interesting and it is definitely an action setting and not a horror one. \n\nSome people seemed to enjoy this one a lot and it does bring a wave of fresh air, but I was glad when it ended, so sadly this is going to be the only part of the game that I cannot recommend to anyone.","timestamp_created":1606172285,"timestamp_updated":1606172285,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hIPV+/UCcdWSsAI="}
