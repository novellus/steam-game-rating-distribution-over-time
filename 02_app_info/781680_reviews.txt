A roguelike arpg with a unique protagonist?  Sign me up!  Unfortunately I ran into issues from minute one that had me uninstalling after only ten minutes of frustration.\n\n  My issues started in the tutorial of all places (never a good sign) where I found the entire concept of separate interact and combat modes in this style of game to be really jarring.    Not being able to pick up a key, open a door or read a note with my weapons drawn and needing to stop, put weapons away and then interact just felt horribly awkward, still I was willing to go with it.   Shortly in to the tutorial I was given an alternate suit of armour to try a second class and was then asked to kill a wizard type enemy.   The game equipped the new suit of armour and changed my class but didn't actually equip a replacement weapon on my character, so I couldn't  fight the tutorial enemy.   It's quite possible I had missed something, but this being the tutorial ,  I would have hoped it would be a little less obtuse.\n\n Deciding to start the main game sealed it's fate.   I immediately encountered what I can only assume was a game breaking bug as I was unable to advance the game beyond the initial village area.  I couldn't talk to any of the NPC's despite obvious talk to me yellow exclamation marks above their heads , or find anywhere to go to start exploring the dungeon. After five or six minutes of messing about I  had had enough and uninstalled + refund requested.   A real pity.","timestamp_created":1553162190,"timestamp_updated":1553162190,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570227324962615967","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1553178003,"developer_response":"First of all thank you very much to take your time and leave this feed back. I'm sorry to hear this was not the game you expected to find. Just last night I updated the tutorial and, indeed something break, but I'm investigating this issue. I'll try to fix it as as soon as possible."}],"cursor":"AoJwy8frz+kCfuu+vQE="}
