The gameplay is like a two-tracked lane-defense game, with a lot of power-ups, upgrades, and unlocks. It has a solid series of several tutorial levels, although owners may quit playing even before completing them.\n\nThe game is off-putting with its confusing mix of item upgrades, limited controls, and odd menus. For example, the game never describes the vital \"pack-up building\" action, which is also inaccessible on the gamepad controller. Overall, this dry game lacks a certain fun-factor. To illustrate just how many people get turned off by this game, only 3.5% of game owners get the achievement that is automatically obtained shortly after the campaign tutorial levels!\n\nIf you can finally get into the gameplay, then the levels offer rewards for replaying. And there are a lot of levels in the campaign, then steam workshop levels to play. I enjoyed the pacing and narrative that encouraged playing them again. There were a decent musical tracks and voiceovers. I thought the bizzaro theme was sufficiently good to make up for the limited gameplay.\n\nI played on Ubuntu 18.10 & 19.10 with radeon mesa graphic drivers. I used an xbox-type gamepad controller (not recommend) and keyboard-mouse control. This game uses the Unity game engine, with rather long level-loading times. The game requires 430MBs of diskspace. I would recommend this game for gamers who are looking for a quirky gaming experience, who will take a chance on an inexpensive price tag. Wish there were more inexpensive games on steam that tried such an experimental approach as this one.","timestamp_created":1541250318,"timestamp_updated":1588533840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.58985668420791626","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiNn/7fECd6v6rQE="}
