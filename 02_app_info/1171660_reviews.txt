The combat and challenges become more difficult as you progress and you get items that completely change the way the game is played. The bosses are challenging and you feel rewarded after finally beating them. The time stop mechanic is one of the coolest time-based abilities I've seen that does't make your character brokenly powerful. 10/10 you will die, and enjoy doing it.","timestamp_created":1601613834,"timestamp_updated":1601613834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514285683631896973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8fTn8/QCfJOqpQI="}
