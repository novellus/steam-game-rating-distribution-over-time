It is well made, but has its flaws.\n\nPros:\n-Challenging gameplay that mixes things up\n-A story that I would like to see more of\n-XB360 Controller support\n\nCons:\n-Incredible difficulty spike at level 28. I can't get past this.\n-I really don't like the main theme. It is a grating tune that repeats far too quickly and gets old really fast. Fortunately, the music changes later on and at least it can be turned off.\n-No windowed support or resolution support, it will launch at your desktop resolution.\n\nI cannot recommend this at full price, but at a sale price it is worth a try. Drop me a note if you can film making it past level 28, I wonder if I am missing something obvious.","timestamp_created":1542830005,"timestamp_updated":1549411223,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.599761784076690674","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43eCG4OgCf7K2rwE="}
