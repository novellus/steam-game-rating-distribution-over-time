    review: "[b]McRogue[/b] is a voxel based brawler/overhead shooter rogue-like.\
      \ It's listed as lite but I see no permanent upgrades. But, that's neither here\
      \ nor there.\n\nRecently the developer posted an update stating he was no longer\
      \ [i]legally[/i] allowed to work on this game due to taking a job at a new company.\
      \ He stated it simply wasn't financially feasible. \n\nNow, I LOVE the way this\
      \ game looks and I like the way it feels. It's responsive and smooth. I'd love\
      \ to see this game get completed or at the very least get more updates. The\
      \ first boss alone is really fun. You must activate a teleporter and defend\
      \ it from a swathe of robots and a giant mechanical snake. \n\nIt seems like\
      \ a good foundation for a really phenomenal palette cleanser/time waster. I\
      \ mean that in the most sincere way. In fact I think it could be something special\
      \ given proper attention. But at this time (and I will do a new review should\
      \ anything change) I simply can't recommend this in it's current state with\
      \ the developer essentially unable to work on it.\n\nI do suggest following\
      \ it though, should you be a fan of the genre. \n\n[quote]More here \u2014 [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/28295405/]Station\
