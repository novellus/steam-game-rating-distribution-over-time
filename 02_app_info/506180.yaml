      \nThe full version is an experience similar to Oculus Dreamdeck, so expect about\
      \ 5-20 minutes of gameplay in the full version for the price of a large candy\
      \ bar. This is a demo that is available for free, and contains one fractal and\
      \ no editor that should give you a pretty good jist of what to expect."
