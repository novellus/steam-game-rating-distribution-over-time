    review: Unfortunately, this is probably the worst game from the developer GDNomad.
      First of all, there is no plot at all and the gameplay mostly revolves around
      our character wandering around hellish maze-like dungeon solving puzzles that
      do not make any sense either. There are hardly any elements that instill horrors
      and the overall concept isn't that mind blowing either.
