    about_the_game: Welcome to Spider Lander DX.  A loving echo of games from the
      80's and familiar to those who loved classics such as Lunar Rescue and Lunar
      Lander.  Spider Lander has some interesting physics including swinging by a
      spider thread to your mothership as part of landing and then more into the familiar
      thrust and position to find a landing spot.  You then have to rescue at least
      one of the poor guys stuck on the planet (lots of extra points if you can rescue
      more than one!) and escape back to the safety of your spider mothership.   Like
      the classic arcades of old, it will keep on getting harder and you'll hopefully
      want just-one-more-go.  Enjoy!

    review: "I'm a big fan of retro games, and Spider Lander pays homage to the 1979\
      \ classic Lunar Lander. The aim of the game is to lower yourself down towards\
      \ the surface of the planet, land on one of the randomly generated platforms,\
      \ pick up inhabitants and fly back up towards the the space craft. All the while\
      \ avoiding both static and moving space objects which will damage your shield\
      \ and eventually cause you to explode and start again.\n\nYou begin tethered\
      \ to the ship, swinging left and right, but will detach when you are low enough\
      \ down.  You will need to adjust your speed and angle of descent skillfully\
      \ to make it to the platforms. A high level of precision is required to land\
      \ successfully. Adding to the challenge is limited fuel - leaving not too much\
      \ room for repeated adjustments of speed and angle of landing. \n\nUpon landing,\
      \ one of the little fellas will run towards your ship, and you will gain bonus\
      \ fuel. This is not just to fly back up to the ship, but also to attempt to\
      \ rescue additional dwellers by landing on the other platforms. These will give\
      \ bonus points at the end of the level. You can also get points bonus for zero\
      \ damage.\n\nEach level adds more and more objects - you need patience, accuracy\
      \ and just a bit of luck too sometimes to complete later levels.\n\nI heartily\
      \ recommend this game, because it's challenging, nostalgia-inducing, with nice\
      \ Jean-Michel Jarre-like synth sounds and effects, and gives a high level of\
      \ self satisfaction completing the ever more difficult levels. A steal at 99\
      \ cents!"
