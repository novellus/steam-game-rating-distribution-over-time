      \ lacking in some parts, if you're looking for a light, non-serious game to\
      \ play through real quick, I would highly suggest this one. The art and sound\
      \ is on point, so with some more detail and attention added to the story, it\
      \ would really stick out and be even better!\u201D<br>8/10 \u2013 <a href=\"\
