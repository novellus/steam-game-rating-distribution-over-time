    review: 'I professionally teach C# (among other languages) and a lot of the phrasing
      and methods in this game lines up well with our introduction to C#. This will
      not make you a master programmer or even make you able to write a basic program,
      however, it will improve your comfort with reading code and basic programming
      concepts while telling you a creative and entertaining story.


      The story does end on a cliffhanger, but hopefully a sequel will pick up where
      this left off and explore other programming frontiers and more of the game''s
      world.'
