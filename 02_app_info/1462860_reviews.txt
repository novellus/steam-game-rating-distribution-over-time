I came across Dots! The cover of this game immediately attracted my attention, going into the review of the game, I saw a very interesting picture in the form of the same type of game, but still decided to buy it. As soon as I entered the game, I immediately liked the design of the game. After the first 10 levels of the game, I couldn't get away from it. I forgot about all the problems and just sat enjoying the gameplay. The game is very relaxing and addictive, and you want to play again and again. The game has more than 1000 levels, the game is not as easy as it seems at first glance. For its price, it's just a cannon!","timestamp_created":1606057397,"timestamp_updated":1606057397,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sOGe+PUCfa7yrwI="}
