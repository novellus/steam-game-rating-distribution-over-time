      - hope you enjoy!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>About the game</strong></h2><br>Sanctum
      Breach is a challenging top down ARPG in the vein of games such as Diablo 2,
      Path of Exile and Grim Dawn. It is currently in the early stages of development,
      however, there is still a ton of content waiting to be discovered! The game
      will primarily focus on Endgame content and Character Development, build versatility
      and replayability.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Story</strong></h2><br>The world
      is falling into disarray as the device used for millennia by the Gods, the Auxillium
      Porta, has been destroyed in a conflict between the Gods and their offspring,
      of which you are one. The gods sole purpose for the Auxillium Porta was to intervene
      in the ways of Man and prevent them from ultimately damning themselves and the
      world in which they inhabit. Now you must work to unite the shattered device.
      By finding its fragments scattered across the universe you hope to undo the
      damage your siblings wrought and carry on your Father's legacy.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Character
      Development</strong></h2><br>There are a myriad of different methods that can
      help you to diversify and strengthen you character. Gold can be found by killing
      enemies encountered on your travels and spent in the Goblin's Gift, after you
      complete his quest. This grants you points in Resistances and Damages.<br><br><img

      /><br><br>When you level up you gain a point to be spent in the Passive Trees.
      The Passive Trees have nodes for every pretty much every Stat in the game and
      are split up into 3 separate trees. You can allocate points anywhere but must
      follow the paths and Cluster point requirements. At the end of each Cluster
      is a Keystone which has a dramatic effect, such as &quot;on hit&quot;, or &quot;on
      damage taken&quot;. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194770/extras/DefensivePassiveTree.png?t=1608473665"

      /><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194770/extras/UtilityPassiveTree.png?t=1608473665"
      /><br><br>Skills can also be levelled up and gain a natural increase in Damage
      upon doing so. They also gain a point to be spent in their individual Skill
      Trees. These trees enhance the Skill in a multitude of ways, with 8 minor nodes
      that other various stat increases, 4 major nodes that modify the skills functionality,
      and then 4 augment nodes that further enhance that modification. These nodes
      must be unlocked sequentially. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194770/extras/SkillDevelopmentDescSS.jpg?t=1608473665"
      /><br><br>Items come in 8 different rarities, some of which have powerful and
      unique Skills associated with them. They can either modify current skills or
      add an effect to the character, such as &quot;cast a Fireball on hit&quot;,
      or &quot;reduce cooldown on kill&quot;.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194770/extras/RelicDescSS.png?t=1608473665"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Endgame Content</strong></h2><br>Endgame Content
      is the major focus of the game and there is a plethora to choose from, so everyone
      can find something they love!<br><br>Conquests are a series of encampments with
      a selection of thematic enemies and a mini boss. Once they have been defeated
      the player will face a super boss in a 1v1 encounter. Conquests also have a
      random modifier applied to them, such as &quot;immune to Fire damage&quot;.
      <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194770/extras/ConquestSS.jpg?t=1608473665"
      /><br><br>Mythical Trials offer a unique challenge based on the type of Mythical
      creature. For example in &quot;Flight of the Phoenix&quot; the player must hunt
      down the Phoenix and fight his multiple phases, after which he is reborn stronger
      and more deadlier than before. &quot;Maze of the Minotaur&quot; sees the player
      tracking the Minotaur down through his maze, constantly alert for his &quot;Shadow
      Form&quot;, which cannot be killed, and must be evaded!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194770/extras/MythicalTrialsSS.jpg?t=1608473665"
      /><br><br>Boss Encounters are a 1v1 fight with a Super Boss. Each boss has it's
      own thematic arena and drops a multitude of loot upon death, including specific
      Relic items!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194770/extras/DragonSS.jpg?t=1608473665"
      /><br><br>Arena is a series of 10 waves against a multitude of different enemies.
      Be careful, it's easy to become overwhelmed because each wave the enemies gain
      a damage and health buff!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194770/extras/ArenaSS.png?t=1608473665"

    review: "The game is in it's early stages of development but I quite enjoy it.\
      \ It has a similar feel as Reign of Darkness except it's a diablo-esque top\
      \ down rpg. There are a few issues now and again but nothing game breaking which\
      \ is surprising since It's in Alpha. \n\nPersonally I think the Creator has\
      \ done a wonderful job with how far along the game is being in the very beginner\
      \ stages of Alpha and all. I'm looking forward to future updates. :)"
