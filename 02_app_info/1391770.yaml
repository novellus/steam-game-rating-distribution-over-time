    about_the_game: You play a red Octopus, enjoying life in your very own inflatable
      pool. Unfortunately for you, Octopus invaders have infiltrated your peaceful
      serenity. To remove them, you can <strong>slam</strong> into the offending rascals,
      simply hold down the mouse on your player, aim, drag to build up power, then
      release the mouse to '<strong>slam</strong>' ! <strong>Only</strong> Octopodes
      of the same <strong>colour</strong> will disappear when they collide. The aim
      of the game is to reclaim your territory, clear all the enemies from your arena
      before the time runs out. Obstacles and environments change as you progress
      through the levels, watch out for scatter <strong>bombs</strong> and <strong>portals</strong>,
      sometimes they can help, other times they can be a hindrance. The game is a
      mouse controlled single player arcade experience, vibrant and easy to pick up
      and play, <strong>harder</strong> to master, flicking fun for all the family
      !
