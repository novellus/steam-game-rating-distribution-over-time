But for those of you who already know what the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] is about, the game obviously takes place in Maggie Dale's second year at the Gail Pilgrim Space Academy where there's more academic life and the usual snooping and getting into trouble that's endemic of youth culture, but this time, Maggie has unwittingly unleashed the full potential of her mind, discovering fascinating facts about some of her fellow cadets. Gail Pilgrim, as expected, is still the adventuress at heart despite living a comfortable life as Chancellor of the academy that bears her name and Ambassador of the Galactic Union, and sets out to conduct an internal investigation of the Space Wardens on Union Station in the Alpha Centauri system after receiving a tip from the villain in [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Year 1[/i] that there's corruption within the Space Wardens who apparently don't seem to be any better than the Jovian Astrolaw Commission the Space Wardens replaced.\n\n[h1] Graphics and Sound[/h1]\n\nNo different from [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Year 1[/i].\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n\nThe classes featured in [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Year 2[/i] make this the game with the most replay value of any game in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i], and is further helped by the fact that the player can earn a much larger number of achievements by using different methods for two of the classes featured.  There's also a hands-on learning experience that makes for a great scene, proving that education sometimes can be fun!\n\nConsistent with [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Year 1[/i], Maggie can respond to her instructors with humorous answers to their questions. (This is at the expense of getting a lower grade, so players are advised to save their games before Maggie goes to class.)\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n\nAs with most games in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i], trying to write about negatives in the game is a prime of example of trying to grasp for straws. The worst things that can be said about [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Year 2[/i], is that the story is far too good for an indie game made with the [i]RPG Maker[/i] engine. (The [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] should have been made into a AAA game a long time ago!) Players will not be able to express their fervor for [i]Space Pilgrim Academy: Year 2[/i] by crafting badges for their profile.\n\nAs with any game in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] (and likely any game made with [i]RPG Maker[/i], the player has to be one of the chosen few people on Steam who have been granted the magical powers to be able to take and upload screenshots to Steam without the use of the Steam overlay. (Although it's possible that these powers have been planted into people's brains by a mad scientist, but nothing has been proven so far.)\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nApart from [i]Space Pilgrim Episode I: Alpha Centauri[/i], this author hates how all of his reviews for games in the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] have to be written with ulterior motives. Do you know the saying \"you couldn't make this stuff up if you tried\"? Well guess what? The author wrote this review in order to fulfill some of the criteria of Steam's 2019 Summer Event. Besides, who's going to read a review of a sequel to a game that isn't a whole lot different that it's predecessor game(s)?\n\n[h1]The honest word of Il Pallino...
