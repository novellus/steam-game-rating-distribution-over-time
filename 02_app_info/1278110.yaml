    review: "[h1]Top Notch Recommendation! Fans of Quarantine, Crazy Taxi and one\
      \ of my all time favorites--Cruis'n USA will feel right at home with Death Taxi\
      \ 3000. This game delivers! Great music, sleek controls, immersive qualities\
      \ and passengers.. so many passengers![/h1]\n\nAs a big fan of both the style\
      \ and music of [i]outrun, retrowave, vaporwave and synthwave[/i] found myself\
      \ powerless from purchasing this title. I just had to. It called out to my soul.\
      \ And I got to say, I am so stoked I did. Best 10 bucks spent in sometime!\n\
      \n[b]It's a blast to play and just soak in.[/b] For me it's part game, part\
      \ music player, part digital artwork. Whenever I power it up, I become immersed--living\
      \ out my 80's outrun fantasy of drifting around the streets of Tokyo in my taxi\
      \ with my synth tunes turned up to 11. It's just an incredible feeling and if\
      \ you are a fan of the style, the music or retro racers, you'll be captivated\
      \ and enthralled by DT3000.\n\n[i]Fair warning.[/i] \n\nWhile this game is definitely\
      \ inspired by Quarantine, even carrying the word \"Death\" in it's title--there\
      \ is no guns, blood or real deaths to be had. You can definitely beat up your\
      \ ride. I haven't fully experimented with the damage mechanics but can say after\
      \ hitting a few objects, my windshield gets cracked and my steering veers to\
      \ one side at which I usually b-line my way back to my garage for repairs. It\
      \ might be possible to damage your vehicle so badly its unable to continue on,\
      \ I just haven't tested that out. But I can't kill people or even die, so there's\
      \ no death to be had. \n\nBottom line--it shares some aspects with Quarantine\
      \ but ultimately they are completely different (both incredible in their own\
      \ rights!). To me, it feels more similar to Crazy Taxi with a sweet outrun/retrowave\
      \ vibe that hearkens back to the 90's racers of old. I simply LOVE it. \n\n\
      [b]A few things I like worth noting[/b]\n[list]\n[*]-[b]Music.[/b] Easily the\
      \ #1 thing I love about this game. It needs a Soundtrack DLC pronto! Very good\
      \ synth tunes.\n[*]-[b]Visual Presentation.[/b] You'll look at the screenshots\
      \ and think \"man, that looks like ass\" but trust me; once you enter the cockpit\
      \ and fire up your engine, you become completely immersed as you would any modern\
      \ racer.\n[*]-[b]Procedural Generation.[/b] Every time you leave the garage,\
      \ the weather will be different, time of day, passengers in need of rides or\
      \ potential illegal contraband delivered. Not sure if the city is generated\
      \ but it's ok due to its size--it's HUGE. \n[*]-[b]Career Mode.[/b] A nice touch\
      \ to the game that caught me by surprise. You start out from nothing and have\
      \ to earn money the hard way to accumulate star ratings and cash that can in\
      \ turn be used to upgrade your ride. Very fun and rewarding. \n[/list]\n\n\n\
      [b]Some things I'd like to see improved or added[/b]\n[list]\n[*]-[b]Steam integration.[/b]\
      \ Not 100% but it seems absent. Dev said on forum that you can use Steam's f12\
      \ for screenshots. As of time of writing this review, I've been unable to do\
      \ that. Hopefully that gets sorted out eventually. \n[*]-[b]Steam Cheavo's.[/b]\
      \ Though dev has expressed interest in possibly adding some down the road. Would\
      \ be awesome!\n[*]-[b]Music doesn't auto-play soundtracks.[/b] I reported this\
      \ to the dev and it seems it was design choice. Kind of a bummer as the music\
      \ is a huge drawl for me. It's not a deal breaker, you simply have to start\
      \ each song as you are driving using F keys. \n[*]-[b]More incentive for Career\
      \ Mode.[/b] Career mode while I commended the game for having it as I wasn't\
      \ expecting it, seems light on incentive to play it past simply upgrading your\
      \ ride. After an hours time, I nearly maxed out all my parts. After that, there's\
      \ little to inspire me to continue playing it. Dev did say that he might add\
      \ more options to increase difficulty, increase upgrade requirements and stuff\
      \ like that to help extend the gameplay for the mode. I'd love to see things\
      \ like being able to buy different interior views, interior decor (like a dancing\
      \ hula girl on the dashboard), different taxi's (maybe even unconventional vehicles\
      \ like spaceships or something silly) and things of this nature. Just more unlocks\
      \ in general that are worthwhile and fun. \n[*]-[b]Lacking certain visuals that\
      \ would be nice to have.[/b] Again, something I love about the game also carries\
      \ some desire to it. The visuals are awesome--don't mistake me but I would of\
      \ liked to see street lights that actually lit up or headlight/brakelights on\
      \ other vehicles. Just little thing details I felt got missed but this is something\
      \ that can be improved upon down the road and by no means takes away from the\
      \ otherwise awesome game.\n[*]-[b]Might be cumbersome for some to get working[/b].\
      \ Fortunately, I was able to get this game up and running without having to\
      \ download any weird programs or drivers though I've read some might need to\
      \ download DDOS box or something like that. Could be wrong but I did read a\
      \ few folks had issue with the game running on their system. Again, for me,\
      \ it was just like any other Steam game. Downloaded it and played it for 10\
      \ hours straight. Still a noteworthy con. \n[/list] \n\n[h1]All in all like\
      \ I said--this game DELIVERS and has some very strong outrun/vaporwave vibes.\
      \ If that's your jam, you'll be in heaven like I am.[/h1] \n\n[b]It pains me\
      \ that this title isn't more popular.[/b] Hopefully word gets out and people\
      \ are able to check it out because it's totally worth it and near criminal to\
      \ go on ignored. [b]It's a masterpiece![/b] \n\n[i]Thanks Coconut Pizza and\
      \ best wishes on your future endeavors! Keep up the amazing work.[/i]"
