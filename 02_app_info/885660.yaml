    review: 'It is such a shame that there isn''t REAL-TIME access to the Telemetry
      DATA..


      It would have made it so much more usable for those who are into DIY building
      projects for 3d Motorbike Motion Simulators.


      The telemetry DATA set is EXCATLY what is need to make such a Physical 3d Motion
      Simulator act much like the REAL LIFE MotoGP bikes / riders..


      The people behind the SRT software CLAIM that is is ONLY possible to get access
      to the Telemetry DATA AFTER the game HAS RUN,  as a DATA set, and it is NOT
      possible to get REAL-TIME access..


      BUT I know for a FACT that it IS possible to get the Telemetry DATA in REAL-Time..


      Several apps / programs do show the Telemetry DATA that is Broadcasted in UDP
      in REAL-TIME from MotoGP18.


      Fx.  the Android app ''SimDashboard''  clearly shows a lot of Telemetry DATA
      from MotoGP in REAL-TIME..'
