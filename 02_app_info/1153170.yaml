      /><br>This game is an homage to <strong>Hbomberguy</strong>''s legendary charity
      stream in support of Mermaids, a UK-based charity and advocacy organization
      that supports gender diverse &amp; transgender children and teenagers!<br><br>In
      this game inspired by a 1999''s classic, you can...<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Fight
      back against thieving Greyman Grifterham and his horde of beavery bullies<br></li><li>Experience
      the thrill (and frustration) of herding low-poly beavers into a bottomless pit<br></li><li>Play
      on &quot;Classic&quot; or &quot;Fair&quot; difficulty<br></li><li>Complete three
      levels and retrieve all money that has been stolen<br></li><li>Beat your personal
      high scores</li></ul><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1153170/extras/Label_How_32.png?t=1570645268"
      /><br>Herd beavers into the pit and collect a total of <strong>$347,137.30</strong>,
      to win the game!<br><br>In Classic difficulty mode, if beavers walk straight
      towards the hole they''ll stop and not fall in! The &quot;trick&quot; is to
      make sure you steer them towards the hole, but not directly at it: Always mind
      the angle at which beavers are walking towards the pit!<br><br>If you manage
      to make a beaver walk closely past the hole, it''s a good chance to give them
      a little scare: Usually, they will jump right in!<br><br><i>For a simpler way
      to bother the beavers, switching to the Fair difficulty mode will make beavers
      run straight into the pit! (If you steer them that way)</i><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1153170/extras/Label_ThankYou_48.png?t=1570645268"

      and everyone who has donated time or money, to make the Mermaids stream the
      success it was!'
