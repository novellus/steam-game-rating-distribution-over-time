The videos don't indicate how difficult it can be to get some of the stars. Completing a level is easy, but if you want to collect the 3 stars hidden in each level you have to be prepared to redo a section over and over until you land it right.\n\nWhat is nice about this game is it lets you choose the difficulty and how much you get out of the game is up to you. It also has a nice setting, and the ability set can be interesting and with fun puzzles that also require reflexes.","timestamp_created":1609311631,"timestamp_updated":1609311631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46dac2fYCd67ZvgI="}
