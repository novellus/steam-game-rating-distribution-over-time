The Good:  Visuals are nice, voice acting is fantastic, story seems interesting (tbd?)  The bad:  Its a standard RNG resource management sim that is absolutely punishing if you make a mistake in layout or resource management.  My first campaign started me off with 1 node (you do find more).  Next go had a handful of nodes right at the start and I actually made very good progress...  right until my repair centers just couldn't seem to get enough resources to actually repair anything...  leaving the factories that I needed to feed the repair centers as piles of scrap.  After fighting that endless cycle for what seemed like forever a meteor finally put me out of my misery and I restarted...  again.  3rd shot - almost no resources, then when I started finding them, I had one show up right between 2 factories, requiring the tear down of both to  access the resource node.  Of course, I did not have the resources to rebuild the factories...  so yeah.  Quit that one out of frustration...  4th go resource nodes were so far away that I didn't have enough resources to actually reach them.  \n\nSo in short, I want to like this game, but if it turns into a \"you have to afk for hours to collect enough resources to play\" I'm going to be uninstalling it and regretting the 30 bucks it cost me to learn the lesson.  Starting another round now...  will let you know how it goes.  Giving it a thumbs up for now, will revisit if frustration meter breaks.","timestamp_created":1607221894,"timestamp_updated":1607221894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549549520015716553","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt/v4mvYCdrfTtwI="}
