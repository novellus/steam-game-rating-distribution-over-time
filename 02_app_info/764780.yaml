    review: 'I first read the webcomic over ten years ago, so I was pleasantly surprised
      to see a visual novel based off of it getting on Steam and bought a copy as
      soon as it was released on Steam. I hoped that maybe I could recommend it to
      friends who''ve never gotten into the series and interest them into picking
      up the comics.


      As much as I wanted to though, I can''t really do that in good conscious, so
      that''s why I had to downvote it.


      Now, it''s not to say that there aren''t any merits. Mayshing''s art and character
      designs continue to be beautifully done. Any fan of the eDepth Angel comics
      will be happy to know that everyone''s characterizations aren''t off in the
      least. If anything, I thought it was refreshing to be able to spend some time
      with Lien and Kolei before they became cyborgs since it was only briefly touched
      upon before. It was also pretty neat to be able to get to know Kolei and Seon
      along with Lien.


      For me though, I think there were two main issues about the game. One was how
      I personally found the mystery solving portion of the game too confusing and
      the other was how there''s too much information that a newcomer wouldn''t know
      but is considered commonplace knowledge for the cast. At the very least, it''d
      probably be recommended to read the game''s About section for any information
      not brought up in the game clearly. (And even then, there''s some stuff you''ll
      miss, such as Angel''s drive to cure ...)


      Sure, the game''s story isn''t exactly straight off of the comic and some things
      actually go down differently, but it''s not really enough to say that it''s
      standalone.


      "[i]So okay, it''s not a standalone game, but if you''ve already read the comic
      then it should be fine to play, right?[/i]"


      Well... perhaps? It''s true that I understood what was going on just fine as
      a comic reader but... it could just be my own ineptitude but I actually found
      the investigation aspect really hard?


      Like, there''s no clear indicator which ones you actually need or if the order
      of the evidences you placed in the timeline is the correct one. I just found
      myself praying that I got it right even though nine times out of ten, I immediately
      got myself in unintended (usually bad) endings.


      If you''re able to understand how to go through those sections or if you have
      the walkthrough at hand then maybe your opinion would probably be more positive.
      But those two flaws didn''t really sit well with me too much to like the game
      enough. :c'
