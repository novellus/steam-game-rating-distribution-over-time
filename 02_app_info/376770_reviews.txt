If you're a parent, please get this game for your children. I've just spent money on the entire H.E. Set here on steam, I loved it so much. I am over 21+ now, and still think about this at least once or twice a year. It's a very educational series, and I implore you to get the others or entire bundle. \n\nThis specific game is the second game in the set, Kindergarten being the first. I remembered the theme song, the colors, the games, and oh my, the stars. I spent hours on this, learning more and educating myself on a lot of things school wasn't effectively teaching me. It kept me wanting to learn, and not even realize I was learning. I would've played all day if my parents let me. Also, good time to note, get this game even if you're not a parent. Get it if you're an adult or teenager on your own, because the cute quirky graphics and games will make you want to get all the stars you can, and I guarantee you won't forget it easily. Yes, it looks a little old, and is absolutley made for first grade children, but like I've gushed about, its a very good game. 10,000,000/10. And hey, H.E., yall should send me a shirt or something if you ever see this so I can gush about it more and wear it on tiktok or something haha. Get ALL the 20+ year olds playing your games.","timestamp_created":1606809532,"timestamp_updated":1606809532,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5vbTjvYCecijtgI="}
