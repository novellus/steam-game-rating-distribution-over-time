Choosing from 1 of 6 leaders, try to create a ratropolis by surviving at least 30 rounds of ever more difficult enemies; after which you may choose to continue playing or end the game as a victory. After each game you are awarded points which unlock new cards, advisors and more, giving the next playthrough new content.\n\nDecide what kind of ruler you will be with the multiple choice event system, which help shape the kingdom you build, through new cards, disasters, opportunities and much more.\n\nIt will be up to the player to decide how their kingdom is built. Proper planning and decision making is important to creating the ideal deck for long term survival.\n\n*personal thoughts*\nRatropolis is still early access, so some things feel unfinished or missing; even so the game was worth its asking price.\n\nI feel as if the developers are passionate about this project.\n\nPlus the little hamtaro ratties are the cutest little babies and I love them so much cus they're just the cutest little things.\n\n8.6/10\n\nThe only thing I wish was different about this game is that the rats would be little sheeple instead but still, amazing game.","timestamp_created":1609866272,"timestamp_updated":1609867455,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4of3k6fYCfd3gwAI="}
