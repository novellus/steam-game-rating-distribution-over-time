    review: "[h1]The Curse of Badly Localized Visual Novels Claims Another Victim...\
      \ [/h1]\n\nSadly, I can't fully recommend this short Boys Love Visual Novel,\
      \ therefore my review can pretty much be considered as a neutral one. I still\
      \ decided to give it a thumbs up because of the touching narrative and the nice\
      \ artwork. The writing, however, just has too many issues and is obviously in\
      \ need of both proofreading and editing.\n\n[b]Yun[/b], our protagonist, is\
      \ deeply concerned about his best friend [b]Max[/b], which got badly injured\
      \ in an accident and lies in a coma ever since. Yun visits him every day, not\
      \ only out of concern, or because he is romantically attracted to him, but also\
      \ because he's able to talk and to interact with his friend since Yun has the\
      \ ability to enter Max's dreams. The only thing Yun needs to do is to fall asleep\
      \ near him.\n\nThere is no obvious clarification as to why he is able to visit\
      \ the dreams of the comatose Max, but one route explains the circumstances for\
      \ that, at least, vaguely. [spoiler]The book Yun reads describes that people\
      \ who are really close to each other are able to enter the other person's dreams,\
      \ as long as the feelings are strong enough. It's more elaborated in the game,\
      \ and the book furthermore explains a way to save the person who lies in a coma.\
      \ The results of that can be witnessed in one ending.[/spoiler] Of course, it's\
      \ up to you if this explanation is satisfying enough or not.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1597353348\n\
      \nTalking about endings, [i][b]May[/b][/i] has several of them, but none can\
      \ be considered as happy or even good to begin with, which is quite depressing\
      \ as you may imagine. Every outcome leaves a bitter taste, there isn't a single\
      \ ending that makes up for it. You should be aware of this before you give this\
      \ Visual Novel a try. I do know that there are people that simply can't handle\
      \ bad endings well if there is no happy end in sight that compensates the reader\
      \ for suffering. The story ultimately revolves around loss, sorrow and how to\
      \ deal with the feeling that you might have only little time left to spend with\
      \ someone very dear to you. Honestly, this is the kind of story that usually\
      \ makes me sob like a little girl, but this time I just felt nothing. No tears\
      \ were shed, and the story touched me only a tiny bit. I'm pretty sure that\
      \ the cause for that is the bad writing that just kind of failed to get me in\
      \ the mood to actually care about the characters.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1593938302\n\
      \nThe English translation, or rather the localization, was handled pretty badly.\
      \ I felt irritation building up while playing [i][b]May[/b][/i]. Don't get me\
      \ wrong, you can catch the meaning perfectly, but especially if a Visual Novel\
      \ tries to pull on your heartstrings, which [i][b]May[/b][/i] clearly does,\
      \ it slightly fails to do that if not a single sentence is written correctly,\
      \ at least that's what I think. It just makes it hard for me to take the story\
      \ seriously, and since the story provided here is more heart-wrenching and serious\
      \ than anything else, the bad localization regrettably ruined every tad of atmosphere\
      \ for me. Except for the bad translation itself, it is also very confusing when\
      \ the character names change rapidly between fore and last name, or when they\
      \ address the protagonist simply as [i]the guy[/i]. [b][i]May's[/i][/b] story\
      \ could be so touching if it wouldn't be for this single, yet deal-breaking\
      \ issue. I'm very sorry that I mention it so often but it's the sole reason\
      \ why I couldn't immerse myself into the story, which makes me terribly sad\
      \ since the storyline alone is absolutely great.\n\nThe transition of all seasons\
      \ in the main menu is really pretty, even if you might don't see much of that\
      \ since you will most likely finish this game in one sitting, taken how short\
      \ it is. Nevertheless, it's still a nice feature, which I'd like to point out\
      \ after complaining so much about the writing. The artwork is surprisingly nice\
      \ as well, especially if you consider that this title only costs $3.99. The\
      \ CG's of Yun and his mother when she's trying to comfort him really touched\
      \ my heart on a level I honestly didn't expect.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1593168951\n\
      \nYou might be able to enjoy [i][b]May[/b][/i] more than me if you think that\
      \ the localization issues mentioned above won't spoil your experience or if\
      \ you are a native Russian speaker. Otherwise, I wouldn't really recommend it\
      \ in its current state. I don't think that the devs are going to hire someone\
      \ to edit the script, so I don't have much hope that I can change my review\
      \ into a fully positive one, even if I'd really love to do that.\n\n[b]Team\
      \ Spieluhr[/b], your work has so much potential, don't let it go to waste, merely\
      \ because of the lack of proofreading. I know that indie developers often don't\
      \ have the financial possibilities, but if you do plan to make another Visual\
      \ Novel, I'm sure that there are at least 1-2 people that would volunteer to\
      \ help you with proofreading the script, you just need to reach out to them!\
      \ Especially nowadays, people are actually willing to spend more money on a\
      \ Visual Novel in exchange for decent writing.\n\n[quote][h1]\U0001D405\U0001D428\
