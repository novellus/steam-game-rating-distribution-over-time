    review: "The game's serviceable for it's price, but it does have some problems.\
      \ My main concerns are that a good chunk of the levels have ice physics which\
      \ make jumping from one gap or small platform to another really difficult and\
      \ levels end up taking a lot longer than they need to in my opinion. Some of\
      \ the sprites used for the platforms and walls can also be confusing in you're\
      \ not paying attention. Also, what's the point of the minigame? I beat the game\
      \ on Normal only picking up the in-stage powerups so this last point's more\
      \ of a nitpick. \n\nI'll recommend the game with the caution of \"AT LEAST 15\
      \ OF THE 50 LEVELS HAVE ICE PHYSICS AND THERE'S NONSENSICAL ACHIEVEMENTS\""
