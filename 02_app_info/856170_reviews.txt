Not usually a tower defense gamer, but the outer space concept and 3-D aspect make the play more difficult and help to make the game more visually appealing. Once you start playing, it gets really addicting. Just don't forget to upgrade your turrets as you go and make sure that you capitalize on the variety of close range and long range weapons systems, otherwise you won't make it once the surprises show up. Overall 10/10.","timestamp_created":1579927947,"timestamp_updated":1579927947,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ47+jC7e8CfPTx7QE="}
