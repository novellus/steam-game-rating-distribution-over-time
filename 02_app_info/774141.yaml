    review: "I like the slow story-rich games and loved this one. My only complaint\
      \ is that imho some puzzles were too difficult (in easy mode.) The two walkthrough\
      \ I found on YouTube end right at the point where it became (overly?) difficult.\
      \ That said, I'm not a puzzle person and you might find them simple. \n\nThe\
      \ setting and characters are charming and you'll also have a school-like learning\
      \ experience. \n\nI did not mind the \"slideshow presentation\" at all. I felt\
      \ it was one of the ways the game entertained with subtle humor. \n\nI'll be\
      \ looking for more games by this team.\n\nHooray to FMV"
