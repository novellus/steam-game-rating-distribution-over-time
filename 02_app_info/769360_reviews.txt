There's definitely a horror feeling to it, and there's enough tension to actually jump when there's jumpscares. However the \"run\" sequences are a bit... odd due to the weird soundtrack. However they're quite easy (the labyrinth took a few time but got it eventually).\n\nSo what's bad? Everything else. The story is badly told, the translation is essentially non-existing as it was probably done through Google Translate and then mangled an extra time for the sake of it and the game isn't really that good after all.\n\nI usually want to give games an extra chance, but damn I do not recommend this. There's better games like this out there.","timestamp_created":1609441287,"timestamp_updated":1609441304,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3KuL3fYCfciXvwI="}
