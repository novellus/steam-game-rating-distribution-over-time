The travel is so slow I felt sleepy trying to travel through the quests as it's a decent size map.  So much more work before it's ready for market, I'm sad I paid $16.95 for this due to it seeming like it's at least 4 year more dev at the current rate of work.\n\nThey have done some good work on designing the map and quests, but game play is too slow for me and I play simulator games on roblox, this makes those seem exciting.","timestamp_created":1610105658,"timestamp_updated":1610105658,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwqdPx8PYCc5bCwQI="}
