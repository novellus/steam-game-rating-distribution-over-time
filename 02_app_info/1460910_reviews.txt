I thought about looking for that console to play those games again but decided to just buy this game. Old school mindless fun right. WRONG. It's addictive but you can't say why and it's not as easy as it looks. I want all my friends to buy it so that I can challenge them to do better than me. \n :)  I find it funny that I kept thinking \"flippen run Mike\" while playing the game.","timestamp_created":1607513002,"timestamp_updated":1607513002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467980295419692993","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgbrPo/YCetyvuAI="}
