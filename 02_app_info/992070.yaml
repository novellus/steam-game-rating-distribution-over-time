      /><br>...Then try out Idle Wizard! It's an idle game infused with RPG elements,
      centered around becoming the most powerful wizard the world ever knew.<br><br><img

      /><br>The core aspect of Idle Wizard is choosing a Character Class. You start
      as an Apprentice, and are able to choose various Classes (12 total, with 6 powerful
      Hybrid classes later in the game), from classic fantasy-inspired sorceres to
      more unique magic-wielders. Classes use different mechanics to gain profit,
      are equipped with unique spells and items tailored for their use. While they're
      not unlocked all at once, all have use and range in power depending on your
      current progress and do not follow the simple logic of &quot;the later it is
      unlocked - the more powerful it is now&quot;.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/992070/extras/Page_01.png?t=1585148829"
      /><br>Pets are a very important mechanic in Idle Wizard. All of them have a
      unique role and purpose, and most of the time it'll be beneficial to use more
      than more than one per run.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/992070/extras/Page_02.png?t=1585148829"
      /><br>Spells are paramount to your success (naturally!). After you get the hang
      of basics in the first few minutes, you gain your first spell-scroll and can
      start casting spells. Their mechanics differ greatly fro one another, from sheer
      profit or a buff, to meta-spells like speeding up time or boosting the xp of
      your pets! All the classes use a combination of common and unique ones, and
      sport quite a few possible combinations.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/992070/extras/Page_03.png?t=1585148829"
      /><br>Later in the game you can unlock and craft Items to help you profit even
      more - over a hundred total! Experiment with different item sets and loadouts
      to find the best one for the situation.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/992070/extras/Page_04.png?t=1585148829"
      /><br>Amount of available upgrades, achievements, and various more complex mechanics
      like Challenges, Trials, Catalysts and Expeditions allow for secondary goals
      and ways to boost you even more. There's much to learn and explore!
