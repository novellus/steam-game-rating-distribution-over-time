    review: For a solo developed game, this played pretty well. The jump scares weren't
      obvious like in a lot of games, and offered a good sense of fear throughout
      the game. The additional content after you complete the game was great. A lot
      of action in a small amount of time, and added more depth to the story of Hanesfield
      Asylum. Definitely a great buy for less than $10.
