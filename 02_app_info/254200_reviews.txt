There's a lot that's difficult to understand as the game's own tutorial is somewhat basic, and even now i don't know how *everything* works, but I've gotten a gist and give some pointers for new players, as the in-game help menu is not ideal, and the wiki is *massively* out of date, from what I can tell:\n\nDon't leave belts unattended (by yourself or a turret) underground. creatures will appear over them, they steal your resources (and besides that alone being a bad thing, this has additional negative effects in the form of hive growth.)\n\nAttacks come from the four \"overminds\" *so far* they always seem to spawn at diagonals from the CPH in the world (you can find them yourself easily, they're *very* hard to miss, and you'll want some of the resources that spawn around them somewhat early on), so plan your defenses accordingly. Also leave some space between your defenses and the CPH, as enemies have ranged attacks too and will attack the core even while under fire.\n\nYour personal crafting menu (\"C\" by default) will allow you to craft more 100slot hoppers before you have iron by combining 2slot hoppers, this is resource inefficient, but useful at the very start.\n\nRooms! more than just a roof over your head: they act as a way of \"partitioning\" your base, and anything inside a room isn't rendered from the outside, and vice versa. this improves the performance quite a bit when things start to get a little cluttered, If you're having performance issues that get worse as you build, consider moving some of your setup into a room.\n\ntruth of it though is that this game had to be pulled from development so the dev could move on to new projects and continue to do that eating thing, and a *lot* of the dev's ideas never made it to fruition for this one... HOWEVER! they are working on a(nother) sequel it seems, by the name of \"FortressCraft: Phoenix\" (a rather fitting name). there's lots of info on the discord's pinned messages, if you can find a link to it.\n\nOverall yes this game has a lot of major issues, like a lax tutorial and a somewhat messy UI, and as stated earlier a *lot* of stuff is difficult to understand. However the game has a certain charm to it, the way things aren't always a direct upgrade of others makes you consider carefully what to use for certain situations, the uniqueness of the vertically stacked world biomes, and the rather fun ways of dealing with problems with the tools you have make for a very fun experience in my opinion, and both the frozen factory and adventures pack DLC add sizeable amounts of content, though adventures is more about multiple playthroughs, and frozen factory is an additional chunk of content for *any* playthrough. there's a couple other DLCs, but those are the main ones for content as far as I can tell, having only gotten into this game recently.\n\nIf you're a fan of automation games (like the obvious comparison factorio) or you play a lot of minecraft modpacks and enjoy the tech mods, this will likely scratch that itch. as it has for me.","timestamp_created":1501131043,"timestamp_updated":1610162038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz9zI8vYCf+SDgQE="}
