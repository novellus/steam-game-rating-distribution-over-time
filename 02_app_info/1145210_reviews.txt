Deluxe[/url] from PopCap (which is a much better game).\nThis 2012 flash game is extremely barebones, the WPM settings are wildly inaccurate and any modes requiring the use of special characters are impossible, as it doesn't seem to register many of them at all (on a US layout anyway, which I would presume to be the most compatible).\n\nCharging $8 for this is insane. Just play Typer Shark Deluxe or many of the free browser typing games instead.","timestamp_created":1596724115,"timestamp_updated":1596724115,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.600259602069854736","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4446L4vMCfcPjmQI="}
