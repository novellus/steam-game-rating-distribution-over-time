    about_the_game: Galactic hero Serena S has been trolled on Spacebook. This is
      obviously a cause to embark on an epic quest to punish the troll in question,
      who just happens to be The Space Prince. Guide Serena through 7 stages of shmup
      action, jumping, shooting, and yet decidedly more jumping and shooting to her
      ultimate goal of total testicular annihilation of her foe. Ultionus is a love-letter
      to the home computer arcade games of the late 80s and early 90s, particularly
      Halloween Harry, Astro Marine Corps, Duke Nukem 2 and especially Phantis/Game
      Over II. The game features tons of lovingly crafted pixel art, and a rockin'
      chiptune soundtrack by the legendary Jake 'Virt' Kaufman.

    review: Ultionus is a parody of the usual action adventure game with a nice twist
      of having a sexy lady protag that just wants to kick a dude in the balls, and
      honestly I can get behind that. The game's style is a neat retro computer game
      look with a lot more polish and far more responsive controls that makes both
      playing it and looking at it a very crisp experience. The game is rather short
      though, and really is about an afternoon worth of adventure. Still with the
      time allotted there is plenty of challenge and substance to Ultionus levels
      and should be checked out by anyone that wants some shooter based arcade fun.
