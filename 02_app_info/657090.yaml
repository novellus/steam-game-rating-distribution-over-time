    review: "Nice little old-school dungeoncrawler but in a very basic form.\n\nSkill\
      \ mechanics offer a solid playground to get a team going, which can be further\
      \ optimized with gear.\n(you get a party of 5 and there are 8 bot-classes to\
      \ choose from)\nThe missions themselves are rather bland and become repetitive\
      \ fast.\n\nStory is there but ... yeah (the drawn art can be offsetting - combat\
      \ aestethics are ok thou), it would offer even different story outcomes depending\
      \ on which factions you support, sadly I couldn\xB4t get there because the game\
      \ is a bug ridden mess. :p\n\n- gamefreezes\n- missing objectives that make\
      \ missions unfinishable \n- gamecrashes in Leaderboard mode\n- scanning faction\
