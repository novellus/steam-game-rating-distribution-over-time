    review: "Station life changes a lot with crafting and implants. Crafting enables\
      \ you to refine your deck in a different way by limiting the cards in a character\
      \ deck. Making a custom piece with specific abilities like armor piercing weapons\
      \ is easier with crafting. Implant is a flat improvement to team member stats.\
      \ Having trouble with evasion targets? Get an accurate implant. Used properly\
      \ it can boost gear stats and help you custom build a damage resistant character\
      \ or \nevasion based character and the like. The random events are also a nice\
      \ change of pace. \nThe inventor class is different. At the start you have new\
      \ card attacks that drain health assuming you bypass the shields. In would recommend\
      \ unequipping either the power glow or the energy blade in the beginning as\
      \ you'll need leeching strike to keep the class health up in the beginning.\
      \ Once you gain the perk to restore health on attack, its less vital but at\
      \ the start its just easier to have leeching strike ready and likely to be drawn\
      \ rather than relying on the reload cards. \nOverall it improves the game experience."
