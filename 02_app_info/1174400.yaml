    review: Fun playing if you like BL games, though definitely a read, what Nitroplus+
      Chiral game isn't! I really like the overall dark setting of the game, and while
      I somewhat wish there was a little more debauchery, it was still a fun ride.
      It definitely felt almost like a prototype for what the company would later
      make, Dramatical Murder. As every review mentions, noncon is rampant in this
      game so don't play if that type of thing in a BL is not for you!
