My main problem is the rolling stock. The same odd \"horn\" sound (it's basically a whistle) has been lazily recycled on all the trains included, making them feel low quality and cheap, despite the excellent models. The 506 should have a 2 tone horn as there are 2 horns on the front and the same I believe with the class 76 although neither of these two trains do.\n\nThe 506 is fun to drive although in one scenario where you are meant to couple to another unit it just won't couple. The lack of a speedometer makes it impossible to drive without the HUD, which is a shame although the real train was like this so not the fault of the developers.\n\nThe 76 is also fun, although it takes a while to get the hang of driving it. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this route, but NOT at full price! Get it on sale as it simply isn't worth Â£18. The train models are great, but let down by poor sounds. The class 76 definitely did NOT have a whistle, it had a horn! For a pro range product, it feels like they didn't even try with the sounds. The original Woodhead route did a much better job with sounds and they should have reused them for this.","timestamp_created":1609318908,"timestamp_updated":1609318908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhri42fYCc5LcvgI="}
