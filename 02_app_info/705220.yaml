    reviews: "\u201CTactical Monsters is a hex grid, turn based strategy game where\
      \ ghost, ghouls and everything in between come to blows in fast-paced action.\u201D\
      <br>IGN<br><br>\u201CIT\u2019S JUST DAMN GOOD. Once you spend some time building\
      \ a deck, it\u2019s really worth it. The [PVP] matches becomes intense. They\
      \ only last a few minutes but they feel very action oriented despite being turn-based.\u201D\
      <br>Gameranx<br><br>\u201C...bite sized turn based arena combat that can really\
      \ suck you in.\u201D<br>Alpha Beta Gamer<br>"
