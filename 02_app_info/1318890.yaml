      /><br><br>You had always regarded the Kraken as merely legend, but recently
      whole fleets have been vanishing in the Molo waters to the north. Then one day
      your fleet is caught in a storm and you see massive tentacles rising from the
      water to meet you.  It wasn't a single kraken, but a whole squad hunting for
      food! You survive the battle but are left with questions. How could such a creature
      return in such great numbers - unless someone is raising them. You look down
      at the kraken egg in your hands.<br><br>Who will raise this one?<br><br>Rise
      of the Kraken is the first major expansion for Pirate Code, the tactical, turn-based
      strategy game from Circuit Hive. Now you can hatch your own kraken and train
      it to serve as a ship in your fleet! Teach the kraken a variety of powerful
      attacks including reaching out of the water and crushing enemy ships! Search
      the seas for other eggs to add even more to your fleet.<br><br>Rise of the Kraken
      will add a writhing mass of changes including:<h2 class="bb_tag">Tame the Kraken</h2>Employ
      as many as four tamed kraken in you fleet. Use them as a powerful alternative
      to conventional ships, but be warned! Your fleet can only claim victory if you
      have at least one surviving ship. Once all ships have been lost, even a trained
      kraken will swim away.<h2 class="bb_tag">Uncover a Dark Secret</h2>Who has returned
      the kraken to the ocean? Follow a unique secondary campaign that can be explored
      in parallel with the main story or afterwards. Discover awesome rewards and
      gain the power needed to take on your foes!<h2 class="bb_tag">Complete the Kraken

      challenges to reap generous gold and experience bonuses. Expect the challenges
      to increase in difficulty as the game progresses. There's no such thing as an
      easy fight with a kraken.<h2 class="bb_tag">Search for Kraken Treasure</h2>Discover
      an intriguing collection of kraken items. Like other items, some may be worth
      more than gold. Careful trading may unlock an additional ten crew members for
      your fleet. Other items may have a darker purpose.<h2 class="bb_tag">Fly the

    review: This is an amazing DLC! The idea of a kraken in a pirate game is a classic,
      and I love that it has appeared in Pirate Code! Though I have not done the kraken
      missions yet, but  having a kraken on my team is the coolest idea yet! This
      DLC made me also wonder, will there be more sea monsters in the game? Ones the
      you can fight and maybe tame as well?
