      Vampire: The Masquerade is the original and ultimate roleplaying game of personal
      and political horror. You are a vampire, struggling for survival, supremacy,
      and your own fading humanity--afraid of what you are capable of, and fearful
      of the inhuman conspiracies that surround you.</strong><br>As a vampire you
      suffer the pangs of the Hunger, the relentless and terrible thirst for human
      blood. If you refuse to deal with it, it will overcome your mind and drive you
      to terrible acts to slake it. You walk this razor''s edge every night.<br>Dark
      designs, bitter enemies, and strange allies await you in this World of Darkness.<br>The
      global blood opera of the Camarilla story continues. As the eldest vampires
      begin to vanish, the Ivory Tower starts to crack under the weight of its own
      decay. Once it was the mightiest faction of vampires in the world, a stronghold
      of immortality. Now it retreats into a maze of neo-feudal conspiracies to protect
      itself against the deadly threat of the Second Inquisition, struggling to enforce
      the Masquerade in the face of modern technology. Featuring insights and perspectives
      on unlife in the Camarilla from Mark Rein-Hagen and Matthew Dawkins.<br><i>

    review: "Pro:\n\n- Great resource book!! (already own the hard copy)\n\n\nCon:\
      \ (Hope the following points will be fixed later... 16-07-2020)\n\n- In the\
      \ whole book there are boxes from a missing fonts\n\n- There are allot of bullet-points\
      \  with no link in the table of contents \n\n- Clan bane is not drag and drop\
      \ and you can't copy the text so need to type it yourself...\n\n\n\nThis is\
      \ the first time i'm doubting to recommend it... Sure it is a great book with\
      \ a lot of info and the artwork is stunning. Only would say, wait for the fix\
      \ of the first to con points. \n\nI't feels a bit rushed"
