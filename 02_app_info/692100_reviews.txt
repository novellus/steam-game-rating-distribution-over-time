A twisted view into the darker side of a family's life.  I played the new Extended Cut and going on the change list provided it seems they really did a great job of upramping the game overall, so there's never been a better time to play.\nThe game handles switching between times and places in this nightmarish world in a smooth way and I was definitely genuinely scared on more than one occasion.  The story is a bit overly telegraphed in advance and descends into the usual silliness towards the end but throughout I had a clear goal as to what I was supposed to be doing, and overall I think the game holds up well.  100% recommended if you're a horror buff, and especially if it's on sale, as there's a good 3-4 hours of gametime included.","timestamp_created":1609870682,"timestamp_updated":1609870682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+aTx6fYCcavjwAI="}
