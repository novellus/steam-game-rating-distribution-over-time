      \ were written by Seppo Kantonen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe music of Company of\
      \ Crime is highly inspired by the soul/jazz/rock movement that emerged in the\
      \ UK during the '60s. American bands toured in Europe by the time and influenced\
      \ music fans especially in England with their raw and vivid sound. Local bands\
      \ were formed and the sound shifted to its own unique style, which affected\
      \ different youth cultures such as mods, etc. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the early\
      \ days, the style of music was mostly liked by other than mainstream racial\
      \ groups and working-class youth. That's why in the opinion of the establishment,\
      \ the music was considered to be the choice of outcasts, rascals, loafers, and\
      \ criminals. Like most of the countercultures this movement also became hip\
      \ and mainstream over time. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe music of Company of Crime\
      \ is also inspired by the sounds heard in the 60's English crime movies such\
      \ as Get Carter and early seventies movies from the US like Dirty Harry. We\
      \ find the mixture of these two elements, recorded music and movie soundtracks\
      \ to be spot on for the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe wanted the music to sound\
      \ raw and performed by youngsters that are extremely excited about the new sound.\
      \ The aim was to find a sound that replicates the enthusiasm for the music and\
      \ was not bothered by the lack of competence or technical shortage to perform\
      \ or record. We hope you find this soundtrack as superb as we do!"
