There are far less guys to date in the free version.\n\nThis isn’t your average romance sim. The guys that the player can romance are … well, asocial and often antagonistic. I guess one could call this a “tsundere” fan sort of thing, [i]but[/i] I’m going to explain why that’s not actually accurate. \n\nOne might be concerned that the game is problematic. Why should the protagonist have to date guys who are going to treat her poorly? Well, here’s the thing: she’s a jerk too. She is definitely not a delicate flower who gets her feelings hurt easily. I, too, am not a fan of stories in which a protagonist’s role in the story is to be a bandage for some bad boy who eventually changes. This story actually isn’t about changing anyone. That’s why I argue that it isn’t truly “tsundere” because that implies that the characters change enough to become friendlier. They never do. They’re as antagonistic at the end of the game as they were in the beginning. The only difference is that if the player dated them enough, they’ve developed romantic feelings for the protagonist. So, instead of getting the typical “let’s change this romantic interest for the better,” the player gets to experience what it’s like to simply accept someone for who they are, flaws and all. I’m not saying there’s no romantic value in the typical kind of “tsundere” story, but it was really refreshing to me to play a game that’s about acceptance rather than changing someone to better suit you. At times when the protagonist does try to get the guys she dates to do something they normally wouldn’t, it’s because they seem so unhappy about the way they are. The guys never change, but they are more open-minded to things. \n\nThis is technically spoilers, but I figure anyone interested in the game might like to know what they’re getting into. \n\n[b]The Six Main Guys[/b]:\n\nEverett – Fashionista, hot-headed, curses a lot, selfish, conceited, loves his mom a lot, best friends with Nate\n\nNate – Perfectionist, overachiever, lawful, extremely high standards for everyone and himself, has no chill, obsessed with independence, likes necklaces, best friends with Everett \n\nShiloh – People pleaser, people manipulator, can never truly know when he’s being genuine, likes hats, eager to be with protagonist\n\nBae – Condescending and sarcastic almost constantly, a tad flamboyant, obsessed with being more adult than his peers, cares about academics, adores cute pajamas, has way too many pairs of glasses, likes children, calls everyone by nicknames\n\nJeremy – Extremely cynical, nihilistic, a pushover, prevents himself from having fun, a germophobe, skillful at fixing things and archery, likes animated films, best friends with Pran\n\nPran – Often quiet, has neglectful parents, has trust issues, believes there are no truly good people, hates liars, stubborn af, likes drawing, friends with Jeremy\n\nThere are also “side boyfriends” but they don’t have CGs or as much character development. I was actually really disappointed that Lucas wasn’t a main guy, because I really liked his character. He doesn’t know how to talk to people, so he panics and ends up antagonizing people he actually wants to be friends with. \n“Clique boyfriends” don’t even have character art or personalities. They’re literally just a bonus mechanism in the game.\n\nAnother thing I enjoyed about the game was the humor. I think I might’ve laughed during this game more than any other, but it’s difficult to account for every game I’ve ever played. It’s definitely high in the ranking though. The story definitely utilizes what’s known as “schadenfreude,” the universal term for humor derived from someone else’s misfortune. None of it is extreme though. It’s usually just confusion, minor embarrassment, and inconveniences, not actual harm to characters. \n\nMinor complaints:\n[list]\n[*] No polyamory option. I would’ve loved it if one could have more than one boyfriend. \n[*] Kam’s character was boring, but that’s just my perspective. \n[*] Clique boyfriends were included in the Guy List, which makes the achievement “The Champion” extremely annoying to get unless you use the cheat code. \n[*] Why isn’t Lucas on the Guy List?\n[*] The protagonist complains about the guys’ clothes way too much.\n[*] Too many typos, not enough proofreading. \n[/list]\n\nBonuses:\n[list]\n[*] Queer representation, despite it being about a cis/hetero female protagonist going after guys. Everett is bisexual and Bae is asexual. Most of the other guys’ sexual orientations are left ambiguous other than they’re attracted to women. \n[*] Racial diversity, as more than half of the romanceable characters are non-white. The protagonist is also non-white.\n[*] The questioning of social norms.\n[/list]\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who wants an atypical romance sim experience.","timestamp_created":1595004032,"timestamp_updated":1595004032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.75160139799118042","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwMLprvMCfo3zlQI="}
