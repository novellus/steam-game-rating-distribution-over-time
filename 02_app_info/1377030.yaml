      notes: This game features graphic violence and gore akin to many other first
        person shooters. These are both highly stylized and unrealistic. The amount
        of gore can be adjusted in the game's settings.

    review: 'Wooow, this is some pretty janky shit. I know its early access and stuff,
      but uploading this alpha stage demo to steam? Really? Maps look the same. Effects
      looks like they were made in ms paint. Fov just resets with dashing. You cannot
      rebind melee. Dashing and jumping sounds like a revolver for some reason. The
      AI is supercrap. And my favourite: you you can see the radius for explosions,
      but if you are near the radius you still get damaged. WTF DUDE?


      The only two good parts are the voiceover, and the weapon cooling mechanism.
      This game needs at least 4 more years.'
