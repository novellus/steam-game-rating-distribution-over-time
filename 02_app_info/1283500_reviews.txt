Nothing indicates that it is over, surely the dev did not just stop building at this point ?\nI wanted this puzzle game to be great considering the intriguing name of it but did not meet my expectations. It does work as a puzzle game as far as it goes but its too short for my satisfaction and I was hoping for some new concepts/game mechanics to play out here but I feel that I have not learnt or experienced anything new that has not already been done in other games. Cubes and lasers.\nIf you can get it on special offer, its worth a punt, but it just feels I got going before it suddenly ended...I think. Im entirely happy not having a story - just solve puzzles but needs more.","timestamp_created":1610021102,"timestamp_updated":1610021102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm4yv7vYCcuegwQI="}
