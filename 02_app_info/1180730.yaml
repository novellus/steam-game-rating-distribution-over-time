    review: "First impression and clicking around:\n\nPro\n- Looks amazing! \n- The\
      \ art is stunning! \n- Really want to run my chronicle! (hype!!)\n\nCon\n- nope\n\
      \nNow making a character: (well using my existing players sheets) \n\nPro\n\
      - O wow, the health, willpower are auto calculated!\n- Neat, small help pup-ups\
      \  for scrolling the generation.\n- Great you can drag and drop disciplines.\n\
      - Were are my discipline powers? aha, in the library (needed to do some searching)\n\
      - Ooh sweet! Frenzy, rouse and mend are a nice button and rouse increase hunger\
      \ when fail. \n\nCon\n- can't resize the character sheet? (don't now why but\
      \ had the urge to try)\n- (rouse is a bit bigger written in Unity?) = fixed\n\
      - What? I need to type the clan bane? No drag and drop here?\n- the SPCS have\
      \ at notes a handy details blok (looks and birth date and more) while the player\
      \ characters have a big box. \n\n\n(test is done in Unity and classic)\n\n\n\
      Update:\nAfter playing/ hosting:\n\n\nPro\n- The easy add map works perfect\
      \ in images. Just drag and drop. \n\nCon\n- There is no party sheet...\n- No\
      \ easy relationships map.\n- The abbreviated SPCs don't work in the combat tracker\
      \ = fixed\n- While crating an encounter the menu says NPC instead of SPCs (yes\
      \ i know it't the same thing, but would like the same name)\n- Some random script\
      \ errors (did forget to copy them was running a game...) = Had no more since\n\
      \nOverall conclusion:\nHad a great time hosting a game and think my players\
      \ liked it as well. (not sure they sounded stressed... ;P)\n\n(play was in Classic)"
