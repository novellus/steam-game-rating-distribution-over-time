    review: "Why isnt this on MacOS, and linux yet?\n\nI love this game, its simple\
      \ but engaging. Im a programmer that spends most of their time on the computer,\
      \ and i love challenging myself to a fun WPM challenge. this fun shoot-em-up\
      \ zombie game is the perfect outlet you may seek to practice your keystrokes.\
      \ ESPECIALLY NUMBERS. i need practice typing numbers without looking at the\
      \ keyboard. i love the blood, the gore and the loud HEADSHOT noise i get. \n\
      \nI do admit i have not gotten pass level 3, i almost got pass level 2 manor\
      \ but im not sure if that matters. im not trying to win the game, im trying\
      \ to shoot zombies and practice my keyboarding, for 5 dollars im happy.\n\n\
      its also not even a necessarily scary game but sometimes i find myself screaming\
      \ underpressure, with my fingers doing all the  work. would reccomend to any\
      \ friend you have if you wanna test out their skill."
