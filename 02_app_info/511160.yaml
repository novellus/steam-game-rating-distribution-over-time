    review: "This game has lots of mixed reviews - some of them praise it, some of\
      \ them hate it. \nIt actually costs 4$/\u20AC, so it's not even that cheap.\n\
      Some users called this game pretentious, since the story looks random and shallow\
      \ with little effort employed in the graphical sector, while the gameplay itself\
      \ isn't really even an arcade/puzzle - rather, it's just a simple platformer\
      \ with few movement options.\nOther users praise the abstract artwork, the minimalistic\
      \ environment, the relaxing atmosphere and such.\nThe Italian translation of\
      \ the game is horrible, so I think you should stick with the English one.. the\
      \ first screen selection in which you're allowed to choose between easy, hard\
      \ or normal literally reads \"pass the game upon another difficulty in order\
      \ to see analternative story ending\" (yeah, \"analternative\" is written like\
      \ this in the Italian page).\nAnyways, the whole environment is really minimalistic.\
      \ It's all 2D, you're a red cube, you can move left or right and everything\
      \ is black and white. Obviously, the goal is to reach the end in each level.\n\
      There are lots of taglines and messages between the levels, it's up to you I\
      \ think to judge if they're enough philosophical or not.. just keep in mind\
      \ that many translation suck that much that you won't be able to enjoy anything.\n\
      Most of the times you won't even know what you're doing and why some of the\
      \ black figures are moving and why they're moving that way, but in the end the\
      \ game looks like a simple minimalistic puzzle game which doesn't present some\
      \ noticeable kind of uniqueness in my view.\nPlus.. it's slow.\nApart from the\
      \ three endings, there are 55 levels and you'll have to move your cube through\
      \ a mix of texts and abstract black figures which will constantly move - remind\
      \ that you'll be able to go only left or right. \nAll in all, the graphics get\
      \ better and better between the levels and I don't know, I agree with those\
      \ who say that the game is pretentious since it's no philosopical masterpiece,\
      \ but on the other side it has a nice mix of good music, nice graphics (not\
      \ in the minimalistic levels themselves, but rather in the animations in-between)\
      \ and somehow challenging but simple gameplay.\nIt's more a matter of timing\
      \ and waiting rather than pure arcade ability, given the limited moves your\
      \ cube has. But it's ok.\nI'd recommend the game, all in all. It can be enjoyed\
      \ by lovers of relaxing puzzles or semi-philosophical matters. In a general\
      \ way it's not a masterpiece, but it's a nice effort. New mechanics are added\
      \ as you'll progress with the levels, making the game somehow more challenging."
