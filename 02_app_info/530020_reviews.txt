Like Zelda, most of the game is spent solving \"puzzles\", but these aren't necessarily in your face puzzle rooms like Teslagrad. Generally you know you need to get from point A to point B, or find an item in point B, and to do that you need to solve some subtle environmental puzzles using the 4 characters (or a subset of those). The complexity comes from the way the developers nave cleverly spread abilities over all the characters, so that there is some overlap of some abilities, and other powers are unique. To solve these puzzles you generally need to find the one character or sequence of characters that have the abilities you need at the time.\n\nIn addition to the main storyline, there are a [i]lot[/i] of collectibles to find: 36 scrolls, a similar amount of health upgrades, and then maybe 100 money chests strewn around the map. These were my favourite part of the game, not only because I'm a completionist, but also because these allowed the environmental puzzles to shine: you really have to think about how the spaces are designed, and which parts stand out as something that can be exploited by a given character. In addition, the game has save points which serve as fast travel spots. Others have complained that each character must individually find these to enable teleporting, but I think this is a clever addition to the game that in some cases makes you solve the same environmental puzzle in 4 different ways in order to access all the treasures available to each character in each area.\n\nThe combat was entirely serviceable for those used to Zelda's combat: each character has a main attack button along with up to 3 other abilities that might have some combat application. Combat comes into focus during some interesting boss fights and certain arena fight gates, but is otherwise not a huge portion of the game.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nI found this game's music to be diverse and interesting. No particular track was so good that I would buy the soundtrack, but I remember enjoying it as I played!\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nAt face value, the story was very bland: four heroes are prophesied to be able to beat the bad guy and his plot to destroy the world, so they have to find key items to stop him. Pretty uninspired. On the other hand, it was a nice opportunity for the devs to explore the interesting cultures present in the world of Teslagrad, including the mind-controlling Mesmer, the engineers from Motorland, the electric Teslamancers from the first game, and others. However, the game isn't set in any of these countries. The Mesoamerican-inspired native people of the titular \"West\" have a pleasantly developed history, but the game seems to sideline them for some reason, and decides that the (white) foreigners need to save their country for them, which is a bizarre decision that could so easily be avoided by including them in the playable party, as well as coming up with a better reason why they can't save themselves except for \"prophecy\". So story is probably the game's weakest part.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nWorld to the West has simple but cute graphics. They're not amazing, and aren't awe-inspiring like Teslagrad, but I really have no issue with them. Check out the screenshots to see what I mean\n\n[h1]Linux[/h1]\nIt supports Linux! And it runs without issues! Great job, devs!","timestamp_created":1610018598,"timestamp_updated":1610018598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx8Wl7vYCc+ufwQI="}
