      \ of dropping a Titan from orbit \u2013 of hearing the scream of a massive,\
      \ 24-foot-tall mechanical monstrosity burning through the atmosphere. They\u2019\
      ve fought side-by-side with their Titan, running on walls and climbing buildings\
      \ as their robotic buddy lays waste to enemies. They\u2019ve jumped into the\
      \ Titan to take control, and wreaked havoc on their enemies with rockets, plasma\

    review: Avoid this like the plague, picked it up as a titanfall bundle, 1) servers
      are dead 2) no offline mode 3) and burned many a minute on the download and
      dumb audio unpack on the first start up for disappointment.
