A revocable living trust, unlike a will, offers a fast, private, probate-free way to transfer one’s property after death. Although a living trust is not a complete substitute for a will (it doesn’t allow you to name a guardian for a child, for example), it is definitely a more efficient way to transfer property at death, especially large-ticket items such as a house. A Living Trust will ensure that your property bypasses lengthy and expensive probate proceedings.<br \/>\r\nA living trust is about as easy to prepare as a will. Do-it-yourself and save hundreds of dollars on attorney fees.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDurable Power of Attorney<br \/>\r\nA durable power of attorney ensures that someone you trust (called your “agent” or “attorney-in-fact”) will be on hand to manage the many practical, financial tasks that will arise if you become incapacitated. For example, bills must be paid, bank deposits must be made, and someone must handle insurance and benefits paperwork. In most cases, a durable power of attorney for finances is the best way to take care of tasks like these. You can also give your attorney-in-fact authority over your digital assets.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHealth Care Directive or Living Will<br \/>\r\nSpare your loved one’s difficult decisions by laying out your wishes for medical care and naming someone to carry out your instructions.
