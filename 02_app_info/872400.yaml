    review: Got this during a Steam discount, overall I think it is pretty good game
      and has potential with upcoming packs. As far as some areas of improvement,
      I would say this is geared towards controls and from the controls to the lack
      of mouse cursor etc its not really streamline for a desktop gaming experience.
      I would say the experience on Steam for this game is that it was confusing without
      the ability to use mouse or even see a cursor, and once inside the game I had
      to use the arrow keys as WASD wasn't working as intended, not to mention my
      mouse didn't work so I couldn't pan around and it was a bit disorienting to
      walk around using arrow keys and not be able to pan around like in a traditional
      3D game, so it seemed like a 3D experience but confined in a 2D overlay. Lastly,
      I jumped right into the game and it wasn't immediately clear which button maps
      to attack and I think there should be some hints/HUD messages during the beginning
      to educate and inform the user on what does what in terms of attack and defense
      to get them started without fumbling around and without having to exit to the
      menu to see what keys mapped to what.
