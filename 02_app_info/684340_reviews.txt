It has a noir taste all around but with Lovecraftian touches\n\nDevelopers seem to care for the opinion of the players too so it feels like we  could have a great Lovecraftian game if they managed to pull it .","timestamp_created":1505593763,"timestamp_updated":1505593763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.696210324764251709","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4y7SYxt4CcoPFhQE="}
