    about_the_game: "A stylistic throwback to the summer camp films of the 80\u2019\
      s and 90\u2019s, Camp Manna is the story of a Christian camp turned upside-down\
      \ by the arrival of the wayward \u201Cnew kid\u201D, Ian Fletcher. After a tragic\
      \ accident, Ian Fletcher, a 15-year old Floridian, moves far north to live with\
      \ his aunt and uncle. Shortly after his arrival, Ian is shipped off to Camp\
      \ Manna, a backwoods Evangelical Christian camp soaked in baffling religious\
      \ sub-culture. Camp Manna is centered around the God Games, a Biblically-themed\
      \ Olympiad focused on turning boys into \u201Cmen of faith\u201D. But as a \u201C\
      nonbeliever\u201D, this is the last place in the world that Ian wants to spend\
      \ a week. He is bunked up with the Passover Privates, the cabin of outcasts\
      \ and misfits, and their zealous, un-cool counselor Bradley Sommers. But when\
      \ Ian is introduced to Clayton Vance, the savvy and chiseled counselor of the\
      \ Righteous Regiment, he has one focus: Ditch Bradley and join up with Clayton.\
      \ But as the God Games approach, Ian realizes that Clayton may not be as \u201C\
      cool\u201D as he claims to be and his choice to ditch the Passover Privates\
      \ and join the Righteous Regiment may end up being the worst decision of his\
      \ life\u2026 Camp Manna blends hilarious comedy with loving nostalgia. This\
      \ \u201Csatire with soul\u201D reminds us all that sometimes getting to the\
      \ heart of something is best told with laughter."
