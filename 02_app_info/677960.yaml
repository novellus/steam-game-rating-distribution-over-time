    about_the_game: "Soak in the sights, sounds and smells of a venerable route with\
      \ almost 200 years of history, but which still runs both passenger and freight\
      \ services across the Kentish countryside. With a range of locos and multiple\
      \ units tearing down the tracks between lovingly rendered, true-to-life stations\
      \ this is the route for all fans of English rail!<br><br>The South Eastern Railway\
      \ was established in 1836 to build a railway line which would link London and\
      \ the coastal town of Dover, a key port with connections to mainland Europe.\
      \ The line was sedate, but bustling. Passenger, fruit and hops traffic became\
      \ a staple of the line between Maidstone and Paddock Wood, and despite opposition\
      \ from residents, and even the Mayor of the county town, there was little denying\
      \ that the railway was proving beneficial. So beneficial in fact, that it was\
      \ decided to extend the line further north, continuing to follow the path of\
      \ the stunning Medway Valley.<br><br>One striking feature of the route is that\
      \ the Medway Valley Line retained its semaphore signalling. It would not be\
      \ until 2005 that the line was finally brought up to modern standard with colour-light\
      \ signalling, however some still remain open and can be seen in-game, especially\
      \ at stations like Cuxton where the level crossing is still hand-operated gates.\
      \ <br><br>Today, the line is a community rail service operated by Southeastern.\
      \ The same service pattern is in effect, and is typically formed of 3-car Class\
      \ 375/3 Electrostars, although Class 466s are used on occasion, and Class 465s\
      \ have also been used in years prior. An extra service pattern was trialled\
      \ in 2011 and is now permanent, Southeastern Highspeed Class 395s operate in\
      \ the morning and evening peaks to Maidstone West, calling only at Snodland\
      \ before heading to/from London St Pancras.<br><br>When brought into Train Simulator,\
      \ the Medway Valley Line will complement the Chatham Main Line by bringing you\
      \ a quieter side to Southeastern services while unlocking freight potential\
      \ across the picturesque countryside. Kent is called \u201CThe Garden of England\u201D\
