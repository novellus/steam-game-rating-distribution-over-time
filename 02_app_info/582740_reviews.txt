Dirty Bomb has often been compared to some of its contemporaries like Overwatch or Cities: Skylines. However, I would say these games should be compared to Dirty Bomb because Dirty Bomb exceeds all expectations for what a game can be and is the gold standard for the human expierience. Dirty Bomb can be compared to some of the finest art, films, and music ever made. Dirty Bomb is the Boss Baby of video games. Maps like Dockyard make this game stand out as a pinnacle of gaming and culture. Dockyard is good for sniping because of the long alley-ways. I would highly recommend this title to any person.","timestamp_created":1546042047,"timestamp_updated":1546042047,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507992863655090332","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oa/S++cCduzhtgE="}
