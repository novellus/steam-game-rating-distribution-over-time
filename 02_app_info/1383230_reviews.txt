They added Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Madison, and Hamilton. Ahh, playing this made me pine for a time when these were the quality of people running for president! Hahaha.\n\nOfc, politics was just as dirty then as it is now. Washington's term 2 they started calling him a monocrat, and the rivalry between Adams/Jefferson and everyone v. Hamilton got pretty brutal haha.\n\nI guess the pro-government Federalists being Democrats and small government Jeffersonians being Republicans is probably as close as you're going to get. Washington and Adams historically didn't identify with parties - but were both Federalists in practice. They did add Washington as an option for both sides though, so you can play him for either party.\n\nBTW, Adams was from Massachusetts. Not Virginia. You should patch that!","timestamp_created":1598895878,"timestamp_updated":1598895996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.622222244739532471","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxpfoovQCeb3+ngI="}
