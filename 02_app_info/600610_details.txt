Recruit a company of up to three mortal heroes and guide them in spirit on a desperate journey from Albion to Jerusalem. Explore a richly-imagined medieval setting on the brink of apocalypse. Trade with merchants, improve your heroes and unearth ancient relics. Search for the lost fragments of your soul, scattered across the multiverse - and save as many worlds as you can.<br><br><strong>KEY FEATURES:<\/strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Roguelike Experience<\/h2>Carve a path across the lands of Albion, Marca Hispanica and Al-Andalus. Will you take a dangerous route, risking life and limb in pursuit of a legendary relic? Or will you choose a safer path? Plan and prepare. Negotiate, barter, fight. Tackle challenges. Suffer losses. Recruit new Heroes. Earn Gold, Supplies and Renown. Be careful: your choices are permanent, as is death. But don't tarry - evil never rests.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tactical Turn-Based Combat<\/h2>Master the tactics of squad-based and turn-based combat to conquer both human and demonic foes. Your enemies will be tough and ruthless; make use of high ground and cover, set up ambushes and coordinated attacks, harness synergies between different Hero classes and skills.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/600610\/extras\/HoM_Steam_1.gif?t=1608725127\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Non-Linear Narrative<\/h2>Enjoy a compelling story inspired by Arthurian legend, the Matter of France, and the history of Al-Andalus - with an unusual twist. Make choices in interactive encounters that change every time you play. Written by Jonas Kyratzes (The Talos Principle, Serious Sam 4) and Verena Kyratzes (The Lands of Dream, Serious Sam 4).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dynamic Leveling<\/h2>Use Renown to level up your Heroes, and choose between a randomized set of new skills or improved attributes.
