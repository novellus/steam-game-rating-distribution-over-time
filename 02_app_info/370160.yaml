      /><br><br><strong>Front Wars</strong> is a turn-based strategy game. Revive
      the great battles of the second world war in a tense campaign, or challenge
      a friend online.<br><br>The two armies take turns building and commanding units
      on a grid-based map. The objective is to defeat the enemy army. There are two
      ways to defeat an opponent: destroy every one of the opponent''s units on the
      map or capture the opponent''s headquarters. The terrain on a map affects unit
      range of movements and the defense attributes of units stationed in that terrain.
      Capturing cities and enemy buildings will give the player new fundings at the
      beginning of each turn, with which the player can create a variety of new units
      (soldiers, tanks, planes, ships...) to gain power over his opponent.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul
