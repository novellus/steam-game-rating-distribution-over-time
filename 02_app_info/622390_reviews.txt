Yep, you heard right: that's about three hours worth of music, give or take! For that one tiny price!! So let's make that a 7.5, and up it to 8.5 for sheer staggering mega-value. \n\n   Nicely done, VGstudio!!! (Shame about the game itself.)\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/​\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210​\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1561242451,"timestamp_updated":1561242895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596400737762451172","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qYDVwOsCc4OFxAE="}
