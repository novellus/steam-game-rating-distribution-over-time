      /><br>Monkey Land 3D: Reaper Rush is 100% full of gameplay! There''s bananas,
      treasure coins, Piggys in need of saving, locked treasure chests and thats just
      in the first 10 seconds! Find new abilities like the STOMPY-BUTT by finding
      the precious Dinosaur Feathers! <br><br>You can also find and unlock the DOUBLE
      JUMP, the DASH ATTACK, and unleash a 3 hit combo DRAGON BACKFLIP that can also
      do GATE CRUSHING amounts of damage! <br><br>Find weapons, power ups, kill monsters,
      fight bosses, beat time trials, explore huge worlds, and help out the inslanders
      all in Monkey Land 3D: Reaper Rush!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/569500/extras/STEAM_ABOUT_HEADER.png?t=1490849654"
      /><br>Mugen is a pirate monkey out on a quest for adventure... and booty! His
      crew has landed on a strange island that looks like fun and games but something
      is strange about the islands inhabitants. Some are locked up in cages and they
      don''t know why? Only Mugen can save them and find out who or what is behind
      all the mischief!<br><br>Weapons like the Morning Star make swords look lame.
      A SPIKED BALL of DOOM on a chain is so much more fun than a sword! But a Sword
      with Lightning going through it is pretty fun indeed! Both of these weapons
      just need to be found and picked up to have for the rest of the game! The Piggys
      of Volcano Island and the Golden Butterflies are being kept prisoner all over
      on the island and only you can free them. The Viking Helmet and Viking Shield
      will be your protection. But you might find your own protection like that spike
      shelled turtle over there can probably be used as a weapon and defense! The
      Owl-Crates around the island hold power-ups too so be sure to SMASH all the
      BOXES! <br><br>Watch out for Skeleton Wizards of dark magic and the evil Saber-toothed
      Bats! The creepy spiders will be sure to come after you. The Firefly demons
      are mostly harmless so it''s not all bad. But the spiked shell turtles can be
      quite fast by the water front so be careful. The Pumpkins are extra bouncy this
      time of year too. <br><br>The Squishy Fishy''s are not so squishy and shoot
      deadly poison stars so be extra careful near water! And one last thing, use
      the Banana button to pause and go to options and use the Heart button to adjust
      the camera. You can adjust the control placement in the Options menu and be
      sure to unlock all the levels by BEATING the GAME! And do replay after you beat
      a certain someone because there might just be a special thing like a reward
      for beating the game but nobody knows for sure what it is! <br><br>Boss fighting
      can be dangerous so make sure you have found at least one weapon before trying
      to take on the last boss. I mean unless you want to be some crazy hero that
      don''t need no weapons to defeat the game then by all means, be my guest. Take
      your best shot, that little head is probably the weakest spot. <br><br>Oh and
      one more thing, the new abilities you get from the treasure chests, they come
      in a different order every time you start a new game so you might get an ability
      you really really want at first, and you might get it last! It''s what the kids
      call procedural random gameplay and it''s so hot right now!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/569500/extras/STEAM_FEATURES_HEADER.png?t=1490849654"
      /><br><br>Single Player Adventure with HOURS of gameplay!<br><br>Unlock special
      abilities like Double Jump and Dash Attack!<br><br>Boost off pumpkins to get
      to super high places!<br><br>Side quests with POWERFUL rewards!<br><br>Boss
      Fights that require EXTREME fighting action!<br><br>Huge levels are like mini

      Triple Jump, Tiny Mode, and more!<br><br>Sword fighting action!<br><br>Melee
      weapons with PHYSICS like the spiked ball and chain weapons!<br><br>Randomly
