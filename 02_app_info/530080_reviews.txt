It seems that it was never finished and is a little buggy. Sadly some features doesn't seem to work. But if you have the chance to buy it on sale or get the key somewhere cheap, I still recommend buying it, since the tutorial/training sequence helped me a lot memorizing the Hiragana in a quite fun way. That said, don't expect too much.","timestamp_created":1560611627,"timestamp_updated":1560611627,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4//PsresCd9a7wwE="}
