    review: The game reminds me of Ark except I don't remember Ark having issues with
      lighting; I couldn't tell if the sun was coming back up or not, or if I traveled
      to another biome that was constantly dark. This was just very confusing to me.
      The game is cheap and fun, but there really isn't much to do. Building is fun
      but can become a chore after awhile; need wooden logs and fiber to make a foundation.
      Check. Now you need to make wooden walls and a wooden door frame, but you need
      to craft something you didn't even have before just so you can make those items.
      It would also be nice to have some dangerous animals lurking about and the option
      to craft more weapons to defend yourself with. What's the point of being able
      to craft a pistol later on but not having the option to be able to craft a bow
      or spear? This game has a lot of potential if it got worked on a bit more. I'm
      not going to complain. It was an $8 game and I rather did enjoy playing it.
