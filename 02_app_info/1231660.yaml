    review: "[quote=author][b][i]* Dr. Faust's Otherworldly Adventure does not retroactively\
      \ apply to past saves.[/i][/b][i] This means you will either have to start a\
      \ new save OR finish an old one to begin its NG+. You cannot undo your decision\
      \ about enabling or disabling the DLC until you finish that save file's run.\
      \ A save file with the DLC enabled will feature an icon of Faust on it in case\
      \ you aren't sure if it's working or not.[/i][/quote]\n\n[h1]What You Get[/h1]\n\
      [b]1. Wandering Dr. Faust's Forest[/b]\n[i]A new dungeon area is added with\
      \ this DLC.[/i] You gain access to this upon clearing a level in the Misty Forest\
      \ after starting a new game (both brand new or NG+). It's a small-sized map\
      \ that you can comfortably explore bringing nothing but few pieces of rotten\
      \ food. The rest of your inventory can be reserved for loot drops.\n\n[b]Dungeon\
      \ Features[/b]\n[list]\n[*][b]BOSS \u2014 Faust:[/b] A fun encounter that creates\
      \ the exit portal once defeated. Unlike other bosses, Faust can be farmed as\
      \ he will respawn on your next entry.\n[*][b]New Enemies:[/b] Post-Op variants\
      \ of the Followers from the Misty Forest. Same skills though.\n[*][b]Guest Enemies:[/b]\
      \ Enemies from the Cathedral and Cursed Town also appear.\n[*][b]New Traps:[/b]\
      \ Golden Mimics and Light Flower Traps. They're everywhere.\n[*][b]New Combat\
      \ Consumables:[/b] These items are immune to the Mist's contamination mechanic.\n\
      [*]\u2014[i]Chocolate: Clears status and mesmerize ailments[/i]\n[*]\u2014[i]Donuts:\
      \ Regenerate life every turn for 6 turns (comes in S/M/L sizes)[/i]\n[*][b]Dungeon\
      \ Scaling:[/b] All loot and enemies found in the dungeon scale to your crew's\
      \ average level. You can easily acquire level-appropriate gear without much\
      \ risk.\n[*][b]Ignores Doomsday Clock:[/b] The clock will not move while exploring\
      \ this dungeon. You can come and go as often as you like. However, running away\
      \ still incurs the usual loot, experience, and gold penalties.\n[/list]\n\n\
      [b]2. Achievements[/b]\n[i]There are 13 achievements associated with this DLC.[/i]\
      \ If you are aiming to platinum [i]Mistover[/i], this will be required. Nearly\
      \ all of them are tied to the Faust boss encounter.\n\n[h1]Impact on Gameplay[/h1]\n\
      While offering a nice change of pace from time to time, [i]Dr. Faust's Otherworldly\
      \ Adventure[/i] lowers the difficulty of the game as it provides a (mostly)\
      \ safe environment to farm for level-appropriate gear and gold. This is especially\
      \ true for players that choose to play with the Doomsday Clock enabled on Hard\
      \ mode, since you always have the option to run this instead of an area that\
      \ may be challenging or too low for your crew to run without having the clock\
      \ tick forward.\n\nClearing the dungeon is relatively easy compared to most\
      \ areas in the game, as the only things you need to watch out for are branding\
      \ (focus fire) from Executioner Shotels and Bows, and stuns from Collectors\
      \ and Wraiths. Enemies are often lined up for column-based skills or a juicy\
      \ Chaos\u2605Blast from your Witch, so have fun with the AoEs. However, the\
      \ Faust encounter can prove to be quite challenging if you tackle his dungeon\
      \ early on without any sort of equipment, since he can overwhelm you with fodder\
      \ and heal himself every now and then. In the case of which this happens and\
      \ you realize he's going to show you the way out, there's no shame in running\
      \ away because you still make out with half of your acquired loot.\n\nYeah,\
      \ this means you can go raid the forest for loot (preferably with a Shadow Blade\
      \ for invisibility), avoid all the monster encounters, and run away so you keep\
      \ a good chunk of the spoils and not level up in the process. How convenient\
      \ is that?\n\nAnd speaking of which: Don't like the loot offered in any area?\
      \ Not enough epics? No problem. Faust's Forest can be utilized to target specific\
      \ gear drops you need, as entering and leaving the dungeon (remember, at absolutely\
      \ no penalty) will refresh available loot in all areas.\_\n\nThe new combat\
      \ consumables can also make some parts of the game easier, if you choose to\
      \ use them or their original counterparts. Chocolates are a direct upgrade to\
      \ both Purified Waters and Bandages, since you don't need to spend gold on them\
      \ and they are immune to pollution. Donuts are a heal-over-time version of Potions\
      \ \u2014 they're quite handy on all difficulties except Hard, as spike damage\
      \ becomes a common issue to worry about. Doesn't mean they're useless, but fights\
      \ often end quickly enough where you're either killing fast or on the receiving\
      \ end of that treatment.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n[u]As a non-Guilty Gear fan:[/u]\
      \ [b]Recommended[/b] and a [b]Non-Essential DLC[/b].\_\n\nFor $5, it's a little\
      \ bit of extra content that always remains relevant, whether you're at the beginning\
      \ of your playthrough or near the end, and on any difficulty setting. Unfortunately,\
      \ it's a bit short since the dungeon only has one area (a small one, at that)\
      \ as opposed to three like every other. But like I said, it always remains relevant\
      \ since the dungeon scales to the crew that enters it; it's meant to be replayed\
      \ multiple times, not just once.\n\nIf you struggle with Hard Mode and/or dislike\
      \ the stress associated with the Doomsday Clock, then the dungeon from this\
      \ DLC may help alleviate some of your issues and make it bearable to play at\
      \ the intended difficulty levels. The consumables are nice to have at hand and\
      \ it's a great source of quick and easy equipment, especially if you're looking\
      \ for good alchemy fodder to fuse into your primary crew's gear.\n\nHonestly,\
      \ it's only a must-buy if you want to 100% this game. It's not asking for much,\
      \ but you're not missing out either if you choose to skip this. If anything,\
      \ Mistover needs more content-based DLC, so this is fine in my book."
