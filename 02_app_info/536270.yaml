    review: "The Good: The concept is interesting and intriguing. The graphics are\
      \ very nice and the exploring and learning part are kind of fun...at first.\n\
      \nThe Bad: The game controls are not very good, particularly for combat. (Who\
      \ throws a help tip screen up right in the middle of the screen during combat?)\
      \ I experienced glitches that cause clan member avatars to get stuck several\
      \ times and restarting the game was the only way to get them unstuck.\n\nThere\
      \ were also some game mechanics that didn\u2019t make any sense. Like clan members\
      \ not being able to feed themselves or sleep if required unless directed by\
      \ the player.\n\nMy Take: I spent one night away from my settlement in the jungle\
      \ with two members of my clan and on retuning none of the clan members I had\
      \ left behind had slept, eaten, or had a drink since I had left the day before.\
      \ Seriously?! You have to be there to feed and rest the clan members you aren\u2019\
      t in immediate control of if you are away from the settlement for any period\
      \ of time? Even the adults aren\u2019t smart enough to eat and sleep on their\
      \ own. And, there is not option to switch back to them unless they are close\
      \ by. If this is how it was 3 million years ago I'm amazed that our race didn\u2019\
      t die off from starvation and sleep deprivation!\n\nI found the game got very\
      \ grindy and boring, very fast. I seemed that all I was really able to accomplish\
      \ each day (in game time) was to feed and water all the clan members, do a little\
      \ socializing for mating purposes, and if time permitted gather and stockpile\
      \ some extra food. No time for exploration or much of anything else at all.\
      \ After almost 50 days I felt like I had done nothing but gather food. (Maybe\
      \ I should be playing Farming Simulator instead.)\n\nThe poor combat mechanics\
      \ was another thing. The controls are counter intuitive. In addition, a help\
      \ tip screen pops up and obscures what is going on in the middle of combat.\
      \ Before you can read and react the fight is over and your clan member is either\
      \ maimed or dead. In two separate encounters three of my clan were killed; one\
      \ immediately, the others later from injuries I didn\u2019t know how to treat,\
      \ or couldn\u2019t figure out how to treat in time to save them. This pretty\
      \ much put an end to any reasonable chance at my clan\u2019s future.\n\nI have\
      \ to say that for something that looked like it would be a lot of fun, I was\
      \ very disappointed.\n"
