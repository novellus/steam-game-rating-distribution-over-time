If you fondly remember the original this will put a smile on your face.  It is about as basic as a game can get, but so was the original.  The game is very very short, you can play threw it in 5 minuets, but there is replay value for a few go rounds here.  I could also fault it for a lack of polish, but that could not stop it from putting a smile on this old gamers face.  Totally worth a couple bucks if this one sparks any nostalgia for you.","timestamp_created":1567468082,"timestamp_updated":1567468159,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50317150354385376","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gcCY+uwCd/fK0QE="}
