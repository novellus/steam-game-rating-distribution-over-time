    review: "I just played about 5 levels on this game, maybe a half an hour, so im\
      \ not super qualified to rate this game, \nBut i think i played enough to have\
      \ a good idea. \nIn a nutshell, the game is very simple, you have to escape\
      \ a maze, and fight off monsters in the process. \nThe learning curve is little\
      \ to none. \nI would probably only play the game again if i was bored and had\
      \ nothing else to do. \nThe AI is a bit wonky to say the least (as evident in\
      \ the video below). At times, i was able to follow a \"bad guy\" shoot him in\
      \ the head, and he never turned around to see why he keeps getting shot in the\
      \ head with arrows.\nTo end this review, ill say this. Although there are some\
      \ quirks, i think the quirks made the game more fun. and a goofy, laugh at the\
      \ games faults while you play it kind of way.\n\nHeres my gameplay, see if you\
      \ like it and want to purchase it for yourself.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TMHCXmuhVro\n"
