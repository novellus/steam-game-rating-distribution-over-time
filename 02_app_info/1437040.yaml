    review: 'Despite the negative comments, I do recommand it! But let me tell you
      why I do, and what issue it does contain. First off, if you do know this game
      from the Nintendo 64 and played it before, it''s IDENTICAL! The only difference
      is the OST that has changed except for one single track ''''Happy Bump Bar''''
      which got a great enhancement to it!


      I saw negative comments about the camera, maybe it''s because i''m playing with
      a Microsolf controler? Because I can manipulate it with the ''''+ Pad'''' perfectly,
      I can also zoom-in and out, and pressing ''''Select'''' will auto spin the camera
      to the direction your character is looking at. So overall, i''m having the exact
      same experience I did on the N64 EXCEPT...every 20 mins the FPS will drop dramatically
      and the only way to fix it is save-quit, reboot-game and man...WHY? Please,
      do something because that''s a big problem and people are right about it! It
      would be perfect if this was being fixed with an update!'
