      \ Clear Creek Narrow Gauge route. Set in the 1930s, this new Train Simulator\
      \ route features daunting yet majestic mountain topography; grades of up to\
      \ 4 percent; switchbacks; remote but bustling mining towns; classic wooden passenger\
      \ cars to carry local travelers and tourists to the \u201Cfar famed\u201D Georgetown\
      \ Loop -- and the very the special appeal of diminutive but powerful narrow-gauge\
      \ steam locomotives!<br><br>Created by Milepost Simulations, the Clear Creek\

      \ 55 route miles, the Clear Creek Narrow Gauge route begins at Golden, Colorado,\
      \ some 15 miles west of Denver at an elevation of 5,675 feet, and then extends\
      \ up the rugged Clear Creek Canyon to Forks Creek. There, the railroad thrusts\
      \ two diverging lines high into the Rockies, one making its way to the mining\
      \ towns of Black Hawk and Central City, the other to Georgetown, and then around\
      \ the famous \u201CGeorgetown Loop\u201D and over towering Devil\u2019s Gate\
      \ High Bridge to reach Silver Plume, Colorado at an elevation of 9,101 feet\

      \ 300-foot-long, 96-foot-high Devil\u2019s Gate High Bridge, and two reverse\
      \ loops, all within roughly 3 miles of track \u2013  the Clear Creek Narrow\
      \ Gauge route delivers all the captivating appeal, romance, and operating challenges\

    review: "A well modelled route and, I guess, realistically monotonous, as you\
      \ drive up a river valley with rock outcrops alongside, vegetation and the river.\
      \ The only breaks being the scattered settlements, the buildings of which are\
      \ superbly well modelled with lots of variety.\n\nThe immensely powerful Baldwins\
      \ are fun to drive up the relentless gradients. (For gradients above 0.5% -\
      \ on the detailed F5 menu - throttle to ~85% and adjust speed with 20-45% reverser/cutoff,\
      \ ideally keeping steam usage just below steam generation (not possible on the\
      \ steepest gradients), max fire mass 750lb/75%)\n\nissues -\nScenarios -\nThe\
      \ difficulty levels are incorrect - apart from the tutorials, they are all hard.\n\
      Career -\n[04] Clear Creek Passenger Part II - after 1h20 driving, a bug prevents\
      \ you from loading/unloading passengers at the final stop, resulting in you\
      \ failing the scenario, with zero points.\n\nFor context, I paid \xA310/$13.50/\u20AC\
