    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Your gold is lost! All you have ever fought
      for! It's time for a last crusade and get back what's yours! </h2><br>You are
      one of the last remaining crusaders and all your gold you conquered was stolen
      out of your giant vault. Jump into <strong>procedurally generated dungeons</strong>
      and fight the creatures who stole your gold. Kill them to gain experience and
      grab your gold.<strong> Craft over 20 swords</strong> with different attributes
      to fight the growing threat. The higher your experience is, the more gold the
      creatures will drop. Get to the end of the dungeon to bring your gold to your
      vault. If you die, your experience is lost as well as the currently collected
      gold. <br><br><strong>Be strong! It's your gold they stole!</strong>

    review: "Hardware: i5 3570, nVidia GTX 1070, Windows 10.\n\nBought it because:\
      \ loved the art style, like procedural RPGs. Inexpensive and wanted to check\
      \ it out.\n\n - Fantastic art style. The avatar in particular, a Dwarf whose\
      \ entire body is basically his head, is adorable. It reminds me of the old \"\
      Weeble\" toys from the 70's.\n - A nice dungeon feel with good music.\n\nHowever:\n\
      \nGameplay is shallow; you use WASD to run through the dungeon, which is a single,\
      \ procedurally generated level. Monsters appear; left click attacks, and right\
      \ click blocks. There's a blocking animation, but no sense of contact or weight\
      \ when you do block. Hitting the monsters does produce a sense of contact. They\
      \ all die easily and you automatically pick up gold. When you get to the end\
      \ of the level, you're healed to full, transported back to your home room, and\
      \ get credit for the gold. There's a crafting station there where you can spend\
      \ gold to upgrade your weapon damage, but nothing else. Then it's back into\
      \ the dungeon for another short, random level.\n\n...and that's it. No real\
      \ story. No exploring. No discovery.\n\nPerformance is fairly poor. I was not\
      \ able to get the game playing full-screen, and I recommend you not change the\
      \ default resolution, as you can get into a situation where the game won't start\
      \ at all. There were noticeable framerate drops and video lag issues even with\
      \ my fairly good hardware, though I didn't toy with the detail settings to try\
      \ to improve this.\n\nAnyway, it's a shame this game was left to linger in such\
      \ a basic state. It feels like a well-polished tech demo."
