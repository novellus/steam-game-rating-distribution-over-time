The game starts off feeling like a simple puzzle platformer or metroidvania but evolves into an exciting test of skill with a story tying the different mechanics together.  The only hinder to your progress is your mastery of the controls, and as you progress there are a variety of new obstacles to master.  The pacing is great and the only rooms I found frustrating were optional side tracks.  The devs managed to pack a lot of content into a game that only takes a few hours to complete (plus a few more if you're going for 100% completion).\n\nPros:\n* Interesting but non-intrusive storyline\n* Solid mechanics and pacing\n* A variety of obstacles\n\nCons:\n* The player interaction with platforms can get a bit wonky\n* The story feels a bit weak at the start [spoiler]particularly with the angel and demon whose purpose to the story wasn't clear[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, this is a should play for anyone who wants to spend a day or two with a great game!","timestamp_created":1599327766,"timestamp_updated":1599327766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw36DXr/QCdIGAoAI="}
