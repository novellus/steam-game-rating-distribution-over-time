    short_description: The endless, halcyon days of the summer of love are over, the
      travellers and minstrels, dreamers and drug dealers have gone. Now it's 198X,
      you wake up in a very bad situation. You were the &quot;Sisters of the amniotic
      lens&quot; and now it's time to face what you did all those years ago.
