It can be removed on the first playthrough, but if you lose and restart you cannot close it anymore until you exit the game and restart. Even if you remove the overlay, the game controls like absolute garbage, collisions masks are extremely larger than the obstacles/enemies and the effects are laughable.\n\nApparently this \"game\" has been like this since 2018. Not worth its price. Nor any price.","timestamp_created":1594574840,"timestamp_updated":1594574840,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjKSEovMCdJbtlAI="}
