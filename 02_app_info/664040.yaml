      /><br><strong>Staff Wars: Wizard Rumble</strong> is a chaotic, round based party
      game for 2-4 players. You and your fellow Magi will compete atop a shoddily
      constructed Wizard Tower, where everything you do threatens to take the floor
      out from beneath you!<br>A variety of high-powered explosive spells, items,
      and gadgets will aid in the destruction of the arena, and propel you towards
      your rightful title as the wielder of the Staff of Cool! <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/664040/extras/YJ8xm9c.png?t=1524441105"
      /><br>Rounds are tense, fast-paced, and inevitably end in the demise of all
      Wizards involved.<br>Anyone who stops in place for too long will find the floor
      falling out from underneath them - if a rocket doesnt get them first! Dodge,
      shoot, and <i>maybe</i> even <i>MAGIC</i> your way into being the last Wizard
      standing at the end of the round!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/664040/extras/FlEv5re.png?t=1524441105"
