    about_the_game: 'Enter White Hell, a retro-style first-person shooter where a
      lone survivor, Jarmo, wakes up on his toilet floor after hibernating through
      the apocalypse and has to fight his way through the frozen wastelands of Finland
      controlled by opposing extremist groups.<h2 class="bb_tag">Weapons: from familiar
      to foreign</h2>From the classic pump-action shotgun to a sword powered by eldritch
      energy, White Hell provides a familiar although unique arsenal of weapons.<h2
      class="bb_tag">A journey across a frost-bound land ...and beyond</h2>After humble
      beginnings in an apartment building, your journey leads you through overtaken
      cities, secret research facilities, dangerous wilderness, and into another dimension.<h2
      class="bb_tag">The enemy of my enemy is my enemy</h2>The dystopian civilization
      of White Hell is firmly divided into two factions: the fascist Order of the
      Blue Eagle and the communist Red Tomorrow. Both parties are more than willing
      to exterminate outside threats, which include you.<h2 class="bb_tag">Unleash
      the power of SISU</h2>Jarmo can harvest magical SISU-energy by eradicating his
      enemies after unlocking his hidden powers. This energy can be used to activate
      SISU-mode where your weapons transform into super-powered versions with new
      features.'
