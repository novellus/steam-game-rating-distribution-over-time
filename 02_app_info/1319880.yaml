    review: "[i] Not for everyone in terms of length and visuals, but I enjoyed some\
      \ of the heartwarming moments when it comes to dialogue and making friends.\
      \ The game is 1 to 5 minutes long with about 60 minutes of exploration in total,\
      \ I ended up replaying it 10 times to find most of the endings. Essentially\
      \ the goal is to dispose of 6 cupcakes any way you like, you can eat them yourself,\
      \ give them to friends to improve your relationship, or put them in weird places\
      \ (and you get some pictures at the end based on your choices). While some endings\
      \ are pretty easy to get like flushing cupcakes down the toilet, other outcomes\
      \ can be a lot more cryptic. For example, I run into a few hidden dialogue lines\
      \ that are not accessible unless you do something specific. It would be nice\
      \ to have achievements just so I can track all of the secrets. The closest game\
      \ I can compare it to would be Dear Red that introduced me to this subgenre\
      \ of choice-based exploration games, it's a fun way to navigate the story but\
      \ I find that you need more than just a decent narrative to make it work.\n\n\
      [h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ I enjoyed the writing and characters, many silly jokes\
      \ if you into that\n+ many obvious and not so obvious ways to end the game \n\
      \n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\n[u] Could use achievements for tracking progress [/u]\
      \ - I don't think that achievements are needed for all games, however, specifically\
      \ in this genre you have to hunt for those small secrets that deviate the story\
      \ in different ways, and without achievements, I can't tell if I need to keep\
      \ looking for more. If you had those, it would encourage me to do 100% completion.\
      \ \n\n[u] Visuals [/u] - the art is not the most important thing for me if you\
      \ can write enjoyable characters, but even if you are not good at drawing, I\
      \ think you have to find a way to make your game presentable (or let someone\
      \ else do the sprites). Luckily when it comes to top-down RPGM games you don't\
      \ need complex animation, just need to find an art style that works for you\
      \ and simple to do.\n\n[u] Entering the name [/u] - a small nitpick, but I found\
      \ the name entry annoying because the run is only a few minutes long, so I ended\
      \ up calling myself the default 'Press ESC' which is not immersive. It should\
      \ either save my name between runs or not waste my time entering it every 2\
      \ minutes.\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 6/10 [/b]\n\nI get amused very easily when\
      \ the choices in the game feel so random, like giving the player the ability\
      \ to stay in the closet or throwing a cupcake from the roof, I do like that\
      \ meta-humour or whatever you want to call it ;). Rachel, I think you doing\
      \ a great job making a fun narrative experience, but it's not the only reason\
      \ people buy narrative games, you should find a way to make the game presentable\
      \ visually as well, you can have simple aesthetic and make it work too. \n\n\
