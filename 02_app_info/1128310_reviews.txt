I thought the game to be more classic ARPG, instead you have a party based rpg with controls i don't like. I asked for a refund coz I'm sure I won't touch this game anymore.\n\nThis being said I can imagine people really loving this game. It's not bad or anything just not my cup of tea.","timestamp_created":1588489179,"timestamp_updated":1588489179,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.457356870174407959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ496nV7PECd5SchQI="}
