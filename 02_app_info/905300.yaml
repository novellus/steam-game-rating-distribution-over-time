    about_the_game: In this game you will have the opportunity to participate in these
      races for survival. You will need to hold out as much as possible circles and
      try not to crash into cars of other racers. It is not so easy as it looks at
      first glance, because on the road you are trapped by all sorts of obstacles.
      For example, spilled oil or just bad road surface.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/905300/extras/daytona_racing.jpg?t=1533718934"

      Perhaps it will be you! You can compete with your friends and find out which
      of you is the best racer. The game is very simple operation, which will be clear
      even to children, so that the game will be able to play a variety of players.
      The game will help you develop skills such as care and reaction speed, and generally
      help to brighten up the time.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/905300/extras/os.png?t=1533718934"
