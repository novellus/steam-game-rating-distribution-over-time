I don't understand why people are complaining about the angles and editing. For me, this was positive and a lot better than all those boring fixed-angle/fixed-position films.  I just hope that they keep building better and better cameras the coming years (16K VR360) despite the small market for it, because the current hardware (cameras and headsets) clearly isn't ready for prime time.  I don't think Robert Rodriguez could have done it (much) better than this.  Obviously, the budget could't have been high for such a small audience, and with hardware that is extremely limited of what it can produce, even the best director and best actors in the world, would have a very hard time making something good.  I hope the future will bring more of these VR movies, I believe in it, but it simply needs to be in (much) higher quality.","timestamp_created":1595627577,"timestamp_updated":1595627577,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46pO0wfMCeOGslwI="}
