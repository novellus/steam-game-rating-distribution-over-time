    review: 'Basic, short Hidden Object game. Wouldn''t purchase it on its own, though.
      It came in a very discounted bundle with other games, that''s the only reason
      I have it and the main reason I''m not being too demanding with my review.



      The animations are basic and honestly ugly looking when it comes to the characters.
      The dialogues are very few and brief, maybe to save costs. As a work around
      you find out most important plot points through notes or letters. Even when
      you''re standing next to a character at one point...


      The Hidden Object sections were good, definitely the highlight of the entire
      game, but the puzzles were clunky and boring. Expect a lot of aligning of things.
      Also, the logic for solving certain scenarios is super wacky. Had to break a
      statue at some point. Hammer? No, wouldn''t work. Gunpowder and matches? No,
      got to be something else. The answes: Tie six balloons to the statue, fill the
      balloons with regular air so the rock solid statue somehow levitates, and then
      proceed to shoot each ballon with an arrow to have the statue fall down and
      break into pieces. Just insane.


      Why am I giving this a positive review? It''s an okahy enough game, it doesn''t
      bug or glitch like some others I''ve encountered, and it doesn''t pretendt to
      be something bigger than what it actually is. Just something quick and mindless
      you can play to pass the time when bored.'
