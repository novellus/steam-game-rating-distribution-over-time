The game holds many of it's simple innovative features on it's sleeves, isometric perspective/level creator and 3D levels are all great additions that really set this apart.\n\nThe levels are really the best part of this many of them a treat to look at and the key focus of the game (seen as it is the levels you are destroying) I have only unlocked 5 of the 15 levels to unlock, quite a few of the levels are pretty difficult and will take multiple plays to get past but there is satisfaction in defeating that level that has really been giving you difficulty.\n\nThe music is very \"chiptune\"/80/90/early gaming inspired (as are the sound effects) and this adds to the experience, but maybe not to everyone's taste.\n\nThe level creator is easy to use, but would need sometime put into it to get the most from the features (I barely used what is possible with the editor but still managed to get a playable level). You can share a screenshot of your level but there is no option to share a level.","timestamp_created":1503871002,"timestamp_updated":1503871002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.425344735383987427","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2czskt4Cf5jhgwE="}
