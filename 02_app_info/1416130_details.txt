The way the normal office furniture shatters and the vermin splat when you hit them is very satisfying. The narrative is also perfectly executed, with lots of little clues about what’s really going on throughout and an ending that gives much more significance to your vermin-splatting rampage. Highly recommended.”<br>Highly recommended. – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.freegameplanet.com\/perfect-vermin-download-game\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Alpha Beta Gamer<\/a><br><br>“But either way it was interesting. It's not really like. Well its actually kind of fun. Smashing stuff not hunting down the vermin, just smashing stuff in general is pretty fun. But the actual experience itself is very unique. I think that's the best compliment you could give. I'm not using it as a sarcastic unique but I mean like literally it was unique.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r89sNS2bnbA&amp;ab_channel=ManlyBadassHero\" target=\"_blank\"
