While it might not be among the best videogame soundtracks, it's enjoyable, so I can still recommend it. I personally decided to buy it to throw a few extra bucks at the developers of the game, especially because I like collecting and listening to videogame soundtracks.","timestamp_created":1590880820,"timestamp_updated":1590880820,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580579578876495361","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwstv4s/ICef2kiwI="}
