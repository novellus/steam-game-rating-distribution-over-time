    review: "Its a shame there are not more games like this on the market. I understand\
      \ that games need to be financed and receive income to be successful, but I\
      \ wish that more Christian games like Adam Venture would be sold on the market.\
      \  They need to be advertised on Christian TV sites like Yippee and Pure Flix-\
      \ I think if more Christians knew about this, these games would get more coverage.\
      \  \n\nThe average gamer on Steam is an unbeliever who wants nothing more than\
      \ to fulfill their lusts for violence, vulgarity, deceit, and sexual content.\
      \ I know, because I was one of them. \n After Jesus Christ came into my life,\
      \ I realized how sinful I was and what I deserve is eternal hell when I look\
      \ at the Ten Commandments.  I understood that God is Holy and Just, and therefore\
      \ will NEVER let someone who loved, ignored, and played down their grievous\
      \ offense into Eternal Life.  It would be worse than a mass murderer being taken\
      \ to court and pretending like he did nothing wrong! The look of shock on his\
      \ face when the Just Judge pronounces life in prison and/or the death sentence!\n\
      The good news, or Gospel, is this: Jesus Christ is God, came to Earth as a man,\
      \ lived a sinless life although tempted in every way... endured our struggles,\
      \ felt our emotion, and did many great miracles of healing and even raised people\
      \ from the dead!  However, none of that would really matter to any of us unless\
      \ He didn't fulfill His mission, for He would be relegated to a footnote of\
      \ history- on the list of good teachers who came and died.  \nBut He did fulfill\
      \ His mission! Because the ruling class thought of Him as blasphemer (because\
      \ He claimed to be one with God) they turned Him over to the roman authorities\
      \ so they could punish Him.. and punish they did!  He was shamed in front of\
      \ a court, spat on, beaten, scourged by roman flagrum, then paraded down the\
      \ street carrying a piece of wood. He would be nailed to it outside the city\
      \ and left for dead- a slow agonizing death that could take days.  He could\
      \ have saved Himself easily, but His mission was to take upon Himself the sins\
      \ of all who believe, so that our death sentence could be commuted..  God will\
      \ not die, for He is eternal- and after he endured death for us, raised Himself\
      \ up on the 3rd day! The purpose: to pay the cost of our sins, for we cannot\
      \ pay for them ourselves."
