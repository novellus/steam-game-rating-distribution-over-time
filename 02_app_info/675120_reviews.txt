If you want to play it, prepare yourself for a challenge.\n\nPositive:\n\n+ Unlimited continues (you will need them)\n+ Challenging, hard but not impossible to beat\n+ Many different enemies, which increase in difficulty\n+ 8 Different locations\n+ Every boss is different\n+ Good Soundtrack and fine graphics\n+ Controls are very accurate\n\n\nNegative:\n\n- Sometimes a little bit too unfair and frustrating\n- Loot is random (and you always get only treasure when you really need a potion)\n- Some bosses are easier to beat than the stages before him\n- No recovery time (on the last levels are traps which can cause a chain reaction because of that)\n- \"Start new game\" comes before \"Continue\", so watch out. :D\n- Ladders feel a little bit slipery\n\n\nOverall, it's a good, enjoyable game and for that price, you shouldn't think twice.\nBut don't say i haven't warned you about the difficulty. :P","timestamp_created":1502631280,"timestamp_updated":1514637854,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478458255529403687","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0/Dc0+ACc4zCggE="}
