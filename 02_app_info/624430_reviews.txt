It has great visuals, one good voice actor (emphasis on \"one\") and does a good job of utilizing hand controlers in-game (emphasis on \"in-game\"). It looked like it had everything to be an amazing story driven space fighter game, a brand new \"Star fox VR\" that would 1-up [i]House of the Dying Sun[/i] (a game that I believe currently holds that title) and it looked like it was going in the right direction, but then took a complete 180, gave that one well voiced character the Vaudeville Hook, and slamed down the curtine with a \"That's all folks!\" The only reason I might keep this game is because I got it for a steal on sale at $3, but that's all it's really worth, here's why:\n\n[h2]The Menu[/h2]\n\nThe first problem you encounter is in the menu. You get your standard lazer pointer to select things with the controllers. Everything's well and good until you actually try to change things. The lazer locks on to the sliders you use to change things like brightness and volume, but if you try selecting these things with the triggers, the lazer switches hands. I guess it was meant to be a means of unlocking yourself from the sliders, but it was unnecisarrily confusing. However, once you jump in the game, you'll find that this is the least of it's problems.\n\n[h2]Your \"Ship\"s\"[/h2]\n\nLike [i]Star Fox[/i], this game has 3 ship types, each with different speeds and weapons. The only trouble is: each is only used once, and NONE OF THEM CAN TURN FOR SHIT! This becomes apparent in the first level, where you fight your first enemy fighter. Now most games give you the upper hand in this type of encounter, but this one has you doing loop-da-loops around eachother because neither of you can rotate sharp enough to face one another. What kind of space fighter game doesn't let you thwart your opponents with agile manuvers? I asked myself this question and laughed remembering Jontron's review of Aquaman 64 and his famous line: \"Ever wanted to play the most annoying level of 'Star Fox 64,' every time?\" That's this game too!\n\n[h2]The Final Level[/h2]\n\nThe final level, a.k.a. LEVEL 3 is just 10 minutes into the game and you are already taking your snarky robot companion into the enemy \"planet\" to destroy it. Why did it take me 47 more minutes to finish the level? Because the game completely drops it's space fighting genre and becomes a rage game instead! From the beginning of the level, your afformentioned snarky robot companion cuts to the chace and straight up tells you that your new ship is a peice of crap. Hey, that kinda reminds me of what Falco said in that afformentioned [i]Star Fox[/i] level. Take this as a warning because you will get a bunch of insane obsticals thrown at you which wouldn't be a problem if your ship wasn't so big and sluggish. Then when you finally get to your objective, your robot companion, whom you just barely met, decides to do a cliche \"best buddie sacrifice\" before you even had the chance to bond with him. Then, you gotta do all that rage inducing flying back out of the \"planet\" accept this time you're under the pressure of his 2 minute fuse! \n\n20 deaths later, it's over an you're rewarded with a credit sequence that feels more broken than the rest of the game as it only shows one line, and then just locks you in this white room with the \"ghost\" of your robot companion as if we are supposed to still care about him.\n\nLong story short, this feels like a demo for an ambitious kickstarter game, and if it was, I would be extatic in anticipation for the full release, I might have even backed it! But NO, this is the whole game as far as I can tell, and it's over before you can grow attached enough to cheer it on! If you missed the sale I jumped on, I guarentee that your $10 is much better spent towards  [i]House of the Dying Sun[/i].","timestamp_created":1506787689,"timestamp_updated":1577390964,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578792333602905273","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0v/0oe8CcPzphgE="}
