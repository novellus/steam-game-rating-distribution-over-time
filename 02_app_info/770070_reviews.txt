Final boss just spam spells and does nothing. Also kinda unbalanced - mage and rogue are useless compared to warrior. Playing dungeon on difficulty higher than normal is impossible, since no matter what I do I get 15lvl higher enemies that almost always oneshot me. \nIt was fun, but not as fun as good old S&S 2 or 5.","timestamp_created":1609370984,"timestamp_updated":1609370984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5Iv/2vYCdtP3vgI="}
