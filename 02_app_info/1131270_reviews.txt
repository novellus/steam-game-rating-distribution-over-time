I’m reviewing this because I was forced at gunpoint to play this for 60 minutes and I don’t want anyone getting the wrong idea and picking this up based on my playtime.\n\n[h1] PROS [/h1]\n\n[list]+  that feeling of relief when you exit out of the game.  Playing Zombie Golf is nothing short of torture.  That exit game option made me feel all warm and tingly.[/list]\n\n[list]+  this is someone’s work.  Look.  I couldn’t even make this and someone did.  So they are already a more qualified programmer than me and I applaud the effort it must take to learn a skill like coding.  Also it’s a free market and you can decide to put something out for nothing or to charge for it.  If this game was free and it was someone’s first attempt and making a game and they wanted to test it out on Steam then I wouldn’t be here.  But it costs money and it says it’s in EA and it hasn’t been updated in a year.  This game is going nowhere.[/list]\n\n[h1] CONS [/h1]\n\n[list]-  golfing surgeon simulator.  The controls are so bad for this game its laughable.  But its not funny in a Surgeon Sim or Ampu-tea way.  The angle on the ball makes no sense, you can hit it at the same angle and same power 3 times in a row and it will go in 3 different directions.  The cursor will go off the screen making it impossible to aim and generally you are just in for a bad time all round trying to take these balls.[/list]\n\n[list]-  sound.  There is virtually no noise in this game.  A zombie will groan if you hit it.  A red barrel will go boom if you hit it.  The ball bounces and makes a tapping sound.  But other than the terrible title screen music, the game has pretty much been audibly sterilized.[/list]\n\n[list]-  lack of levels.  It might be a little bit more worth it if there were more levels and perhaps a level selector if by some miracle you found a level you enjoyed playing but as it stands there are only 4 levels and they all suck. [/list]\n\n[list]-  general boredom and frustration.  There is not a single thing redeeming about this game.  At least if there were some cards or some cheevos for say, landing a ball in the back of a pickup truck.  Or hitting the ball into 2 zombies, you know….like some sort of challenge?  The only challenge is to not gnaw your own fingers off in despair while playing this.[/list]\n\n[h1] THE CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nTake a mulligan on this game back to before you even hit the play button.  There is nothing to see here.  I can’t even say this game is rough round the edges and could be saved with some work.  It would require a full overhaul and I just don’t see that happening.","timestamp_created":1607964259,"timestamp_updated":1607964458,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":36,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.780102074146270752","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwwc+JsfYCdZGWugI="}
