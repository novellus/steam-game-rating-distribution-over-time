    about_the_game: "** Multiplayer gameplay trailer will be up when I get gameplay**<br\
      \ />\r\nWhy I made this game:<br />\r\nI made this game for the players to enjoy\
      \ some old school arcade shooter. Have friends to play with you and enjoy yourself..\
      \ no battle pass or anything crazy.. just enjoy yourselves and have fun!!<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat this game expresses:<br />\r\nI want Deadly Maze to help\
      \ build friendships and make new ones with Co-op. Take your friends and put\
      \ them in a 1v1 situation. Have a grudge with someone take them to in there\
      \ and see how many times you can beat them. All in all... I hope everyone enjoys\
      \ my game!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContent:<br />\r\nWe got all kinds of modes:\
      \ 1v1, 1v3, 2v2, cooperative and last team standing. For those who just want\
      \ to play and have nobody to play with there is a singleplayer mode so you can\
      \ train and learn the maps if you need to. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverview of the\
      \ game:<br />\r\nIts a really simple arcade shooter. When I say simple.. I really\
      \ mean simple... I wanted to focus on the gameplay over graphics. I am still\
      \ new with this engine so I had to go back to old school gameplay so there is\
      \ very little animation. I just want players to have fun playing this game and\
      \ to meet new people."

    short_description: Just an old school arcade shooter that isn't made to be taken
      seriously... Just have fun with friends or by yourself. This game is just here
