    review: 'Meh, nice idea but badly executed, You have to navigate through some
      kind of space anomalies which completely swallow any kind of light... of course
      there is a monster hunting you. To find your way through the anomalies you have
      to use a sonar, which gives you one particular sound for "wall ahead" and one
      for "no wall" within (approximation) 3 meters. Sounds like a good idea, but
      it sucks! You easyly lose orientation, especially when the monster is close
      behind you... and then you die. That also sucks because there is no way to save,
      only checkpoints, probably to make the game longer. Bugs - of course. The setting
      is a joke too. Textures and objects are so unbelievable repetitive, it actually
      makes this "horror game" kinda "funny". Absolutely ridiculous!


      All in all, this is NOT A GAME, just a demo of an idea with minimal effort which
      should be for free!

      To expect people to pay 6 dollars for this demo is absolutely ridiculous!


      STAY AWAY!!!'
