I also like the idea of how you can conquer the other settlements and be able to force them to pay tribute to you.  \nThe story is simple and easy to follow with a few side quests which you guessed it, they are not morally good. \nNow the gameplay has this feel of Mount and Bland with rpg elements. The last part I want to say is that this game would become more fun if modding was to get introduced, because imagine playing this with Fallout mods.","timestamp_created":1605084136,"timestamp_updated":1609205400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471941173076629639","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnLiH1vYCddjarQI="}
