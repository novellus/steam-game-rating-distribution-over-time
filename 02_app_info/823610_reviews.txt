This is all well and fine, but it failed to get me. In Legend of Grimrock, I was invested almost immediately, while LoG2 repelled me in the second level by introducing spiders hopping in my face. The developer was so nice as to confirm for me, that THERE ARE NO SPIDERS in DODK. Really big plus!\nOn the other hand, I didn't feel my attacks make an impact, I didn't know what I did wrong sometimes, and though death isn't too punishing with liberal checkpoints/autosaves, I quit on my second death three levels down and won't return. It looks good, but doesn't feel good for me.\nSolid dungeon crawler, just not for me.\n\nFollow my curator at https://store.steampowered.com/curator/28337205-Fair-Minded-Witness/","timestamp_created":1609786826,"timestamp_updated":1609786826,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0bOx5/YCevy8wAI="}
