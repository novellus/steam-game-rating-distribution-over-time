Glitches still happen ... two people in a Tub, clothed bathing, one person jumping into all the Tubs, multiple people in a Changing Screen and other glitches.\n\nThe toilets work on any floor a Bathroom Room is built.\nSo do the Posh Sinks.\nSo do the Changing Screens.\n\nWooden Sinks still do not work.\n\nDon't expect a busy Bathroom, its just another basic room in the end, nothing game-changing or unique. I have 5 Tubs and only one gets used. Maybe two if the Inn is busy. Historically Bath-houses were busy so I expected a busy room, but it is not.\n\nStill missing the \"elborate mosaics and tiles\" and I have looked for them, as shown in the DLC Store Page pic.\n\nThumbs Up but with a warning you may have lots of problems for awhile at the start of a game and they may persist.\n\nIt still needs fixing like The Pit DLC.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW ...\nThis DLC upon initial release barely works for me on New and Old Saves, or whatever Inn floor is chosen or location on a floor.\n\nOnly 1 Sink and 2 Toilets work, besides the decorations. The \"elborate mosaics and tiles\" are no where to be found, unless the nude portraits are them. The Changing Screens cannot be tested because the Tubs don't work to begin with. Base game Tub never worked either.\n\nWhy release a DLC based on Tubs when the first Tub never worked and, I assume, would just have the mechanic copied over to the new 6 Tubs?\n\nThe special Bathroom Room icon under Build Mode only showed up when the Build Mode Menu is randomly clicked on once opened. Room built OK.\n\nWooden Sink has no Water Requirement so none delivered so Sink is not functional.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2204335220\n\nPorcelain Sink has 5 Water Requirement which gets delivered so Sink is functional.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2204335561\n\nAll Tubs have no Water Requirement so none delivered so all Tubs are not functional. Just like the base game original Tub.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2204335386\n\nUnknown if all Change Screens are functional as all Tubs are not functional. I did install them from DLC .\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2204335056\n\nThe price does not bother me ... $3 (a coffee irl)... but it barely works and after reporting it on the Bug Thread and getting the response I did, in addition to my growing base game problems, I cannot give support to this DLC. \n\nI'll change this Review once I see the DLC fixed.","timestamp_created":1597963025,"timestamp_updated":1599786309,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.642352283000946045","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42LqsvfQCfYfcnAI="}
