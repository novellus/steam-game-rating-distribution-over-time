    review: Game does not work whatsoever. Every time I start it, my monitor turns
      blank and nothing happens. Most annoying ist that once that happens, there is
      no way you can stop the game running, neither Alt+F4 nor windows-button nor
      task manager work. So you hav to manually switch off your computer every time.
      As you can see from other reviews and from the forums, this problem has persisted
      for years and developers could not be assed to fix it. The fix that is proposed
      in the forums has also stopped working. Gonna ask for a refund, fuck this game.
