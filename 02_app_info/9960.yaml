    review: "Atari Haunted House (Remastered) - A great concept, to some, a poor execution.\n\
      \nI am not sure how I honestly feel about that.  My love of all things classic,\
      \ tells me that I should give this one a pass, however, my serious gaming side\
      \ (as small as it may be), tells me be honest.  \n\nWhat I have played of this\
      \ game it is fun, once you get use to it, the fun novelty of it shines through,\
      \ and what a great addition to anyone's library for the sake of Halloween and\
      \ whatnot, honestly, I kind of like the feel of it, and like the updated graphics\
      \ to the original Atari 2600 game I use to play as a kid makes me feel nostalgic,\
      \ so yeah, I am sorry for anyone that expects a harsh review, but I just can't\
      \ bring myself to do it, its a fun game to me, I recommend this one, its well\
      \ worth the play, but definitely get it on sale if you still can!"
