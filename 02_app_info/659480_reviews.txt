The game incorporates a variety of common puzzle types while maneuvering within a thriller atmosphere.  \n\nThe puzzle types in [i]The Initiate[/i] include hidden solutions/codes, color coding based on references, finding hidden objects, piecing together riddles, and a switch-based maze.  The puzzles are varied enough to keep the player interested.  Veterans to puzzle games will find most of the puzzles somewhat familiar and logical.  [i]The Initiate[/i] requires a very keen eye compared to most puzzle games as some solutions and objects are well hidden, either physically or within journal notes.  Without a guide, players will spend around three or four hours working through the puzzles.\n\nThe uniqueness of [i]The Initiate[/i] comes from the thrilling atmosphere it strives for.  The game takes place in a suburban home.  The player takes the role of \"Nathan,\" a short-term amnesiac who has applied to become part of the Organization.  As part of Nathan's interview, he must escape the house without breaking any rules.  The game partially achieves the atmosphere it wants.  The physical space in a well-lit house does not lend itself fully to the thriller genre.  It feels as those the developers were going for the obviously-being-watch-is-creepy vibe, which doesn't quite do enough to get the heart pumping.  However, the music and narrative work wonderfully to create a thrilling - and sometimes creepy - atmosphere.\n\n[i]The Initiate[/i] was made by a small team.  With that, there are some bugs and issues, as expected.  Often, narration will play twice simultaneously with slight dissonance.  There are some areas in which it is difficult to maneuver.  There are multiple spelling and grammatical mistakes and an overall need for polish.  There is nothing game breaking or anything that would ruin the experience for players.  To the developers' credit, they do seem to care about the game and have made attempts to correct issues players have found.\n\nOverall, [i]The Initiate[/i] is recommended for fans of puzzle games.  The game has fun challenges, an interesting little story, and good atmosphere.","timestamp_created":1609700840,"timestamp_updated":1609700840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpLLp5PYCet2UwAI="}
