    about_the_game: "Ricerca (ri-cher-ka), which in Italian means \u201Csearch,\u201D\
      \ is an animated installation experience. In it, we follow a bicyclist searching\
      \ through different memories and worlds to find something he has lost over time.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis film was originally experienced on 5 different projection\
      \ screens in an art gallery space with custom-designed 8 channel surround sound,\
      \ and has since then been re-created virtually in order to showcase the art\
      \ installation experience to more people with ease. Created by artist animator\
      \ Yo-Yo Lin, Ricerca is a media installation that combines the virtues of cinematic\
      \ storytelling with that of installation art, an experience designed to tell\
      \ compelling stories in a more intimate format. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRicerca\
      \ pushes boundaries in storytelling by creating a cinematic experience every\
      \ viewer will experience and interpret differently by how they move around in\
      \ space. The installation beckons viewers to physically move in and around the\
      \ animated film and explore the three-dimensional soundscape in the room, giving\
      \ viewers the ability to develop a highly personal relationship with the film\
      \ and go on their own self-search through time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Ricerca\
      \ VR&quot; is itself its own unique experience- instead of being in a room with\
      \ other viewers, one goes on their own meditative journey in solitude. Just\
      \ as in the physical art installation, the entire experience loops over after\
      \ 12 minutes, giving the viewer opportunities to ruminate over the experience\
      \ many times. The narrative is structured to have no clear beginning or end,\
      \ drawing from the director\u2019s Buddhist beliefs of reincarnation and flow\
      \ of karmic energy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe sound design and musical score come\
      \ together to create a directed experience in 360 space, allowing viewers to\
      \ effectively follow a narrative on five screens by following certain hard sounds\
      \ in different parts of the room. While there are directional sounds present\
      \ to tell the viewer where to look, ambient sounds are spread throughout the\
      \ room to create an immersive world for the viewer themselves to explore freely.\
      \ Using Two Big Ear's 3Dception, our team effectively re-created our soundscape\
      \ for Ricerca VR.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile Ricerca VR is no game, it presents\
      \ an interesting idea of how art installations can live on in virtual space,\
      \ changing our perception of a temporal-based medium into one that has the potential\
      \ to live on in a digital afterlife. Ricerca VR asks the questions, how will\
      \ virtual reality be used to archive and distribute art? Will a virtual gallery\
      \ system appear as the line between art and technology continue to be blurred?\
      \ How can we foster the human experience that is integral in art-viewing with\

    review: "[h1]Experienced on Windows Mixed Reality[/h1]\n\nThis is a purely cinematic\
      \ experience. This isn't really VR. You're in a VR environment sure, but it's\
      \ just a sad white room with 5 big screens where you can see a 2D film play\
      \ on on those 5 screens and you can sort of get immersed in the different happenings\
      \ on each screen. Sometimes there will only be one screen showing, other times\
      \ all 5 screen will be showing different perspectives of the story.\n\nWhole\
      \ affairs takes approximately 12 minutes (the experience does restart on its\
      \ own and has an abrupt conclusion). There is good spatial audio. The drawings\
      \ and animations, in my opinion, were not all that great. The story was very\
      \ artistic and experimental. There is no dialogue. \n\nThis experience really\
      \ wasn't my cup of tea. You may enjoy it more than I did, but I can only give\
      \ it a neutral recommendation, mostly due to the low price.\n\n[b]Rate 5/10.\
      \ Buy if you're into artsy, college-level productions.[/b]"
