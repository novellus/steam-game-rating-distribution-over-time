    about_the_game: 'Kill heroes first. Ask questions later. (Note: game does not
      actually require you to ask any questions)<br><br>Heroes Must Die is the story
      of a young hero forcibly conscripted into the villain''s army, and viewing classic
      RPG trials from this perspective. Faced with the daunting task of dealing with
      the world''s evilest boss, stupidest minions, daringest freedom fighters, and
      troublesome-est posers, how do you survive a world where all sides are in conflict?
      Battle through hours of challenging combat (even we have to work hard to beat
      our own game), laugh out loud dialogue (but like, for real, not a ''lol''),
      and surprising story turns (seriously, a professional playwright wrote this
      game).<br><br>Heroes Must Die is an action-RPG with aesthetics inspired by the
      best roleplaying games of the 16 bit era, with the sophisticated story and design
      of modern epics. Follow a grand and fun story of trying to break the world and
      then save it. Combat is easy to learn and difficult to master. And best of all,
      it''s free.<br><br>And if that wasn''t enough, Heroes Must Die has a sequel
      - an interactive stage show that brings video games to life - now available
      here on Steam!<br><br>Features:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Unique Combat - An
      action/puzzle battle system different than anything out there, but still intuitive.
      Simple rules but difficult to master.<br></li><li>Actual Writing - Heroes Must
      Die brings sincerely funny dialogue and engaging story. Not content for half-assed
      reference humor, HMD brings its full ass, and borrows a few other asses, to
      tell a structured tale with memorable characters and moment after moment of
      making you laugh without interrupting the flow.<br></li><li>Pixel Art - Retro-inspired
      graphics from artists who grew up on the best of the 16-bit era. Detailed backgrounds

      mashup of funky tunes propel you through the game. Available for download!<br></li><li>No
