    review: "I am sad. I really wanted to like this game because it legit looks awesome!\
      \ <3\n\nBut-- the lack of a graphical options menu has made the game unplayable\
      \ for me. My FOV is all messed up somehow and I can't pick any items up which\
      \ basically ends the game for me. \n\nI'm going to give this a 'No' for now.\
      \ I would love to change my review, but I need to be able to play the game.\
      \ The last update was in August. Hopefully the Dev comes back and adds that\
      \ menu, which would allow me (and many others who are having the same problems)\
      \ to enjoy the game. \n\nFingers crossed, friends! :)"
