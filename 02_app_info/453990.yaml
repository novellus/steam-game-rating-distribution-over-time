    review: 'Edited Review:


      Since my previous review, I have since beaten the game in all aspects aside
      from Insanity Shuffle, because as the name implies, its insane. Mibibli''s Quest
      is still to this day an absolute gem, and if you''re a fan of Platformer-Shooters,
      I couldn''t recommend this game enough. It carries a vibe and aesthetic that
      no other games I''ve played have had, and its simply so brilliantly unique with
      everything that it does. The game both tests your patience and your skill, so
      buckle up if you''re not used to more difficult games. Overall, Mibibli''s Quest
      is a game I haven''t seen many people play or talk about, so I hope you give
      it a try, and if you like it, spread the word even further.


      Original Review:


      Two years ago, my friend stole my laptop for about 10 minutes, then gave it
      back to me with the original free version of this game booted up and ready to
      play. Ever since then, it has become one of my favorite platformers of all time.
      I almost feel ashamed about just now finding out about this version on Steam.
      Needless to say, I instantly bought it and now I intend on playing it for many
      months of tears and cries of joy to come. Sooner or later, once I finish this
      paid-version, I''ll come back and edit this on my thoughts on the new content.
      For now, I already give this game 1,000 thumbs up, if you like platformers or
      a great challenge, buy this game.'
