Now I've found this game again and I want to finish the series. \nI like the charm of this old-school game, especially the fact, that every move, every action in this game is a round, you don't need to pause the game, you just have to leave the game alone. Perfect for me, cause I love turn based games so much! :)\nBtw. I bought this game at the same time I bought Cyberpunk2077 and I am currently playing this game. haha","timestamp_created":1608202159,"timestamp_updated":1608202159,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ubCUuPYCcd70ugI="}
