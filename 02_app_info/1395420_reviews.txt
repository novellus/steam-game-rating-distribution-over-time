But game itself is unplayable mess and garbage.\nUI is the worst. It does not even considers the video-safe areas. On my 31'' display the UI looks just terrible and unpleasant.\nMenu does have unskippable ugly title screens and veeeerryy long fades to black.\nLoading bar does not means loading - the battle mode still spends alot of time loading while bar is 100%, then much more time on black screen before game actually starts.\n\nTo reach the FPS game you need to play some sort of GO-base building (I repeat - the game does have really bad and un-informative user interface).\nFor trailer the basebuilding maybe is cool to watch - but ingame it is terrible and not fun and lacks visual feedback for your actions.\n\nAt some point during base building there appears yellow dot and you can click it and begin battle.\n\nAuthor of the game seems knew that base-building is crap - so he/she added option to select quick battle level from menu (there like less then ten total battle stages).\n\nThe weapons and enemy is trash. Probably author spent ton of time editing video to make a bullshot trailer. Notice how player carefully touch enemy robots with his gunfire (to not kill them) in trailer - because 95% of time their death effect is really ugly and bad and they just disseapear when dead.\n\nThere are ton of performance problems, like I got random hicups for half of second when firing a gun.\nI cannot even change my mouse sensivity while in battle mode. And default setting for sensivity is very-very high.\n\nYou don't feel liberating any planet like it mentioned on store page. There are just some optional text with story (you need to watch long fade-to-black animations to reach the story). \n\nTotally at the moment of writing this review Human Diaspora feels like a overpriced asset flip game!\n\n[b]Summary: someone just throw some random models together, glued some visual-basic forms for UI, selected few CC-licensed audio tracks and called it the game.  [/b]\n\nMaybe cool for screenshots, but disgusting as a game.\n\nReally terrible user experience! Avoid it at all cost while it still is in Early Access.","timestamp_created":1605723214,"timestamp_updated":1605723863,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568630814552307129","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4/bam7vUCe9SUrwI="}
