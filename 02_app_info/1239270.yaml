      is a dangerous place filled with mystical creatures, witches and ghouls. You
      are a lone bounty hunter collecting runes to become the strongest mage of Yoren.<br><br>Your
      journey starts at your hideout deep within Yoren's icy mountains. Here you can
      safely practice your magic against the dummies in the practice field, or craft
      potions and wands at your very own forge.<br><br>Yoren is currently in early
      access, this means that some parts of the game are still undergoing development.
      Currently the game mainly serves as an experimental magic sandbox. Bugs, glitches
      and performance issues are to be expected.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1239270/extras/practice.gif?t=1590419616"
      /><br><br>Before you start looting and exploring the fallen kingdoms and dungeons
      of Yoren looking for special artifacts and runes you've got to be prepared for
      anything or anyone crossing your path. All around the world of Yoren are crystals
      growing. Perfect for brewing potions, or crafting wands. Discover new recipes,
      ingredients and spells along the way.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1239270/extras/worm.gif?t=1590419616"

      VR technology for spell casting. Draw rune shape gestures to select and cast
      spells, each with their own individual sign and ability. Yoren aims to make
      use of the newest VR technology, such as the pressure sensitivity in the Valve
      Knuckles controllers. No button pressing, just squeeze lightly in the controller
      to activate your spell.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1239270/extras/hideout.gif?t=1590419616"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Dungeons &amp; fallen kingdoms</h2><br>After you've brewed
      your potions, it's time to enter the dungeon. In Yoren there are several dungeons
      and fallen kingdoms. In these areas you can collect area-specific loot, and
      encounter it's boss. With each dungeon or kingdom you beat, you learn a new
      rune. Each rune has it's own element for example water, fire and blood. Each
      element has it's own advantages. Some may be more focused on healing, whilst
      others are far more aggressive depending on your play style.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1239270/extras/forest.gif?t=1590419616"

    review: "So of course it's early access, but right now if you are someone who\
      \ wants to play this game and NOTHING past that, it is not worth $20. I'd say\
      \ it would be worth $9 to someone like me. HOWEVER; if you are a passionate\
      \ VR player, you may see that this game has a lot of potential, as I also see.\
      \ If you would like to support the developer in making this game and watching\
      \ the game as it progresses, then go ahead and buy the game and join their discord.\
      \ \n\nThe one thing that I will make sure I say, though, is that the developer\
      \ does seem like a genuine guy and passionate about this game. I look forward\
      \ to seeing the progress of this game in the future, but right now it isn't\
      \ worth buying to an average consumer.\n\n*edit* - I decided to list the things\
      \ that I thought ill of this game to help people see why I was harsh, please\
      \ keep in mind im not really trying to be spiteful, just honest, and again if\
      \ you as a consumer want to support the developer, go ahead!\n\nIn order of\
      \ time experienced, they go as follows: the vast majority of objects in the\
      \ game are apart of the map asset and are as such uninteractable. the grab/hold\
      \ mechanism in the game feels very floaty and unimmersive. the physics of the\
      \ player is not realistic with fixed falling speeds, no sprinting, your hands\
      \ can go through walls (speaking of hands the player's hands are not well-attached\
      \ to the wrists and in the case of the player opting to not have arms, it instead\
      \ defaults to the SteamVR toolkit in Unity's default gloved hands, which isn't\
      \ very neat. my right hand disappeared while in the tutorial. the tutorial itself\
      \ accidentally was skipped somehow and I couldn't restart it. I had to blindly\
      \ figure out that you had to use grip while casting to hold and then throw your\
      \ spell. the sound of you successfully creating a rune and holding it is loud\
      \ and obnoxious. when i loaded into the first level my second (left) hand dissapeared\
      \ along with my right. in various locations on the map you can get caught on\
      \ rubble and pop your head through the wall/ceiling, revealing the entire map\
      \ from within the wall (very G-Mod no-clip esque). the first giant boss' death\
      \ animation made him fall halfway through the wall. the second giant boss (spider\
      \ lady/queen) was very goofily animated and I didn't even know I killed her\
      \ while I was running away lobbing spells behind me. (her death animation also\
      \ put her halfway into a wall). upon approaching the spider queen's lair my\
      \ computer started chugging as my reprojection rate went as high as 45%. I kept\
      \ walking for 30+ seconds through corridors only to find they were dead ends\
      \ and I had to walk all the way back (doesn't sound like a lot but annoying\
      \ to do that for a minute straight). at this point I tried drinking my potion\
      \ by dropping it on my head (as at first it didn't seem like i could just tip\
      \ it back and sip it. this crashed my game somehow. I loaded it back up and\
      \ saw my arms again for the first time since prior to when my tutorial glitched\
      \ out. i accidentally clicked on the 2nd (or 3rd maybe?) level and didn't have\
      \ a chance to fix it before i loaded into it. Had to walk a few minutes in a\
      \ admittedly pretty canyon to find a giant sandworm that started attacking me.\
      \ I wanted to die to go back to the main lobby but it didn't seem like it was\
      \ damaging me at all. eventually it burrowed into the ground over me and clipped\
      \ my player's hitbox through the floor of the canyon and I fell through the\
      \ map forever. That was a compilation of all my complaints in my 22 minutes\
      \ of playtime :)."
