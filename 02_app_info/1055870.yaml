    reviews: "\u201CI could hear men\u2019s voices, and when I took a look around,\
      \ I realized that I was inside the cattle wagon. Around the walls of the carriage\
      \ were people in worn clothes. Through the half-open door, a blizzard raged\
      \ outside. An inner voice spoke: \u201CMaybe if the train slowed down, I would\
      \ be able to escape.\u201D I jumped out, landed in a snowdrift, and suddenly\
      \ I was again in Jozwiak-Rodan\u2019s cozy apartment. \u201CI think history\
      \ should be told in a way that young people can understand it,\u201D he said\
      \ as I put the virtual reality goggles and controllers on the desk. And so,\
      \ he and his programmer friend Jacek Ross started developing the VR game Siberian\
      \ Run in 2018. Immersed in a virtual Siberia, players take on the role of a\
      \ fugitive trying to avoid capture. They can collect different objects that\
      \ help on the quest and interact with the world around them. The shouts of guards\
      \ calling out from somewhere in the snowstorm reminds players that time is running\
      \ out\u2014and that each mistake can cost you your life. (...)\u201D<br>- \u2013\
