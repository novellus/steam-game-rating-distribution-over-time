It contains two frustratingly aimless gameplay sections, and in each I considered calling it quits. However - without these sections, would the game so vividly create the emotional experience that it does?\n\nThere are points in life (or there have been points in my life, at least) where you are so desperate for companionship and connection, that you go on dates with people that you are clearly incompatible with and maintain stale text conversations in the hopes that the two of you will eventually experience some miraculous and magical connection. \n\nWhen self-worth is contingent upon the creation of real relationships from these bad seeds, it can be difficult to perceive that you're trying to draw water from an empty well. You just push forward, over and over again, into a wall. There are other sources of water around, but they might as well be invisible.\n\nDeveloper Starless Studios depicts this emotional state through their game much better than I ever could through words. If you'd like a game that creates a unique emotion for the player not often seen in gaming (as opposed to power, wonder, etc.), give MaryPark St. a try.","timestamp_created":1601052919,"timestamp_updated":1601052919,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.459110468626022339","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zZiM4/QCePf/owI="}
