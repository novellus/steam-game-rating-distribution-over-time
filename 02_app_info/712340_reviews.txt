For me it is the consummate East front experience.  So many great iconic battles here, all showcased within a system that is easy to learn and hard to master.   There is a lot of variety and ebb and flow in this campaign which keeps things interesting.  \n\nSome comments on most of the scenarios: \n\nRyzhev - One of the more challenging opening battles in the OoB series, and one where you have to defend a three-sided salient in the high Russian winter, and do it on a shoestring budget.  This one puts you to the test right out of the gate.\n\nDemyansk - Like the previous battle, I didn't know a lot about this one other than it happened, and it turned out to be quite interesting.  It was a 'cavalry to the rescue' situation and a dress rehearsal for the relief of Stalingrad.  Further, most players will still be hard up for resource points this early in the campaign, so you have to win it on a budget.  \n\nKharkov '42 - Expected this one to be a pushover for the Germans, and it was not.  You have to quickly close the encirclement and do it with limited forces, with the Soviets trying to break your encirclement from both within and outside the pocket.  This battle was very tense and chaotic, and exceeded my expectations.\n\nCase Blue (Voronezh and Kalach) -  The iconic drive on Stalingrad.  You do it over two large maps and are given a lot of leeway on how you want to proceed.  Also, the Soviets are toughening up by this point (as if they weren't challenging enough already!), and starting to deploy more T-34's and Il-2 Sturmoviks.  Also, the Night Witches was an interesting touch. \n\nStalingrad - This famous iconic battle could have been a grindy city slog, but it was not. There's a lot going on in this battle both within and  around the city, and as in the historic battle one of the challenges is to not be taking excessive casualties on your vet troops at the hands of Soviet conscripts.  \n\nWinter Storm - This one greatly exceeded my expectations, and is one of my favorites in the Order of Battle series.   Not only to do you have to advance with your Winter Storm relief force against tough opposition while defending 'Fortress' Stalingrad, but you also have to defend the Chir River line against strong Soviet attacks.  Fail in any of these three and it's game over man! \n \nOperation Star - It's always an interesting challenge trying do a fighting withdrawal in the face of a superior enemy, and this one was very tense and exciting.  The situation forces you to make judicious use of engineers, and plan in advance where you will make your stands. \n  \nKharkov '43  - Manstein's legendary 'Miracle of the Donets'.  This was another one I expecting to be easy, and turned out to be rather challenging.  You have to advance against a strong opponent and think outside the box for creative solutions while you're doing it.  Also, it's hard not to resist deploying some early Tiger tanks at this point, which can still be quite useful despite their expense and unreliable early state.  \n\nKursk -  What better way to end this campaign than with one of the largest, most apocalyptic battles in history.  The interesting thing about the game's take on this epic and iconic battle is it is not quite the grindy slog I had expected, but rather gives the player some maneuver options.  Without giving away any spoilers, suffice to say that the devs delivered in spades here with an epic finale worthy of the battle and the campaign.   \n\nAnyway, I highly recommended Panzerkrieg.  Also, I would recommend prospective players doing the Order of Battle Blitzkrieg campaign first, as you can transfer your core force from Blitzkrieg to Panzerkrieg, but this is by no means a requirement.","timestamp_created":1603702800,"timestamp_updated":1603795022,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi77otPUCdo+bqgI="}
