After all they do not promote themselves as grand strategy games, for the price and content hexwar I think have done quite well. I don't see to many other games out there like this, yes they do pretty much play out in the same way, but on saying that, they do work and they are playable. Lets give these guys a thumbs up, for actually giving us some wargames.","timestamp_created":1604282970,"timestamp_updated":1604282970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+e2tw/UCcYzaqwI="}
