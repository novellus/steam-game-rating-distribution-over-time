Rewards you for any play style whether that is to stay back and fire safely or just run in and gun at things like Doom. The mechanic of being able to recoup the eggs you lost and get your health back as you fight means you can have an extremely chaotic play style and still stay alive if you manage to continuously micro your guy around and pick the eggs back up. The upgrades, art, and just the general idea was clearly a product of some inspired fun.","timestamp_created":1607720405,"timestamp_updated":1607720405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gNHmqfYCdtqbuQI="}
