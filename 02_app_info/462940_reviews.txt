First of all: turn time calculations takes so many seconds making the game so slow.\n2. Big nations Germany, USA, Soviet Union, China or even Japan are so dificult to manage, you have to read so many repetitive reports, you have to do infinite clicks for building farms and factories, you have to split move all troops and is dificult to organize them, manage airplanes is really troublesome. Playing Nepal is easy but not interesting, playing a major nation is that you want can be an authentic nightmare.\n3. And maybe the most important: Is the game so complex? No, the problem that there is no manual, not all the thigs are intuitive and you have to consult the enciclopedia and quick tutorial but this is not enough to understand all concepts.\n4. Bugs: I've read some comments from people complaining of this, but I haven't found them, just a strange behaviours whrn moving troops nothing important.\n\nOverall a good game and good experience if you manage a medium or little country for example spanish civil war, but so slow and tedious when managing major countries.","timestamp_created":1610120428,"timestamp_updated":1610120428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnv+p8fYCecHIwQI="}
