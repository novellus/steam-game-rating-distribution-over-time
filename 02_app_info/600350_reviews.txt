That said, if I hadn't gotten this for $1 on sale I would be asking for a refund. This should be in early access still because not only does the core gameplay need a lot of work, there are a few bugs as well. I gave it a half hour of playtime hoping to see it through til the end, but after the boss on wave 21 I saw that it kept going I really just didn't feel like playing anymore. The wave 21 boss was actually the best part of the game but other than that it was boring. The bugs I encountered were waves wouldn't start and enemies wouldn't spawn when the fire button was held. This means I had to stop firing and wait for the wave to register, then pick up again. It broke the flow of gameplay but wouldn't be sun a big deal if it were the only issue. The other bug is that when you start firing the first shot goes in the direction that the ship is facing, and then the ship turns to continue firing. This is a problem most with slow firing weapons like the bomb, where it fires the first shot out into space, then I'm waiting aiming at the enemy for the next shot to fire. This can be corrected by quickly rotating the ship before shots are fired, but it's just some of the work this game needs that I would expect from an early access game. I saw that you ported this into VR, so I tried the desktop version before writing this review and the controls on that were so horrible that I couldn't play for more than a minute. How can you mess up a twin stick shooter? Use WASD for movement and mouse for aim, not W for forwards S for back, and A and D to rotate. I am sorry for the harsh review but there is potential here it just needs more work, and I will happily change my recommendation and review if you continue development.","timestamp_created":1519098372,"timestamp_updated":1519098372,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517937123775482178","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+rPU2OECe7PBmQE="}
