      - Great fast paced action and incredible graphics! - It's just like playing\

      \ will be available once the game is fully out! <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- The demo\
      \ only has 2 co-op multiplayer, but I've heard you'll be able to play with up\
      \ to 7 other people on the full version!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Right now you\
      \ can only play kick off games, but the full version has Tournaments and Leagues!<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nYeah, it's the Official game for next year's 1991 Superstar\
      \ Soccer Cup. What if when the game is out, we both pay for half and we swap\
      \ it every other week?"
