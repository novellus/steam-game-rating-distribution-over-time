    review: 'Ah yes, the medieval/dark fantasy DOOM cousin, Heretic. Great game. Though
      a lot of purists might cry in anger, I''d suggest playing this with GZDOOM source
      port (that gives you a lot of cool options to custo9mize the controls, effects,
      sound, HUD and add mouse look, crouch and other QoL options) AND the AI Neural
      Textures mod, that upscale every texture without losing quality.

      I can''t even say anything bad about this game lol, except the fact we never
      got a DOOM 2016 treatment to it.'
