    developer_response: First of all, thank you so much for playing Shadow Walls means
      a lot to me. I'm sorry to hear about the hardware problems that you had while
      playing it! It's not common and I'll investigate. I'm a solo dev doing everything
      alone. Knowing that your game experience was disturbed, I'll do everything that
      I can to fix this problem as soon as possible so that you and future players
      don't face the same issue. I'm a gamer as well, so I know exactly the feeling.
      Thank you for taking the time to write this detailed review and you can expect
      an update in about a week.

    review: "[i] My Experience [/i]\n\nI'm a big fan of these slower-paced and moody\
      \ top-down shooters. I enjoyed the minimal, monochrome level design, and familiarizing\
      \ myself with each of the game's enemies along with the number of bullets each\
      \ takes before going down. \n\nIf you've got a little kiting room, you can do\
      \ quite a bit of work with the mace and save bullets for the most troublesome\
      \ enemies. In addition, you can sometimes get enemies caught at the entrances\
      \ of the game's narrow corridors, allowing you to put a hurt on them while out\
      \ of harm's way.\n\nUnfortunately, the game did not play well with my PC. The\
      \ one I am using during the holidays is a 3.3 GHz w/ 16 GB ram, coupled with\
      \ a GTX 960. On two occasions, the game chugged to a standstill. I was barely\
      \ able to move my character and my system became almost unresponsive. There\
      \ was nothing to do but quit the game and restart it. Since the game does not\
      \ save checkpoint information, I was forced to restart a level each time. The\
      \ game isn't long at all, so it's not that big of a deal, but it was annoying\
      \ enough to note here.\n\nEven with the game's uninspired story, I still would've\
      \ given it a recommendation if not for the significant technical issues. Perhaps\
      \ developer Saulo Rosart will create other moody top-down shooters in the future\
      \ that play better with my rig."
