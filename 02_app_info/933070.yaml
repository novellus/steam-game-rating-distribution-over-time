    about_the_game: Here is a platformer in which you will find more and puzzle elements.
      You yourself will need to decide how to pass a particular level. Jump, press
      the buttons, open the barriers and just enjoy the game, moving from room to
      room! On the way you will meet different obstacles that will have to be overcome
      if you want to move on. Some of them will require you to make non-standard decisions.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Simple controls<br></li><li>Great
      performance<br></li><li>A lot of levels<br></li><li>Cute design</li></ul><br>Embark
      on an adventure with a strange little cube, which suddenly felt the ability
      to move independently and come to life on your screen! Come with him puzzles
      and jump over the gap, climb the pixel mountains and open the door! The game
      is great for both children and adults. Perhaps some of you will feel nostalgic
      for the good old days, when the graphics were very simple and consisted of individual
      large pixels. So if you want to get a lot of pleasant experiences - be sure
      to play! You will not regret the time spent!

      \xE3o de 0,09 centavos talvez.\n\nO jogo \xE9 muito ruim, tem apenas 4 ou 5\
      \ fases que parece um tutorial indicando o que se deve apertar para fazer a\
      \ a\xE7\xE3o, quando voc\xEA aprende o jogo acaba. ahusauhsa por incr\xEDvel\
      \ que pare\xE7a nessas mis\xE9rias de fases ainda tem mais bugs do que que divers\xE3\
      o.\n\nEm 6 minutos eu zerei o jogo e ainda platinei ele. kkkkkkk"
