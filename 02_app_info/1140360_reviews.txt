Please note though I only have 2000 Cuda cores.\n\nAt the time of writing the node editor is missing several quality of life features such as a search bar for the filters, copy/paste/duplicate shortcuts and box select. I would also love to see a gaussian, and kawahara blur nodes and sobel filters.\n\nThe parameters for map generation are limited compared to free alternatives such as \"Materialize\" by bounding box software but get the job done, again though a sobel/edge map generator would be a welcome addition.\n\nOverall for the AI features you wont find any other implementation of them without paying out thousands of dollars since the tech is so new; so for the price it is great if you have a rig to run the processes.\n\nWhy the developer decided to split all the program's features up into individual executable files that launch their own windows is beyond me (although isn't terrible). The dev should concider using Unity with the ML python integration to build the UI and integrate the libraries into a unified application.\n\nBut hey beats cobbling together random free tools or paying for an Adobe monopoly subscription.\n","timestamp_created":1608930322,"timestamp_updated":1608930322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527897000312805176","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5YzuzfYCf+mVvQI="}
