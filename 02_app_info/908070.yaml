      \ /><br><br>Take on the role of a druidic clan and use your blessings to heal\
      \ the Valley of Life. This task doesn\u2019t come easy though, it requires both\
      \ courage and caution as it can be easy to overwhelm the land if you\u2019re\
      \ careless or wield too much power.<br><br>Based on the Origins award-winning\
      \ board game from AEG, get ready for an all-new deck-building experience in\
      \ Mystic Vale. With the innovate Card Crafting System, you can keep improving\
      \ and building your cards to create a diverse and effective deck. <br><br>Mystic\
      \ Vale is easy to pick up for those new to deck-building games, yet is challenging\
      \ even for those skilled in the genre. Practice against AI opponents before\
      \ you take the battle online, where you can find and create public or private\
      \ rooms to play against friends or random players!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/908070/extras/GameplayGif01.gif?t=1575284773\"\

      \ /><br>Cards combine in a variety of different ways creating powerful combos.\
      \ What combo wins one match might not win you your next one, though. If you\u2019\
      re a risk-taker, Mystic Vale has a push-your-luck element, but if you spoil\
      \ your hand, you\u2019ll miss your turn and maybe even that special card you\
      \ were hoping to collect.<br>Remember, keep an eye on your opponent\u2019s cards\
      \ to see what advantage they may have over you and which cards they may want.\

      \ and play through the game with the same 20 cards, however, each card has 3\
      \ slots available within it which you can add advancements to by buying them\
      \ from the field.<br>Each advancement has different abilities and properties,\
      \ which when mixed together can create powerful combos. Some cards will offer\

      \ pool, playing with/without expansions or want to add turn timers to keep the\
      \ game moving quickly. Online multiplayer is also available cross-platform so\
