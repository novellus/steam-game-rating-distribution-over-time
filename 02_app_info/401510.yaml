    review: 'Oh my, This game is a really great, Now if you dont like hard games,
      then i do not advise you play this, cause you will want to rip the creators
      thorats, im in level 5 and ive gotta say the game looks easy, untill you start
      getting to the harder levels, you will absolutly hate bats, saws, Octopuses
      and much more, This game is a really good 8-Bit and Nostalgic old fashion game,
      that you will love, i highly assure that you will have fun with this game, but
      at the same time hate it, it is really awesome, Some other things are it has
      really good music, and a story to follow through the game. The game is worth
      what you have to pay, and its really good!


      Some things to expect are:

      Rage

      Heart Attacks

      Sezuires

      Triggers

      Flashbacks

      And Suicidal Thoughts


      Please do not play this game if you would like to live for a few more years,
      without chronic depression and constant rage from not being able to beat this
      game'
