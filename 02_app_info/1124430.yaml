    review: '- Good challenge. The game may look like a fast paced shooter but it
      actually makes you think each movement carefully.

      - There is a very wide variety of weapons ranging from futuristic blasters to
      bow and arrows... even a flamethrower! Also grenades and a knife for melee.

      - Enemies can follow you even in uneven terrain (i.e. they can jump to get to
      you), which create high tension situations where you must run from enemies and
      bullets while trying to finish them off as quickly as possible.

      - Music and graphics are nice, with a retro style that fits the game nicely.

      - You must rescue your cat. You simply can''t say no to a game with this premise.

      - Price is very nice.


      A very fun game overall :)'
