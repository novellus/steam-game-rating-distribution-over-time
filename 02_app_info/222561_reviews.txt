Lets start with why you would want to buy it:\n\nPros: -Very fast\n         -Comes with EX BN SW1500 switcher engine and BNSF ES44DC.\n         -Very scenic\n         -Extra DLC include: BN/BNSF SD40-2, BN/BNSF GP38-2, BN F45, AMTK P42 DC, and GN F7/GP9.\n\nCons: -All concrete track. Most of Marias Pass is wooden track.\n          -ES44DC sounds are TERRIBLE. \n          -It has a short line coming out of Coumbia Falls to Kaspell, with would normally be cool, but its all concrete track.\n           -The mountains look terrible from far away. That is one of the best parts about riding the Empire Builder.\n           \nOver all I would NOT recommend this route to anyone because of the false advertising preview video.\n\nEdit: The reason I do not like the concrete track is because of the yards and the 13 mile shortline. If you look in the preveiw, it has correct track texture.","timestamp_created":1423020712,"timestamp_updated":1604897758,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.422734558582305908","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws4vX1fUCcJvQNg=="}
