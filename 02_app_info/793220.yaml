    about_the_game: You find yourself on a strange island where the civilization has
      ended. Up on the sky you see the moon shattered, distant cities destroyed and
      a mysterious woman in an age-old outfit, biding her time on the beach as if
      none of it happened.<br><br>As you traverse this uncanny surrounding, you start
      to unravel its mysteries.<br><br>This is an impressionist art-game about love
      and loss, a tribute to our dear friend <strong>Deger Deniz</strong>. In order
      to piece all the puzzles, you might need to search beyond the game itself.<br><br>The
      game lasts about 30 to 60 mins, depending on how keen you are to find all the
      secrets and unlock all the achievements.<br><br>Music by Cava Grande.<br><br><a

    review: "I don't know how to write this review. A wise man I admire taught that\
      \ silence is the most eloquent kind of speech. And I think only silence could\
      \ do this game full justice, but I can't be properly silent in a written review.\
      \ So I'll say: this game shows how death imposes itself on love, and how love\
      \ desperately smashes itself against death in retaliation, and how they painfully\
      \ bleed into each other becoming one.\n\nCould it be more polished? Yes.\nCould\
      \ it be an open space instead of linear paths closed off by hedges? Yes.\nCould\
      \ it be comprised of completely original assets? Yes.\nCould the woman's throwing\
      \ animation be better? Yes. \nCould its sky-opening skull-shattering brain-scooping\
      \ heart-blending effect on me be an individual and accidental thing? Yes.\n\
      Do I give even a quarter of a f\u0438ck? No.\n\n[i]A Fine Mess[/i] is the best\
      \ game I've discovered in the past seven years."
