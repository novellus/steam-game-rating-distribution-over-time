So if you're me and you delete your myplayer data cause you want to restart, you've effectively wasted your kick start with no way to reset without going technical.\n\nI'm about to do such to get my kick start back but that may cost me every custom character I've spent hours on. I'll edit with the results, if it stays negative, I lost my custom wrestlers, if it goes positive, I was able to recover them all.","timestamp_created":1531042124,"timestamp_updated":1531042124,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572836458683013916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjprOvOQCfNLFpQE="}
