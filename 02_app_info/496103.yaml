      s first real-time ray tracing benchmark for gamers. It shows you how well your\
      \ PC handles ray tracing effects in real-time. Use Port Royal to benchmark graphics\
      \ cards that support Microsoft DirectX Raytracing. Compare Port Royal benchmark\
      \ scores to see how overclocking affects ray-tracing performance. Find your\
      \ PC's performance limits with custom benchmark settings and detailed hardware\
      \ monitoring charts.<br><br><br>3DMark Port Royal was developed with input from\
      \ AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, and other leading technology companies. We worked especially\
      \ closely with Microsoft to create a first-class implementation of the DirectX\
      \ Raytracing API.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Port Royal Stress Test</h2>Check the reliability\
      \ and stability of your system after buying or building a new PC, upgrading\
      \ your graphics card or overclocking your GPU. Stress testing can also identify\
      \ faulty hardware and a need for better cooling.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DirectX\
      \ Raytracing feature test</h2>Measure the pure ray-tracing performance of your\
      \ graphics card with the 3DMark DirectX Raytracing feature test. Instead of\
      \ relying on traditional rendering, the whole scene is ray-traced and drawn\
      \ in one pass. The result of the test depends entirely on ray-tracing performance.\
      \ You can use this test to compare the performance of dedicated ray-tracing\
      \ hardware in the latest graphics cards.<br><br><br>The test includes an interactive\
      \ mode that lets you move freely around the scene and take screenshots. You\
      \ can control the focus point and aperture of the camera to explore different\
      \ depth of field effects using ray tracing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">NVIDIA DLSS\
      \ feature test</h2>Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is an NVIDIA RTX technology\
      \ that uses the power of deep learning and AI to improve game performance while\
      \ maintaining visual quality. This feature test helps you compare performance\
      \ and image quality with and without DLSS.<br><br><br>You can choose to run\
      \ the NVIDIA DLSS feature test using DLSS 2 or DLSS 1. With DLSS 2, you can\
      \ select between three quality modes\u2014Quality, Performance and Ultra Performance\u2014\
      and a range of resolutions, from Full HD up to 8K."
