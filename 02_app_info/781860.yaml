      System</strong><br>To use the Shop you need currency, the currency in this game
      is gold. Gold is dropped by defeating enemies, each enemy drops a random range
      of gold depending on their difficulty. The player will be able to view the entire
      shop from the start of the game with no limitations. Items purchased usually

      Wizard Madness works based on the shop, the player first buys a spell scroll
      from the shop and then activates the scroll by clicking on it whilst it''s in
      the Shop Pit. You can only have one spell at a time. <br><br><strong>Random
      Reward System</strong><br>The player will be rewarded throughout the game via
      the Random Reward System. This system is triggered via killing mobs to build
      up a behind the scenes counter, once this counter is at maximum capacity the
      player will be greeted with the Reward System.<br><br><strong>Clothing System</strong><br>The
      clothing system in Stick Adventures: Wizard Madness is very straight forward,
      the player has a large selection of clothing to choose from using the arrow
      keys on the keyboard. You do not have to pay for these clothes with in game
      currency all of it is available from the start.<br><br><strong>Save System</strong><br>Every
      time a new level starts the game automatically saves locally on your hard drive,
      please remember you only have one save file so if you start a new game it will
      erase the old one. Always press LOAD if you want to continue playing from where
      you left off previously. NEW will create a new save file erasing your old one.<br><br><strong>Developers
      Notes:</strong><br>This game is around 25 minutes long in total, I run Renegade
      Games as an Individual. This is the first title of what I hope to become a series
      of Stick Adventure games.<br>Stick Adventures: Wizard Madness is the first game
      I have ever created. Any feed back would be greatly appreciated!'

    review: "This is a cute, little clicker game that I quite enjoyed playing. Below\
      \ are my main thoughts on the game.\n\nPROS (Strongest To Weakest):\nStory -\
      \ While the story is basic, I could tell that a lot of effort was put into it.\n\
      Levels - Each level design is unique and true to its nature.\nEnemies - The\
      \ game contains a pretty wide range of enemies. I noticed a few enemy types\
      \ to be similar, but this didn't bother me.\nBosses - A nice touch to the game.\n\
      Item Shop - Has items to aid you in the game. Pretty balanced system. Although\
      \ I didn't really need the items.\nStructure - A little sloppy, but really impressive,\
      \ considering this is the developers first game.\nItem Lottery - I believe this\
      \ system needs to be more randomized as, throughout the entire game, I got the\
      \ same reward.\n\nCONS (Strongest To Weakest):\nLength - The game took about\
      \ 45 minutes to complete. Take this into consideration before buying. (Still\
      \ Worth Money) \nAnnoyances - I thought the breaks at the endgame cutscenes\
      \ were a bit to long.\nGlitches - The only glitch I was able to find, is that\
      \ when you defeat a boss, enemies continue spawning after the games says \"\
      Level Complete\"\n\nI personally recommend that you purchase the game, but wether\
      \ or not you want to spend $3 is up to you. I hope the above information helps\
      \ in this decision. Thanks for reading!\n\nNOTE FOR DEVELOPER: Great game! I\
      \ hope you continue this series in the future! If you do, I hope you take the\
      \ points I made in my review into consideration. \n"
