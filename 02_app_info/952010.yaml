    review: This text-based adventure game is fun and interesting and well-written.
      It's a science fiction story about a heist, with drama and romance elements.
      The included characters are diverse with regards to genders, sexual orientation
      and ethnicity, and you are free to choose your own gender and sexual orientation
      for the romance elements of the story. I really appreciate that, but I have
      seen that it has caused a lot of bad reviews. So if you prefer games that are
      only for white males with mainly white male characters (and some sexy females
      for the guys to ogle), you might not like this game.
