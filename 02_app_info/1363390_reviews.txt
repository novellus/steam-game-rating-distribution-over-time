This ain't no AAA game it's an Indie  game and a (rather short one) it has it's pros and it's cons but it general it's an OKAY game it reminded me of when I first played The Forest but it clearly shows you that this game was made within a budget (or simply as a prototype).\n\nIn general it's a short and simple game that has good intentions but it's kind of lacking. Do I recomend it? Kinda since it's an Indie game by a ultra small studio and I did like the whole idea of the game. But it's not like I can't point imperfections, bugs, mistakes or just plain simple bad ideas within the game. but give it a try you may find yourself entertained by it or not IDK.\n\nPT-BR\nJogo simples e curto tem algumas coisas boas em seu favor, mas também possui erros/imperfeições vale a pena? Sim e Não... Sim já que vai te entreter por sua duração Não por que pode não ser muito sua \"praia\".","timestamp_created":1604077437,"timestamp_updated":1604077437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hOidvfUCfaKNqwI="}
