I had to do alot of playing around in the Steam controller configuration to get the controls right. I have them set pretty closely to the Ace Combat control scheme. tip with the config as well, set your sticks to act like D-pads and change your roll and turn features around to get a simulation style control if you dont want an arcade style. the voice acting is terrible but hey you can always turn it off. the only other complaint i have is the difficulty leveling can kinda be random. one min your dominating the skies the next your a brand new pilot that just learned how to fly. But again decent WW2 Flight sim. also ive seen alot of complaints about the game not starting at all. my computer is old and im working off of an Intel Celeron N2840. i had to switch the properties over to windows XP service pack 3. runs like a dream. no patch needed.","timestamp_created":1581403421,"timestamp_updated":1581403421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lKe/mfACf8zI8QE="}
