    review: boring mechanics, half the time the mechanics dont work (match 3,4 or
      5 nothing happens).  critical component of match 3 games are when you match,
      something more than nothing happens.  i'd rather see ads and be bombarded with
      micro transactions than pay for this (aka nothing).
