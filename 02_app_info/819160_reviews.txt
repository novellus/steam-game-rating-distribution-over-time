I got about 20 minutes of fun out of it, and that was worth the purchase price. Even though the UI is clunky AF and the game could use about 500 buckets of polish, there was enough good to make me not refund.\n\nThis is a combination of space shoot-em-up and a sort of infinite platform runner. The first phase of the game is space combat, then the second phase after that is the platformer. The space combat is actually pretty innovative and has interesting mechanics! The platforming is horrible and should be entirely removed from the game.\n\nIn the space combat portion, you see a wave of enemies, each with different abilities and skills. You can also see that some of them are \"absorb-able\" which allows you to use their own attacks against them. So there's a bit of problem solving at first, where you plan out what ships to kill and in what order. For example, you might see that one of the ships will shield all of it's allies for 4 seconds... so you try to take that one out first. Or you might see that one of the enemies has a \"stun\" attack, so you'll go after that right away so you can then use the stun power on a different foe, then while it's stunned you can take out it's allies. This concept is really neat and I quite enjoyed it. Real-time re-prioritizing of kills and ability-stealing was really fun.\n\nI wish the developer would remove the platforming entirely. It's a little \"bonus\" stage between each space combat mission where you can pick up orbs that increase your ship's health. But it is totally unfun and irritating to play. While there's no penalty for not doing well in this 30 second mini-game, it's also completely annoying to play. I like the idea of a little mini-game between combat stages, but this one sucks.\n\nI beat \"normal\" mode in about 20 minutes which gave me the ending, and unlocked \"hard\" mode. But I don't want to keep playing because that platforming minigame is just annoying AF and it drives me nuts. I'm not kidding. I like the space combat part a lot, but the mini game is sooooooooo bad and annoying.\n\nThe space combat part is really cool, and if the developer fleshes out that concept into a larger game I would buy it in a heartbeat.  I like the combination of shoot-em-up, dodging, strategy and stealing the abilities of foes. I like figuring out in real time how to turn their abilities against them, and steal them in the most optimal order. Again, I find this to be a new and refreshing mechanic and the dev should put more time into it, expand the game or maybe make a new and longer game with this mechanic refined a bit more.","timestamp_created":1600444224,"timestamp_updated":1600444224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474683523178100586","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoJr60PQCebHLogI="}
