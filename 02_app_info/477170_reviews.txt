If this were the only problem I could just remember to close my eyes every time I die (ugh) but the game itself is horrible, mainly there are no explanations for a lot of the things in game. When upgrades come on the screen they are instantly collected so I don't know what they have done for me, and there is a sphere in the center that does something? Not worth even the sale price.","timestamp_created":1514263024,"timestamp_updated":1514263024,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535137712955474854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmILHyOACc77IkwE="}
