    review: It is a rather standard HoG and did not stand the test of time well. It
      misses the custom option in the difficulty. It is a bit all or nothing with
      that. The voice acting is meh, the drawings could have been better. But what
      irked me most is that it was not really enjoyable to play, the story was rather
      illogical, you had to run from here to there, picking up items that were rather
      more random then really part of a thought through narrative. The characters
      were not really believable either. It came to a point where I almost stopped
      playing it altogether because it got tedious in the end.
