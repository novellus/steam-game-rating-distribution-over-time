    about_the_game: 'Leaked documents suggest that the US government is holding aliens
      within Area 51. And not just any aliens - <strong>CUTE GIRL ALIENS</strong>.
      Infuriated by the thought of the government hoarding all the alien girls for
      themselves, the masses rise up and decide to raid Area 51 to get an alien girlfriend
      of their own. But the military will be there waiting for them. Assume the role
      of a lone military defender, protect the alien girls, and kill all the invaders!
      Kill enough of them, and the government might give you &quot;some time&quot;
      with one of the alien girls. Or, you can abandon your mission, and seek out
      an alien girlfriend on your own. The choice is yours...<h2 class="bb_tag">FEATURES</h2><br><ul

      Having conquered all earthly women already, Chad seeks to spread his seed intergalactically.

      Hopes his first time will be with an alien girl, but is unremarkable in every
      way. The most the Virgin can contribute is taking a bullet for another Stormer.<br></li><li><strong>STACY</strong>:
