Math has always been an area he struggled in and doing homework is always a pain. This game made math fun. It includes practice with elementary level math such as multiplication, fractions, and number lines. Every problem has a little story behind it and is often introduced with a video. My child really liked the water challenges where he got to catch fish and direct his own boat. The Native American history lessons are also a plus. As a parent, would highly recommend.","timestamp_created":1517613982,"timestamp_updated":1517613982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk/S1rOECcujqlwE="}
