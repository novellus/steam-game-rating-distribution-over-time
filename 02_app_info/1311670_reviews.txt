Jack, I hate you!\n\nI'm not a huge fan of scary games because ehm.. They scare me. However, I somehow ended up with this game on my wishlist and not long after an email notification that this is finally out on Early Access I have decided to buy it and give it a go. So what do I think?\n\nIt's great! No, it really is. Don't expect fireworks and over the top game mechanics with super fancy graphics. This game is very simple to get into and straight away feel the atmosphere of it. Maybe one tip for the developers.. When all of the torches are switched off perhaps make it a 'tiny' bit more darker? It's still easy to see even with your own torch off. Would definitely add to the whole atmosphere a bit more.\n\nI'm not going to lie, I needed to go for a shower after playing this game because I was legit scared. I hope everyone else finds it the same. \n\nAnd that little note towards the end.. You bastards! Hopefully whatever I recorded is good enough and I will share my own view on this on the big red platform.\n\nBuy it! It's cheap! It's not fully polished but it's definitely good enough to play already and enjoy!","timestamp_created":1590957105,"timestamp_updated":1590957105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503816783428192139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ49tubtvICdaW7iwI="}
