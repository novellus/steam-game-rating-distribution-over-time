    review: Just discovering this was a thing and I was giddy with excitement. A port
      of one of my favorite NDS games. But I was let down to say the least. The controls
      are janky, and I've discovered many bugs, some having to reset the level to
      fix. Thankfully i'm buying this during a sale, so 3 bucks isn't bad at all for
      what I got. But I don't recommend paying full price. You're better off buying
      the original. This has been out for a few years and nothing seems to have been
      fixed since release.
