    review: "Date of completion: December 2, 2019.\n\nReview: This time, they have\
      \ the \"surprisingly-difficult\" part of the store description dead-right; this\
      \ game's hard as @#$% because you have to guide the ball to the key, then to\
      \ the portal, all in one go without touching the sides of the maze at all. No\
      \ matter how close you are to the end, the moment a wall is touched, you'll\
      \ have to restart; no checkpoints, no fun, no kidding. Sure, the levels are\
      \ colorful, uniquely shaped and decent background music but the frustration\
      \ of finishing the game outweighs all of that.\n\nYou'd probably have to be\
      \ a die-hard fan of the aMAZE series or feel too obligated to play this game.\
      \ Either way, I won't stop you but I won't recommend it, either.\n\nThe developers\
      \ could at least compensate players by making Steam Trading Cards...not that\
      \ they ever WILL. \U0001F612"
