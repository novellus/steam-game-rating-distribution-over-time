    review: "Ever hear of game's as an ART FORM. If not I present to you Killer7;\
      \ beautiful, mangled art. O' and if you love shooting drop dead gorgeous handguns\
      \ and giving the bird to the spirits of your long deceased psycho relatives;\
      \ that only just want to give you a nice big hug.... The story is open to interpretation....hm.\n\
      \nIf any of that tangential rambling sparked something in you, do yourself a\
      \ favour, GETT this Game. \n\n"
