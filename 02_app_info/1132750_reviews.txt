[/h1] \nI have played this game for 30 minutes, and I honestly don't know why I bought this in the first place, I could've bought an energy drink for these 40 cents but instead I decided to play a horrible horrible zombie game... I'm gonna split this into sections:\n\n[h1] The Good Parts:[/h1] \n[u] â€¦ : [/u] Now that we are done with this segment let's move on.\n\n[h1] The Bad Parts: [/h1] \n[u] Everything looks horrible: [/u] You start the game up and the first thing u see is a screen that looks like someone took a screenshot from Nexon Zombies and added text with a colored font in Paint and called it a day, seriously who thought this looks good in any shape or form. Not mentioning the fact that everything is a different color for no reason. And let's be honest here, I might be kind of messing around here, saying they made it in Paint. But once you see the main screen u can actually see the possibility of it being true... which is not a good sign.\n\n[u] The Difficulty Levels don't make any sense: [/u] Now, I don't remember exactly how many difficulty levels they have, but I won't go through the pain of booting the game up again. As far as I can recall, you have 4 difficulty levels and the only thing they change is the amount of zombies, (maybe also the damage but I can't tell) which brings us to the next point:\n\n[u] It's Laggy af: [/u] Now don't get triggered and start writing comments. It's not my PC's fault. The game is spawning almost 300 zombies at the hardest difficulty to the point where u can barley move, there is a function to limit the zombies, but the game should be able to work without it... also the limit doesn't really work, if I set the limit to 150, it will still spawn upwards to 160.\n\n[u] Lack of content: [/u] There is only 1 map in this game and like 3 guns... which doesn't really matter since the first gun you have in the game kills on 1 shot in the head.\n\n[u] Ugly textures: [/u] I had the settings all set to the highest possible, and when I turned it down to stop the game lag... which didn't help, the game all of a sudden looked a lot nicer, still really bad tho let's be honest.\n\nIn conclusion: please stop playing this... or developing it.","timestamp_created":1586471165,"timestamp_updated":1586471482,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520958065986633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1587154357,"developer_response":"Sorry you don't feel you got your $.40 worth.  But to clarify a few points you were mistaken about, the difficulty levels change not only how quickly the zombies spawn and the amount they spawn in, it also increases their health and chances of special abilities (both of which also increase as the day count increases).  These are made so that you can basically start things off faster once you get the hang of it.  Lag may be an issue depending on one's setup which is why you are able to limit the number of zombies to a setting that your computer can handle.  As far as lack of content, new maps and new characters with different abilities open based on your kill count which also will start to cause boss zombies to spawn.  The extra levels and characters are something that is earned, not given.  Not liking the textures and opening screen is personal choice.  Sorry it's not everything you hoped for."}],"cursor":"AoJwqbbEsPECdfrD/wE="}
