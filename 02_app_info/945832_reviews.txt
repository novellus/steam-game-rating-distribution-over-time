Today we’ll be looking at the Cosmetic Pet DLC “Monotask Servo-Skull” which is a little servo-skull (flying skull robot) that follows you around when summoned.  This is similar to the cherubs and other non-combat pets you get in the game.  Is it worth it?\n\nYou will Serve:  Like the other cosmetic pets this flies around annoying some NPCs but doing nothing else.  No voice lines or mechanic changes and gives you no buffs of any kind.  Nothing much to note here as it is more for flavor and atmosphere.\n\nThis is my favorite cosmetic pet that I have access, though there are that I’d prefer of course I haven’t unlocked them yet.  I’d recommend this if you feel you need something flying nearby but you probably won’t be missing it not being there.  Enjoy!\n","timestamp_created":1591141249,"timestamp_updated":1591141249,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550172984600067139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/pXau/ICctHsiwI="}
