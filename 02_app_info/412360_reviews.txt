In my opinion, the chair experience is more polished, and a fun demo of VR in general. It’s a trippy use of the platform to demonstrate something that can’t be done IRL. Surreal and well executed. The other experience – a puzzle - has more content, is a little longer, but not as polished. Combined, they offer about one hour of playtime. Both are definitely worth your time!
