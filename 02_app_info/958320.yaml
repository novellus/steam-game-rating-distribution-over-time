    review: I love that game ! The aim is a bit hard and the bad point is that the
      player CAN'T remap his keys (???) but it is the only open world WW2 RPG that
      I know, so it is very innovative, I am in font of the Corvo Studio games but
      Marco Amadei has to let the player choose their own keys because itmay be unplayable
      at the begining
