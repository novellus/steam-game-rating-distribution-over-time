Whole thing lasts about 5 minutes, although the song is on a loop and you do have to manually quit the game. There is no gameplay here and no interactions other than walking. Locomotion is gaze-based plus press of the trigger. \n\nThere are two environments. I would suggest looking around the first one completely before teleporting into the second world as there is no way back. The two environments are nice. I liked the music track. I thought the music went well with the intended experience. \n\nIt's running on the Unity Engine. The visuals are kind of dated now in 2020. The lighting could have been done better as well. You can clip through objects. Wish there were at least some interactions. Still, it was a nice, though not great overall experience for me. I guess it depends on whether you like the music or not ... listen to the store page video. \n\n[b]Rate 6/10. Not the best music video. There might even be free ones that are better. However, keep in mind, you're paying for a audio/visual artistic experience. So I can't really complain about the price.
