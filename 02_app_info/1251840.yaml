    review: 'This game has terribly failed us players in at least three main points.


      (0. It''s buggy).


      1. The interface. I have - methinks - never (or not in the past ten years) played
      a game with such a poor interface. Even free flash games are more intuitive
      and more nicely done. Clicking doesn''t work to access things, some parts of
      it are counterintuitive or even not working. Accessing information, adding slaves
      to work places, etc. all is painful. Have the icons you put your cursor on don''t
      give you any information, and even those which give you "information" are undecipherable.
      Why? If only the developers made it work like any other game (but... can they?)


      2. The scenarios. Yes I only played for 20 minutes. But those 20 minutes were
      more than enough to see the poverty of the scenarios. To be honest, I already
      wanted to stop and get a refund during the tutorial. Good lord it''s heavy.
      You have "missions" (build a wheat field, do this or that) which come one after
      the other and make you feel you''re in a relationship with an extremely demanding
      psycho girlfriend. This is not what I expect of a city building game. Scenarios
      are bad.


      3. The English is very poor, and to be honest, after they told me "Free is able
      to get more workers" or "Sell 2000 flours" or "you can make research" (something
      like that) I wanted to quit. And what is it with this Slavic dropping of article?
      "I do it Roman way" (imagine this sentence with a stronk Russian accent please).
      Just no, brothers and sisters, no.


      Now I could add 4. to be really cruel. 4. would be the graphics and general
      appearance, which is crap. 4.1. The buildings. They all look the same and they
      don''t look good. 4.2. The animations. There basically isn''t any except sometimes
      unclickable unexplainable slaves which appear to do things. Ha! the fishing
      slave animation is particularly funny. It''s a slave who just stands there,
      looking at the sea, with his hands up. Does he fish? Yes. What does he fish?
      He fishes player''s money, his bait being an overpriced crap game. Oh, and running
      slaves are absolutely ridiculous. For one, when the speed is on 1 (normal) they
      run in slow-mo which is absurd and for 2 why do they run like that? I wish they
      ran in the Forrest, run. 4.3. The slaves. Hahaha they''re dressed like accountants
      or traders from Wall Street. Is this some kind of bad developer joke I''m too
      gamer to understand?


      To conclude, I keep thinking this game is in beta, that it''s a very early access
      game. But no it''s not. One ok-ish thing is the music, although it''s very repetitive
      for some time and then there''s some super epic music as if you were going to
      fight a big monster but you''re not. Or like, you''d expect a natural cataclysm
      to crash the game. You''d hope it would, even.'
