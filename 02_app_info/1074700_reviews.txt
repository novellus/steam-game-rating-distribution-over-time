I happened to look at my shelf, thinking what to play next. I've picked this game and it was quite well made. It stand not stand out. But if it happens to be pouring rain outside, this is a good game to start your day. It has elements of a classic HOPA with real-life characters and modern protagonist propelled in magical situations that she needs to survive or save the someone else's life. A classic gem.\n\nPROS: \n- Beautiful backgrounds;\n- Journal entries are brief and sharp;\n- The Strategy Guide is very useful;\n- The Voice acting is very good;\n- It contains a Main Game + Bonus Chapter;\n- Extra folder with wallpapers, screensavers, concept art and music.\n\nNEUTRE:\n- The characters might remind one of the story of Snow White and the Witch;\n- The Witch is called by the same name as Holly's mother from the game True Fear: Forsaken Souls.\n\nCONS:\n- No fast-traveling Map;\n- No achievements;\n- No trading cards;\n- Repetitive music.\n\nAll in all, it is a good game to play for any HOPA fan or for anybody willing to discover new experiences as a Steam player.","timestamp_created":1607809831,"timestamp_updated":1607809831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4heK7rPYCd6rQuQI="}
