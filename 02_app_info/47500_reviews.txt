The ghosts that you can collect have their own little fun stories, each floor of the house consisting of 4 rooms has an overall theme with a connected minigame at the end that you will be able to participate in with the tools you automatically create by finding enough stuff in the house.\n\nI liked \"hunting\" the ghosts in each room with the magic magnifyier glass, but found the best part to be the \"coded\" riddles for each floor that can be put together with some of the findings.\n\nThe screenshots of some reviews that you can find on the net don't do this nice game justice at all, because they often concentrate on the intentionally weird portraits that will only pop up as some sort of \"jump scare\" parody as a \"punishment\" whenever you have misclicked too often.","timestamp_created":1527552057,"timestamp_updated":1527552057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46tPM1OMCdoHHoQE="}
