    about_the_game: This soundtrack is a mixture of orchestral, electronic and rock
      music scores from the Gray Zone videogame. As well as the game, this soundtrack
      is a kind of Early Access version, which means it's not complete. There will
      be more tracks coming in future chapters of the game story. They will be added
      in this Original Soundtrack too, which will raise its price each time. Owners
      of this early version of the Soundtrack will receive all future music scores
      for free.
