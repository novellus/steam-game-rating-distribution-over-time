      affinities each, they all have their own unique set of skills. Pick between
      9 weapons with various perks that match how you want to play.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>KEY
      FEATURES</strong></h2><strong>High Skill Gameplay</strong><br>Easy to learn,
      hard to master. The game rewards you for constant improvement and closing down
      skill gaps.<br><br><strong>Built for Team Competition</strong><br>Coordination,
      communication, chemistry. 3v3 gameplay means every move you make can affect
      your entire team. <br><br><strong>Playstyle Customization</strong><br>Play your
      own way. Choose your class, armor, weapons, and even abilities and elemental
      affinity.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>3 GAME MODES</strong></h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Annihilation</strong>
      - Wipe out the enemy team in pure combat. The first team to win 5 rounds will
      win the match. You only have 3 revives available per round so use them wisely!
      Do you go for the revive or can you win with a man down?<br></li><li><strong>Corruption</strong>
      - Race with the enemy team to collect enough shards. Eliminated players drop
      1 shard and the goal is to collect 100 enemy shards to win. Need more shards?
      Keep your eyes open for the Obelisk that spawns around the map. Destroy it for
      an extra 8 shards but be careful of the enemy team!<br></li><li><strong>Skirmish</strong>
      - Square off in a time-limited skirmish. Every elimination gives 100 base points,
      but different manners of elimination give extra points. Turn up the skill and
      the style if you want to reach 5,000 points first and win the game.</li></ul><h2
