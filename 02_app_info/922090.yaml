      /><br><br>Always wanted to feel like a programmer or just bored at work, but
      your computer is only good for playing Minesweeper? Then this game is for you!
      <br><br>Meet <strong>CMD 2048</strong> - a modern model of minimalism, refuting
      any need for highly polygonal models and combining the fascinating mechanics
      of a puzzle that has become so popular made with the creative design of the
      end of the last century. This game will steal you from the paws of everyday
      routine, leaving behind purely positive emotions, and it will also increase
      the level of your intelligence (+200 IQ).<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>HOW  TO
      PLAY</strong></h2>Use your arrow or WASD keys to move the tiles. When two tiles
      with the same number touch, they merge into one!  8 .. 16 ... 1024 .. 2048.
      If you have 2048 on the board you have won, but you lose once the board is full
      and you cannot make a move.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong></h2>
      <ul class="bb_ul"> <li>The game runs directly on the Command line. Get your
      portion of enjoyment even on the most primitive computer! <br></li><li>Is there
      a limit to perfection? Of course not! Watch the table of records and compete
      in the flexibility of your own thinking even after reaching the desired mark
      in 2048! <br></li><li>Made a mistake? No problem! The game will allow you to
      take a step back in case of a desperate situation. <br></li><li>Several backgrounds
      to choose from, choose the one you like best! <br></li><li>Nice graphics which
      is pleasant to the eyes, performed in minimalist style. </li></ul><br><strong>PS.</strong>
      This is the first project of my friend, who recently returned from the Russian
      Army.
