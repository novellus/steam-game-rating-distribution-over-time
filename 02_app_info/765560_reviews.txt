Not sure why the couple bad reviews? I bought it after watching some videos and its awesome! I feel in complete control of my team on the field calling plays. I can do things in this game that I cant do in other football sims when it comes to play calling. Send guys in motion on offense, calling a defensive play and deciding last minute to have your OLB blitz, wicked! The visual representation of each play is so cool and reminds of games like OTTB. If you like sports, if you like strategy, you will like this game. I am definitely grabbing Pro 2019 when it comes out this month.","timestamp_created":1534223606,"timestamp_updated":1534223668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsuq2m+UCeoOuqAE="}
