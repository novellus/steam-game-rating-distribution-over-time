Not too much in the way of plot or puzzles etc to worry about, just jump straight in and start killing ;)\n\nI haven't played Maverick a whole lot yet, but on first impressions it's pretty good.\n\nOK, it's a little rough around the edges, as to be expected for an Early Access game. There's room for improvement here and there. Check out my post on the discussions page for more details on this. \n\nBut I'm happy to see the developer is responsive to suggestions, and I look forward to future updates.\n\nFor the price, it's worth a go if you're into solo shooters.","timestamp_created":1587096907,"timestamp_updated":1587097054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJws+WWw/ECfq2xgQI="}
