    review: '[i] My Experience [/i]


      I can''t say that Devastated is bad, but I also don''t think I can recommend
      it.


      I enjoyed the feel of the combat (especially the rhythmic melee attacks you
      can use to save ammo) and the upgrade systems for your character and weapons.
      It took me a while to figure out that I could upgrade my guns on the fly out
      in the world - you don''t need to be at a special NPC or table.


      The best aspect of the game is actually the post-apocalyptic mood. Steam reviewer
      "de Woffels" nails it, calling the world "colorless" and "soulless." It''s a
      game that actually feels somewhat oppressive to play. The blue color palette
      is overwhelming, and the seemingly-endless enemy respawns make walking anywhere
      feel tiresome. 460-E (Edward) does not naturally regenerate health, and must
      use either health kits or healers in town.


      The flip side of this, however, is that walking anywhere FEELS tiresome. You''re
      constantly running into jumps you can''t make without more upgrades, analog
      locks you can''t pick without more upgrades, and digital locks you can''t hack
      without more upgrades. Initially I tried to make a mental note of the locations
      of these jumps and locks, but quickly became overwhelmed. The matter isn''t
      helped by the fact that by the time you return, all of the enemies have respawned.
      I''ve never been much of a fan of metroidvania gameplay elements, so your mileage
      may vary here.


      Once you have the ability to pick these locks and hack these doors and crates,
      things are still a slog. Hacking advanced computers is time-consuming, but so
      simple that it''s trivial. Picking locks requires the ability to store a number
      of directional presses in your mind (often up to 7), so it''s more difficult,
      but certainly not what I''d call satisfying. Many of these locked boxes hold
      mundane items, such as a clip for your rifle.


      I appreciate developer Mikkotheque''s attempt to explore deeper topics, such
      as the humanity of Edward and the regrets of the Nova Concordia soldiers, but
      the low quality of the writing and the numerous typos removed any emotional
      investment for me.


      If you want to take a chance and support an indie developer, you could do worse
      than Devastated. But in terms of unique gameplay and features, you could also
      do a lot better.'
