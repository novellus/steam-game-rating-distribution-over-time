    review: "The extra ships and story missions are great! Islands are styled nicely\
      \ too. \nThough, the Jade Sea island cities are sparse and few in number. I\
      \ would enjoy it much more if there were additional Jade Sea unque  factions,\
      \ cos right now there's only The Order present."
