There's nothing to do if you don't have another person to play online with. There are two areas under construction ... apparently since December 23, 2017. There have been no updates since that time (just a little over a month after game was released on Steam). From the lobby area, I can say there's clipping and hiding in a chest or barrel feels dumb and the climbing is very bad and you can fall under the map.\n\nThis game should go free to play. I regret spending $2.49 for this game during the Steam Lunar New Year 2018 sale. Wish I could get a refund.\n\n[b]Rate 3/10. Do [u]NOT[/u] Buy!
