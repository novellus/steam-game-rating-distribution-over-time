The gameplay is awesome but the mapping system, the input before you launch the game if you don't know, could be simplified a little bit. The characters are charming and everything. I know this is early access so I'm not judging it too bad cause its an Early Access, there's bound to be some issues. Also first boss was easy due to a glitch where it couldn't harm me XD","timestamp_created":1572391506,"timestamp_updated":1572391506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470978707075119019","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1572976245,"developer_response":"Hello Vile.\n\nThank you very much for your feedback!
