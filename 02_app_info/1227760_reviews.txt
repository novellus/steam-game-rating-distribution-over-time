And honestly : it is well written, fast paced and enjoyable for what it's worth.\n\nYes, it ends a little abruptly and yes, there are a lot of things I would have like to see developped (romance, secondary villains, sidekick, the other hero... all which are presented quite nicely but barely developped) The fact that you can't expect much from a CYOA with only 48, 000 words remains unchanged.\n\nTaking into account it's an Eric Moser (author of community college hero, a quality serie of CYOA) work it's still interesting to read it to see how he does in those circumstances. And if you accept the flaws of a short story then it is actually not bad at all. Overall I would say it should have been a novel, not a short story. It is well written but as a novel that's too short, not as a short story in itself in my opinion. Read it if you're curiosity is picked.","timestamp_created":1583831273,"timestamp_updated":1583831273,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.564233183860778809","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44uns4fACcMCZ9wE="}
