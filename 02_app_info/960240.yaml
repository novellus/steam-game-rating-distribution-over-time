    review: '(Drop down the price for good and you will have A LOT of people play
      this)

      I hope people come across this review and snag this game! This is such a GEM,
      it''s nuts! The music is addicting and so soulful and relaxing, the graphics
      with the color scheme is on point! The missions, the goals that you need to
      do in the game are so fun and addicting and easy enough to get the hang of each
      little mini game. There is dialogue between each character , you are the main
      character, the main character (you) meet a lot of other people, and you start
      flying your kite and playing mini games to advance. Each mini game is creative,
      fun, and different. The game runs smooth and is a really good fun friendly time
      to be had..the music slightly nostalgic of mario kart, and that is a beautiful
      thing. Just really happy I found this game, and it''s so ODD to see no reviews
      really...glad the one out of two people who left a review got a lot of likes...but
      anyways, get this game, you WILL NOT REGRET IT. Good job to the devs, you guys
      seriously knocked this out of the park!!!!!!!'
