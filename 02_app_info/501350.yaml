    review: 'I''m a total VR noob and bought this along with some other cheap VR games
      just to try out my new Index, and this has been the most fun yet.


      I''ve only played it for about 30 mins, on the ''on-rails'' setting (I didn''t
      even realise I could have free movement), have died very often, but have loved
      every second.


      Great music, great art style, great mechanics and some funny moments.


      I haven''t tried any other shooters yet but if they''re half as good as this
      I''m going to be very happy.'
