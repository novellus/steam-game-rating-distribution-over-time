You won't find trades or managing ticket and concession prices in this sim, this is about the on -the-field game itself, and the match-ups.\n\nInevitably this game will be compared to OOTP, an excellent game in its own right. But OOTP is more about being a GM, and that is its strength. DDB is about being Tommy LaSorda, Sparky Anderson, or Billy Martin -- field generals. The options for the on field game are not as copious as OOTP, but do reflect the historical accuracy better, in my opinion. Every player that appeared in even one game for a team during the season is present on the roster.\n\nThe game is very modable as well.\n\nTL;DR - Buy it! It is a wonderful hidden gem.  9/10","timestamp_created":1566007656,"timestamp_updated":1566007656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542168676853179932","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5I/VzuwCfs2/0AE="}
