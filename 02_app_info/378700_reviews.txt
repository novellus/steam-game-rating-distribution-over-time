Recommend purchase when it is on sale. Travel around in a sub finding \"stuff\" that helps solve a mystery.  Nothing too difficult.  \nSome bits don't make a lot of sense - like the salvage exchange that you don't really need after the upgrades have been purchased.  \nOverall its relaxing, simple, somewhat engaging.  But it is very short.  You can finish it in about an hour.","timestamp_created":1604900460,"timestamp_updated":1604900460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3rLh1fUCcJGlrQI="}
