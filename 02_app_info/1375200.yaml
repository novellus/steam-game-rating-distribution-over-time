    review: "Mind Mapping has been around since the 70's as a semi-structured way\
      \ to organize one's thoughts and planning around a central idea. Using VR Noda\
      \ provides users Mind Mapping on steroids! Noda is an invaluable tool to those\
      \ wanting to optimize thier brain power and leverage the power of VR in organizing\
      \ and generating thoughts and ideas around a specific topic or effort. Want\
      \ to map out your life goals, organize a research paper, author a novel, or\
      \ plan a party. You can do it better in Noda! The experience is at once meditative\
      \ as well as gamified and designed to put you \"in the zone\" so you can be\
      \ your most creative and productive. I find after i start a Node map i visit\
      \ it several times a week and just the experience of being there looking at\
      \ the map will trigger new thoughts and expand my map. \nCheck out my overview\
      \ of Noda over at my YouTube channel, VR 4 Work https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOPivLudusITkFvxUMzu3SA"
