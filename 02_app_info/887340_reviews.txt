Mechanically, there isn't much to it, and dashing is a bit imprecise, but this is an EXPERIENCE.  The world is very pretty, and beyond that, it's incredible to watch the world gradually going to Hell as the adventure progresses.  A lot of love was put into this, and I'd jump at the opportunity to play a longer game set in this world.","timestamp_created":1608699802,"timestamp_updated":1608699802,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmd7+xvYCeOWtvAI="}
