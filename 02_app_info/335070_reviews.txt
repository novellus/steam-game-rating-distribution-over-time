Nothing like a real R/C. I purchased the game to find out the most important cars are an additional purchase? \n-Buggies do not come with this game\n-Drift car is garbage - I don't even know where to start.\n-Physics are nowhere remotely close to the real thing.\n-Sound is annoying and nothing close to the real thing\n-Graphics are terrible, and look nothing like the real thing\n-Transmitter connections don;t work well. I have calibrated my radio several times, VRC only detects half of the wheel movement and twitches most of the time. Expensive dongle is also required in addition to make this actually work.","timestamp_created":1609680555,"timestamp_updated":1609680701,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45Mic5PYCeuOIwAI="}
