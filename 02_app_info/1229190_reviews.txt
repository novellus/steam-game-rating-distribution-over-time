Placing various shapes causes different audio channels to play and, by changing the colour of the shape you're placing, you'll get a different tone and rhythm to play. I found myself grooving to the songs I was making after a while and really got into the intersectionality of visual and auditory art. It could have more selection of shapes and perhaps something like a smoother line tool, but I'm happy with the game overall and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys unique VR artistic experiences.","timestamp_created":1593531970,"timestamp_updated":1593531970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnYb6gvMCdLDVkQI="}
