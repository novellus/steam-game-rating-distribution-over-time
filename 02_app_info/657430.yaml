    review: 'Out of all the Pinball tables I own this one is the most fun!

      I beat all the challenges no problem while still exploring the references from
      the game.

      Getting the achievement for finishing all tests and "beating" GLaDOS must be
      really hard though.

      And I think it is a bit disappointing that clip they chose to go with for the
      sound that plays when you click the table in the level select is the the Spanish
      Wheatley bit.'
