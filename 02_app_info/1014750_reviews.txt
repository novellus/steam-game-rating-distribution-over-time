The setting is well developed and the story is well written.  There are some optimization puzzles and you WILL want to cross train as many as possible but these aspects are not too difficult and do not detract from the narrative.  This really is all about the characters and their relationships--all with subplots that complement the setting and main story and make it feel like an actual group of less-than-ideal individuals forced together instead of pieces to progress the narrative.  This focus on story and characters does not remove player agency, however, and your choices will effect your outcomes.  I want to play again and not out of a completionist desire or feeling I got a bad result but because I actually want to make alternate choices and see how they turn out.\n\nAs an aside, the ending feels very original Deus Ex and I mean that in the best way.  I don't like any of the choices but that feels natural given all that has proceeded it: you have to make the best out of a series of bad options and there is no obvious alternate that the game just doesn't let you make.  There is no absolute best or \"good\" ending that I know of (it may exist but be hidden) but ones you can live with...and given the setting and genre that will do.","timestamp_created":1574492378,"timestamp_updated":1574492378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.601941704750061035","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwueLDy+4CdZ+E3AE="}
