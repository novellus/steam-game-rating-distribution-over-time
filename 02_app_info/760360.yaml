      /><br>You have to go through 13 levels for efficacy checks<br>and identify problems

      /><br>In the modern world the current trend is interactive learning. This game
      will help you better learn the basics of programming without spending much time
      and money by learning through the visual system in the quests. <br>The game
      contains 13 levels, each of which accommodates 1-3 scripts on the gaming scene.
      With each passed level the game is integrated into a complex puzzle, which demonstrates
      the various functions and variables within scripts. <br>The gameplay encourages
      interaction, exploration, teaches a method of trial and error. A good game leaves
      the player with time to develop his skills, the same thing happens in the learning
      process. Naturally, to understand the scripts you'll need to explore the library
      of functions. Through these actions the player will learn new tools and discover
      his own abilities to programming. The very visual programming does not require
      the initial preparation for the game, the quests themselves teach a player,
      allowing him to understand the basic principles of programming. All that is
      required for the player is logic, which helps training and completing levels.<br><img

      /><br>In the game there is also a sandbox, you can use it for implementation
      of your different ideas, or just for practice or study. There will be enough
      tools in the library for implementation practically any of your ideas, and what
      is the most important, the implementation of different logics in the sandbox
      due to visual programming goes free and easy as the context dependence solves
      problems with syntax errors, however before passing into the sandbox we recommend
      you to pass the storyline in order to understand how the system of visual scripting
      works.

    review: 'I got this game on a big sale and still feel cheated.

      There is no game. You just thrown into some editor with zero instructions.

      I love programming games, but this is NOT how you do a programming game. I have
      enough "fun" figuring out how to use real-world systems with bad documentation,
      don''t need another one.


      On top of that, the game is mostly not working for me, just crashing on load.

      Had I access to "gameplay" right after purchase, I would''ve refunded it (I
      generally don''t refund games if there is at least some resemblance of gameplay).

      Having spent next to nothing, I decided to wait and see how the developer would
      address various issues instead.

      He makes updates once in a while, fixing random things.

      A year has passed, but the game is still crashing on me, and gameplay is not
      there. Weak response in discussion forums too.


      Thumbs down. Not recommended to anyone. Developer have a lot to learn about
      how to deliver fun to players.'
