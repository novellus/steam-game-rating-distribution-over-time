    review: "The game itself is a fun town building game with the pre\xB7quel versions\
      \ starting a genre of games.\n\nBut this version was put on steam by a hobby/basement\
      \ modder that has abandoned the game.  \n\nThis version has many bugs, clitches,\
      \ missing graphics, missing textures for buildings, modified programing errors\
      \ etc. It simply isn't a working version.\n\nIs it worth the money? No, its\
      \ not a working version\n\nMuch better working choices on steam available: by\
      \ Impressions Games / Publisher Activision such as,\n\nCaesar\u2122 3\nPharaoh\
      \ + Cleopatra\nZeus + Poseidon"
