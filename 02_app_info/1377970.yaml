    review: This game is quite beautiful and relaxing. It has an ok story, with some
      funny references, and I liked the mechanics since we have the option to move
      our characters on the keyboard. My only issue with it is that I experienced
      some bugs, nothing too serious, but one of them was that even though I completed
      my quest it showed as incomplete, and I had to figure out what to do next by
      guessing, so sometimes I got stuck. Since the game is pretty new it`ll probably
      be fixed soon, so I didn`t mind it too much, I think this game has great potential
      to be a very fun and enjoyable experience, hope the developers keep updating
      it so we`ll have more things to explore.
