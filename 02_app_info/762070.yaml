    review: "More is less. Some cards will give you prestige. Every action phase has\
      \ an aditional prestige bonus. Settling planets will reduce the cost by -2 for\
      \ example for 1 prestige, exploration will let you draw 6 cards and keep 2 for\
      \ 1 prestige etc. It's not a new mechanic, it just adds more bloat. Another\
      \ feature here is the new search action phase which can be selected once per\
      \ game and let you search for a specific card. \n\nBottom line is, there are\
      \ too many bonuses and cards. It's much harder to chase strategies. Cards are\
      \ also cluttered with symbols now due to the additional prestige bonus. It feels\
      \ like it's designed for more than 4 players in mind while the game's player\
      \ limit is 4. This expansion doesn't make sense, the elegance is lost. Rebel\
      \ vs Imperium is the way to play the first arc in my opinion. A big thumb down,\
      \ avoid.\n\nNote: This expansion requires Gathering Storm and Rebel vs Imperium."
