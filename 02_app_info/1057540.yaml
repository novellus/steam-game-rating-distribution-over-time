    review: 'I didn''t think I was going to enjoy this game as much as I did but holy
      crap is this game a riot. Honestly I haven''t played Cthulhu Saves the World
      or Breath of Death VII but I did enjoy some of the interactions between the
      NPCs during story events. Probably gonna have to play the other games at some
      point.


      Pros:

      - Cthulhu

      - Christmas puns

      - Chickens

      - A unique battle system that challenges the player to think strategically.

      - Fourth wall breaks

      - References to other RPGs

      - Awesome soundtrack, especially on the boss battles


      Cons:

      - Battles can tend to drag if you don''t prepare and equip your party properly.

      - It''s short, only like 10-12 hours, probably less if you don''t grind.

      - You probably won''t get the references to other games unless you''ve played
      them. (It doesn''t detract from the game but you guys should be aware.)


      It''s a great little game and definitely worth a look, highly recommend this
      one if you need a laugh or if you''re looking for a bit of a shorter RPG experience.'
