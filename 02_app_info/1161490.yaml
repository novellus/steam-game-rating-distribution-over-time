    review: "So yes, when you look at my time played you may just automatically brush\
      \ this off.  However, I've been playing MotoGP, and nearly all other racing\
      \ games of all types since their inception. I'm not even gonna take the time\
      \ to list them all just to prove my knowledge and worthiness... I'm a racing\
      \ game junkie born in '84... nuff said.\n  \nSo here's why I quit so early...\n\
      \n1. Engine audio is absolutely awful. Clearly just some layered saw-tooth waves\
      \ with some unintelligent use of reverb. What happened to the days when they\
      \ took the time to go out and record real audio of each individual bike; manufacturer,\
      \ class, any modifications, track and weather conditions, object proximity,\
      \ part performance and or failure, etc.etc. \n\n2.  Graphics; running i7, 7700,\
      \ 1070, blah blah blah... yes running ultra... no not looking like ultra. Idk\
      \ about this one.  I hope I'm doing something wrong cuz these graphics seem\
      \ worse than PS4. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.\n \n3.  WTF is\
      \ up with the handling?  Listen, I'll accept the fact that I might simply be\
      \ overlooking something, but I'm pretty sure I've gone through every menu and\
      \ setting available from easy settings through pro... I can't even finish a\
      \ lap without sliding out, or turning a horribly slow time.  So please, if you\
      \ guys have any advice on settings or what I may be doing wrong, please let\
      \ me know.  This is the #1 killer for me.  I can deal with sub-par graphics\
      \ and audio, as long as the game-play is smooth and enjoyable. Also, I use an\
      \ XBOX cont., if that says anything...\n\n4.  This is a nit-picky one: character,\
      \ livery, helmet, suit, bike etc. Customization is ok... I feel like more in\
      \ depth options should be standard these days. We've all seen what can be done,\
      \ let's include at least that.\n\nSo yeah, that's what I gathered in 1 hr of\
      \ play.  Really hope someone can show me where I've gone wrong in the settings,\
      \ because I really want to like this game."
