    review: "When I first bought this game It was during the late stages of the overall\
      \ decline of the player base. The game delivered on all aspects of the proposed\
      \ experience but had issues with bugs and glitches. I've heard talk of some\
      \ exploiting or even hacking but I have never had the displeasure of encountering\
      \ them so I cannot talk much on them.\n\nFinding a lobby with any amount of\
      \ players became a challenge as the months passed. (We're talking anywhere from\
      \ 5 to 10 minutes to find a lobby and then again to wait for others. Most people\
      \ do not have that kind of patience.) I hear now it is even worse but there\
      \ are still games being played out there apparently. I even managed one myself\
      \ recently so it's not dead yet. Floundering? Maybe but not dead by any means.\
      \ \n\nGame play is what you would expect if you have played Dead by Daylight\
      \ and Left 4 dead. It blends the multiplayer concepts the two games have. It\
      \ is less smooth then either of the two in my opinion but the overall challenge\
      \ of outpacing a team of 3 distinct killer types controlled by one player. Is\
      \ sometimes overshadowed by how easy it is for the survivors to rush the objectives.\n\
      \nDo I recommend this game? Yes but I'd also recommend using discord to link\
      \ up with other players. It's far far faster that way. (We're talking down from\
      \ 5-10 to 2-3 minutes with wait for other players) Plus there is ALWAYS someone\
      \ trying to play as a killer (just like dead by daylight) so chances are you'll\
      \ get paired up fairly quickly.\n\nTLDR? \"too few ppl casually play now so\
      \ have a backup to lure extra players\""
