I am absolutely floored hearing it equal audio quality after all this time.\n\nStill the weakest of the three OSTs in my opinion, but this clarity removes one of my biggest issues with it.","timestamp_created":1593157551,"timestamp_updated":1593157551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653676331043243408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ueDl9/ICfcWkkAI="}
