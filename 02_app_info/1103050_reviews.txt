Quite fun to do.\n+You have 5 hints you can use to help solve the puzzle.\n+\"Shuffle\" and \"Center camera\" option.\n+It's nice to have a big surface area to work on the puzzle. Zoom is available too.\n+Puzzle save when you go back to puzzle selection menu\n\nNegatives---\n-UI is very ugly.\n-Music is annoying and reset when you begin a new puzzle. Music loop is very short and doesn't loop properly, but anyway, I'm sure people will just end up muting it.\n-Annoying telephone ringing noises not relaxing when you snap a piece correctly to the board.\n-snapping is way too permissive. Snapping occurs when your pieces are about 2 puzzle height away from the spot where it really belongs. There is no setting to change the snapping distance either.\n-When you drop a chunk of pieces snapped together, I don't know why, but it goes behind some of the other loose puzzle pieces.\n-There is no visual indicator to know if you already complete a puzzle or not.\n-No achievements\n-Puzzle have a set difficulty, you can't change it.\n-No confirmation to restart the puzzle\n-There is no indication of which puzzle is in progress.\n\nEven at his price, I can't recommend the game at the moment because it's just too easy with the autosnapping far away, also you can't change the difficulty for images. With more work on it, it could be improved, but for the moment there is better puzzle game on steam to play.","timestamp_created":1583700888,"timestamp_updated":1583701100,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531835198402404785","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3qD83fACeJz29gE="}
