The game is full of details and hidden elements, which makes it in an solid rpg. Also this is a choices matter game.\n\n- Crafting system where you can create weapons, armor, accessories, objects, meals, etc. Each piece of equipment in the game has different slots in which you can insert gems of different uses, some increase your stats, others give you the ability to blind or poison, others increase your elemental resistance, etc., allowing a lot of versatility and customization. In addition each piece of equipment has different type and number of slots, unique pieces can have unique slot type, unlike the generic equipment they sell in stores, which usually have the same type and number of slots.\n\n- Class system for your main character where you can choose between 7 different classes each with their own role, skills and equipment, and a detailed description of each before you can choose, you can also change to another class later. The music is well set and does not disappoint. Depending on the time of day morning, noon, night, etc., different events can occur, which gives more life to the game world.\n\n- The devs are professionals and dedicated to the project. It shows in the story so well told and the amount of detail, that the devs wanted to make a game that surprised you and give you the good feeling that games like FF4 or 6, Chrono trigger, Lufia 2 gave you in those times, but with modern touches, and with over time was lost in some games, clear examples FF13, Star Ocean Integrity and Faithlessness, Atelier Lydie & Suelle, etc.\n\nCons:\n- The grammar in some sentences could improve.","timestamp_created":1546779925,"timestamp_updated":1558734834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462532311677932739","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwlcH19eoCfOzUtwE="}
