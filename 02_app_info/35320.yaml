    about_the_game: "<strong>Insane 2</strong> offers a number of innovations in the\
      \ off-road racing genre. Besides the traditional time trial mode, the game features\
      \ 9 other game modes, including the popular \u201CCapture the flag\u201D, \u201C\
      Gate hunt\u201D and \u201CPathfinder\u201D, as well as some new competitions,\
