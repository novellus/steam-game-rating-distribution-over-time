It was quite a surprise to see it appear in the Steam store considering its age, however, I immediately bought  it because it is one of my all time favourite 3D breakouts and also  I wanted to convey my thanks  and support to the developer for including it on Steam;  as well as suggest a few additions that may improve the re-playability, or even see a  new version created by the developer, that may incorporate some of the suggestions I've made at the end of this review and in the comments section.\n\nThe game mechanics are similar to most 3D breakouts; however, compared to most 3D versions of breakout, this one is quite challenging, in part due to the addition of the robots,  boss battles & invader like mini game, but also because the ball speeds are a tad faster than most other 3D breakouts, where  ball speeds in those breakouts start off very sluggish and rarely get any better. also, the shape of each arena  differs slightly.\n\nAlso, if you do lose all of your lives, you  can choose to continue,  by restarting the level with the same number of lives you started out with at the beginning of that level.  If you are lucky you'll have a full complement, or even more  if you've gained extra lives; however, if you only had the one life left at the beginning of the failed level, (likely if you've just completed a boss battle), that's all you'll get when continuing. The advantage of not starting  totally from the beginning is that you retain your score as well.  If you do choose to start from the beginning, i.e. with a score of zero, you can still select  any level you've previously unlocked. (I'm not sure if this is actually possible as the game  saves your progress when you  leave the game).\n\nYou can earn more lives by collecting the infrequent life power-up or destroy 25 robots. The ball physics are acceptable, though I'd like to see the ball ricochet off at more acute angles as it seems to be limited to specific angles, though this does not affect game play at all. I think the different shaped arena that changes each level  helps to counter the lack of more acute angle ricochets.   The overall speed of the game is good compared to many other 3D breakouts, where the balls always seem really sluggish; making those games easy to beat. Also, when the last few hard to get bricks are left, the rocket launchers, that are  usually placed along the top of the arena come into play and soon dispatch them to oblivion. I think this may also include any robots that are still lurking.\n\nUnless you are an expert breakout player you will need as many lives as you can muster to survive the boss levels, especially the later ones, which are more difficult to beat.  There are five different boss types, but you will usually only face one or two at a time.  Both can be quite hard to beat, especially the dual boss levels.   As you have one  facing off against you frequently,  while the other is firing missiles  (and later bricks) at you. Usually you do get  several machine gun or laser power ups in the boss rounds which does help somewhat.  You can see your progress  against  the boss levels via the health bar located at the top of the game arena.\n\nAs with  most  breakouts, Action Ball 2  includes a wide variety of power ups totalling thirty one; some of which are rarely seen in breakouts, for example freeze robots, lightning bolts,  bombing raids, grenades and meteorite showers.  There are four types of robots to contend with (not counting the boss robots),  these include a supply robot that  replaces destroyed  bricks,  a repair robot that repairs damaged bricks;  sentinel robots that  fire rockets at  your bat and Kamikase robots  that try to destroy your paddle by dive bombing you..  Each robot  when destroyed is added to a counter (located to the right of the arena) that,  as mentioned above,  adds a new life  once you reach 25 kills.\n\nA nice touch to this game which I've only seen in a few other Alawar based breakouts is the upgrade system (e.g.  Strike Ball 3), where you earn upgrade points after scoring a specific amount of points.  These upgrade points can be added to either  the size of your bat,  the amount of ammo  your bat can carry, the power of your bat and  the defence of your bat.  Each of these can be upgraded up to four times. You can also select  from four different  paddle styles once they are unlocked. Most power ups are time limited. An indicator at the  left side of the arena will appear whenever you pick up a useful  or negative power up. Different power ups are stackable, but not the same power up, though the new one will cancel the part used one if you pick up the same power up while one is still live.   Every fifth level you get either a boss battle or an invaders like mini game that alternate throughout the game.\n\nThere are 13 achievements available with the Steam version, most of which are  easily earned.  I got the first eight or nine within 25 minutes of playing the game for the first time.\n\n\n[b]Suggestions for the developer - part 1[/b]\n\n\nI would  consider revamping the  achievements. As they stand I think they are far too easy to  achieve and are not in that sense achievements. I'd consider scrapping most of the ones already included or at least supplementing them with others such as level markers e.g. attaining level 10, 20, 30 etc (after beating boss levels) also being able to survive a boss battle without  losing a life, and/or not using any power ups to beat the boss, achieving your first extra life for killing 25 robots, collecting 200 or more power-ups in the mini game (space invader like levels), Beating all boss levels without using power ups etc.  I'd also like to see trading cards added.  These could include images of the boss robots as well as images of the rarer power ups and different paddles etc.\n\nplease see other suggestions in the comments below.","timestamp_created":1581261622,"timestamp_updated":1606407043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.67499309778213501","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+8bUgvYCeeqX8QE="}
