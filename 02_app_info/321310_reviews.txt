Eventually as social media caught onto this fact, that not only was it a badly programmed vagrant cash grab, but that the game itself contained many cases of copyright infringement which the developer himself just stole without gaining approval. Hence the company known as ‘Killjoy’ eventually became known as a scam artist.\n\nThis tarnished reputation originally was evaded by the company changing their name to ‘Iron Game Studios’ and again another quick cash grab full of glitches and meaningless copyright infringement dribble was released onto the Steam Store, but not all consumers are dumbbells and soon many began to realise that this raw programming piece of sewage was from the exact same scammers of ‘Air Control’.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/V3JK_2GLBSk\n\nEventually after a massive backlash exposing this fact, it’s interesting to note that the reputable publisher Kiss LTD ( http://www.kiss-ltd.co.uk/ ) took a noble measure of immediate action removing it not only swiftly from the Steam store, but also from any other retailer, they made a formal apology that this violation somehow got through their scrutiny process and offered a refund for a period of time to anyone who bought this falsely marketed product. Since then you can bet Kiss Ltd have tightened the reins to make sure this kind of thing never happens again?\n\nHowever it’s interesting to note that even to this day many question if the developer ( http://zenfishgame.blogspot.com.au/ ) is really a scammer or more just a delusional programming wannabe. For one thing, regardless of the sheer volume of glitches and bugs, one can’t ignore the amount of work that ‘did’ go into this press ‘w’ simulator. 30 levels of different landscapes, decorated with many animated versions of fish. One quickly therefore asks were they the work of the developer? Or are they also a copyright infringement? How much of this product was truly his?\n\nWhat further makes this a puzzling thing is that the game starts off with a begging statement requesting that you meditate and imagine what life would be like as a fish. Whatever inspirational message the developer is trying to get across soon becomes lost as you begin to laughingly experience levels where a clown fish is experiencing flashbacks of her children being burnt as she swims along, and a questionable level where your clownfish seems to be on LSD.\n\nThe music which is supposed to be relaxing you into some type of Zen trance, instead is piercing your eardrums with a heavenly choir that sounds like they’ve just sat on a hot poker. There is no in game volume control other than to turn the damn thing off. Even the clown fish you control eventually swims into an Angler fish and snuffs himself for which I assume was an act of mercy in trying to get out of the game. Alas you’re not so lucky and for no apparent reason whatsoever get to control other fish in the following levels again where the only objective is to press ‘w’ until you trigger the next cut scene. This isn’t always the case though, for instance one scene does not trigger any cuts, and instead you can swim endlessly into the blue beyond for 6 hrs straight or more if you wish to experience a migration scene across the whole Atlantic.\n\nWhat really gets my panties in a knot, is that the developer of the game even spent time translating this noble message of imagine what life would be like as a fish in more languages than what is even currently translated on the United Nations Website. Seriously! I KID YOU NOT! This guy REALLY wanted to get this message of ‘Let’s have some fish empathy!!!’ out there. I really wouldn’t be surprised if he hasn’t started door knocking by now asking people, ‘Have you ever wondered what life would be like if you were a fish?’ and let’s face it there’s probably many out there with a Christian fish symbol who might be tempted here…\n\nIronically many who wanted it originally completely scaled from the Steam store and now it is, a number of those avid game collectors would now love to hook themselves a copy, all because of its downstream antics and history. I concur and understand why some are truly vexed about the game. Was he delusional? Was he a scammer? Was he both? My personal beliefs is that he was definitely a very ‘fishy’ person.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/GxmhB-OLA_s\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please subscribe to my curator page.
