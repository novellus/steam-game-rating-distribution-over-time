It spent months in my wishlist until it went on sale and I could buy it and I am so disappointed honestly. The controls are downright terrible. Its like the people who made it have never gamed on a computer before. What game has you press the down AND jump buttons simultaneously just to jump normally? I don't understand. And the controls are crazy sensitive with no way to adjust them. You simply tap the left or right button and your character moves way farther than it really should which makes the avoidance of traps and enemies extremely difficult. Plus, sometimes the game wants me to play using the WASD buttons and sometimes it wants me to play with the arrowkeys, but its not consistent and literally will not let me use certain buttons if those are not what it wants me to use at that time. Talk about confusing? And I'm somehow supposed to be pressing three buttons on different parts of my keyboard at once just for the beginning of the second level? How many hands do you think I have? I replayed the first level I dont even know how many times trying to figure out how to free the other cat and I never figured it out. Went to the second level and same thing. I shouldn't have to look up how to play the game just because theres no gameplay instructions and its not self-explanatory. By the other bad reviews citing the same issues that have clearly not been fixed, I can tell that the game developers did not take much time to consider the actual issues with the game after its release (or apparently before either).","timestamp_created":1609346168,"timestamp_updated":1609346168,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzLag2vYCdrfpvgI="}
