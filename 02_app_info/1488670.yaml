    about_the_game: "Physics Cake is a 2-D physics simulation game where you can draw\
      \ containers, objects, or anything you want really and put whatever chosen physical\
      \ object you want inside of it. All the objects have different interactions\
      \ that are designed to be fun and entertaining. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhysics\
      \ Cake is similar to old \u201Csand-like\u201D games you would find online many\
      \ years ago. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhysics Cake is designed to be fun and entertaining,\
      \ like paint, but with basic physics. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can also save\
      \ your creations and simulations. You can easily share your simulations with\
      \ anyone else by sharing your saved text files with them. Physics Cake supports\
      \ steam cloud, so anything you have saved will be backed up to steam automatically\
      \ when you exit the game. This way you can keep your creations across devices.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is easy to start and has built-in help descriptions\
      \ for all the objects and basic functions by clicking the ? Or ?2 buttons in\
      \ the game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhysics Cake is currently in early access as\
      \ we plan to add user suggestions, fix any bugs, improve stability, and in general\
      \ make a fun open 2-D simulation game that can be entertaining for minutes or\
      \ for hours.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBelow is a list of all the objects currently\
      \ in the game (most objects are able to be re-arranged after spawning by right-clicking\
      \ and dragging the object as wanted): <br />\r\nNone: nothing spawned on click\
      \ (default)<br />\r\nDelete: A red crossed through circle that deletes anything\
      \ you touch with it.<br />\r\nLine: A solid line to draw things with, or make\
      \ containers.<br />\r\nWater: A liquid ball of water.<br />\r\nOil: A liquid\
      \ glob of oil.<br />\r\nSteam: Quick rising steam that evaporates.<br />\r\n\
      Fire: It burns things, duh!<br />\r\nWood: Wood blocks that act similarly to\
      \ line (wood can be effected by other objects life fire).<br />\r\nJello: Wiggly,\
      \ jiggly jelly, bouncy and expandable.<br />\r\nSpinner-R: Spins to the right\
      \ like a singular fan blade.<br />\r\nSpinner-L: Spins to the left like a singular\
      \ fan blade<br />\r\nVoid: A tiny black hole, anything sucked into it is deleted\
      \ automatically (limit 1).<br />\r\nClack: Clacker balls that are pinned to\
      \ the spawn area<br />\r\nGrass: Grass, can be watered to be grown. <br />\r\
      \nIce: Cubes of ice that freeze things and jiggle like real ice cubes.<br />\r\
      \nWater-SP: Endlessly spawns water objects from the chosen location.<br />\r\
      \nIce-SP: Endlessly spawns ice objects from the chosen location.<br />\r\nOil-SP:\
      \ Endlessly spawns oil objects from the chosen location.<br />\r\nJello-SP:\
      \ Endlessly spawns jello objects from the chosen location.<br />\r\nSteam-SP:\
      \ Endlessly spawns steam objects from the chosen location.<br />\r\nE-SP: Endlessly\
      \ spawns electron objects. <br />\r\nKill Line: The standard object, but any\
      \ physical objects that touch it are removed on contact.<br />\r\nPulley: Two\
      \ connected weights that make up a pulley system.<br />\r\nSticky: Sticks to\
      \ other physical objects. (limited to 125 instances on screen at once)<br />\r\
      \nCOLORED L BUTTONS: Produces the LINE object in the chosen color.<br />\r\n\
      Etron: Short for electron. Bounces randomly at high velocity. Not affected by\
      \ void, wood, or ice, and can electrify objects on contact. <br />\r\nDrag u:\
      \ Drags any physical objects upwards that are below it.<br />\r\nFire-SP: Endlessly\
      \ spawns fire objects above it.<br />\r\nKill Line: The standard object, but\
      \ any physical objects that touch it are removed on contact.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nYou can also alter the gravity of the simulation at any time you wish."
