Its been in early access for months but there's still ridiculous bugs like the 5th crashing constantly, Endless Mode ending after 93 fish (....), being able to fall off the screen pressing down in level 4, and its short and lack in content, while little has been added to it in the months its been in EA.\n\n\nYou can find better games like this for free just googling fish eating game","timestamp_created":1609715508,"timestamp_updated":1609715508,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504132270812988281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609722578,"developer_response":"Hello,\n\nOnly by myself, I am trying my best to delevop the game. Development process could take up to 2 years like i mentioned under early access title. Multiplayer and story mode will be added as mainly but bugs will be fixed as well. So while I am trying my best to develop game by myself as lone developer, your comment made me upset, because I thought I was making process. The game will be better by time. But thank you for, you tried my game and your precious comment.\n\nSincerely."}],"cursor":"AoJwsqyh5fYCff6cwAI="}
