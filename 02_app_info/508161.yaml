    review: "[h1]I would recommend playing this rout last before hikaru's,[/h1]\n\
      bc then you get all the hidden references etc. A lot of characters of other\
      \ routes (nearly all of them) are in this, it even has some spoilers for other\
      \ routes too.\n\n[h1]Game overall:[/h1]\n- My only critique is the music, wich\
      \ becomes boring after some loops. \n- CS were good but i would have hoped for\
      \ more (or i'm used to get more of them in other VN/Otome).\n\n+ Other that\
      \ that the game is unusually polished\n+ i personally enjoyed a more western/realistic\
      \ artstyle for once \n+ and the writing was good (both in grammar AND storytelling)\n\
      + the maincharacter is normal, in a GOOD way. She reacts grumpy when someone\
      \ is rude, shes flustered if its the situation but shes not overly anything.\
      \ The writing conveyed a fully fleshed charcter wich you shape with your reaktions\
      \ one by one. I really enjoyed seeing this instead of one blunt character!\n\
      \n[h1]This particular Route:[/h1]\n+ Overall this route was very interessting.\
      \ You learn a lot about the world, the characters (wich you shoud know from\
      \ other rutes already) and the main mystery of Shizuha.\n+ Taku as a person\
      \ is written pretty good, not the best of the bunch ut believeble albeit sometimes\
      \ beeing a bit extreme in his uuuh let's say \"outbursts\", wich at times makes\
      \ the writing / his character a bit questionable and more fiction-esque than\
      \ realistic\n+ their relationship is one of the more fuctional and realistic\
      \ ones, its especially nice to see important or \"hard\" topics being dealt\
      \ with and solved through conversations wich is not seen often in fiction (sadly)\n\
      (- at times i found the protagonist a bit out of control (just like his ourburts)\
      \ but the given excuse (beeing that shes just way to in love with him and tbh\
      \ a bit clingy) is enough to make me stand it )"
