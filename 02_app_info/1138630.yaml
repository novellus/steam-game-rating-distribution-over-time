    about_the_game: '<strong>Heroes Swipe Right</strong> combines the hell of challenging
      roguelikes with the hell of online dating.<br><br>In Heroes Swipe Right, players
      are challenged to wade into a dungeon full of nasties. You''re not alone, though
      - you can team up with fellow adventurers using a dating app, swiping left to
      pass on the losers and right to pair with capable allies. Every potential match
      comes with their strengths and quirks. Maybe they''re a herculean warrior who''s
      also a hoarder, or maybe they''re a powerful mage who''s nearsighted, or maybe
      they''re a devilish rogue who constantly sends you pictures of their ducks.<br><br>It''ll
      take more than just skill to brave the ever-changing labyrinth. You''ll also
      have to find your perfect match along the way.<br><br><strong>The Dungeon:</strong>
      Play in an ever-changing catacomb full of goblin wizards, sai-throwing skeletons,
      and rock-smashing golems. Every run is different, with new enemies and traps
      to test your mettle. It''s not all bad though: you''ll find shrines and shops
      to give you powerful boons, and you''ll recruit allies to your town to aid you
      in future quests.<br><br><strong>The Questing App:</strong> Dungeons are built
      for 2, and every time you need a new companion, you''ll open your modern-day
      inspired app in search of another compatible adventurer. Swipe left and right
      to find your match, but be mindful. Some matches will be faceblind and unable
      to tell friend from foe. Some won''t know how to read numbers. Some will constantly
      jabber while you''re trying to fight. Finding the right companion won''t come
      easy.<br><br><strong>The HUB:</strong> As you play, you''ll recruit allies into
      your base town, all of whom come with their own quirky <i>stuff</i>. Want someone
      to dig into a well for special items? There''s a guy for that. Want someone
      to tell you hot dog jokes, and nothing but hot dog jokes? Sure, we have that
      too. <br><br>Heroes Swipe Right is built around discovery - finding new quirks
      that surprise you, new townsfolk that engage you, and new enemies that destroy
      you.'

    short_description: Heroes Swipe Right is a challenging dungeon crawler where you
      form your party of adventurers using a dating app, swiping left to pass on the
      losers and right to pair with capable allies. Every potential match comes with
      their strengths and quirks, many of which drastically alter the nature of the
      game.

    review: interesting twist on rougelite,  progression feels alright at least from
      what I've seen.  This would probably do really well on mobile.
