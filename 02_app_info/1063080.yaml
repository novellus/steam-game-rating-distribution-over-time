    review: 'Once again, Goeppels-chan really captures the spirit of you''re average
      Nazi hire-up going to great lengths to appease the Fuhrer. The basic plot of
      this episode is that the Fuhrer wants to beat out Disney to ensure that Germany
      is the key player in world wide animation. You''re key decision is whether or
      not you will use actual German ideas, or contract out to foreign companies.
      SPOILERS AHEAD: In my play through I decided to use the glorious German animators,
      and Flute recommends first Ninja Turtles, but later Transformers. With the help
      of Leni Riefenstahl, you manage to make the most kick-ass cartoon ever, and
      you also get a massive toy deal, making Germany the talk of the animation and
      toy industry for the next thousand years! OH AND ALSO ITS BASED AND REDPILLED!'
