Not the best, but good.\n- The arrow setting is a little bit off: you have to bend your hand to set the arrow to the bow.\n- Also you can't change hands after you accidentally chose wrong.\n- To get to the next wave, you have to shoot the arrow extra far, instead of the possibility to just push a button.\n* Could also have multi-player online choice.","timestamp_created":1603416478,"timestamp_updated":1603416478,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk7rEqfUCdNXDqQI="}
