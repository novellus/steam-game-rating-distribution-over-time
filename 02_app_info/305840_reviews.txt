The tutorial is confusing and seemly written by someone who has never played the game.  There are functions that are complex for no reason.  The tutorial itself is interminable and seems to go on without end.  I never completed it because I simply could on figure out how to make containers.  Plus the player cannot simply skip the tutorial.  The gameplay in the Quick Battle is similarly fraught with buggy control.  Focusing and attacking does not always work.  Great ship models and I like the elevation system but the controls are uncontrollable.  This is basically an incomplete game.  Somebody please complete it!","timestamp_created":1608487838,"timestamp_updated":1608487838,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwk5TWwPYCevThuwI="}
