    review: 'Interesting story, 9 different endings (one only available after first
      playthrough), depending on your decisions and a skip button that lets you skip
      everything you have seen already.

      The only thing I''d wish to have was some sort of tree or something after you
      finished all endings, so you can see, what scenes are still missing and how
      to get them.

      Otherwise a good game, nice acting and an excellent story with different outcomes
      (which offers a replay value). Give it a try!'
