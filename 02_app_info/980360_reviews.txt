Extremely relaxing, while still having a bit of difficulty to it. The art style is perfect for the vibe and I can't wait to more functionality/modes/difficulties/(maybe keyboard controls)/whatever else to get added. Much needed change of pace when I'm stressed. Highly recommend!","timestamp_created":1604724217,"timestamp_updated":1604724217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4yorB0PUCdJvqrAI="}
