In this game of survival, you are essentially trying to maintain order as throngs of victims that have succumbed to the Zombie Epidemic Disease parade around the countryside. \n\nThe game can be played at several levels - a Basic Game level that uses simple instructions to help new players learn the game, to more advanced levels that add in new rules and features to play with! There seems to be quite a bit of luck involved in the game but it is certainly tempered quite a bit with abilities to push things in your favor.\n\nI found the rules to be cumbersome - and split across several sources to read, but overall a lot easier to get through then other DLCs in Tabletop Simulator I have play, and much more indepth. For the most part they were understandable, though I did notice an issue with the Setup Instructions for the Level I: Outbreak! - which indicated certain components as being there when they are actually apart of the subsequent level Level II: Apocalypse!\n\nSomethings that I sort of dislike though is that it seems to cater more to a singleplayer then other games - you can play with game cooperatively but ultimately you don't really have any singleplayer that you specifically control as other players (with your permission of course) 'can' move your character around and make other actions.\n\nNonetheless it is definitely a step above many other games I have played in Tabletop Simulator. It even comes with a little bit of extra scripting - making setting up a game so much less of a hassle, and letting you just play!\n\nRecommended!","timestamp_created":1605036357,"timestamp_updated":1605145509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yJeI3fUCdvbNrQI="}
