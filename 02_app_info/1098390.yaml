    about_the_game: 'Project Wasteland: The Mythiclands, is the second chapter in
      the Project Wasteland series. The lack of mercenaries in The Wasteland has caused
      the dimension to collapse due to the on-going wars between Fox Tech, Coyote
      Corp. and the invading of Demons...and Aliens. All human life has been wiped
      from the wasteland, but the death does not stop there. The rifts created from
      the demon armies have allowed the corrupting fog of death to seep from The Wasteland
      into The Mythiclands. You play as a villager that managed to secure themselves
      a pocket dimension to live inside of, but the catch is that this pocket dimension
      has almost nothing. You will need to return to the now corrupted Mythiclands
      to scavenge supplies to build your home and while you are there, investigate
      ways to reverse the effects of the corruption. Beware though, without magical
      intervention your body will succumb to the fog if you are there for too long.
      Fight through monsters, scavenge supplies, and fight off players with ill intentions
      in this survival/exploration evolution on the Project Wasteland universe.'
