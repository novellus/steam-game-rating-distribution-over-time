    review: 'At most it''s average...it can be fun..if you can somehow lay it like
      it shows in the vid...a majority of my gameplay was the stress at building up
      chi..then when it comes to the throw, even if I throw it in their direction,
      the game acts as if I did it wrong and only ONE of the blasts go zooming towards
      the target or even sometimes none


      With that being said, there''s hardly ever an indicator whether or not you''d
      actually hit your target unless if it''s powerups, but for basic, nope, it''s
      more or less luck...whether you hit or miss


      Wanna stress yourself out whilst tiring your arms out? Well, this is the game
      for you!


      Despite what the devs commented on this review, they truly didn''t give a damn,
      I went to their discord server and I was blatantly ignored when I told them
      the issue and my specs, if I could, I''d refund this.'
