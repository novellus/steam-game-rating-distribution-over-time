      I know you think everything is alright, but tell me, how come you can\u2019\
      t even remember her name?\u201D<br><br>The Shattering places you in the mind\
      \ of John Evans, where you struggle to piece together the fragments of your\
      \ past and present. Not remembering is one thing, but what will happen when\
      \ your mind leads you down the twisted path of fake memories in order to shelter\
      \ you from the truth?<br><br>Follow the voice of the Doctor as it guides you\
      \ deeper into your mind, and experience the key moments of John\u2019s life\
      \ that had defined and shaped him. Discover the truth, shatter the lies, find\
      \ out what happened to John\u2026 and remember her name.<br><br>The Shattering\
      \ is a first-person, story-driven, psychological thriller. Its defining features\
      \ are the dynamic environments, beautiful aesthetics and intriguing story. There\
      \ are no failure conditions in The Shattering, nor complicated puzzles. The\
      \ gameplay is meant to submerge you in the mind of John, as you take each step\
      \ forward into the twisted mystery of what had happened. A serene and emotionally\
      \ charged soundtrack gives life to every single moment, while the visuals delight\

      \ John, where there are no limits or rules.<br><br>Beautiful and rich realistic\

      \ /><br><br>The Shattering is a work of passion coming from a small group of\
      \ 5 close friends lead by Marta Szymanska. Super Sexy Software started in spirit\
      \ in 2013, when the first echoes of The Shattering started to take form. The\
      \ project began from studying the contrast of white and black in horror and\
      \ culture. The core theme draws on the premise that horrors and fear can be\
      \ achieved through embracing white and the absence of information, rather than\
      \ darkness and the obvious, though unseen, enemy.<br><br>Over various iterations,\
      \ the game took shape and the decision was made to work on it in every spare\
      \ moment that could be found. With members of the team residing in Poland, France\
      \ and Switzerland, they grew in experience and efficiency as the true spirit\
      \ of the studio was born. As the game progressed, the developers and Deck13\
      \ met at a networking event and the synergy between the companies resonated\
      \ immediately. A publisher was found, and all the ingredients to finish The\
      \ Shattering were ready.<br><br>With the full development spanning multiple\
      \ years, births and deaths, tears and laughter, the only joy greater than that\
      \ of the journey together as one team and family, is the joy of seeing The Shattering\
      \ take shape and be played by people around the world. We\u2019d like to thank\
      \ you, the player, for taking interest in our passion. We hope our story can\
