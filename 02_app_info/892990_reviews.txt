The writing and characters are just beyond amazing, and the story is exceptional. I hadn't played a lot of visual novels before and after discovering these i am waiting with anticipation for the next ones.\n\nEdit: after playing more than just one route i have to say all the sables Grimoires are even more amazing than i originally believed, i find myself looking for even more like these stories, and have now played 20+ hours on each. after having seen the roadmaps i find myself wishing it could go faster but i am waiting with breath held for even more of these great stories.","timestamp_created":1609571510,"timestamp_updated":1609758478,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw66HF5vYCcdbSvwI="}
