It was hard to maneuver around. I struggled on a few levels due to the fact that I overjumped. Movement aside, though, HA/CK Classic was among my favourite games on gamejolt and I'm looking forward to finishing this!","timestamp_created":1610005851,"timestamp_updated":1610008169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ouH97fYCesebwQI="}
