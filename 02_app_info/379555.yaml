    review: '"Welcome to Adrenaline". in thick russian accent...lol...more like "welcome
      to 1984 FS1 BOA rofl''...its bad really really bad, but some may enjoy, stories
      are good, enjoyable, but video cant be skipped and goes on forever, but thats
      what we dropped $15 bucks for.. Was going to ask for refund, but ill cut em
      some slack, if they updated the models to something that represents FSX 2018,
      or even 2008...that may be possible to do on your own via web free dlc cockpits
      ect, good 1968 Bell 202 model from fsx freeware ect...Yes that helicopter was
      designed in 60''s :) was way ahead of its time, but not represented well in
      this DLC.  Next time ill do more homework before buying this type of mod, rocketman
      just a glider for example and useless in freeflight, does show whats possible
      realtime video wise in FSX, but dont spend more than $6 on it 35% discount not
      enough :) https://youtu.be/op55fVcVPZI'
