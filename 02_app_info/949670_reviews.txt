This is a truly outstanding work of science fiction by Manuel F. Cede√±o.  The art is [b]gorgeous[/b].  The story is compelling. The characters are well realized.  There are some very big ideas.  The English grammar is about 98% there, but at no time did I have any trouble understanding what was being said. I highly recommend this gem to anyone interested in space exploration, artificial intelligence, or strong female characters.","timestamp_created":1608787208,"timestamp_updated":1608787208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9JTMyfYCf4rXvAI="}
