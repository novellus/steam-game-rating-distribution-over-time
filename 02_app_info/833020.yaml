    about_the_game: '&quot;<i>Dusk Golem''s Anthology of Horror</i>&quot; collects
      four short playable horror stories tied together by a core theme of &quot;Grief&quot;.
      Dealing with grief is hard. It can follow you, whether you''re innocent or guilty,
      prying at you when you''re at your most vulnerable. Grief hurts, and in this
      case, kills.<br><br>Before playing the four stories, enter the miniature &quot;START
      HERE&quot; game narrated by the character Dusk Golem setting up the four horror
      tales you''re about to experience, Along with the introductory pieces, there
      may be more to this prologue game than first meets the eye. Still, the main
      courses awaits within the four stories you can sink your teeth into:<br><br><strong>Girl''s
      Graveyard Mystery</strong> is about Kiki, a witch from a coven settled in a
      rural village. One day while out picking berries, she stumbles upon a nude boy
      in the bushes who she takes back home with her. The Coven takes an interest
      in him, but something takes grip of Kiki''s heart, though she is uncertain if
      it''s feelings of a jealous love or that something really bad is about to happen.<br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>An old arcade-styled collectathon game that slowly twists
      into something far more sinister.<br></li><li>Explore a small rural village
      full of quirky characters from a witch coven.<br></li><li>Featuring a stylized
      OST, black-and-white video cutscenes, and a couple different endings to obtain.</li></ul><br><strong>I
      Haunt this Place</strong> stars a cute and colorful little bean on its way to
      the impossibly constructed yet abandoned Central Services Center. Having recently
      lost your dearest friend, you''ve come back to this place where years prior
      you accidentally left behind something special to you, made even more precious
      with the recent death. This building has a painful history all its own, growing
      scornful and hostile to humans as it decays forgotten. it doesn''t want you
      within itself. it''s hurting and so are you. What you''ve got to make sure of
      now is that you don''t get lost on your way.<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Explore
      a surreal and large complex dripping with atmosphere.<br></li><li>An open-ended
      narrative about someone stricken over grief from loss and the history of an
      old decaying building.<br></li><li>Moving away from common horror tactics like
      jump scares, chasers and the like to focus on something much stranger.</li></ul><br><strong>Wail
      of Despair</strong> follows Kenneth, a kinda'' socially awkward dude who started
      dating this girl named Lucy a few weeks ago. Things are going well, until Lucy
      dies. And with her death, Kenneth begins to be haunted by a terrifying strange
      monstrosity that wants him to die with her. Reality begins to blur, and it''ll
      take all of Kenneth''s willpower to not succumb to a darkness that wants him
      dead. <br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Shlocky and twisted for people with a taste
      for the deranged.<br></li><li>A strong surrealist Americana tale that taps into
      folklore and urban legend.<br></li><li>A twisted explorable linear experience
      spiced up with lots of small hidden secrets.</li></ul><br><strong>In Pale Moon
      I Saw Her Smile</strong> opens with a nervous gentlemen burying a corpse into
      a shallow grave. As he walks home in the dead of night through a white forest,
      he swears he can still see her smiling at him.<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Stylized
      in a unique 2.5D black &amp; white aesthetic.<br></li><li>A callback to a long
      forgotten era of romantic gothic horror, with a surrealist edge.<br></li><li>A
      strong sense of mystery to slowly piece together, backed with voicing of a man
      teetering on the edge.</li></ul><br>We hope you enjoy these twisted tales. Each
      may suit a different type of person with their differing flavors, but we hope
      each is just as surprising as the last.'
