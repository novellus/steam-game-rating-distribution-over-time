Unfortunately, it's the same concept as previous games (except the first [I]Witches' Legacy[/I]), which means that most of the puzzles are \"magical\" and make no real-world sense and deduction won't help you. As an example, in one puzzle you light a censer with flower oil, which stimulates a magical pyramid, which releases ... a necklace. Makes sense, right? ;)\n\nAlso unfortunately the story is as bad as any of the previous games, possibly worse. Remarkably there are practically no characters in this game, they are just one-dimensional props for the puzzles. Have the writers just given up entirely?","timestamp_created":1598984691,"timestamp_updated":1598984778,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwke66pfQCeuqYnwI="}
