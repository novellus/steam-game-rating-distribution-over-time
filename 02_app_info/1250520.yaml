      \ /><br>Once Upon A Time,<br><br>In a bustling town nestled between the mountains\
      \ and the sea, there lived a young girl who made bad decisions.<br><br>But aside\
      \ from her terrible luck and life choices, she was a kind and brave soul who\
      \ always tried her best to find the light, even in the midst of darkness.<br><br>One\
      \ fateful day, she saved the life of a mysterious old woman while crossing the\
      \ street. The woman turned to her with a knowing smile and in return for her\
      \ kindness, gifted her a book.<br><br>Unbeknownst to the girl, the woman she\
      \ saved was actually a powerful witch-- and the book she received was a magical\
      \ spellbook capable of making anyone whose name she writes inside its pages,\
      \ fall in love with her until the next full moon.<br><br>Our heroine took the\
      \ book, had a terrible day and went to the local pub to drown her sorrows with\
      \ a good drink...<br><br>.......and then she made a really, really bad decision.<br><br><img\

      \ /><br>Love Spell features a variety of game-based interactions to increase\
      \ the level of storytelling, such as:<br><br><strong>Nameable Heroine:</strong>\
      \ You can keep our MC\u2019s default name, Luna, or take the lead in the story\
      \ yourself with a custom name!<br> <br><strong> 4 Different Romantic Routes:</strong>\
      \ Each route in this story was written as a different literary genre featuring\
      \ a different guy! Whether your cup of tea is the drama involved in romancing\
      \ a childhood friend or a heart-racing adventure on an expedition with your\
      \ professor--or even more-- the choice is yours to make! The heroine herself\
      \ and her interests also differ slightly from story to story, so you\u2019ll\
      \ have to play all of the routes to experience the full picture!<br><br><strong>\
      \ Navigation System:</strong> Instead of manual save slots, our game uses a\
      \ &quot;Navigate&quot; feature which allows players to revisit previously unlocked\
      \ chapters in the story through an auto-save function. Interested in going back\
      \ to explore different choices in the story? No problem! With the navigation\
      \ feature, you can easily go back in time and change any choice-- the game will\
      \ record your new decision automatically. <br> <br><strong>HIS P.O.V Stories:</strong>\
      \ Each route features a special chapter where the story is told from your lover\u2019\
      s perspective. See the world and experience his feelings about you through his\
      \ very eyes!<br> <br><strong>Romantic CGs: </strong>In the more intimate moments\
      \ of your relationship, experience what his embrace feels like first hand with\
      \ beautiful CG illustrations. Note: There will be no explicit imagery in the\
      \ game.<br> <br><strong> User Choices: </strong>Take control of your destiny\
      \ by picking first hand what you say or do in the story-- but be careful, the\
      \ wrong choice could lead to a terrible fate!<br> <br><strong> Multiple Endings:</strong>\
      \ The Good, The Bad and The Epilogues can all be unraveled through your choices\
      \ in the story! Determine your own fate and decide on your own ending!<br><br><img\
