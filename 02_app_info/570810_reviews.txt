Excellent writing, good pacing, and superb price make this a must buy for an comedy or RPG fan.[/h1]\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9nUnSg9e8SE\n\nHoly CRAP. I can’t remember the last time a game, besides something Crankage Games cooked up, got me to laugh so hard I was crying. I wasn’t sure what to expect when I started up this game, but the meta ‘game within a game’ and then never taking itself seriously was amazing.\n\nYou start the game innocently enough, but it quickly becomes apparent that Ivy (you) is the only sane and logical character in a world FULL of badly written NPCs and horrible camera angles. Eventually you manage to get the upper hand on the world. I won’t spoil anything, but how you fix the airship is nothing short of genius, both in actual GOOD game design and comedy.\n\nThe main draw of this game is that you are a player PLAYING another game...an RPG Maker game that is filled with bad design choices, copy & pasted maps, and terribly written sections that smack of a developer that is too full of himself. But that’s just it...it’s SUPPOSED to come off as pretentious and full of itself! It ticks off all the boxes of a bad game, but does so in such a subversive and meaningful way, that you almost forget it’s a game poking FUN at those sorts of things, until you hit the punchline and just sit there in awe, holding your sides.\n\nParody games (and to an extent, games where you are self-aware) are delicate things to get right. Too obtuse, and no one will get the joke. Too blatant, and people find it boring and unfunny for ‘trying too hard’. I dunno what the developer, Kyle, was doing to come up with this masterpiece, but he struck gold. Easily one of the best RPG Maker games, and easily the best parody game I’ve ever played. By attacking the designs, and not the tropes, it’s a fresh take on what can be a stale topic.\n\n+Hilariously takes jabs at itself and other games for common ‘bad’ design choice\n+Doesn’t overstay its welcome, and plot moves along at an excellent pace\n+Every Inn’s name is a pun, and that’s just Inn-credible\n+Excellent price\n\n=Dragon Boss was somewhat difficult and annoying, taking several tries (and a dead Tonk) to finally down. Unsure if intentional or not. Clever girl\n\n-There was only ONE [i]Choose Thine Destiny[/i] book","timestamp_created":1546762274,"timestamp_updated":1548295385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.636126101016998291","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+pXmvugCfLrStwE="}
