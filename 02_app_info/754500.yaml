      \ /><br><br>In the game,  the executive branch consists of officials of the\
      \ federal and local levels. The governor is in charge of the state welfare,\
      \ the treasurer of finance, the prosecutor and the police of law and order,\
      \ the judges make decisions.<br><br>During the game, you\u2019ll see a simulation\
      \ of the real processes of passing laws at the region and the entire country\
      \ level. We tried thoroughly to simulate the political system of the United\
      \ States. Politicians will be sorting out significant issues of financing, taxation,\
      \ management, business, education, healthcare, migration, social programs and\
      \ other.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/754500/extras/office.png?t=1591608240\"\
      \ /><br><br>There is an opportunity to hire political lobbyists who will be\
      \ able to find some arguments to promote your law or an unfavorable law against\
      \ your competitors. On the one hand, you may sponsor the election campaigns\
      \ of politicians and they\u2019ll help you when you in need, you may collect\
      \ dirt on them and use the mass media to your advantage to not leave a chance\

      \ /><br><br>Necessary laws will open up new opportunities for you to increase\
      \ your wealth. Become a manipulator in political circles, increase your status\
      \ and make relationships with influential officials and politicians. The party\
      \ of Republicans and Democrats have different ideologies. So if you adopt the\
      \ policy of clan capitalism, the government will have less influence on the\
      \ regulation of market relations, therefore you will be able to get the support\
      \ of the Republicans.  <br><br>For instance, you can make a monopoly and lobby\
      \ through a law that reduces corporate taxes. But be careful, it can make a\
      \ federal budget deficit and the whole country will take up arms against you.\
      \ Greed is not always good! You must be able to find a balance between all the\
      \ parties and society levels so that your monopoly doesn\u2019t collapse like\
      \ a house of cards.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/754500/extras/plutocracy_time.jpg?t=1591608240\"\
      \ /><br><br>However, if you need bills of the democratic part such as reducing\
      \ unemployment, increasing wages and other stuff, then don\u2019t miss the opportunity\
      \ to lobby through the bill to sing and adopt it! Use politicians and officials\
      \ for your own goals! Will, you improve the well-being of the population or\
      \ will you only take care of your well-being? It\u2019s up to you!<br><br><img\

      \ /><br><br>Capture fields of strategically important resources in other countries\
      \ and provoke military conflicts through the Senate of the US Congress or the\
      \ White House.  Give a loan to the parties for the military conflict, break\
      \ down the economies of countries, create the financial crisis and coup d'etat\
      \ to buy cheap assets!<br><br>You can become the beneficiary of the most significant\
      \ historical events or just create your own alternative history without wars\
      \ and economic crisis. In the game, you can get used to the role of secret leaders\
      \ who was creating and influencing the history. Appoint politicians and heads\
      \ of states so that they unquestioningly carry out your orders.<br><br><img\

      \ Help an ambitious politician to become the minister of the country you need\

      \ /><br><br>If you want to play hard and dirty, you should use the agents of\
      \ influence who are your assistants in difficult situations.  There are more\
      \ than 36 unique characters, divided into 12 categories, whose hands you can\
      \ fight with competitors. Make political intrigues, hidden manipulative fraud\
      \ and win competitors!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/754500/extras/agent's_deck.jpg?t=1591608240\"\
      \ /><br><br>You have a huge set of tools: you can use force methods such as\
      \ arson and accidents, bank robberies and etc as well as you can use secret\
      \ and cunning methods: organize strikes and block production to competitors,\
      \ industrial espionage, influence the stock market, use the services of a journalist\
      \ and the mass media and so on. But be careful, every illegal action is strictly\
      \ punishable by the court of justice! Well, or make sure that the judge and\
      \ the state attorney are on your side\u2026<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/754500/extras/agents.png?t=1591608240\"\

      \ /><br><br>The game has something around 15,000 characters including shareholders,\
      \ officials, politicians who have their own interests, fears, ambitions and\
      \ other stuff that you can use to influence them. Just imagine a game world\
      \ in which all the characters interact with each other, buy shares, lobby their\
      \ interests, try improving their lives.<br><br>Organize routes (banquet hall)\
      \ and make meaningful relationships among influential people as well as give\
      \ gifts, help people realize their ambitions which in turn will help you get\
      \ access to huge resources. Every character can conceal a threat or access to\
      \ game resources down the line. Therefore, it is necessary for you to consciously\
      \ make friends!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/754500/extras/social_graph.png?t=1591608240\"\
      \ /><br><br>Keep in mind that every \u201Cresident\u201D is endowed with intellect\
      \ and knows how to behave and calculates what to do one step ahead. In addition,\
      \ he is also connected by the threads of friendship or enmity with other characters,\
      \ forming his unique network of contacts.<br><br>For example, if you improve\
      \ your relationship with a businessman who has two influential friends in the\
      \ Congress, then your relationship with those congressmen can become much easier\
      \ which will open up new opportunities later. On the other hand, you will have\
      \ the risk of starting a financial war with some &quot;oligarch&quot; and his\
      \ friends, if you stop getting along well with each other.<br><br><img src=\"\

      \ will go up! Don\u2019t forget to buy houses to get annual rent; cars, yachts\
      \ and planes are a measure of your luxurious life. Any property is a tool for\
      \ making relationships: if someone collects rare coins or paintings so as you,\

      \ system where you can leave a bequest to your heirs to go on playing for them!\
      \ If one of the heirs has analytical abilities and pragmatism, then you should\
      \ give a financial monopoly to him.  If you think that someone is suitable for\
      \ the position of Senator of the Congress, then you should take care of his\
      \ election campaign in advance.<br><br>Promote your relatives in official posts,\
      \ divide spheres of influence and appoint them as managers of your companies.\
      \ Build a clan network and capture all strategically important resources.<br><br>Be\

      \ /><br><br>Choose any of the 14 industries and take over the market. Destroy\
      \ competitors, be ruthless on the way to achieving your goals! You can develop\
      \ and improve the infrastructure of your companies because new technologies\
      \ increase income! Build new buildings, expand the plan and get higher dividends.\
      \ The game will give you the right to choose to be able to become economically\

      \ /><br><br>In the game,  the executive branch consists of officials of the\
      \ federal and local levels. The governor is in charge of the state welfare,\
      \ the treasurer of finance, the prosecutor and the police of law and order,\
      \ the judges make decisions.<br><br>During the game, you\u2019ll see a simulation\
      \ of the real processes of passing laws at the region and the entire country\
      \ level. We tried thoroughly to simulate the political system of the United\
      \ States. Politicians will be sorting out significant issues of financing, taxation,\
      \ management, business, education, healthcare, migration, social programs and\
      \ other.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/754500/extras/office.png?t=1591608240\"\
      \ /><br><br>There is an opportunity to hire political lobbyists who will be\
      \ able to find some arguments to promote your law or an unfavorable law against\
      \ your competitors. On the one hand, you may sponsor the election campaigns\
      \ of politicians and they\u2019ll help you when you in need, you may collect\
      \ dirt on them and use the mass media to your advantage to not leave a chance\
      \ to those who refused to be your puppets.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/754500/extras/negotiations.png?t=1591608240\"\

      \ /><br><br>Necessary laws will open up new opportunities for you to increase\
      \ your wealth. Become a manipulator in political circles, increase your status\
      \ and make relationships with influential officials and politicians. The party\
      \ of Republicans and Democrats have different ideologies. So if you adopt the\
      \ policy of clan capitalism, the government will have less influence on the\
      \ regulation of market relations, therefore you will be able to get the support\
      \ of the Republicans.  <br><br>For instance, you can make a monopoly and lobby\
      \ through a law that reduces corporate taxes. But be careful, it can make a\
      \ federal budget deficit and the whole country will take up arms against you.\
      \ Greed is not always good! You must be able to find a balance between all the\
      \ parties and society levels so that your monopoly doesn\u2019t collapse like\
      \ a house of cards.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/754500/extras/plutocracy_time.jpg?t=1591608240\"\
      \ /><br><br>However, if you need bills of the democratic part such as reducing\
      \ unemployment, increasing wages and other stuff, then don\u2019t miss the opportunity\
      \ to lobby through the bill to sing and adopt it! Use politicians and officials\
      \ for your own goals! Will, you improve the well-being of the population or\
      \ will you only take care of your well-being? It\u2019s up to you!<br><br><img\

      \ /><br><br>If you want to play hard and dirty, you should use the agents of\
      \ influence who are your assistants in difficult situations.  There are more\
      \ than 36 unique characters, divided into 12 categories, whose hands you can\
      \ fight with competitors. Make political intrigues, hidden manipulative fraud\

      \ and cunning methods: organize strikes and block production to competitors,\
      \ industrial espionage, influence the stock market, use the services of a journalist\
      \ and the mass media and so on. But be careful, every illegal action is strictly\
      \ punishable by the court of justice! Well, or make sure that the judge and\

      \ officials, politicians who have their own interests, fears, ambitions and\
      \ other stuff that you can use to influence them. Just imagine a game world\
      \ in which all the characters interact with each other, buy shares, lobby their\
      \ interests, try improving their lives.<br><br>Organize routes (banquet hall)\
      \ and make meaningful relationships among influential people as well as give\
      \ gifts, help people realize their ambitions which in turn will help you get\
      \ access to huge resources. Every character can conceal a threat or access to\
      \ game resources down the line. Therefore, it is necessary for you to consciously\
      \ make friends!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/754500/extras/social_graph.png?t=1591608240\"\
      \ /><br><br>Keep in mind that every \u201Cresident\u201D is endowed with intellect\
      \ and knows how to behave and calculates what to do one step ahead. In addition,\
      \ he is also connected by the threads of friendship or enmity with other characters,\
      \ forming his unique network of contacts.<br><br>For example, if you improve\
      \ your relationship with a businessman who has two influential friends in the\
      \ Congress, then your relationship with those congressmen can become much easier\
      \ which will open up new opportunities later. On the other hand, you will have\
      \ the risk of starting a financial war with some &quot;oligarch&quot; and his\
      \ friends, if you stop getting along well with each other.<br><br><img src=\"\
