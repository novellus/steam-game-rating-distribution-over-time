    review: "This review is based off of the full, paid-for version of the game, which\
      \ I definitely recommend. There are far less guys to date in the free version.\n\
      \nThis isn\u2019t your average romance sim. The guys that the player can romance\
      \ are \u2026 well, asocial and often antagonistic. I guess one could call this\
      \ a \u201Ctsundere\u201D fan sort of thing, [i]but[/i] I\u2019m going to explain\
      \ why that\u2019s not actually accurate. \n\nOne might be concerned that the\
      \ game is problematic. Why should the protagonist have to date guys who are\
      \ going to treat her poorly? Well, here\u2019s the thing: she\u2019s a jerk\
      \ too. She is definitely not a delicate flower who gets her feelings hurt easily.\
      \ I, too, am not a fan of stories in which a protagonist\u2019s role in the\
      \ story is to be a bandage for some bad boy who eventually changes. This story\
      \ actually isn\u2019t about changing anyone. That\u2019s why I argue that it\
      \ isn\u2019t truly \u201Ctsundere\u201D because that implies that the characters\
      \ change enough to become friendlier. They never do. They\u2019re as antagonistic\
      \ at the end of the game as they were in the beginning. The only difference\
      \ is that if the player dated them enough, they\u2019ve developed romantic feelings\
      \ for the protagonist. So, instead of getting the typical \u201Clet\u2019s change\
      \ this romantic interest for the better,\u201D the player gets to experience\
      \ what it\u2019s like to simply accept someone for who they are, flaws and all.\
      \ I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s no romantic value in the typical kind of\
      \ \u201Ctsundere\u201D story, but it was really refreshing to me to play a game\
      \ that\u2019s about acceptance rather than changing someone to better suit you.\
      \ At times when the protagonist does try to get the guys she dates to do something\
      \ they normally wouldn\u2019t, it\u2019s because they seem so unhappy about\
      \ the way they are. The guys never change, but they are more open-minded to\
      \ things. \n\nThis is technically spoilers, but I figure anyone interested in\
      \ the game might like to know what they\u2019re getting into. \n\n[b]The Six\
      \ Main Guys[/b]:\n\nEverett \u2013 Fashionista, hot-headed, curses a lot, selfish,\
      \ conceited, loves his mom a lot, best friends with Nate\n\nNate \u2013 Perfectionist,\
      \ overachiever, lawful, extremely high standards for everyone and himself, has\
      \ no chill, obsessed with independence, likes necklaces, best friends with Everett\
      \ \n\nShiloh \u2013 People pleaser, people manipulator, can never truly know\
      \ when he\u2019s being genuine, likes hats, eager to be with protagonist\n\n\
      Bae \u2013 Condescending and sarcastic almost constantly, a tad flamboyant,\
      \ obsessed with being more adult than his peers, cares about academics, adores\
      \ cute pajamas, has way too many pairs of glasses, likes children, calls everyone\
      \ by nicknames\n\nJeremy \u2013 Extremely cynical, nihilistic, a pushover, prevents\
      \ himself from having fun, a germophobe, skillful at fixing things and archery,\
      \ likes animated films, best friends with Pran\n\nPran \u2013 Often quiet, has\
      \ neglectful parents, has trust issues, believes there are no truly good people,\
      \ hates liars, stubborn af, likes drawing, friends with Jeremy\n\nThere are\
      \ also \u201Cside boyfriends\u201D but they don\u2019t have CGs or as much character\
      \ development. I was actually really disappointed that Lucas wasn\u2019t a main\
      \ guy, because I really liked his character. He doesn\u2019t know how to talk\
      \ to people, so he panics and ends up antagonizing people he actually wants\
      \ to be friends with. \n\u201CClique boyfriends\u201D don\u2019t even have character\
      \ art or personalities. They\u2019re literally just a bonus mechanism in the\
      \ game.\n\nAnother thing I enjoyed about the game was the humor. I think I might\u2019\
      ve laughed during this game more than any other, but it\u2019s difficult to\
      \ account for every game I\u2019ve ever played. It\u2019s definitely high in\
      \ the ranking though. The story definitely utilizes what\u2019s known as \u201C\
      schadenfreude,\u201D the universal term for humor derived from someone else\u2019\
      s misfortune. None of it is extreme though. It\u2019s usually just confusion,\
      \ minor embarrassment, and inconveniences, not actual harm to characters. \n\
      \nMinor complaints:\n[list]\n[*] No polyamory option. I would\u2019ve loved\
      \ it if one could have more than one boyfriend. \n[*] Kam\u2019s character was\
      \ boring, but that\u2019s just my perspective. \n[*] Clique boyfriends were\
      \ included in the Guy List, which makes the achievement \u201CThe Champion\u201D\
      \ extremely annoying to get unless you use the cheat code. \n[*] Why isn\u2019\
      t Lucas on the Guy List?\n[*] The protagonist complains about the guys\u2019\
      \ clothes way too much.\n[*] Too many typos, not enough proofreading. \n[/list]\n\
      \nBonuses:\n[list]\n[*] Queer representation, despite it being about a cis/hetero\
      \ female protagonist going after guys. Everett is bisexual and Bae is asexual.\
      \ Most of the other guys\u2019 sexual orientations are left ambiguous other\
      \ than they\u2019re attracted to women. \n[*] Racial diversity, as more than\
      \ half of the romanceable characters are non-white. The protagonist is also\
      \ non-white.\n[*] The questioning of social norms.\n[/list]\n\nI recommend this\
      \ game to anyone who wants an atypical romance sim experience."
