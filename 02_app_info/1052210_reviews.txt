[/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Who [/h1]\n\nBarney's Dream Cruise was published and developed by Gubbi Games. You may recognize this company from other such blockbuster titles such as: ...Barney's Dream Cruise....The Demo.\n\n[h1] What [/h1]\n\nis the game about? So you play as Barney, a broke-ass dude who has the hots for his neighbor, Donnie. However, he has competition in the form of Michael. An individual who has similar hole interests and is significantly financially better off. So what's a guy to do? Well, the obvious thing, obviously. Steal stuff and use your welfare check to frame the cock blocker so you can have a hassle free bee line to the bunny's hunny-hole.......wholesome....??  I gotta tell you...if the only way to get this bunny's attention is through money, then, you're doomed, buddy. You're broke. I mean, directly after the opening once you see you're living conditions, the screen should've faded to black which should've been followed by a gunshot sound and a game over screen with a smiley face. Not only that but he's a rabbit. Rabbits and foxes are natural hoars. If they wave at you congratulations; you just contracted about 15 different, new, and fun forms of herpisyphahepatitus. The lagomorph desire from this guy is so strong; you'd think he was a rejected Beastars character. Terminal diseases aside, this a dark humor point and click misadventure game.\n\n[h1] Where [/h1]\n\ndoes this game go wrong? It's point and click. This can be a chore. Even my favorite point and click was a cast-iron bitch because some sequences were a bit too cryptic and this game is no different. No shame in admitting that I used the walkthrough. No shame in my game. I'm not about to give myself a migraine on a game where my sole purpose is to play hop on pop with a rabbit.\n\n[h1] Why [/h1]\n\nYeah...why? Bitch, I dunno. It's kinda funny. It's not breathtaking but it may be worth a play. MAYBE. Personally, there are some jokes in this game that I really appreciated after the game was completed and I did some \"research\". I get it....I get it. \n\n[h1] How [/h1]\n\ndoes it fare? It will, sadly, become forgettable but I did enjoy it I'm not gonna lie. I don't think that this will be as widely appreciated as it should be especially when you consider the fact that quite a bit of the humor will probably be missed or completely rejected. \n\n[h1] Is [/h1]\n\nYeah, totally. I mean, the audience for this is niche, but luckily I qualify for that audience so bully for me. The typical point and click \"isms\" are here so you shouldn't be too disappointed. If you go with a very light disposition and open-mindedness I think you can have a bit of fun with this one. If not....well....I mean....you played a game about a dog sabotaging a fox (?) so he could bang a total sub dude rabbit.....yeah.....go ahead....critically analyse this, I'm sure you totally won't look like a douche. No seriously, your academia is critically needed.","timestamp_created":1606011603,"timestamp_updated":1606011603,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g4nw9vUCc5/lrwI="}
