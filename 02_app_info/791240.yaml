      platformer with vivid visuals and quirky characters. Play as Lumote a squishy
      bioluminescent creature on a quest to overthrow the Mastermote. Solve a world
      of puzzles by taking control of its inhabitants.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Lumote
      &amp; The Master Mote</strong></h2><br>Lumote is a tale of two opposing powers
      in a struggle for control. Blue power controlled by Lumote and red by the Mastermote.
      You play as Lumote, whose only abilities are to jump and to possess. You must
      take control of the world's inhabitants, the Motes, and use their abilities
      to progress. Depending on whose power controls a Mote, their behaviour will
      either help or hinder you on your journey into the depths as you search for
      the Mastermote.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>That's one big world!</strong></h2><br>The
      world of Lumote is a single massive environment containing six towers and fifty
      puzzles. Each tower marks your mastery of a specific Mote and unlocks a new
      set of puzzles to explore. Solve the puzzles to bathe the world in the blue
      light of Lumote and extinguish the red light of the Master Mote.<br><br><img

    detailed_description: <h1>Why can't you buy Lumote!?!? :(</h1><p>Hi there!<br><br>You
      may have noticed that Lumote is no longer for sale on Steam. We're currently
      working with a publisher to rerelease with some new content and improved performance.
      We intend for Lumote to be available again with a bunch of new stuff on PC along
      side a console launch in 2021. I can't give you any more details quite yet but
      there will be an announcement soon. Hopefully we'll be able to make a bigger
      splash releasing with more stuff on more platforms all at the same time!<br><br>Be
      sure to give us a wishlist and pop by our <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discord.gg/lumote"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"  >discord</a>and say hello!<br><br>If you really
      need Lumote in your life right now, try your hand at crochet! We've designed
      a pattern for everyone to make their own custom <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.luminawesome.com/lumote/Lumote%20Crochet%20Pattern.pdf"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"  >Lumote plushies</a>. You can ask for help on
      our discord as well if you get stuck.<br><br>Thanks for keeping tabs on us!<br><br>/
