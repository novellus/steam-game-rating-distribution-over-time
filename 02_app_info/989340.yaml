    review: 'The teleport mechanic is the core mechanic of this game, and unfortunately,
      it is very clunky and frustrating to use, especially when you have to teleport
      diagonally. And, well, you have to teleport most of the time in every level,
      the jumping mechanic is only secondary.

      In addition, there are some bugs, and the level design is perfectible. In some
      levels, there are "shortcuts", that I assume are not intended to be shortcuts,
      which enable you to skip most of the level. Also, some saws are poorly positioned
      (for instance, one right before the end of the last level), meaning that you
      have to perform an accurate teleportation ... which is, as I mentionned above,
      not easy due to the controls.

      That is why I cannot recommend this game in the end.'
