    short_description: Play as either Sir Edward, a noble Knight defending the Human
      Kingdom, or Krill, a wicked Necromancer with an unearthly lust for power! The
      Age of Fear series is a deep and complex turn-based strategy (full of humour!)
      that fuses a tabletop wargame with RPG elements.
