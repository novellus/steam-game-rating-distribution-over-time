While you can put together the gist of the story & background lore off of watching the cutscenes, having all the dialogue in the robot language keeps you somewhat disengaged & confused for as much time as the slow & unskippable cutscenes take place. The dialogue does translate to english (each of the robot language characters corresponds to a different letter of the English alphabet), however thats only if youre willing to take the time to manually decipher it yourself. The game having a mode to switch this would keep players a bit more interested & engaged for the cutscene time between puzzles.\n\nVery easy to 100%. Also, there is a 100% walkthrough in the guides section that does have the language translated if you wish to read along with that as you play.","timestamp_created":1604218609,"timestamp_updated":1604218609,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41qu4wfUCdvy/qwI="}
