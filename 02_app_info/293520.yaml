    about_the_game: "<strong>Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn</strong> is a first\
      \ person hunting simulator where you hunt the largest and most dangerous creatures\
      \ to ever exist \u2013 DINOSAURS. <br><br>This game is a sequel of the original\
      \ classic dinosaur hunting video game, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter. It\u2019\
      s an authentic hunting simulation where you track and stalk your prey. Careful\
      \ and thoughtful consideration must be taken during the hunt; to survive you'll\
      \ need to know your preys temperament and mannerisms, and just like in real\
      \ hunting, you need to be aware of your surroundings (you don't want to be caught\
      \ upwind of a T-Rex or you'll end being lunch). Remember you're not hunting\
      \ deer, you're hunting dinosaurs.<br><br>You\u2019ll visit huge, beautifully\
      \ rendered and realistic 3D environments, each with their own unique Eco systems.\
      \ There are pristine beaches, dense jungles, pine forests, muddy marshes, rocky\
      \ plains and deserts to explore. Environments can be used to increase the odds\
      \ of a successful hunt. Players can follow trails and track animal footprints.\
      \ Awareness of wind direction is important since some dinosaurs can smell you.\
      \ Using stealth and land elevation will give you a sound advantage over some\
      \ of the more vicious dinosaurs. <br><br>Choose between a high caliber rifle,\
      \ sniper rifle, a silent crossbow or tranquilizer gun, which puts your prey\
      \ to sleep instead of killing it. You can also carry sidearms. Some of your\
      \ equipment includes a handheld Gadget, which includes radar and GPS satellite\
      \ positioning to make tracking the beasts easier, Cover Scent which masks your\
      \ smell and numerous other goodies, which will prove indispensable for your\
      \ hunting adventure.<br>There is a wide variety of different dinosaurs to hunt\
      \ each with unique behaviors and intelligence. Every dinosaur in Carnivores\
      \ has realistic, advanced AI logic, so from species to species , each will react\
      \ differently to you. Some dinosaurs will flee if they see you, while others\
      \ will become enraged and attack. During your adventure you'll experience everything\
      \ from &quot;pea-brained&quot; dummies to cunning dinosaurs, with heightened\
      \ senses of sight, hearing and smell. So be careful and stalk your prey intelligently,\
      \ otherwise you might be the one being hunted.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>key\
