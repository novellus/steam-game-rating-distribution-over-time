Tense decisions with uncertain consequences in the future, interesting enough scenarios, and a cool AI that evaluates you between acts.\n\nThere is just one problem: It is so buggy that it is unplayable. I'll be trying to get a refund if it's still possible.\n\nWhen the AI grades you on your various characteristics, your stats can get trashed by you trying to survive the game's more difficult scenarios. I went from max altruism and such to 0 in all but one stat simply because of how many times I died trying different paths (that I normally wouldn't take) in a desperate attempt to survive with one of the characters. Alternate endings you can \"try for fun\" as suggested by the AI will also permanently affect your grade heavily. I felt baited and then punished for trying an alternate route I had avoided for good reason.\n\n\nBut that's not even the main problem. The game is filled with soft-locks and event-breaking bugs. Items and past events aren't remembered correctly, and when I got through those I ended up staring at a screen of a character's face after their chapter ended, unable to move on and staring down my only option of completely nuking my save data and starting over from scratch. The game is a few years old now, so while I will not say it's impossible that these issues will be fixed some day, I'm also not counting on it. \n\nI knew I took a risk when I picked up a game with no reviews. Well, consider the risk taken for you. Don't get this game. It's basically not playable in its current state, and that's a huge shame. I was very close to being heavily rewarded for being the first to break the ice on this one. \n\nIf the Developers still care about this game experience I'm happy to help pinpoint issues/get in contact.","timestamp_created":1602849172,"timestamp_updated":1602849948,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536817073822021484","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlqjTmPUCdt2XqAI="}
