    developer_response: I'd be more than happy to create a custom save for you to
      use to get you past whatever possible bug occurred.  I did test the boss and
      had no issue.  Other players have finished the game in its entirety so I really
      have no clue what could cause such a bug.

    review: "SIGH....\n\nI didn't want to write a negative review, but I'm going to\
      \ have to.  This game Haeven is a short little RPGmaker game, one with a lot\
      \ of custom assets built into it.  Custom assets that are all quite pretty.\
      \  It must have taken quite a bit of work to make.  \n\nThis game has a really\
      \ interesting concept, you are Cleril, a poet on a journey to reclaim your mind\
      \ from your subconscious.  The problem is the second mission of the game has\
      \ you heading to a neural center point, to put yourself into a coma.  My problem\
      \ with this is that soon after the coma begins there is a boss fight called\
      \ The Monster.  This fight I do not understand its purpose.  It is quite easy\
      \ to beat all the other parts of it, then the head just heals constantly.  The\
      \ head heals for around 8-10k damage a round while you can only do around 100.\
      \  I stopped caring at this point.\n\nNeedless to say I won't be coming back\
      \ to this, despite the spooky atmosphere that chilled me to the bone.  I'd write\
      \ more but I don't know how to elaborate here."
