The text below is only kept for archival purposes.\n\n(Also, this is pretty much the only thing the overhaul fixed, but this isn't the place to rant.)\n\n\n\n\n\n[quote=Me in early 2019][i]I really can't criticize the music. The other reviews are right, absolutely lovely. But what made me downvote this is the way the FLAC files are presented.\n\nIt is, carefully worded, a complete train wreck. It's not that track numbers are missing, no, they do exist. But they are all wrong, to the point where some tracks share a number. This is annoying, but can be sorted out easily, it it wouldn't be for something else:\n\nThe albums are incorrectly labeled, too. I can understand putting the base game OST and the AMPLIFIED OST in the same folder. I can even understand that you just put them on the same album. I can not understand how somebody managed to mess this up.\n\nExample? Sure, after downloading, have fun with your \"Chipped of the NecroDancer: AMPLIFIED\" OST. Except it has exactly one track (Voltzwaltz).\n\nI'm not saying you shouldn't buy this (when you're reading this, you made your decision most likely anyway), i'm just greatly annoyed that you have to sort everything yourself.[/i][/quote]","timestamp_created":1557825075,"timestamp_updated":1596403270,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl5jD2PMCfM6VwQE="}
