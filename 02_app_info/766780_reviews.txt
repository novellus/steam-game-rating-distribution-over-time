After my initial confusion, I bought it without hesitation - it was only 2 bucks.\n\nI loved Klax. I played it in the arcade back in the 90's and I had it for original Xbox on some game compilation. I remember being pretty good at it. I miss that game and this \"spiritual successor\" is a pretty faithful replication. \n\nIt is not super professional - besides resolution, I'm not sure if the graphics are really any better. I am slightly colorblind and have trouble seeing the difference between the green and the yellow, but that's not their fault. I feel like the tiles/board are a little too narrow.\n\nThe game plays very well with a controller.\n\nI thank the developers for making this available. I wish we had a real port or official update from whomever owns the rights nowadays but I am very thankful that this is here on the Steam store and very cheap. I definitely spent more thatn $2 on this game on a daily basis at the arcade back in Chicago.","timestamp_created":1588676595,"timestamp_updated":1588676595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ406Gg8vECevLbhQI="}
