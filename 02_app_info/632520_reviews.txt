I feel like the Tai Chi would be far better if I could figure out how to just do it for as long as I want.  I never get to a deep meditative state because it keeps interrupting me to give me a \"score\".  I don't do Tai Chi for a score, and this is a great way to enhance the focus of Tai Chi and help you get into it fast, but why not just let users \"go\" for 30-60 minutes if they want to?  It's a distraction that ruins the entire experience.  It seems like a massive lapse in a crazy simple option that just involves turning off features that harm the purpose.  I also wish they would set this up to do actual Tai Chi forms (maybe even multiple families like Yang and Chen).  This seems like a big missed opportunity.  I wouldn't recommend it yet, but it's the only Tai Chi VR available on Steam.  I hope they improve it... At the very least allow us to do it without time limits and remove the score.  Like fruit ninja \"Zen Mode\".","timestamp_created":1575217594,"timestamp_updated":1575217594,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw6Z+S4e4CeLLh4AE="}
