I was hoping maybe he'd decided to innovate for this one, but unfortunately this appears to be more of the same, but even worse.\n\nIn my short 10 minutes of playtime, my game crashed once, and got stuck on an infinite loading screen once.  Then when playing I only heard the first two pieces of dialog; the next one never triggered, and I was unable to get the trigger to load the next level working, meaning I was eternally stuck.  This happened in one of his previous games too.  I fixed it then by restarting the game, but given this was already my third attempt, I gave up.\n\nPass on this.  There are LOTS of better walking simulators out there.","timestamp_created":1610163705,"timestamp_updated":1610163705,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yorP8vYCf8XawQI="}
