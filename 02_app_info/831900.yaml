      \ mountain passes and pure highway sections based on real word laser scan data\
      \ from mobile and aerial scan systems. For the first time ever a game uses laser\
      \ scan data not only as base for modelling, but actually as part of the graphics\
      \ thanks to state of the art technologies that allows to render millions of\
      \ points in real time. The point cloud data combined with conventional polygonal\
      \ meshes and latest shading techniques provide the perfect environment for the\
      \ accurate yet fun focused vehicle physics.<br><br><strong>GAME MODES</strong><br><ul\
