Only a single ride, barebones functionality. I spent more time trying to figure out if I was missing something in the menus than actually enjoying the ride. My mom loved it but she loved playing with the basic oculus quest tutorial even more. Almost worth $3 but I'll never use it again. I wouldn't bother refunding if my expectations were set appropriately.","timestamp_created":1588798556,"timestamp_updated":1588798556,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9sDx9fECcNWGhgI="}
