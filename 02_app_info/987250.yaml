    review: "I just bought this game an hour ago. It comes with no instructions so\
      \ I lost 4 times before I found out how to build things and get people. Even\
      \ then finding out how to move those people into the buildings had to be found\
      \ out. How do you win at this game? Don't ask me. \nIn short I've played loads\
      \ of better games for free."
