The commentary  is very accurate but poor, the voice over is enough to make me reach for the volume and turn it down its very weary.\nThe form mechanics of the game feel realistic. If there was options to choose different voice tones that would be a big plus. However Horse racing games are limited for PC users  the people that produce these type of games are good at it.  its come a long way since the days of Stablemasters.\nI have experienced no crashes yet whilst playing this game.","timestamp_created":1608918696,"timestamp_updated":1608918696,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhODBzfYCe6CPvQI="}
