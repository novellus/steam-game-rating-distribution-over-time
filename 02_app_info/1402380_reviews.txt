It starts off pretty simple to get you used to the game, but they get a little bit harder each time. The puzzles are well thought out and I'm actually a little afraid for them to get harder lol. The game runs extremely smooth, not glitchy at all and is actually a ton of fun. There's some minor jump scares when you die, but for the most part you are figuring out puzzles. It's so much fun I decided to do a YT series on this and I can't wait to finish it. Definitely worth trying out for the price.","timestamp_created":1602218508,"timestamp_updated":1602218508,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666686534881592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7sfqhfUCdLPfpgI="}
