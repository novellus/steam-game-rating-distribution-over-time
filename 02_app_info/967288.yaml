    about_the_game: "The \xD6BB 1142\u2019s lineage dates back to the 1960s, when\
      \ a fleet of electric locomotives was built as an efficient answer to the challenging\
      \ S\xFCdbahn and its Semmering pass. In all, over 250 locomotives (classified\
      \ as the \xD6BB 1042) would be built over 14 years, making them an important\

    review: 'One of the best electric locomotives ever made for TS.

      I do love nicely detailed cab, and the realistic driving experience, even motor
      overload protection implemented.

      You need to watch for amperage, otherwise, when traction motors overloaded,
      the engine shuts off and needs to be restarted - like on real locomotives.


      Before to start driving it, read the manual first!'
