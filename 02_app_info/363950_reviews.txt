Colorful pallet/character design, with great music and quality controls. This game was made by one guy right? I'm impressed for sure. I just got finished with the desert/pyramid temple and am enjoying the crafting system for sure. I got this on same on both Switch/Steam within a few days of each other and it was well worth the price. I really hope there is a sequel to this game or some kind of additional game in the world it sets up. Being an RPG purist, I do wish I could've created my character - not to say I mind playing as a girl but it would've added a little more depth to the game, and yes, I know the creator wanted it to not be an stat driven RPG but I need to gain levels. I'm being asked to fight/kill a lot of beasts throughout this game and do think there should be more incentive to do so (even combat moves). \n\nThe combat system could use a little tweaking as it does kind of become uber simple, but that's ok by me. I see massive amounts of potential here in regards to combat, magic, heck even VR. The first person view leans itself towards that and wonder if motion controls could be implemented on Switch/Oculus/Mixed Reality VR. There potentially could be a multiplayer function here to journey with friends!\n\nOverall, it's worth your time - support small publishers/game creators and realize this is a labor of love. I've enjoyed it!","timestamp_created":1609213156,"timestamp_updated":1609213156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqoOl1vYCdqOpvgI="}
