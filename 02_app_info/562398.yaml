    about_the_game: "The distinctive and incredible GWR Large Prairies comes to Train\
      \ Simulator to fulfil a multitude of steam-era roles, courtesy of Partner Programme\
      \ developer Victory Works.<br><br>In general, a \u201CPrairie\u201D steam locomotive\
      \ is any that sits upon a 2-6-2 wheel arrangement, and particularly in tank\
      \ locomotive form proved a very popular design worldwide. On British soil, the\
      \ Southern Railway would be the only example of the \u201CBig Four\u201D to\
      \ not produce Prairie locomotives in its lifetime.<br><br>The Great Western\
      \ Railway however would dote on their 2-6-2T \u2018tank\u2019 locomotives for\
      \ secondary and more rural duties. Some of the earliest examples were rather\
      \ light, and were suitably called the \u2018Small Prairies\u2019; however, larger\
      \ variants would also be produced, primarily for suburban commuter operations\
      \ but initially for general use too. First appearing in 1903, these are the\
      \ \u2018Large Prairies\u2019.<br><br>The first of many Large Prairies appeared\
      \ in 1903 as GWR No. 99, a prototype design from Churchward that would become\
      \ the basis for a production fleet of 39 \u20183100 Class\u2019 tank locomotives.\
      \ At heart, the 3100 Class was a mixed-traffic locomotive, and would be the\
      \ start of a \u201Cworkhorse\u201D fleet for GWR and be found across the network\
      \ throughout their lifetimes.<br><br>Differences between the prototype and production\
      \ 3100s were next to none, only the tank shape was altered to improve visibility.\
      \ Naturally, changes were implemented over time to improve the class, including\
      \ altered weight distribution and a larger coal bunker; these changes warranted\
      \ a fleet-wide reclassification, and so was introduced the 5100 Class, as most\
      \ would now stay until withdrawal.<br><br>A handful of 5100 Class locomotives\
      \ received further modifications in the late 1930s and were once again given\
      \ new numbers. This move took place to bolster another fleet of Large Prairies,\
      \ a fleet which was introduced earlier in the decade and itself derived from\
      \ yet another production batch.<br><br>In the late 1920s, Churchward\u2019s\
      \ successor, Collett, sought to update the original 3100 Class design and have\
      \ a large fleet built to fulfil local, suburban passenger roles. In fact, it\
      \ was Collett\u2019s development that resulted in the 3100 Class becoming the\
      \ 5100 Class, all while a new batch of 5101 Class locomotives were produced\
      \ to the same standard. Whereas only 40 of the original were built, Swindon\
      \ Works would deliver 140 members of 5101 Class between 1929 and 1949.<br><br>Together,\
      \ the 5100s and 5101s dominated traffic in all corners of the Great Western\
      \ network, quickly growing and becoming a regular sight on all kinds of trains\
      \ right up the end of the Second World War. Post-conflict, a rise in road usage\
      \ and the introduction of diesel traction took its toll on the Large Prairies\u2019\
      \ duties, seeing them take on new life as mainline support engines; providing\
      \ backup as pilots and bankers on the more troublesome sections of the GWR such\
      \ as the South Devon Banks, or the Severn Tunnel.<br><br>While prolific, the\
      \ Large Prairies still only represent a portion of the entire fleet. A further\
      \ 70 locomotives are still to be accounted for. These come in the form of the\
      \ 6100 Class, another of Collett\u2019s finest and built specifically for commuter\
      \ services out of London Paddington.<br><br>The \u201CNetworkers\u201D of their\
      \ day, the 6100 Class was introduced in 1931 as a development of the 5101, and\
      \ was based at Old Oak Common, Slough, Reading, and elsewhere. Being prominent\
      \ in the passenger scene, enthusiasts quickly took to the class and nicknamed\
      \ them \u2018Tanner One-ers\u2019, a call to their 61xx numbering and some currency\
      \ of the day, a sixpence and a penny.<br><br>Much like the other Large Prairies\u2019\
      \ story, a future of diesel forced the 6100s into other positions, but not before\
      \ the fleet was joined by a previously mentioned extra batch of locomotives;\
      \ may the 5100 Class re-enter centre stage.<br><br>It was the 6100 fleet that\
      \ was reinforced by a modified micro fleet of 5100s; the latter was rebuilt\
      \ with smaller driving and pony truck wheels, and received a boiler pressure\
      \ increase (a common Large Prairie modification). 10 rebuilt 5100 Class locomotives\
      \ were renumbered into the 8100 Class, and were destined to work alongside the\
      \ 6100s, supposedly providing extra acceleration characteristics owing to their\
      \ smaller wheels.<br><br>All GWR Large Prairie locomotives survived until the\
      \ end of steam, by which point many of them were still in good shape, despite\
      \ the oldest examples working beyond their 6th decade. Unfortunately, very few\
      \ avoided the cutters\u2019 torch after the steam-era\u2019s final chapter.\
      \ None of the 5100 or 8100 made it into the epilogue, it was a spot only reserved\
      \ for 10 5101s and a lone 6100. Even then, only 4 out of the 11 are operational.\
      \ Well, technically 5 see heritage service, but one was rebuilt into a 4300\
      \ Class tender locomotive. The rest are awaiting overhaul, apart from 6106 which\
      \ is on static display at Didcot.<br><br>Fantastically, Victory Works has translated\
      \ the GWR Large Prairies into Train Simulator, and the pack contains a bumper\
      \ collection which Includes the 5100, 5101, 6100 and 8100 classes in GWR Green\

    review: Another glittering package from Pete and the team at Victory Works. Wonderful
      large GWR Prairies that complement my stable of the small ones, in 4 different
      Classes in both GWR Green and BR Black, and along with a plethora of mixed freight
      wagons, including a Tunnel Inspection Van and a Herring Hopper freight wagon,
      which we haven't had released before in the game, it's yet another top quality
      pack to keep us entertained on our numerous Great Western routes, highly recommended.
