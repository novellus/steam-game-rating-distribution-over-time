This is stealth game with the ability to play together on one screen. Topics - spies, thieves, theft, mission impossible - all this. There are all sorts of red ray cameras, security guards. There are quite a few tasks, and the gameplay is varied and interesting - it seemed to me so. I have nothing more to say, for that small fee I am very pleased. Many thanks to the developer, I want more similar games. Maybe about the ninja. There are few such stealth games.","timestamp_created":1598527755,"timestamp_updated":1598527755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r7rrl/QCcOaMngI="}
