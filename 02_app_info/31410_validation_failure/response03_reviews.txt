Graphics surprisingly is servicable but of course not top quality. The premise of the game is simple. Basically just drive a car from a forced top-view perspective and ram zombies. \n\nThe gameplay is simple but the forced perspective feels stifling and the lack of a minimap to show your objectives or nearby healthpacks / ammo is just unforgivable. Had the game implemented a complete freeform view with a solid minimap, it would've scored much higher.\n\nOverall Rating: 3 / 10\nNot worth to buy even if its on sale. Its only good for a couple of minutes of time wasting. Don't bother with this game unless you have absolutely nothing to play.","timestamp_created":1342713659,"timestamp_updated":1591406121,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gsrMw/ICcPr3Dg=="}
