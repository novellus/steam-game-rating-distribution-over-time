    about_the_game: 'You are the Dragon Commander. Your mission it is to reunite a
      broken empire and become the new emperor.  Success depends entirely on your
      ability to efficiently rule your empire, build invincible armies and lead them
      to victory. Your secret weapons: your tactical insights, your leadership skills
      and your ability to turn yourself into a dragon. <br>Dragon Commander is not
      just any strategy game - it seamlessly blends real-time strategy gameplay with
      turn-based campaigning, role-playing an ascending emperor and controlling a
      formidable dragon.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Real
      time strategy: Command your sea, land and air forces in real-time. Combined
      operations and knowing where and when to hit are crucial elements of any victory.
      <br></li><li>Dragon Combat: During real time strategy mode, you can turn into
      a dragon to support your troops in combat and obliterate the enemy using your
      formidable dragon powers.<br></li><li>Turn based campaign: Direct your conquest
      on the turn-based world map; plan several moves ahead, build formidable armies
      and invest in the right technology or magic upgrades.<br></li><li>Rule your
      empire: You are the emperor and you make the decisions! But beware, political
      balance is easily upset. Each game is different and you''ll find that a Dragon
      Commander needs to make really tough decisions. Feel the effects of your decisions
      on the battlefield as the war progresses.<br></li><li>Single-player, multiplayer
      and co-op modes: Play the single player story-driven campaign or test your mettle
      against other Dragon Knights, online or local via LAN. Start your own multiplayer
      campaign with or against a friend. Or duke it out on a skirmish map.</li></ul>'

    review: '[u][b]It has interesting ideas that fails to reach their full potential.[/u][/b]

      It has bits and pieces here of the various genres it tries to implement, but
      without the polish that each one needs to make it all worthwhile.  This could
      be good, but it needs a lot more work before I''d recommend it to anyone.


      The real time strategy is spamming units, and luring the enemy AI into throwing
      their fleet into your larger mesh.  Units move and die for too quickly for precise
      usage of the more utility units to be viable.  This might change later in the
      game, but unit diversity mattered little compared to sheer unit size.  A Hunter
      that''s strong against a Trooper gets dunked by the 1:3 Hunter:Trooper ratio
      you can spawn them at.  When it''s just a few units against another few you
      can get an inkling of how this balance might''ve mattered, but the strategy
      isn''t there for it to be engaging.


      The turn based part is superficial; the units you initially have decide what
      you start with, but they''re not anymore powerful than units you spam during
      the real-time aspect.  It''s more about allowing you to invade and defend territories
      you control.  Despite this part deciding the real-time stage''s initial conditions
      you can win even if you''re against overwhelming odds.  Not due to superior
      strategy of positioning, understanding the game''s mechanics on a deeper level,
      or terrain utilization.  But because you can turtle it out until you can build
      a mega blob to steamroll to victory.


      The empire ruling was interesting initially, but after 4 choices it''s pretty
      obvious that there are certain choices that''re explicitly better; 4/4 times
      the choice does a +3/+2 faction support increase/decrease with no other benefit
      to balance out the +2 side, no neutral opinions, or benefits from your decisions
      that''d later affect gameplay and/or unit mechanics.  It should tie more directly
      into how your empire actually works, that the player can feel their choices
      mattered more than a single moment.  In the end  this results in the characters,
      and by extension the developers, feeling like they''re talking down to us about
      what is right way an empire should be.  Instead of letting the players be free
      to shape the empire to their liking.


      At a glance - areas for improvement:

      Real-Time

      - A breather moment to allow the player to see the field of play and plan out
      how they''re going to approach it.  As it is now, while I survey the field the
      enemy is spamming units, even in my home territory.

      - Make terrain matter more in how it affects troop movement and bonuses against
      each other

      - Slow down the building, spamming, and overall combat speed such that unit
      abilities can actually be used


      Empire Turn

      - Government decisions affecting the empire as a whole; equal pay means a greater
      reduction of troop funds from the treasury, or gay marriage reducing population
      growth, etc

      - More in-depth resource management and racial uniqueness in terms of benefits;
      special unit access, special building access, etc'
