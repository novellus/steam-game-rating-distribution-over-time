Yes, the graphics are a bit wonky, but they're hiding a huge amount of depth. The first time I had to fight two wolves at once... man, it was more exciting and mechanically complex than you would expect from a game that looks like this. \n\nI don't know anything about Alaska, but this game paints a thoughtful and nuanced picture of the people and environment. Honestly, this game is probably worth the small price tag just for that. \n\nI usually don't think there's anything terribly important about the whole \"solo dev\" thing, but Wyatt White (the creator of the game) clearly had a singular vision for what he wanted this game to achieve, and I think he was largely successful.","timestamp_created":1571674735,"timestamp_updated":1571674735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4majH9+0Cccq/1AE="}
