      \ />_____<br><br>You are a freelance adventurer who wants to experience everything\
      \ planet Heart has to offer, regardless of the inherited privileges determined\
      \ by the country of your birth.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The current Heart. Papers.\
      \ Border. build is in Early Access because it is an Early Alpha build featuring\
      \ enough core mechanics and content to let you, awesome players, help us develop\
      \ the best possible game from this concept!</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Concept</h2>You\
      \ travel to learn, and as you pay a closer attention to what each country has\
      \ to offer, you gather wisdom that you channel in a blog that grows in popularity.\
      \ Eventually you come to grasp the power of your influence: where you pass,\
      \ things change faster to the better, and locals that you have met increasingly\
      \ demand openness from their governments. You have always been an optimist and\
      \ dreamed of a completely border free world, but as you travel, you realize\
      \ your influence into actually living to see your dream come true - that of\
      \ living in a world without borders!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Visuals</h2>Heart.\
      \ Papers. Border. is inspired by NASA's Visions of the Future posters, The Jetsons'\
      \ cartoon series and current real life events. We chose vibrant colors and a\
      \ retro futuristic style to gently remind you that Heart, just like Earth, is\
      \ moving towards openness, kindness and love, even though the movement might\
      \ sometimes seem too slow to notice. But you can always make a difference!<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Heart. Papers. Border. is as easy or as challenging\
      \ as you want it to be. Through very simple control mechanics and up front information,\
      \ you can strategize an optimal life that allows you to see the last border\
      \ disappear in the course of your long and safe life. With multiple win conditions,\
      \ challenging puzzles and morally difficult quests, Heart. Papers. Border. simply\
      \ asks you how do you choose to live this virtual life<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">So\
      \ how will you play?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Create your Multipass and choose\
      \ your Citizenship (Easy, Med, High, Random); this determines your starting\
