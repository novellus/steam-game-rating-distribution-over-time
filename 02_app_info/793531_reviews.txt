First off, the balloon accessory is a solid, stationary object with no jiggle bones, so no there is no reaction to movement. \n\nThe storm cloud and rainbow accessories are animated. Rain drops fall down with the cloud and the rainbow has an aura glow effect with a few animated sparkles thrown in.\n\nBiggest selling point in the pack might be the food items, the animated accessories (mentioned above), the ninja weapons, and the legwarmers. Price is a bit much for the value, but it's worth it if at a discount.","timestamp_created":1520878743,"timestamp_updated":1520878743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.663918077945709229","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43f3bjeICfLrDmwE="}
