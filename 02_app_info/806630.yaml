    review: While you could just rip the songs from the game files, and is what I'd
      honestly normally do if I wanted the songs themselves since it's as simple as
      finding the music folder for most games; this is honestly the one time I've
      decided to buy the songs from the developer. The novels and storytelling are
      too good to let talent like this continue to be unrecognized and go to waste.
      Like most said, the songs are good, but you buy this to support HCP to make
      more novels, or make the one's they're working on even better. I wish I had
      known that they were publishing new IP's and were working on an extended edition
      back in 18/19, as it really does irk me that I could've been supporting these
      guys two years ago. I can chip in with at least this, though.
