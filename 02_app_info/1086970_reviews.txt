(fuck the stunning btw) This health system is especially useful when later in the game you're guaranteed to get hit and the only thing thats conductive to survival is KILLING THE FUCK OUT OF EVERYTHING AROUND YOU 24/7.\n\nI like the look of a lot of the enemies in this one more, as well as it actually having unique bosses which are pretty fun fights and with cool designs. More enemy types as well.\n\nNo more ammo, your primary is pretty much just free to fire constantly. Your secondary generally has a cooldown and can only be used a couple times before waiting for more charges. But this way makes the combat in-game a lot better imo even if I find the weapons in this one lacking. Additionally weapons are now unlockable and chosen prior to levels which go on until the very end without shopping in-between waves.\n\nI think the soundtrack in this one is better, personally that is. They both have great sound tracks though just very repetitive as the levels drag on.\n\n[b]What the first game does better than this one:[/b]\n\nI would like to personally speak with the dev and have an insight into what the FUCK crack rocks he was smoking while developing this. Im sorry but genuinely some of the most blaring, lazy, and just BAD game design ruins a pretty core part of the game. \n\nWhats that you ask? The fucking slot machines, whats money even used for in this game? IDK at the end of levels you have to watch a WAY WAY too long animation of a stock unity store truck asset sucking money out of you while you're replaying the last animations you had the whole time (including firing weapons). You can hold m1 to speed it up, but its still an easy like 30 god damn seconds at the end of each level for MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.\n\nThe ONLY way to unlock weapons in this one is via these slot machines, and you have to get lucky and roll all 3 of the same symbol. These are literally the most disgusting slot machine models ive ever seen holy shit why couldnt you have just drawn and animated something yourself. But this means that you can go fucking forever without having any new weapons, theres probably still weapons I havent found yet but I cant be bothered. On top of these random weapons, literally like half the ones I tried are dumpster fire trash. The only good ones are the ak/flamethrower with the big laser zap microwave gun thing. Everything else sucks MASSIVELY and is just unfun to use. Seriously go fuck yourself I see why you didnt model Lizas weapons on her BECAUSE YOU DIDNT EXPECT THE PLAYER TO EVER FUCKING GET THEM OR ACTUALLY USE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE SO GARBAGE.\n\nOh yeah 99% of the time from those slot machines? You get a random, colorless, low poly unity store asset. Collect all 71 to 100% the game. Not only that but you can get the same ones multiple times, AND for SOME reason they put these as physics objects in the helicopter area you select missions. I wonder if its possible to lag the fuck out and perma crash a save with all the physics shit spazzing out if you sell your soul to this game long enough. The dev literally put more effort into the achievement descriptions than this entire system. Actual garbage and kind of ruins everything outside the actual core gameplay but even then your weapon choices are at the mercy of RNG. \n\nAdditionally, this game is bugged as fuck. DONT hold down fire for either weapon while doing melee dashes (which suck shit) or your gun gets stuck perma firing in the last direction you had it until you spam click it unstuck. ESPECIALLY annoying with secondaries.\n\nYeah the melee dashes suck ass too, its some literal dark souls 1 directional rolling mechanics. You dash in the direction you move, which is harder to do in a sea of enemies rather than just flicking your mouse really quick. Theres like no stamina bar or indicator on when you can dash, you just can do it sometimes and sometimes you'll end up dashing like 2 or 3 times back to back which is weird as hell. On top of having a distinct lack of iframes at the end of dashes with the inability to tell when/how many dashes you have often ends up getting you stuck in enemies. But once again, hp is easier to get in this one.\n\nMy last complaint is probably the way this game tries to prevent you getting surrounded and 1 shot with no hope, basically when your hp is low enough it seems getting hit will knock you in the air, usually iframes cover you until you land and can quickly kill enemies to heal. BUT, and ESPECIALLY in the later levels where you have next to no breathing room. You'll get bounced up in the air, only to land back in the middle of enemies who then get 100% free hits on you as you're stuck in a stupid animation meant to save you. My only deaths in this game came from this happening because as long as you can shoot stuff, you wont die. IT IS HELPFUL sometimes and is preferable to just being 1 shot by getting surrounded since you spend 99% of the game surrounded. Just this is the most frustrating and out of your control way to die is when this system breaks.\n\nI am not kidding dev, you are an absolute god damn bonafide clown and I want you to make a third of these games with just the good bits and not the bad. I will buy. im sorry no h8.\n\n10/10 I love it and you.","timestamp_created":1604248589,"timestamp_updated":1604330388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.369451820850372314","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwot/ixPUCf5jMqwI="}
