I bought this game on sale for $2.49 since I figured I might as well take a chance for such a low price. I mean I buy 2 chimichangas at the 7-11 for the same price and that's as much as a gamble as this.\n\nBoy was I wrong! At least the Chimichangas at 7-11 are usually good. This game is just bad, bad, bad. I can't find too many nice things to say about it. It's got almost free locomotion! That's good. You can't turn, that's bad. The guns are pretty accurate, that's also good. The enemy AI is bad. There's more than one gun, I think there's 4-5 total. That's good sort of. I think there's only 2 enemy types (and a dragon apparently that I have yet to see), that's really bad. There was an attempt at a story. There's some nice looking scenes sort of. Everything else is not good. This game is a mess.\n\nSo you start out and the tutorial consists of some text graphics. Very basic information about what the buttons do. Then you're left to your own devices. Well, it took me a while to figure out that your'e supposed to go to the trading post and then stand on the light, press A (Oculus Rift) and then select the quest and press A again to activate the quest. \n\nSo you go to this dark corridor. Your flashlight on your gun barely illuminates anything. Your gun overheats quickly. That's okay because the zombie AI is dumb and they walk slowly towards you and you can easily just backtrack. Just keep shooting, they are quite the bullet sponges. Sometimes they drop stuff. You pick it up. You find this object. You click activate again, and voila the first quest is done. \n\nWell, that wasn't that bad. What are all the negative reviews about? Well, rinse and repeat the above about 4 more times before you see a different area. Then guess what? You go back to the same area you started in. Just slowly kill stuff. More zombies. Walking slowly. Shoot once, shoot twice, three times, maybe on the fourth they die. Repeat over and over and over again. \n\nSo this clunky quest system repeats itself. There's a store. You can buy and sell stuff. Not sure that any of it matters and most things drop anyways. There's upgrades. I never figured out how to upgrade my weapons. If anybody knows, please let me know. In any event, this game is not worth buying. If it was free, I would give a tepid recommendation.\n\nRate 4/10. Recommended for those who love to backtrack in games, like clipping issues, and obtuse UI/quest/tutorials.
