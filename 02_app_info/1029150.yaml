    review: "??? Uh... I feel like this one is misunderstood. And I say that based\
      \ on the other few reviews I'm seeing so far on steam. First, I will guess that\
      \ people who reviewed didn't like (or don't like anymore now that they're adults)\
      \ so much power rangers or super sentai series. That's not my case. I still\
      \ enjoy them from time to time and just to be clear... this whole title is one\
      \ BIG reference to those series that includes a LOT of fans-services. \n\nSo\
      \ of course the writing is childish, of course it is cliche and of course it\
      \ goes a little everywhere in order to make enough references (teenagers with\
      \ attitude and stuff) to the whole genre. So yes in this way it DOES indeed\
      \ fulfill its job admirably.\n\nThe thing I will criticize is the pacing. It\
      \ kinds of slow down every chapter due to the episodic format and it does break\
      \ the immersion a bit. Some passage do fill a litlle rushed or blank but the\
      \ vast majority of the work is a proof of love to the super sentai hero genre.\n\
      \nIf you're searching something logic or mature here you're just missing the\
      \ whole point (the whole point being you're a chosen one even though that part\
      \ is actually explained \"scientifically\" lol) ! But then, the story HAS its\
      \ own amount of plot twists and progressively become more mature and dark near\
      \ the end.\n\nI had a blast with it even though there are some flaws obviously.\
      \ But please just don't go and misjudge the thing just because you didn't understood\
      \ it was based on a very specific genre. The description of the work does not\
      \ hide it and nothing justify criticizing the genre here."
