This one was no different! From beginning to end there's all 3 of those things. The ending of the film had my jaw on the floor and I loved every second of it. Doomhead is one of the most menacing villains I've ever seen in a horror film and even he made my skin crawl with his crooked smile and switchblades. Though, the only problems with the film I had was that I really wanted more backstory behind the people who were running 31 and how they got those people to agree to be part of the game. Also some of the scenes could have been shot a little better. The chainsaw fight was extremely shakey and it was hard to tell who got hurt or who was swinging until the scene was over. \n\nAside from that, I did enjoy the film! If you like Rob Zombie's work then I highly recommend it!","timestamp_created":1481437132,"timestamp_updated":1481437132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536821663379669189","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzpai9tgCdIj8aw=="}
