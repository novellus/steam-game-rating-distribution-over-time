Horror movies don't often rely more heavily on cliches than this one, so if \"don't watch it\" isn't clear enough, I'll try to explain why it's not worth your time, and certainly not worth your money. \n\nThe film opens with a few sequences to establish what every teen-centric horror movie feels it must have: A group of teens who are repugnant at every imaginable level (your stoner stereotype, your misogynist jerk stereotype, your annoying younger hellraiser stereotype, and so on) comprise the forgettable cast whose role is basically to line up in order and die obligingly, and the filmmakes do their level best to be certain that you will dislike them all just enough that you won't lament their passing. In this, at least, they are successful. If the characters aren't cliche enough for you, the typical \"asylum with a dark past\" setting is played for every tired note they could come up with, and the worst part is it's played entirely straight, with no sense of self-awareness of just how worn out these tropes are. \n\nSo, you have the setting you don't care about, the characters you don't care about, and then there is the general ineptitude surrounding handling of the camera and lighting. Horror Movie 101 tells us that horror movies take place at night, to make monsters harder to see, the scares scarier, the characters more vulnerable, and so on. This movie takes place almost entirely in well-lit rooms, during daylight hours (which is not typically when one holds a drug-fueled rave), and this takes a considerable amount of the edge off. A horror movie taking place in daylight might otherwise have been interesting, but, sadly, they don't really do anything with this, and it comes off feeling more like these people couldn't figure out how to shoot at night. Add to this the poor camera handling (shaky cam, odd angles, too many out-of-focus shots, and so on) and you have a recipe for disaster. \n\nWorst of all, this movie tries to pull what our friend M. Night seems to have made necessary in all horror movies: The twist ending. Without spoiling, I will say that if you didn't see this twist coming after the first half hour, then you've either never seen a horror film before, or you're much too young to be watching this movie. Your expectations aside, the twist largely falls flat, not least because there is no work done to make you care about these characters or what is happening to them. \n\nI suppose it's worth noting that there is also nothing in this film that is even remotely scary. They rely so heavily on images, plot points, stylized renderings of frames from and what I suspect is an actual audio clip from The Exorcist that this movie feels like a low-budget modern remake that couldn't get the rights to the actual source material. Don't expect anything at all frightening to happen in this movie that is two parts deranged high school party, and one part exorcism-mystery. \n\nThe short version is that this film isn't worth your time, your money, and manages to be exceptionally bad even in an era when we are churning out enough bad horror films to run back to back from now until the endtimes!","timestamp_created":1475032073,"timestamp_updated":1475032073,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.700904965400695801","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4suiwt9cCfMaVYg=="}
