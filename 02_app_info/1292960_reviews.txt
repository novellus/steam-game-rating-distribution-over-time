It's a bit short, but I don't personally mind that given the price. The only real criticism that I have gameplay wise is that you cannot grab objects that are not on the bottom of the screen yet. Forcing you to remember where it all is as you search for specific items first. I just find that an odd choice. \n\nAnd aside from that the UI is really obnoxiously huge. It distracts away from the really nice artwork. Especially the home button. I assume they're made this way for children, but at least giving an option would be nice. I'd rather a collapsable menu that shows everything to find rather than just 5 at a time. But that's more a personal preference I suppose.\n\nOh, and more of an issue is that some of the icons do not accurately reflect the object within the game itself. There's a bike horn for instance, in the image itself it's elongated and looks like a bike horn. In the circle that requests it, it looks almost identical to a pawn chess piece that the same level can ask you to find, just turned on it's side. There are quite a few instances of clicking on something that doesn't really look like the image that it pairs to.\n\nAnd I don't want to be mean to the narrator actress, but it's a bit rough. The acting itself I wouldn't mind as much if the audio quality itself wasn't terrible. I usually don't even notice these things since I don't even have an audio setup. It's just really poor quality. \n\nThe game is pretty easy / liberal on hints. There's just a minor cooldown and the hint itself is literally just a reveal of where the object is. That's not really a negative or positive to me, just something of note. In spite of a few minor issues and nit picks, I think it's a neat little hidden object game. And well worth the incredibly low price.","timestamp_created":1589677842,"timestamp_updated":1589677842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593931257724761963","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5duLkPICdKmiiAI="}
