I did enjoy the crazy humour. It is NOT subtle, you can clearly see author's sympathies - but it's not too blunt to enjoy either.

Overall, I did like it!","timestamp_created":1608250195,"timestamp_updated":1608250195,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w8/LufYCfZCIuwI="}
