I want to like this game but to many frustrations Not to mention so levels with toatly random worms floating around ??? thats not a Puzzle or stategy to that it is just messy and confusing for no reason??? I have even looked up how to beat some of the levels I could not beat but what I saw in vids never ever worked for me no matter what I tried or how fast. even got to the point where I was almost winning but still lost. WOULD REALLY like to now how this game is suppose to work. what allows you exactly to have a take over ??? Cuz it never fucking teaches you that ????","timestamp_created":1489141681,"timestamp_updated":1489141681,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529423415660858154","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ttnw29oCe5+HdA=="}
