I've played this for 50h+ with my kids and had such a great time of it. While it has a little learning curve to it, due to many controls and unusual interface, it's still extremely simple to get started with. Between digging, light gravity maneuvers, and portals, it has some complexity to it as well. \n\nIt contains some really novel ideas, which makes this game stand out. For example, \"Sudden Death\" after one player is out, makes the waiting really short for the dead player.\n\nSingle player is only there for something to do when waiting for the other players. So, don't get your hopes up on that. Aim for multiplayer.\n\nIt has some likeness to Liero, which is a great game, though Liero is bit dated in terms of usability compared to Chaos Caves. \nChaos Caves has support for more players and hand controls, but less variety in guns and mods than Liero, due to that games large amount of user-created enhancements.\n\nThere are some UX tweaks needed to make it a bit easier to use, and it would be sweet with an update and some new content but, it's totally playable and recommended, as is.","timestamp_created":1608144556,"timestamp_updated":1608144761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ira5tvYCcpPiugI="}
