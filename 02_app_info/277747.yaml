    review: "now before you start killing the dislike button i do cons first so if\
      \ you want to see pros go down. i really like metrolink a lot  and it has my\
      \ favorite engine the f59ph and it has it this dlc is very good. cons-  though\
      \ one thing i would like is maybe ad the rotem cars in and the mp36,f125 or\
      \ the f59phi because theese engines/cars are ones you should add though that\
      \ is ok if you don't. antother thing is that the passenger cars don't have the\
      \ same pattern as real life.\n\npros-the engine is great\nthe lights work\n\
      the interior is good looking\nit has a bell and horn\nthe ditch lights flash\
      \ when i blow the horn\nthe engine exterior is very detailed\nthe scenarios\
      \ are correct on the route as they are in real life (not going to san diego)\n\
      the bombadier car's shape is good\nthe inside of the cars is accurate\nthe cab\
      \ car is correct \nhorns sound great.\nin the scenarios you include the amtrak\
      \ trains going by.\n\nsuggestions-\nmaybe add the rotem cars\nadd the mp36/f125/f59phi\n\
      redo the paint for the train cars\nadd rotem paint to the engines\nmaybe add\
      \ inland empire (riverside,san bernadino,perris not france,lancaster,)\n\nthat\
      \ is all so i really like this DLC and i recomend it with some suggestions along\
      \ side it so i hope this was helpfull for you guys!"
