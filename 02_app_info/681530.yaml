    review: "Before going into specifics about the game, I'd like to point out something\
      \ about my experience with the game which I regard as very important to point\
      \ out: At this time, the game does not convey some rather important information.\
      \ Trying to look for answers to questions in the Steam discussions wouldn't\
      \ lead anywhere most of the time. I was becoming quite desperate until I coincidentally\
      \ became aware of the existence of a Noisz Discord server and found the invite\
      \ link in the Noisz news here: https://store.steampowered.com/newshub/app/681530/view/4039122238476742084.\
      \ If you want to get into the game, I highly recommend joining it as it is the\
      \ best source of information at this time thanks to dedicated players in it.\
      \ I would also recommend the devs to invite players more aggressively to it.\
      \ Had I not found out about it (by accident), I'd certainly still be desperate\
      \ for a lot of basic info at this time!\n\nNoisz is a bullet hell shmup and\
      \ rhythm game hybrid, though I'd say that the former genre has a stronger presence.\
      \ The game doesn't feature stages but instead it consists of bosses only with\
      \ individual songs. The significance of the music is that the boss's patterns\
      \ are designed after the song and you can only shoot or activate your shield\
      \ to absorb light blue bullets and become immune to light blue lasers in the\
      \ rhythm of the song. You can choose between different styles and the equipped\
      \ core to make use of their properties or abilities. They're very powerful and\
      \ the right combination can make achieving whatever goal you have much easier.\n\
      \nMost of your experience will revolve around this gameplay concept and Free\
      \ Mode lets you play any song on any difficulty at any time. However, there's\
      \ also the Story mode which is a Visual Novel where you fight said bosses very\
      \ frequently. Now, I don't have much to say about the story itself as I've barely\
      \ read it and will most likely not do so in the future either (you can skip\
      \ through text with the shield button). However, it is a significant part of\
      \ the game regardless as the bosses you encounter will depend on the choices\
      \ you make throughout the VN. Playing this mode is mandatory if you want to\
      \ experience the full game as certain songs and styles/cores are locked behind\
      \ it. \n\nWhatever difficulty you chose to play Story mode on: if you play for\
      \ the first time, I wouldn't recommend playing on hardcore mode. On Hardcore\
      \ mode you only have a limited amount of credits. Credits are used if you fail\
      \ and need to restart a song or want to skip a song (you can not skip the last\
      \ one). As many songs later in the story are very difficult and require memorization\
      \ and preferably a good style-core combination, you'd most likely restart the\
      \ entire story and play through the comparitively easy songs of the first few\
      \ chapters for a while before fighting the harder bosses again. You also obtain\
      \ more credits you can spend per story mode run as you play the game. Thus,\
      \ hardcore mode is more suited as a challenge for those experienced with all\
      \ songs you get on the route you chose.\n\nOccasionally, I've experienced slight\
      \ hiccups in the game. It doesn't occur that often on my PC, so I'm not too\
      \ worried about it personally. However, keep in mind that the game is a shmup\
      \ (usually a frame based game genre) and a rhythm game (with its time based\
      \ on the music). Thus, hiccups can compromise the game experience not just visually:\
      \ They can cause you to miss the beat and therefore your chance to shoot or\
      \ activate your shield which may result in failure.\n\nI purchased this product\
      \ alongside the following DLC: NOISZ DM Ashura Level Pack, NOISZ HyuN Level\
      \ Pack and NOISZ re:||VERSE. At this point, I haven't played or even seen/heard\
      \ every song in the game yet, but if you enjoy the game concept, I also recommend\
      \ the DLCs. They all contain more songs which are listed on their respective\
      \ shop list. The re:||VERSE DLC mentioned also adds more routes (with some insanely\
      \ difficult songs) to the story and more styles as well.\n\nSummary: I find\
      \ the game very fun to play, even though I don't necessarily like a lot of the\
      \ music used in the game. It has much to offer in terms of challenge but fails\
      \ to convey some of the basic information you wish it did, so do consider joining\
      \ the Discord server if you decide to get serious with it!"
