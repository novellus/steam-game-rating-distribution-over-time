    review: "This is a somewhat maligned sequel to Star Control II, widely regarded\
      \ as one of the finest scifi games ever made.  Like SC2, this is an arcade \"\
      SpaceWar\" ripoff with a plethora of ships, where you control your own upgradeable\
      \ super-mothership, fly around the galaxy, interact with comical and interesting\
      \ aliens and eventually work your way through the grand plot of the game. \n\
      \nThey opted for an unusual 2.5D combat mode, and that's just one of many experimental\
      \ gameplay choices.  I know the game got a lot of flak, it simply wasn't as\
      \ good or entertaining as StarCon2, but if this was 1996 I'd definitely recommend\
      \ it.  Today, however, it's an old DOSBox curiousity that's only worth picking\
      \ up for nostalgia's sake.  DOSBox is clunky at best, you have fixed resolution\
      \ and no widescreen support...  I couldn't recommend anyone stops playing CS:GO\
      \ or DOTA2 for this."
