There is more to the game than you first think, and some things you only see later in-game. It's the co-op game I've been meaning to play, it helps strengthen friendships or lose any trust in your friend's capabilities. Also, it supports the steam online splitscreen function lets me play with friends from further away, which is awesome! Thank you developer, absolutely worth the money so far and I hope to see updates!","timestamp_created":1574973114,"timestamp_updated":1574973114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580419540405273438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6dDt2e4Cc+6I3wE="}
