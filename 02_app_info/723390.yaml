      face challenges to survive. This marine has to use all of his training, both
      with firearms and thinking tactically, to parkouring across the levels. Mitchell
      has to manage his inventory with over twenty-six unique weapons and gadgets,
      find the best way to get the job done, and do whatever it takes for his own
