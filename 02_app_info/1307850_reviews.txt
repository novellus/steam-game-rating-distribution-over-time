It's good to relax to and just to tease your brain a bit. Especially in the later levels where timing and fast reactions become crutial it can get quite challenging, although no level will keep you from advancing for too long. For a low price it'll keep you entertained for a while and is definitevely worth it.","timestamp_created":1606688089,"timestamp_updated":1606688089,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4utSEi/YCfO2/tQI="}
