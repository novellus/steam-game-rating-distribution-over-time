Got 70 minutes of playtime, mainly because I have not played many games of this ilk. Whenever I do play games like this though, I always like changing the controls to my liking, so this game not having control editing was a real shame, which didn't help the already slightly buggy gameplay. Despite those two things though its a fun game for a very small price.","timestamp_created":1606532318,"timestamp_updated":1606532318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws7iyhvYCfrOPtAI="}
