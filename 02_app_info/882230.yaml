    about_the_game: "Champion is a German Shepherd tasked with keeping the Queen (the\
      \ owner of the house) safe from monsters.  Nyan the cat keeps watch during the\
      \ night, but monsters are no less prevalent during the day.  Worse yet, many\
      \ of them are invisible.  Thankfully, their terrible smell makes them easy to\
      \ hunt down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDog's quest is a journey for all ages to explore\
      \ the virtues that dogs are known and loved for, such as loyalty and companionship.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nNote: A computer mouse is strongly recommended for optimal\
      \ gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFEATURES AND GAMEPLAY<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nScent: Dogs have a very strong sense of smell.  This allows Champion\
      \ to hunt down monsters, as well as assisting his search for other animals and\
      \ objects.  Watch for particle effects, and if you ever feel unsure of what\
      \ to do, follow after them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoving: WASD movement, but with\
      \ A and D rotating Champion's facing instead of strafing.  Press the Left Shift\
      \ button to run, and paw prints will float across the screen.  Press the Space\
      \ bar while a paw print is lined up with Champion to extend how long you can\
      \ run.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTalking: Talking to other animals is automatic.  Press\
      \ the T button when you see a talk balloon with a T in order to continue through\
      \ the dialogue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBarking: To activate Bark Mode, click the\
      \ mouse.  Spheres will fly across the screen.  Click them to bark and scare\
      \ monsters away.  Some monsters make Champion more powerful after they're defeated.\
      \  A couple monsters must be clicked upon directly in order to defeat them,\
      \ but most require barking.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSaving: Saving the game is automatic\
      \ at periodic chapter breaks, usually right before and right after a conversation.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nDecision Mode: Sometimes Champion will be unsure of what to\
      \ do, and menu choices will pop up.  When this happens, click the menu choice\
      \ you want.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClosing the game: Press Escape to end the game\
      \ at any time."
