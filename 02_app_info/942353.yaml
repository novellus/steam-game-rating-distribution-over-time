    review: I'm not feeling too much buyer's remorse because I bought this using Steam
      wallet money I earned from selling trading cards and inventory items, but I
      still can't really get behind locking day-one-ready content behind a separate
      paywall. There's nothing all that special about the content in this pack. It's
      stuff that should just be in the game by default. Keep your dosh to yourself.
