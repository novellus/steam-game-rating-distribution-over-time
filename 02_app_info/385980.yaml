    about_the_game: Picture this. One guniea pig alone in the vastness of space, fighting
      an empire of evil Rhinos. Sure, that's pretty unfair...the Rhinos don't stand
      a chance!<br><br>Scott in Space is a stylized platformer with a classic gameplay
      core, plenty of different enemies to defeat and quests to fulfill. Can you stop
      the evil Rhino Empire from abducting guinea pigs from their home world New New
      Guinea? Can you defeat the dark rhino leader named... Evil Andy?! Can you make
      it home before dinner? So many questions and so little time!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/385980/extras/rufus.png?t=1488055734"
      /><br><br>If you like the light-weight sphere of classic family platformers
      and you love helping little guinea pigs in space out from time to time (an uncommon
      hobby), then Scott in Space is the right game for you!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/385980/extras/quests.png?t=1488055734"
