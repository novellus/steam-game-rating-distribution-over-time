    review: I absolutely LOVE this game!! I just got it on PC (i bought it on switch
      before) and it made my love for it spike!! It's such a simple, versatile game.
      It's one of those games that you can bring to a family gathering and you'll
      have grandpa spitting out his dentures, laughing, playing this game. The fact
      that you can have multiple players on one keyboard or multiple controllers is
      great! It's so easy to play and set up and I totally reccomend that you buy
      it. It's worth every penny! Just make sure that you have a friend or two by
      your side to play with! I would wish that you could change the FPS, as it spikes
      my CPU pretty high.
