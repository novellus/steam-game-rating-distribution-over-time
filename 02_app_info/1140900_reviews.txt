The game is indeed very simple (after all, it's a first solo-developer game for 4.99$) but, to be fair, I've never considered that players would want to have an action relationship with monsters (killing them) in a Lovecraftian, horror game. Anyway, I found your critique on the repetition very interesting, because the objective stays the same only for the first two levels - the idea was to step up the difficulty adding the big fat creatures - that tells me that people get very annoyed by this and become frustrated immediately. I find this piece of critique very important and wanted to thank you for that.\nOnce again, I'm sorry you had such a negative experience. I hope I'll be able to change your mind with future updates!\nHave a good day!"}],"cursor":"AoJ4xqfy9e0CdMa71AE="}
