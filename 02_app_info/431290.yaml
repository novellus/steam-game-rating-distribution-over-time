    review: "You know how ridiculous it was when Solid Snake hid inside a cardboard\
      \ box? That's what this game feels like all the time. This is a rare case for\
      \ me, an Indie game that isn't terrible but is actually pretty damn fun. (Seriously,\
      \ look at my other reviews, this doesn't happen much). I can honestly say I\
      \ really enjoy this game despite its issues. Highly recommended (for me anyway).\
      \ Price point may be a bit high for some though since I'm not sure if there's\
      \ much replay value,  a community level editor would make this a much better\
      \ proposition for the price.  \n\nTechnicals: Not much to speak of, no fullscreen/windowing\
      \ options, you can toggle music and sfx on or off and you can use gamepad or\
      \ mouse and keyboard (I recommend gamepad, mouse and keyboard requires you to\
      \ control the character with clicks like an rts which is very awkward, a wasd\
      \ and arrow keys system would have been better). Oh and nothing is remappable.\n\
      \nGameplay: You control Gary and try to evade coworkers and security guards\
      \ as you sneak your way into work late. You hit a gameover when you are spotted\
      \ by somebody (unless you just skirt their vision for a split second). The \"\
      enemies\" have a cone of sight like in many games and you need to evade them.\
      \ \n\nThis can be done by simply learning their movement patterns and dodging\
      \ them, to using the environment to hide (vents, closets, toilets etc.) , to\
      \ even sabotage. Sabotage how? Well you can break their equipment to distract\
      \ them, chuck erasers so they look in that direction, knock em out, OR (my favourite)\
      \ give them an overdose of laxatives -insert maniacal laugh-\n\nThe gameplay\
      \ feels very smooth and it does get complicated at some points, I'll openly\
      \ admit there was a couple points in the hour and I half I have played so far\
      \ just raging. Oh, and did I mention boss fights? There are boss fights in this\
      \ office lmao. These boss fights use mechanics you've already seen but in a\
      \ way that feels much less like you're advancing a level than legitimately duking\
      \ it out with the boss and it's great. \n\nBesides that there are little collectible\
      \ figures, essentially pop figures with alternate names and some quirky descriptions.\
      \ As well as secrets, these are hidden behind safes which require you to locate\
      \ hints hidden throughout the level, on the first couple levels this is simply\
      \ a case of spotting numbers hidden in plain sight around the level but later\
      \ on it does become more difficult.  \n\nMusic/sound: Pretty enjoyable, the\
      \ pacing is good and suited to the game and I do enjoy some of the tracks quite\
      \ a bit. The sfx are decent enough, the one issue I have in this department\
      \ is the fact that you can hear the employees using printers when they are waaaay\
      \ off screen, no matter the size of the level you can always hear printers being\
      \ used from the other side. It's not a huge issue but it does detract from the\
      \ music a little.  \n\nGraphics: Pretty simple, nothi9ng flashy about it. Runs\
      \ smoothly at 60 locked. \n\nOf course there are a couple bugs that do need\
      \ addressing: \n1- I have multiple monitors and f0r some weird reason this game\
      \ does not play in the primary but in my third monitor all the way on the left,\
      \ this means if I were to play on mouse and keyboard I'd be at a very awkward\
      \ angle. There's no in-game option to window the game so you need to alt+enter\
      \ to window it then move it to your primary and alt+enter again to have it play\
      \ on the right monitor. \n\n2 - On gamepad there's a button that will zoom in\
      \ the camera and lock it there, I can't figure out how to zoom back out despite\
      \ mashing all the buttons, this is fixable with a restart. \n\nFully recommend,\
      \ this is honestly very, very fun for me. Nice pacing, it's got some difficulty\
      \ behind it at some points, and the dialogue is quirky. I do honestly think\
      \ using a gamepad will make the game feel much smoother though."
