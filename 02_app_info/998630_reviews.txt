I'm not sure? Interchangeable bored teenagers? The sheer number of goggles indicates a steam punk setting, but the equipment they fight with ranges from medieval weaponry to random garbage, so maybe this is a drunk teenager army simulator? Is that a thing?\n\nAnyway, your scrubs fight some other scrubs that wear different colors. One of your scrubs comments on the futility of this, but the other talks him into continuing to beat on everyone else wearing different color shirts. Good. You capture some towns, which provides you with more supplies (drugs? snacks?) with which to bring out more units of scrubs and so forth. If the procedurally generated level gives you towns nearby, you probably win. If not, you might lose as the enemy scrubs can bring units out faster. Boo. Sometimes you have to find really finicky little hidden things that require your guys to land on just the right pixel. Sometimes you have to escort a bomb cart to a city. Sometimes you just murder a bunch of goth teenagers. Why? I'm not at all sure!\n\nIn each stage, you can find one hidden town, one guy who will boost one stat for one of your scrubs, and one new scrub to recruit. You get some money with which to buy garbage to fight with. The ones that look like weapons help a lot. Sometimes your guys gain levels, which gives them some stats and a choice of two perks. They all have some potential meter, which maybe gives them better stats if it's higher, but everyone you have is just varying shades of low potential, as befitting a troop of homeless whino children. (Edit: Apparently you can trade in levels for extra potential? Make sure to hit every possible button on every screen as there aren't great prompts to do so.)\n\nAnyway, don't buy this if you don't understand what a game of drunk Ogre Battle would end up being, but if you do, it's worth the low price to mess around with. The class change and trait flexibility end up being a lot of fun once you figure out what the heck is going on.","timestamp_created":1604535770,"timestamp_updated":1604874630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550594568252563477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt+7+1PUCd9WtrAI="}
