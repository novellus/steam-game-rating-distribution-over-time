The characters were good, I enjoyed the worldbuilding and the story was interesting. I wasnt very interested in romance in this one (ironic for a game in their hearts label). Most of the characters are already in relationships, which isnt my cup of tea, though if you like poly stuff you might enjoy it.","timestamp_created":1605361556,"timestamp_updated":1605361556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoqvA4/UCeJuprgI="}
