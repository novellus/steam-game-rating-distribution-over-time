At least he tried?\n\nOk, this game needs so much work. Let's get right to it.\n\nThe keyboard-only control scheme which is not re-bindable is quite difficult to play with. Your fingers will be jammed onto the XZ, NJMK keys. Please try something for me now: Put the fingers of your hands in that configuration on your keyboard now, and ask yourself if you think you'll enjoy holding your hands like that while you play.\n\nThis is some half-baked speed runner but it it so badly made you can't really employ any kind of skill. It's so random and not in a good way. Things fly at you so fast there is not a human in the world that can react fast enough, and they fly at you in bad RNG patterns where everything clumps up in ways that remove skill... most of the obstacles are completely unavoidable.\n\nThe interface is insane, the English instructions really don't make a lot of sense. The music is horrendous. Even at the lowest volume setting, it makes me want to deafen myself with knitting needles.\n\nThis game is rancid. Nobody should buy it. Even if they gave it away for free you shouldn't play it.","timestamp_created":1588373406,"timestamp_updated":1588373406,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk9ib6fECcdbzhAI="}
