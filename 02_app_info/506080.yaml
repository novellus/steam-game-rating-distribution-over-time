    review: "Per quanto mi riguarda la soundtrack \xE8 uno degli elementi pi\xF9 importanti\
      \ di un videogame, cos\xEC come lo \xE8 per i film. \nQuesta \xE8 una delle\
      \ colonne sonore pi\xF9 belle che abbia mai sentito, malinconica, dolce e assolutamente\
      \ immersiva. \nMeadow si conferma, anche per questo, una delle migliori esperienze\
      \ videoludiche che abbia mai intrapreso."
