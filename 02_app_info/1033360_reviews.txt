I suggest tipsy town as a fun map.","timestamp_created":1554338996,"timestamp_updated":1554338996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8tv08ukCeYnAvgE="}
