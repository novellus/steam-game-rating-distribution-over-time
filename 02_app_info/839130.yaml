    review: "I'd visited Twitch streams of the dev programming and testing out this\
      \ game and so my expectations from seeing it in action were very high. When\
      \ the day finally arrived that the game was out, I'd tackled it in the store\
      \ immediately. With my hands on the controls, I'd experienced the feel of them\
      \ for myself. They're incredibly smooth and the gravity on the character feels\
      \ spot on! A nice weight to him, not too slow and even the ability to make him\
      \ shoot ahead even faster with the space key! Not to mention that the subtle\
      \ manipulation of trajectory allowed by the WASD keys really made landing some\
      \ of the trickier jumps a bit easier. You also get two jumps to correct mistakes\
      \ and reach higher platforms. But that doesn't mean there isn't a challenge.\
      \ No! This game is so sweet and simple with enough in it for higher level play\
      \ that anyone can pick it up, but the challenge can be found! The stages have\
      \ plenty of hazards and timing and accuracy based jumps that will test your\
      \ gravity platforming skills! Some of them I'd had myself a bit of a panic as\
      \ I'd just missed shots by a hair... or an entire horse. Sometimes I'd have\
      \ myself a jump from the tension in some stages! Especially the mid to later\
      \ ones! And a sweet surprise to me was that I'd found the water levels in this\
      \ game to be very enjoyable, unique and relaxing! You know, those levels you\
      \ usually want to drown yourself after playing? Well, this game doesn't have\
      \ one of those nightmares! Which brings up the next bit I have to say!\n\nA\
      \ major point of the charm for the game that I'd personally been enthralled\
      \ with all the while playing it is the atmosphere it has. From the very beginning\
      \ the opening cinematic gave off a very nice and simple charm to it that is\
      \ even a bit reminiscent to a storybook. Then after a brief chat with Santa\
      \ that I'd found comical, the first level begins. It's cold and mysterious with\
      \ a dark gloom and shining glimmers here and there. The music compliments this\
      \ scenery perfectly! It sounds like a grand adventure awaits just outside of\
      \ the caves you explore at the start! The very following stage, you get hit\
      \ in the face with charm as you leap about the snowy tundra and a super catchy\
      \ tune which calls to mind something you'd hear in a Mario title begins to play!\
      \ Even in just writing this review I'd opened up the game to experience these\
      \ stages so I could describe them to their best and I'd easily gotten caught\
      \ up playing through the first level and found it tough to let it be and get\
      \ back to writing. Not to mention too that I'd started humming along to the\
      \ soundtrack a few times myself both now and in the past. I'd easily gotten\
      \ caught up playing this game through nearly twice over and I'm looking forward\
      \ to sharing it with my sister and her family. \n\nI have a feeling my Mario\
      \ and Kirby adoring nephew is going to just love to try Snowball out for himself.\
      \ Then after I'll likely hear him chatter on about Snowball again and again!\
      \ I'm betting this is going to be a great game to play with them and we'll have\
      \ ourselves plenty of laughs as we watch each other fail at those tricky jumps!\
      \ This game really is such a nice callback to the feeling of playing a Mario\
      \ or Kirby game but with its own unique twist given the special controls featured\
      \ where you fling the snowball all about the map rather than have a free run\
      \ to and fro. Maybe a bit like Kirby Canvas Curse in presentation, but still,\
      \ that doesn't quite cover it. I'd highly recommend giving it a swing for yourself\
      \ just to see what I'm talking about!\n\nAs for the settings, you get to see\
      \ an icy tundra, a beach side full of bombs and even a factorial setting! But\
      \ I'd definitely recommend seeing the surprises you'll have later on for yourself!\
      \ The extra stages were the places where the real skills needed to be busted\
      \ out! Not to mention that the bosses appearing at area endings were quite snappy\
      \ and quick. Some keep you on your toes very well! Some are even surprisingly\
      \ eerie! It's like a mix between winter, summer and Halloween given those moments!\
      \ Which also brings up the sprite work! Really nice and charming with something\
      \ like an SNES aesthetic to it. You got yourself some wandering demon types\
      \ that work as the main mooks at the start, then you even have some shuffling\
      \ penguins that bounce you about and off of platforms if you're not careful!\
      \ Some spiders grab poor Snowball and tug him up to the ceiling! There is a\
      \ nice variety overall to the tone, sound and environments you traverse! \n\n\
      Really, the only real downer I can see is that I want to play even more! I'm\
      \ looking forward to an expansion to this game in the future and I hope that\
      \ wish will become a reality. Even then, I want to play another Snowball title\
      \ someday in the future which improves even further upon the already stellar\
      \ mechancis utilized here. If this was the 90's where Sega did what Nintendon't,\
      \ I'm betting Snowball would absolutely fit in with the likes of the platformer\
      \ mascots you'd seen then. And for certain, he'd be one that you'd remember\
      \ the face of anywhere! That's Snowball! What good memories! \n\nTo get across\
      \ my opinions on Snowball: this game is so worth getting for yourself and it's\
      \ an experience you should really bask in. Have fun with it like the games from\
      \ the good old platformer days! I absolutely say go for it and give it a play!"
