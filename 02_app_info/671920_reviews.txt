It's a good follow-up to the original game.  I love this universe so damn much.  (And yes, I did finish this game in 7 hours, if that's a factor for you.  I didn't 100% it but I came close.  Still worth the price, if you ask me, especially if you liked the first one.)  It runs a little janky and I had to force quit a couple of times when it didn't load correctly, but nothing permanently game ruining.","timestamp_created":1604288795,"timestamp_updated":1604288795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l4rEw/UCd9fbqwI="}
