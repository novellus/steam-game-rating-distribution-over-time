    review: 'what the fuck


      I guess if the developer wanted to make something intentionally bad he 100%
      succeeded because everything was indeed exceptionally bad. Especially his singing.
      But also everything else, ranking this as one of the worst RPGMaker games I''ve
      ever tried playing. But you shouldn''t play things that are just bad with no
      redeeming value!!! I shouldn''t either!!!'
