Vermintide is a game for UP TO 4 players. Meaning, you can play solo or with a friend, the rest of the party gets filled by bots. Not in this DLC. You are either forced to play with randoms or play without a full party. No bots here! The DLC is balanced for 4 players, so only two will get slaughtered fast.\n\nAdd to that that your equipment, build and talents that you farmed over the main game and every other DLC are useless here (you need to unlock new weapons and new talents by ingame currency that you gain while playing the DLC map). Unlock costs for items and talents seem rather high, so I see a lot of farming here.. for items and talents you can use only in this map, nowhere else in the game.\n\nOnly positive factor is the one new weapon per character. Beastmen are a nice new faction, but you practically don't get to know them. They could have used their own campaign.\n\nIf they had made weaves copies of the normal maps, with your own build, items and bot support, but with new special conditions, mission goals and special rewards depending on the weave, it would have greatly increased replayability of the game. In the current form I tried it once and will never touch it again.","timestamp_created":1610009872,"timestamp_updated":1610009872,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550561785697937012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6KCE7vYCfuecwQI="}
