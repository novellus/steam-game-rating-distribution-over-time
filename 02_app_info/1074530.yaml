    about_the_game: "This game is a detective adventure game, made by a former Japanese\
      \ private detective. <br />\r\nHello everyone! My name is Yusima, a former Japanese\
      \ detective. Being a detective in Japan is relatively easy. There is no exam\
      \ and there are no strict trials you must go through. There is no strict approval\
      \ process also. Detectives are very much like ordinary people. They don't have\
      \ any special authority for investigations per say. So for example, when a detective\
      \ ask someone about something or they ask for a survey or when they are on a\
      \ stakeout, they may be mistaken as a stalker or suspicious person. This means\
      \ they might be reported to the police. Since this is the case, Japanese detectives\
      \ should be quick on their feet and should be able to lie and make good excuses\
      \ on the spot. <br />\r\nI was originally a good person who was very bad at\
      \ lying, but during my detective work over the past 10 years, I had become a\
      \ good liar and deceiver. This is a detective adventure game made by someone\
      \ who is good at deceiving people. <br />\r\nI hope you are challenged by this\
      \ game! The price is also very cheap, it is very affordable for even small children.\
      \ However the target audience is Adults.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMain character<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nEtuko Goto <br />\r\nAn unmarried mother with two children.\
      \ A private detective.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToshiteru Goto<br />\r\nA son of Etuko\
      \ Goto. An investigator and also a teacher.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShiho Goto<br\
      \ />\r\nA daughter of Etuko Goto. A junior high school student . She calls her\
      \ brother 'Goony'.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDetective Ogawa<br />\r\nA detective of\
