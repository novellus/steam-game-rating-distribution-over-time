    review: "A definite buy if you are into Nordic Folk groups like Wardruna, Danheim,\
      \ and Heilung. Instrumentals and choruses do an oustanding job at delivering\
      \ the ancient battle ire energy or giving the mood of anxious \"calm before\
      \ the storm\" suspense. \n\n   The music is prosaic, which is a definite plus\
      \ given the game's context. It does not try to portray epic battles with neck\
      \ breaking acrobatics and war elephants. Instead, it creates a musical embodiment\
      \ of ruthless competition between forceful men, which turn the paradox of \"\
      an unstoppable force meets an immovable object\" into  \"an unstoppable force\
      \ meets an unstoppable force head-on \". This \"paradox\", however, has an answer.\
      \ And it's not pretty. \n   \n   If you are searching for a dose of brutal masculinity\
      \ without fantasy makeup, you've found the right product."
