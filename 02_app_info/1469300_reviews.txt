Like rollback doesnt work for me no matter what I try, plus why doesnt it support mouse wheel rollback anyways rather than right/left side of the screen. No matter what option I chose at the first option the game pretends I chose the castle. if I go to the tavern first without going to the other two my character talks about events that havent happened to him yet at the castle.\n\nfix the bugs and we got a neat little game here","timestamp_created":1609914456,"timestamp_updated":1609914456,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609924116,"developer_response":"Thanks for pointing out the continuity errors, they will be fixed in the next patch (later today).\nThe rollback is deactivated because it was messing with the map, so not really a bug but something I had to do, if I can find a way for it to play nice with the map I will reactivate it."}],"cursor":"AoJw/KKY6/YCfJv2wAI="}
