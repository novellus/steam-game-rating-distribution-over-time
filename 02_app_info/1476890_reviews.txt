Can't use keyboard to type in answers or remove letters.  There is no \"settings\" button.  If you click on the wrong letter you have to clear the entire board and start over.  I thought it was a steam version of the original online game, but it's not.  Instead of entering as many words as possible for a high score, it's enter as many words as possible, but only random words are accepted.  There is no counter showing wrong guesses, and the letters keep shuffling.  I wanted to challenge my vocabulary, not my clicking skills.","timestamp_created":1609121173,"timestamp_updated":1609121173,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44JHG0/YCfbz6vQI="}
