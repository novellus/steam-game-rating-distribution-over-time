The initial plot seems a little bit silly, but generally  speaking, it doesn't matter. The plot works, and that's all it has to do for this first entry to the franchise. The music is nice, the map making is great, the characters are believable, and the artwork is neat. \n\nWhy buy this game compared to other RM games, a lot of people ask themselves. Especially when this is priced higher? \nThe simple answer is \"because unlike most games, this one is part of a 5 part saga that actually feels complete and has amazing twists and turns for people who like the genre.\" \nOf course, secret rooms, huge dungeons, and many secrets isn't something everyone enjoys.\nChildren might not enjoy the game on basis of it being long and not \"mash through and win\", that's fine, it's a fair warning. \n\nBut all in all this is one of my most recommended games out there; MM1 is the entry into the millennium series, a series any true RPG fan can spend upwards of 10, 20, or even 40 hours in. \n\n(This review was made as the current world record holder of this game's speedrun.)","timestamp_created":1608676006,"timestamp_updated":1608676006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh/ujxvYCcM2kvAI="}
