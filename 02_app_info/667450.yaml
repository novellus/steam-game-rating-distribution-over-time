    review: 'Since there''s no information anywhere about what the gameplay is like:
      you run to a fire (cutting any trees in the way), water it, then dig the ashes
      to make sure the fire doesn''t pop back up. If you dig all around a fire (or
      bunch of fires), it can''t spread anymore. If you run out of either trees or
      buildings (the bars at the top, not how many are on the tiles), you lose.


      It took under an hour to beat, but could''ve taken half that if not for my biggest
      issue with the game: once you''ve isolated all the fires, so that there''s no
      longer any way to lose, you still have to run and put out and dig all of them,
      which takes 3-4 seconds per tile. After 50 levels, my wrist is sore from all
      the unnecessary clicking.


      Aside from the last few levels, there''s not really any sense of danger or time
      pressure. For the most part, you have plenty of time to get to the fires.'
