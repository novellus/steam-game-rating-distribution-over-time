    review: Edelweiss takes what Pacific had and polished it even more. There's larger
      and more complex tanks, more mission diversity, more weapons to play around
      with, and TWO new boss battles that come with their own sweet battle music for
      each campaign. The DLC team really outdid themselves with their second big project,
      definitely worth 10 bucks.
