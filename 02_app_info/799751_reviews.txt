That said, I think it is very good. It really makes Shadow Hawk look badass. It's not just a paint job, it gives Shadow Hawk much beefier look, like it's gone Super Saiyan.  Shadow Hawk is the best medium class 'fast charging' mech (if you know what to do with it of course) and I'm very happy with the new look. Worth the price, especially if it's on special.","timestamp_created":1608595657,"timestamp_updated":1608595657,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4krrxw/YCd8qHvAI="}
