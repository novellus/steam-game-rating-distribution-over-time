    review: With Elizabeth Margaret being my favorite character, I was very excited
      to play this route. I hate to say that I was disappointed. I got her good, neutral,
      and mutiny endings, and while I did enjoy the extra scenes with her, they were
      too short, especially the rope play one, which was the biggest let down as it
      ended so soon after it began. This DLC did not come with any new CG, which was
      the absolute biggest disappointment. I see that there is CG in the steam screenshots,
      so if there was a bug that for some reason skipped the CG, I would love to fix
      it. until then however this will have to be one DLC I do not recommend.
