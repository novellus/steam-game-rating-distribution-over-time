      \ stake your claim. To win, you have to gamble your relationships with the most\
      \ powerful bosses in town to win influence. This influence comes in many forms:\
      \ Law, Money and Force. If you\u2019re clever enough, you\u2019ll be able to\
      \ take claim over the buildings in the ever growing boomtowns and gain powerful\
      \ abilities. At the end of the day, the boss who has the best combination of\
      \ wit and bluff will become the most powerful tycoon in the Wild Wild West.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">GAMEPLAY</h2><br>The game is played in a series of rounds.\
      \ Each round, poker cards are dealt between the locations, which are laid out\
      \ in a circle. Players place posse members on these location cards, which will\
      \ both give an action and count as a bid for the location\u2019s valuable resources.\
      \ Players also get a poker card of their own which uses the two adjacent cards\
      \ from a location to form a three-card hand. This creates a clever mix of modern\
      \ worker placement and poker that drives the game. In addition, players must\
      \ manage their resources of Law, Money and Force to buy buildings and gunfight.\

    review: 'Actually a fun game to play which doesn''t take so much time. The rulebook
      is well designed, yet it took me a sample round to understand what it wants
      to tell me. After that round one knows how to play and the mixture of duelling
      and poker make for a kind of intense gameplay!

      What can you expect for that price? The surrounding is well designed (you basically
      play on a train in the desert), and so is the game itself. What it doesn''t
      provide is any kind of scripting like auto setup/deal/etc., but since it is
      not a micromanagement game you barely need those anyways (even better for rewind/save
      and load).

      Also, the table could be bigger, maybe with working drawers (Which the table
      has by design, they just don''t work) to place the player mats on.

      All in all I can recommend this game, at least give it a shot, yeehah!'
