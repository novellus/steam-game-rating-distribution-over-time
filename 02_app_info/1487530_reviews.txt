Pronouns don't really matter when one character looks obviously male, two characters look obviously female and the last one looks like some extremely unattractive alien jelly blob.\nSo yeah, my information is OBJECTIVELY correct. Only 1 male. Numbers are not equal. 2-1-1 (2 females, 1 male, 1 it) instead of 2-2 (2 females, 2 males) like it was with original characters. It's not about pronouns it's about how they look. I repeat to anyone who wants to buy it: there's only one male character.","timestamp_created":1609301450,"timestamp_updated":1609828045,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.202552318572998047","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609528598,"developer_response":"This information is objectively incorrect. \n\nThis DLC includes 2 characters using canonically \"He/Him\"; 1 character who uses \"She/her\"; and 1 character who uses \"they/them\". \n\nNot that it would be an issue if the distribution was any different, in our opinion. But we wanted to reply since -although this is a complaint on something we humbly deem irrelevant- it is just objectively inaccurate. \n\nAdditionally to that fact, player can -as it has always been the case- choose the pronouns for the characters. \n\n"}],"cursor":"AoJ4jNLO6PYCdpHVvgI="}
