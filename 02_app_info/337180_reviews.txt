As I get better and faster at the game, it is a joy to coordinate the different mechanics: jump, teleport, slide, sprint, shoot at the correct angle, etc... I love the heart pumping rhythm of the music and the back and forth between space combat and platforming. \n\nAfter finishing a level, I happily look at my watch and declare, \"I have time for one more level.\" The game is quite accessible, at first, for those who do now have skilled video game reflexes. Veterans of arcadia will find that there are many opportunities, and rewards, in finishing these levels with improved speed, efficiency, and thoroughness. \n\nLt. Kai Tana and her side kick Ralan are likeable. The story may not be mind-blowing but it enough for our purposes here. Velocity 2x is about fun game play and the story, at the very least, does no harm.\n\nI was able to get the game on sale for about $7. For that price it was easily worth it for me.","timestamp_created":1608985634,"timestamp_updated":1608985634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzYzBz/YCd42vvQI="}
