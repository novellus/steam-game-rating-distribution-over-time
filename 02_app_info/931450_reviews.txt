All they have to do at this point is build content around the very strong combat and they will have a real winner.\n\nAlthough even if they abandoned it right now, I'd probably still come back and visit the holo chamber now and then.\n\nEdit:  There is a recently-posted roadmap including some campaign missions coming this fall, and the current public beta includes a third cave tileset for the holo chamber.","timestamp_created":1601169892,"timestamp_updated":1601239382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw/77T6PQCfZ6ppAI="}
