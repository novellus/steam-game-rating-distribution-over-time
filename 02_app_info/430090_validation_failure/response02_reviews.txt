Was make me feel like i play Serious Sam in a mmo. The Black Pyramid mission at the end worth the time and $. Hope to see more awesome missions like this in near future, especially in Transylvania.\n[/b]","timestamp_created":1466784032,"timestamp_updated":1478423843,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560489177703857422","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i7K7nNgCd9/RWg=="}
