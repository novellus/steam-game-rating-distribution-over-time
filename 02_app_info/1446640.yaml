    developer_response: "Hi White,\n\nThanks for taking the time to try out Rifle\
      \ Dodger, though I'm sorry it didn't seem to work for you! There was a bug right\
      \ at release that prevented non-Vive controllers from working correctly, though\
      \ that should be fixed now, so I'm not quite sure what would be causing this\
      \ problem for you. \n\nIf you have the time, I'd appreciate if you could make\
      \ a post in the discussion board with your setup details and I'll see if we\
      \ can get to the bottom of the problems you're having.\n\nCheers,\nJordan"
