    about_the_game: '<strong>Nectar of the Gods</strong> is an unquenchable head-to-head
      real-time strategy game where bugs battle over the finest beverages. You must

      /><br><br>In Nectar of the Gods you will embody <strong>Beetle Brigade</strong>,
      <strong>The Hive</strong>, and <strong>Spidey Party</strong>. Each bug family
      has 8 unique bugs with special abilities and quirks. Examples include a Rhino
      Beetle that propels fellow beetles forward with it''s mighty stampede. And a
      Queen Bee that boosts your team''s resources by producing precious royal jelly.
      All of the bugs have sampled the sweet sweet nectar of the drink industry and
      are counting on you to coordinate a winning drink against any bugs standing
      in your way. In order to deliver this bubbly bliss, you will need to maximize
      every bug''s contribution, while squashing anything your opponent or the countertop
      can throw at you. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1421410/extras/InspirationAlt.gif?t=1608140380"
      /><br><br>I was inspired to make Nectar of the Gods by the &quot;rock paper
      scissors&quot; tactics and mental reflexes of real-time strategy games. I love
      the idea of bite sized asymmetrical battles where you have to think quick on
      your feet and rely on your mastery of the units available to you. And bugs are
      rad!'
