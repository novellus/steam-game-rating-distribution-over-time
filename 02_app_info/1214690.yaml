      \ to attack, it is up to the player to make the choice to face, flee or go unnoticed.\
      \ The player will also have to solve several puzzles in order to advance in\
      \ the game and find out the next location, as many places in the city will be\
      \ locked and you can unlock them by solving these puzzles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
