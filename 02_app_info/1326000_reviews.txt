It feels a little longer than the first game, which is appreciated. My main complaint is that they made Cosmos too much like Ayu in this game. In the previous game, Cosmos was an awkward, eccentric social media influencer. Ayu was a bratty, tsundere teen idol. In this game, they often act interchangeably and argue with each other entirely too much to even be mildly amusing. Cosmos was my favorite from the previous game but I forgave the deviation from her original personality when they introduced Hazel. My new Thighfu.","timestamp_created":1609216969,"timestamp_updated":1609879012,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqoiR6vYCe/uqvgI="}
