You can use a gamepad or your keyboard. I was impressed by the graphics and animations. The characters are designed with a love for detail, which is very important to me in games. The music and sound effects also fit the atmosphere well. The special twist in this game is that your characters don't start at level 1, but at level 99. Thus, the battles are interesting and exciting right from the start. All in all, LV99: Final Fortress is a great indie game which I would like to recommend to RPG fans wholeheartedly.","timestamp_created":1594550726,"timestamp_updated":1594550726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw16WoofMCeMTjlAI="}
