That being said though, one small gripe I have is that sometimes the event triggers can be a bit wonky and the dialogue doesn't match what's going on around you. However it's not a deal breaker and the missions don't suffer unduly for being repeated, as they are really good.\nOne big piece of advice that I'd offer is this:- learn to fly the A-10C properly before you attempt this campaign. You will need a complete understanding of all the CDU functions, as you will be given tasking in both lat-long, UTM and Bulls formats, and you will be changing these on the fly. \nAlso, be fully up to snuff on the radios too, as you will be given various radio freaks to switch and change to, and if you don't know how to change radio channels on the fly then you will fail to trigger the mission events. Also there's a couple of missions were flying in formation and time on target is a factor, so practice those skills too, but flying this campaign will improve you as an A-10 pilot anyway.\nWorth the money I'd say\n","timestamp_created":1608598025,"timestamp_updated":1608598025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sr76w/YCf6iIvAI="}
