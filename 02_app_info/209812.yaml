    review: 'Missions are clearly unbalanced relative to base game. The suit aliens
      are broken, boasting stupid stats. You try to apply knowledge [i]the base game
      taught you[/i] where you survive if you take full cover and the enemy is far
      but these enemies not only have perfect accuracy but extremely high crit chance,
      and almost always take more than one attack to kill. The poison attack does
      not seem to be able to miss at all and that requires to bring tons of medkits
      to the mission to avoid slow but certain death of a team member. The missions
      are handed out early in the game where i dont yet have upgraded weapons. It
      was completely possible to prioritize unlocking upgraded weapons but I could
      not know beforehand about the cringe that was about to come.

      The misssions are annoyingly, putridly difficult for someone playing the game
      for the first time, they smell. Do not have this DLC enabled for your first
      playthrough and while you''re at it, you might aswell forget about it altogether.
      The cat''s dcik worth of content that it introduces to the game is probably
      not worth the money and nerves anyway'
