There are a few trickier parts in the levels but overall it's quite easy especially after you've bought more gear. The levels got quite a bit of tension though as although they are easy, death brings you back to the beginning of the level so beating the levels and managing to get through some of the \"tougher\" parts feels pretty good.\n\nIt's a nice and surprisingly charming little game despite it feeling amateurish during the platforming levels. And I loved the music. Every level has its own song and some of them are really good. I think I'm going to buy the soundtrack. I kinda miss hearing some of the tracks already.","timestamp_created":1599079253,"timestamp_updated":1599079253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wKCjqPQCe6C1nwI="}
