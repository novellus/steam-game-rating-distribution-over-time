It doesn't try to fit into a certain category, which is refreshing.\n\nThis game is not \"super realistic\", although that should be pretty obvious if you watch the trailer. Physics aren't completely accurate, some of the cars have exaggerated behavior, and you're stuck in third person. But this game is overall very simple, which makes it \"realistic enough\". You don't pick up this game expecting to be playing a racing sim where you have to be conscious of tire heating, aero setups, or locking up your brakes in corner entry. But there's also no \"drift button\", nitrous activation that spews fire out of your tailpipe, or any of that arcade nonsense. You've got gas and brake and steering, and your job is to use those as expertly as possible to get the fastest time on an autocross course.\n\nThere are about 25 cars and tracks each, and all of them feel unique. That's where this game really shines. Again, the physics are aren't going to blow you away, but that allows for cars that each handle noticeably different. This makes it fun to try out various combinations of cars/tracks and see what you can make work. Oh, and there's leaderboards for each track, which can really suck you in to trying to beat everyone else's time. The only thing that kind of sucks with this much variety is that there are only so many cars that are viable for setting top track records. Some of the cars are, to be honest, pretty trash. They can still be fun to drive, and there are leaderboards specific to each car. But there are really like 5 or so that always end up taking the top times across all cars.\n\nOverall, this game is great. Community is awesome too, there's a discord which is really helpful for new players, and we sometimes have tournaments to play for steam gift cards (that's right, you can MAKE money playing this game). I would recommend this game even at full price, and definitely do not pass it up if it's on sale.","timestamp_created":1585807713,"timestamp_updated":1585807713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rqzgnPECdOKl/QE="}
