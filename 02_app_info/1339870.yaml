      /><br><br>You woke up in an unfamiliar forest. You only have a rifle, ammunition,
      provisions and a small camp. In this seemingly uninhabited place, there are
      many empty and creepy houses. Every night you can hear the howl of a werewolf,
      the opportunity to meet him appears only at night. Be careful, if you succeed,
      you fall into an illusion.<br><br>In this dream, you will visit different places
      and points of the world. For example: an Arctic island, a vast desert, the streets
      of a beautiful and interesting city on the coast of the sea, tropical jungle,
      staying above the abyss of the ocean and being at the foot of a destructive
      volcano.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1339870/extras/Maps__3_.gif?t=1608478488"
      /><br><br>The battle with your opponent will not be so easy, because you will
      not see him. Here you will need to listen to every step and roar, but you will
      also help your rifle, which reacts to the enemy in different colors. The yellow
      light indicates that he is somewhere nearby, and the red light indicates that
      you need to shoot immediately. But all this must be done quickly and clearly,
      otherwise you will not be well.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1339870/extras/Fir.gif?t=1608478488"
      /><br><br>Only you, The Last Saviour, can save this world, which is on the verge
      of destruction. So do it!'
