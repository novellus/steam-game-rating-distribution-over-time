    review: i like this game. the price is very cheap, and you get a good experience
      out of it. it's a short game, taking between 30-60 minutes to play, depending
      on the player. the downsides are that there's no proper settings menu, or a
      help section with controls. it took me a while to figure out how to unlock doors
      (right click on door btw), and i couldn't find some of the notes easily due
      to the lighting (some were needed to move the story forward). ending was a bit
      confusing but alright. i would recommend this if you want to play a quick game.
