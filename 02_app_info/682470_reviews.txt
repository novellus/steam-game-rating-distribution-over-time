Tragedy, suspense, romance, and life struggle, all in one. In this VN, you will play as Ji Zhe, a bold female intern reporter that strive to be better in her job. Ji Zhe who will never give up and full of curiosity will bring you to chronological incidents that appealing to be reported. Actually, for me Ji Zhe is more than just an intern reporter here. She is also like a detective that trying to solve the case down to the roots. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2343688475\nThe best words to describe this VN are \"truly beyond expectations\". I saw this VN often included in a quite cheap bundle, so people will underestimate its story at first. This VN has compelling stories that rich of moral messages and spirit to defend the truth and justice. Definitely a VN that will make you crave for more! Beside the main story, the extra stories also worth your playtime because Ji Zhe will report and solve other interesting cases. Anyway, this is a lengthy VN, so prepare your snack and beverage before you jump into the journey of a passionate intern reporter!\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2343400151","timestamp_created":1609500469,"timestamp_updated":1609500469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495300352573394775","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48ITt3vYCcsOvvwI="}
