    review: "First of all, I have to point that this is not a game but a loosely interactive\
      \ story.\nWith only 2 choices and two endings, don't expect much of interactivity\
      \ or replayability.\n\nHere comes the bad points:\n- the story is a little original\
      \ but fail to develop further, and looks unfinished at the end\n- the characters\
      \ are somewhat a generic mix of the genre and for most lack of original personality\n\
      - the music is not bad but becomes boring very fast as you have tons of text\
      \ to read\n- the grap\u0125ics are unequal, varying from decent to bad: backgrounds\
      \ are for the most good, standing characters are okay but still lacking originality,\
      \ but when it comes to other poses, there goes anatomic problems, mis-schaped\
      \ faces and looks.\n\nConclusion: we can sense it was a fun project for the\
      \ devs but really lacks what it needs to be paid for, it's way more like a prototype\
      \ than a finished product."
