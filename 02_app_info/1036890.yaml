    about_the_game: Fallen corporate shogun Lo Wang and his former employer turned
      nemesis turned sidekick Orochi Zilla embark on an improbable mission to recapture
      an ancient dragon they unwillingly unleashed from its eternal prison. Armed
      with a punishing mix of blades and bullets, Lo Wang must traverse uncharted
      parts of the world to track down the dark beast and push the apocalypse back
      yet again. All it will take is the mask of a dead god, a dragon's egg, a touch
      of magic, and enough firepower to hold off the impending cataclysm. <br><br><strong>Bring
      a Katana to a Gunfight</strong><br>Conduct a symphony of death with each encounter
      by mixing overwhelming firepower with devastatingly precise katana strikes as
      you dash in and around the demonic hordes.<br><br><strong>Fancy Footwork </strong><br>Flow
      between nimble movement techniques including air dashes, wall running, double
      jumps, and the fancy new grappling hook busts your combat and movement options
      wide open in every battle.<br><br><strong>Execute Then Annihilate</strong><br>Execute
      spectacular finishing moves to claim a piece of your conquered foe and unleash
      its powers back on the horde in a burst of unstoppable fury and powerful magic.
      <br><br><strong>Dynamic Combat Arenas</strong><br>Each environment is lined
      with hazardous structures and devices that can be activated to add another layer
      of creative choice to the offensive strategy. <br><br><strong>Neo Feudal Japan</strong><br>Trek
      across a mythic Asian land infused with the magic and technology of ancient
      samurai, now overrun by the demonic yokai from Japanese folklore.<br><br><strong>Funny
      Business</strong><br>Brace for expertly delivered one-liners from Lo Wang, pointed
      banter with Zilla, and an intense thrillride of absurd predicaments on the way
      to turning doomsday into a new day.
