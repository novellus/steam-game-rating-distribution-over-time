    review: 'i finished the prologue a couple days ago, and honestly wasn''t expecting
      such a turn of events! my heart definitely broke. though i''ve enjoyed this
      game so far, there is a lot that could be added to improve it. little details
      can go a long way.


      this game is still in its early access stage, after all. so i don''t expect
      it to be perfect.


      some details i would like to see added are character images, to help me better
      connect to them. as well as giving the npcs more personality. i feel like they''re
      all the same and that none of them have any depth to them. details like this
      are probably being put on the back burner so that the large game mechanics can
      be finished, so i understand why they''re not first priority. hopefully, however,
      they''ll be added eventually.


      going along with that, character driven quests and etc would also help me grow
      a connection to them. maybe even add a companion system so they can go with
      you adventuring and etc.


      another glaring problem i faced was not knowing what to do. after the prologue
      finished, i wasn''t given a clear quest of where to go from there. i know i''m
      being left to my own devices to run a farm and start a family but what about
      my sibling? [spoiler] is there no quest line to reunite with them and rekindle
      our relationship? [/spoiler] there isn''t any clear direction of what i should
      do.'
