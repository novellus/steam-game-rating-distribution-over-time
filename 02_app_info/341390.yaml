      \ the original keyboard commands for those wishing to play as it was intended.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">The adventure</h2><br>Recently, you have begun to find yourself\
      \ unfulfilled and distant in your daily occupation. Strange dreams of prospecting,\
      \ stealing, crusading, and combat have haunted you in your sleep for many months,\
      \ but you aren't sure of the reason. You wonder whether you have in fact been\
      \ having those dreams all your life, and somehow managed to forget about them\
      \ until now. Some nights you awaken suddenly and cry out, terrified at the vivid\
      \ recollection of the strange and powerful creatures that seem to be lurking\
      \ behind every corner of the dungeon in your dream. Could these details haunting\
      \ your dreams be real? As each night passes, you feel the desire to enter the\
      \ mysterious caverns near the ruins grow stronger. Each morning, however, you\
      \ quickly put the idea out of your head as you recall the tales of those who\
      \ entered the caverns before you and did not return. Eventually you can resist\
      \ the yearning to seek out the fantastic place in your dreams no longer. After\
      \ all, when other adventurers came back this way after spending time in the\

      \ just kept going?<br><br>Asking around, you hear about a bauble, called the\
      \ Amulet of Yendor by some, which, if you can find it, will bring you great\

      \ amulet will be granted immortality by the gods. The amulet is rumored to be\
      \ somewhere beyond the Valley of Gehennom, deep within the Mazes of Menace.\
      \ Upon hearing the legends, you immediately realize that there is some profound\
      \ and undiscovered reason that you are to descend into the caverns and seek\
      \ out that amulet of which they spoke. Even if the rumors of the amulet's powers\
      \ are untrue, you decide that you should at least be able to sell the tales\
      \ of your adventures to the local minstrels for a tidy sum, especially if you\
      \ encounter any of the terrifying and magical creatures of your dreams along\
      \ the way. You spend one last night fortifying yourself at the local inn, becoming\

    review: "IMO this is the king of the rouguelikes. There is no question in my mind.\
      \ The amount of stuff you can do, the amount of careful planning it takes to\
      \ get far, dying sometimes on your first step of the journey... this is roguelike\
      \ perfection. This is just an adaptation of the classic NetHack, for the most\
      \ part it is simply a graphical overhaul, or basically an isometric tileset.\
      \ However, there are a couple game mechanics that are very slightly different.\
      \ But for you purists, I really don't think it affects the gameplay. This is\
      \ basically classic NetHack but with better graphics than have ever been seen\
      \ before. Sadly, they are still not very good. I would love to see some really\
      \ good graphics on NetHack someday, but I'm not sure there is enough interest\
      \ for that these days. The devs of this game say they have graphical updates\
      \ coming, and from what I've seen they look amazing, but the project seems to\
      \ have stalled out, so who knows if we'll actually get them.\n\nEither way,\
      \ if you have played NetHack before, this is the best version to play IMO. Don't\
      \ come at me if you're an ASCII purist, I don't care. This is objectively a\
      \ better game experience than ASCII characters, don't lie to yourself. If you\
      \ have never played NetHack, this will be by far the easiest way to get into\
      \ it, and I highly recommend you give it a try. Sure, you can get a free version\
      \ of NetHack online. But you will struggle to figure out what to do. Just buy\
      \ this, it's worth it. (Not that you won't struggle in this too, just remember\
      \ to ask the oracle, and if you can't figure something out... well I guess there\
      \ is no shame in looking it up. I'll give you one hint though, you can engrave\
      \ \"Elbereth\" on the ground to protect yourself from many enemies for a short\
      \ time.)\n\nI guess I should add something here on the off chance that anyone\
      \ here is totally unfamiliar with Nethack. It is a D&D inspired dungeon crawler\
      \ which is randomly generated with each new game. You start off not knowing\
      \ what things are - for example, you may find a potion, and realize it is a\
      \ potion, but not know what it does. It might be called a \"milky potion\",\
      \ and even if you have identified a milky potion in a previous game, that will\
      \ not help you because the item descriptions are also randomized. You'll have\
      \ to do some experimentation to figure out what potion it is, and from then\
      \ on, you'll recognize it as, say, a potion of healing (not all potions have\
      \ positive effects, though). Until you die. You only get one life, so you better\
      \ make it count. Progress in this game is made through dying over and over and\
      \ getting a little further each time, until you have learned the mechanics of\
      \ the game and how to use your character well enough to be able to beat it,\
      \ which is no small task. Few people who play are dedicated, careful, and ingenious\
      \ enough to actually do it. \n\nWhile the game may be limited in terms of graphics\
      \ and an easy to use interface, it is anything but when it comes to player choice.\
      \ In fact, it is the most robust game I have ever played in that regard. You'll\
      \ have to use every object you find to maximum effect in order to make it out\
      \ alive, and that often means getting creative and using items in ways which\
      \ are not immediately obvious, and which no other game would allow you to do\
      \ (barring some other hardcore roguelikes, which are all essentially inspired\
      \ by this game and its predecessor, Rogue). Here is a video which explains what\
      \ I mean pretty well. There are some spoilers in it (what players call hints\
      \ on the game mechanics - not storyline spoilers, the storyline is for you to\
      \ fill in the details), but I think they are good for proving the point. https://youtu.be/SjuTyJlgLJ8\n\
      \nIf you've enjoyed \"roguelikes\" and \"roguelites\", which are terms very\
      \ loosely thrown around these days, often being applied to games which only\
      \ have a couple of these mechanics such as permadeath, and want to see what\
      \ all the fuss is about, this is what you should try. It's frustrating, it's\
      \ hard to learn the basics, and much, much harder to beat. But it can also give\
      \ you experiences that you will never have in any other game (again, possibly\
      \ barring some other games which were inspired by it). \n\nPersonally I'd recommend\
      \ limiting your exposure to spoilers, because I think it's more fun to figure\
      \ it out for yourself, even if it means you'll never beat the game. If you can\
      \ reach the oracle a few levels down, he can give you some hints. The Elbereth\
      \ trick mentioned above is technically a spoiler, but given that it is mentioned\
      \ in the guide that comes with the game, and it would be difficult to reach\
      \ the oracle who tells you this trick without knowing it, I don't think it counts.\
      \ \n\nBasically, it's NetHack. The learning curve is pretty insane. But once\
      \ you get into it, you won't want to stop. This is a masterpiece of gaming,\
      \ and while I can't give too much credit to the creators of this game, given\
      \ that they really just slapped a skin on it, I do believe that this is the\
      \ definitive version, for now. The controls are still complicated but less so,\
      \ and the graphics and music, while not great, are certainly better than nothing\
      \ (which is what you'll get with the free version). Good luck and happy hacking.\n\
      \n9.5/10"
