    short_description: A pure white Horologue appears in Celavie, a casino town swirling
      with greed, its huge size implying that it must have devoured thousands of years
      worth of time, and Victor and Kiri face the brunt of its immensely powerful
      attacks until they're saved by Mina, a girl who can control wind.
