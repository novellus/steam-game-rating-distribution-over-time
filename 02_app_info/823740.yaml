    review: Complete rubbish. Tetris has a better storyline than this. This would
      have been considered a poor game in the 80's. They had a fun idea (lead a revolution)
      and then they could not come up with any more ideas than let's make it like
      pac-man... Whatever you pay for this, it is to much. They should ban the makers
      of this game for ever realeasing another one.
