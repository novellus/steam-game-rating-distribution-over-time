The game was developed by Eipix Entertainment and published by Big Fish Games Studio.\n\n\"Death on the Silver Screen\" is the first episode of \"Final Cut.\"\n\nSince this is a collector's edition game, it comes with extra features that are not available in its' counterpart; the standard edition.\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are two different difficulty game modes to choose from: Regular and Expert.\n\nThe notebook keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events and clues.\n\nThere is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly without having the need to constantly backtrack. It also indicates that there are a variety of tasks that can be completed at various locations within the game. The interactive map is automatically given at the start of the game.\n\nThere is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place. The inventory panel does slide up when it is being moused over.\n\nThere are some interactive items in the game. Some of the interactive items may require extra components before they can interact with. All interactive items are marked with a symbol in one of the corners.\n\nThe hidden object scenes consist of the following: Find \"x\" amount and Traditional word lists. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interaction. Most of the hidden object scenes can be replayed in the game's extra feature section.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them. Some of the puzzles can be replayed in the game's extra feature section as well.\n\nThere are two sets of collectibles in the game: Photographs and Playing Cards. They are scattered throughout the game for the player to find.\n\nThere are forty different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game only.\n\nSince this is a collector's edition game, there is a bonus chapter, but it can be accessed only after the main story is completed.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThere are extra features in the game: Bonus Hidden Object Scenes; Bonus Puzzles; Wallpapers; Soundtracks; Concept Art; Game Trailers; Game's Strategy Guide. Most of these extra features can be accessed only after the entire game is completed.\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1520795309,"timestamp_updated":1600732467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.637013912200927734","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48+HF2fQCc5a5mwE="}
