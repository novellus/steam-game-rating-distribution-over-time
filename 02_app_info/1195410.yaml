    review: 'Updated, the original post starts on the 2)

      1) Played this for over 50h in total and the Dev made many additions to make
      the game even better, if you were in doubt before, now it''s a nice moment to
      buy this game. The new mechanics blend in to the game and with the SIRALIM universe
      even more. congratulations, very, very solid game,


      2)Played it so far, very interesting

      My personal liking is for quick battles which are present. Strategy comes in
      knowing your opponent and be able to counter it. Not only you need to abuse
      their weaknesses, you gotta cover your own.


      I like the creatures artwork, expanding the siralim series concepts, all looking
      beautiful so far

      OST is very good


      Can be a bit hard but you have acess to your stable, where the cards you got
      are, for easy switching. Not a big punishment for losing, and winning makes
      you stronger.


      So far, very good
