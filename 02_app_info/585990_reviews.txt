I just didn't feel like it added anything of importance to the story that I didn't already learn in Episode 1. In fact I often felt that some parts were explained with more depth and reflection in that game than actually seeing them here. Anyway, the game is free, so nothing is lost from downloading it, but personally I feel nothing was gained either and that's what determines my score.","timestamp_created":1487715491,"timestamp_updated":1487715491,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492803573608398438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y5uwsdoCe8Hjcg=="}
