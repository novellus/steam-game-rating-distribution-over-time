    about_the_game: 'The world is under siege from an unknown enemy.  Gates are appearing,
      spawning demonic entities. Major cities have been destroyed with overwhelming
      force. Most of the population has been decimated, but the dead rise again to
      feast on the living. There was no warning, no signs, but there is no doubt.
      This is the apocalypse. There are rumours of massive fortified strongholds around
      the world, properly defended against these dark invaders. The closest stronghold
      is called Salvation, but getting there will prove to be a long, challenging
      road. If there is any hope of survival, it rests far to the North at the gates
      of Salvation.<h2 class="bb_tag">Description</h2>I am proud to present the first
      release from Indie/Anon Games, Endgame: Road to Salvation. It is a road trip
      combat style of game with rpg/survival/roguelike elements and full ragdoll physics.
      It is a unique hybrid of top-down/twin stick shooter and third person camera
      control while driving. As the player, you have to drive North and reach the
      safety of the distant stronghold Salvation, delivering your caravan with as
      many survivors as possible from the cruelty of the Apocalypse. You can accomplish
      this monumental task by staying armed, fed, and mobile, and keep your caravan
      fed and safe. The undead are more active at night, meaning you should find shelter
      and stay hidden, and hope that nothing tears down the walls around you. This
      is a really difficult game and you may be forced to make tough decisions on
      the fly, but the random generation and AI storyteller will keep you moving.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Drop In/Out Local Co-Op</h2>The game contains local co-op split
      screen, which needs 1 gamepad controller and 1 keyboard/mouse. Single Player
      can be played with either the keyboard/mouse or a controller. Player 2 can drop
      in or out of the game at any time, maintaining their character through a slot-based
      save system. Co-operative play allows certain privileges such as reviving a
      fallen player, controlling a trailer turret, or just to have a friend watch
      your back.<h2 class="bb_tag">Some features include:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Dynamic

      at night, try to find a safe place to sleep before the sun goes down, or be
