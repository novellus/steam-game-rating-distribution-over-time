    review: 'Sorry guys i just cant give this the thumbs up. I totally understand
      its a one man dev and there for sure is nice work. But there is a ton of things
      missing (even for E.A.) like sound effects, music and story. You just start
      the game out of nowhere.


      But my main problem was the movement and swordplay. Its just way to slow. He
      moves like you just want to push him on, his sprinting is a trot but it helps
      a little. The turning though is just horrific, slow isnt even the word and the
      directional combat is barely existent, but is made more so by the slow movement/turning.
      You will find yourself spacebar pushing continuously just to move or get turned
      around.


      Its got promise but it really needed to launch with more, even for E.A. I think
      if it wasnt for the sound effects missing and the nightmarish movement and turning
      speed plus the frustrating directional combat.... i would have liked this game.'
