    review: "I love these +1/-1 solitaire games, and I'd never played one developed\
      \ by DigiMight, so I wanted to get their take on the formula.\n\nOverall, I\
      \ think that they did a pretty good job. Although the abilities were simple\
      \ and straightforward, they certainly aided in the completion of some of the\
      \ more challenging levels. I also liked the tension created by the time pressure\
      \ cards present on the tableau. If you remove too many other cards without removing\
      \ the time pressure obstacles, a card will either be subtracted from your deck\
      \ or added to the board, depending on the obstacle color. Blue obstacles remove\
      \ a card from your deck, while orange ones add an additional one to the tableau.\
      \ \n\nAs always, there is room for improvement. Although the player can have\
      \ up to two uses for each ability, the in-game display does not indicate how\
      \ many uses you have remaining. Therefore, you'll sometimes be caught off guard\
      \ (having only one use of an ability when you thought you had two), and may\
      \ not be able to finish levels that you thought you had \"in the bag.\"\n\n\
      There are also level obstacles that cannot be removed unless the player achieves\
      \ a streak of perhaps four card removals. This isn't a bad idea in theory, but\
      \ since the layouts are randomized, there are times when you just can't achieve\
      \ the streak necessary with the cards available. You'll remove all the cards\
      \ above the obstacles and then be forced to restart the level in hopes of a\
      \ more favorable draw. This never feels good.\n\nIf you also enjoy this style\
      \ of game and have played most of the more popular iterations on Steam, DigiMight\
      \ isn't the worst developer you could check out next."
