The controls are keyboard only, movement and combat is slow, there is no gear to find or level up your party (undermining the dungeon crawl aspect), and the magic system is easily exploitable for infinite healing.\n\nIt feels like a simple, cheap flash game.\n\nWander around the dungeon until you find one of your objectives, and then smash it.  Your characters aren't leveling up almost at all, no gear, so it is very repetitive quickly.\n\nThe artwork and animations I thought were endearing for the style.  The music and sound effects were not great.\n\nSadly, not a good entry in the dungeon crawling genre.","timestamp_created":1514241914,"timestamp_updated":1514241914,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574250400066375732","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyb72x+ACecPEkwE="}
