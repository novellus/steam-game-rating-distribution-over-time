    about_the_game: Push Me Pull You is an award-winning local multiplayer game about
      friendship and wrestling. Joined at the waist, you and your partner share a
      long, wriggling body as you wrestle your opponents for control of the ball.
      Since you're sharing the same body, you'll need to carefully communicate (or
      just shout a lot). With every action affecting both you and your partner, PMPY
      combines the best parts of co-op multiplayer with the worst parts of your last
      breakup.  <br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Frantic local multiplayer gameplay in
      the vein of Sportsfriends or Towerfall.  <br></li><li>Compete in multiple game
      types that will test your friendship in different ways, or play around in a
      sandbox area filled with toys and secrets.  <br></li><li>Low on controllers?
      Share a controller with a friend or try controlling two heads simultaneously
      - a two-player game can be played with just one controller!   <br></li><li>Accessible
      yet deep - play it as a noisy party game or hold a fiercely competitive grudge
      match. </li></ul>

    review: It's such a ridiculous game, and I absolutely love it. (Ps.There is a
      hidden dog mode, but I won't tell you how to find it lol) (pps. don't get it
      if you don't have a wireless gaming receiver.)
