    about_the_game: Endless RPG is a random dungeon and map generator for 5th Edition
      Dungeons and Dragons.<br><br>The Random Dungeon Generator is not a game. It
      is is a tool for playing D&amp;D 5e alone, in a small group without a dungeon
      master, or with a dungeon master as either a standalone adventure or an easy
      way to get into the game.  The tool can even be used for running full campaigns
      as an easy way to fill a tower with gobins or some ruins with the undead.  <a

      target="_blank" rel="noopener"  >Endless RPG is also available for mobile platforms,</a>
      but on Windows you get the benefits of a big screen.<br><br><strong>*** PLAY
      SOLO OR IN A GROUP WITHOUT A DM ***</strong><br><br>The Random Dungeon Generator
      allows you to explore a randomly-generated dungeon through a fog-of-war discovery
      system with encounters, traps, tricks and treasures shown as you encounter them
      and roll your own dice to determine the outcome.  This is perfect for solo play
      or groups without a dedicated dungeon master.  <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.nations-software.info/2017/12/14/play-dd-or-pathfinder-solo-or-in-a-dm-less-group/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"  >Learn more about playing D&amp;D alone or in
      a group without a DM</a>.<br><br><strong>***USE AS A DM TOOL ***</strong><br><br>Custom
      Dungeons allow you to pick the CR level, environment (dungeon, cave, etc.) and
      enemy (orcs, undead, demons, etc.) and can generate a single level or multiple
      level dungeons.  This is a great way to quickly build a side adventure or do
      some of the heavy lifting for your campaign. You can easily get at the map images
      for importing into different software.<br><br><strong>*** CUSTOMIZE YOUR MAPS!
      ***</strong><br><br>As a DM, you have a variety of tools to customize the maps.  This
      includes editing encounters, adding or deleting monsters, editing treasure,
      adding items, moving traps or setting custom messages for your players, which
      can allow you to add custom events or traps.  Endless RPG isn't a full map editor,
      but these customization options can ensure that encounters and treasures are
      found where you want them to be found.<br><br><strong>*** MULTIPLE DUNGEON TYPES
      AND MULTI-LEVELS ***</strong><br><br>The missions created by Endless RPG can
      encompass different types of 'dungeons' including caves, ruins, strongholds
      or the classic dungeon.  The missions can also be on a single level or multiple
      levels mixing and matching the dungeon types, so you can explore a cave that
      leads to ruins or a stronghold with a dungeon below it.<br><br><strong>*** QUICK
      BATTLE AND BATTLE MAPS FOR COMBAT MANAGEMENT***</strong><br><br>The app aids
      in keeping track of hit points with characters on the screen while exploring.  When
      encountering creatures, the player has a choice of simply clearing the encounter
      (the monsters will be considered defeated), utilizing a Quick Combat mode, which
      is great for small battles with just a few creatures, or a full Battle Map,
      which allows a more tactical way of resolving combat.<br><br><strong>*** SUPPORTS
      UP TO 8 CHARACTERS ***</strong><br><br>Players can run through the dungeon as
      a single character or a party of up to eight characters.  A &quot;character&quot;
      can also include guard dogs, guard bears, or other non-standard creatures.  <br><br><strong>***
      EXPERIENCE AND LOOT TABLES ***</strong><br><br>The app will keep track of the
      monsters you have killed, including the over experience points and experience
      points by character.  It will also track the treasure (magic items, coins, etc.)
      you have looted on your adventure.

    review: eh, its not that usefull, this thing barely was developed and throwed
      away as cash grab on steam (i dunno this "game/generator" really follow ANY
      map contruction rules for whatever D&D version), i recomended it if you REALLY
      are short on money (like myself) to buy a "decent" D&D map gen software or at
      very least a D&D constructor book, otherwise STAY AWAY
