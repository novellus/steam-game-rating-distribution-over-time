All other songs aside, if I realized I would have liked that track that much I probably would have paid $5. \n\nThe other songs are nice too but haven't played all of them. Initially was really excited about the Moonlight Sonata. I like it, but I really LOVE the version of Wagner's piece :)","timestamp_created":1603084337,"timestamp_updated":1603084337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49rfRn/UCcN/iqAI="}
