I did not buy them together.  So for those of you who buy the dlc later, just make sure you wait a day, because it does not install automatically. evenif you click \"install games\".  Then go into the DLC and double click on it to install it.  The songs are very well written and I love the game, having played 9.2 hours so far :)","timestamp_created":1501727845,"timestamp_updated":1501756394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456330478191375732","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoYHq090CeczRgQE="}
