You can really hear the care and detail that goes into every note. It's something you'd expect from a high budget motion picture.\nUsually you can tell if instruments in songs are using samples, but this one sounds like a legitimate Erhu being played. At this price I felt like I was ripping him off. Nice work, Murray!","timestamp_created":1545575801,"timestamp_updated":1545575801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iuTf7ecCepyStgE="}
