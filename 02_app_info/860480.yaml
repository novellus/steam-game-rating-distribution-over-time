    review: 'Ah Koei Tecmo, time for another 16 bit RPG that was ported from mobile
      to steam.  This game is quite enjoyable, however its also rather short. The
      primary reason that I''ve even played 34 hours is due to trying to complete
      everything.  (in fact I plan on writing a guide to part of this game here on
      steam when I get home tonight.)   But this brings up another point I wanted
      to discuss which is they brought back the record keepers!  Well kind of...  They
      no longer are physical NPC''s on the map but instead are labelled as trophies
      in their own separate menu.  I''ve managed to get 18/20 of the gold trophies,
      and the last two one my playstyle simply put would make it a slog to obtain,
      and the other I don''t know how to get.


      But this brings up something else I want to talk about since this is a Koei
      Tecmo RPG.  This game and most others made by the company suffer what I call
      ''Fourth Act Slog'' which I will be denoting as FAS from now on.  What is it
      praytell?  Well most books follow a three act structure of a beginning, middle
      and end.  KT tends to do four acts though, which are a beginning, middle, wrap
      up, and end.  However the fourth act KT has a tendency to bog down TERRIBLY.  This
      game''s main plot line the fourth act isn''t so bad, its more like how much
      extra stuff there is to do.


      SPOILERS BELOW

      For example to define the four act structure in this game or at least in my
      opinion:

      The first act runs from the start of the game where Alex wakes up in Fernland,
      all the way up till when you meet Clangorrah for the first time and everyone
      regains a fragment of their memories after the Stiletto fight.  Or when he finally
      decides to join the support squad.


      The second act then runs all the way through to the second Belthazar fight and
      he decides to join the resistance full time.  Or the second Stiletto fight where
      everyone remembers how they die.


      The third act runs up until the first fight with Endrey and then gaining the
      ability to finally access Clangorrah''s castle.  The Endrey fight in my opinion
      is actually where this game''s writing is at its best.  Sure its foreshadowed,
      but personally Endrey if he was more developed could sway the story so much.


      The final act actually doesn''t occur until you beat Clangorrah and get the
      normal ending.  Since like every KT game there are two endings, and the ''better''
      ending requires you to do an additional set of dungeons.  And here like usual
      there is pretty much no charm within them.  The best thing in the fourth act
      is honestly the design of the true final boss, which kind of ripped off Neo
      Exdeath, but I digress.  There''s no real character development in the fourth
      act, and it feels like things were drug out longer than they should have been.  Plus
      the like 6 bonus dungeons at the end are just that much more extra padding.  But
      I still recommend.'
