    review: I failed to write about this in my main game review.  I really love it.  It's
      challenging, it lets you try out tables if you don't have Platinum Pack, it
      forces you to play tables you already play in possibly new ways, it makes you
      choose how to improve the crappy setup you started with (I did most of flippers
      first), and I consider it a nice way to improve my pinball skills and reflexes
      (which I'm pretty lacking in).  I'm only on the intermediate level as of writing
      this but I think it's easy to say this is a definite recommend from me.
