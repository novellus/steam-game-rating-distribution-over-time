It does a great job of giving you some back story and informing you about the different factions fighting. The research into the units actually present in this front/theater is excellent. This short and sweet engagement (the mission time is 24 hours) can be played from the side of Turkey or Russia.  I played three games so far with Russia and each one unfolded differently due to the random chance in game events have to \"fire\".  This really was a huge bonus for me personally.  I encountered no bugs during my playtime so far and had a ton of fun. As a person who follows closely world events and studies conflict zones, I really loved this and looking forward to trying some of the other \"LIVE\" missions.  10/10!","timestamp_created":1580953451,"timestamp_updated":1580953451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.665258884429931641","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n+eKjPACfYS68AE="}
