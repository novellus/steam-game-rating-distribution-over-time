    review: 'The mechanics are very simple, but you''ll have to think fast and strategize.
      Works best with friends.


      Used to play this game in college with my roomies. We had a lot of fun. It becomes
      especially nerve-racking if you increase the speed setting.


      I was really happy to find this gem on steam. Very unexpected. I had lost my
      copy of it for about 15 years. There have been many light cycle variants, but
      this is the version (though slightly updated) that I played and loved most.'
