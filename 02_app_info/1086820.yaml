    short_description: End of Realms is a turn based RPG where travel is inspired
      by classic board games. The kind where you roll a die, go one of two ways and
      find something interesting. Combine that with simple combat, painterly graphics,
      an original plot told in comic book captions and, voila, that's our game.

    review: "[i] My Experience [/i]\n\nI very much like the concept of End of Realms.\
      \ The \"painterly\" graphics are pleasing, and it is a very streamlined game.\
      \ You choose one of two places to go, and find there either quest advancement,\
      \ an item (weapon, armor, jewelry, treasure, potion), a shrine (that refills\
      \ one of your stats), or an enemy. You can sort of create your own build through\
      \ equipping the ten active, three passive, and three free skills that you'd\
      \ like. You can also equip items that lend themselves to what you're trying\
      \ to do. You can trade the treasures you find for weapons, armor, or potions.\n\
      \nI chose to use a weapon that doubled my damage, but greatly increased the\
      \ chances that my spells would fizzle (fail). I would then use Steady Advance\
      \ (which cannot fail and makes your next skill succeed) to push through my Doom\
      \ skill for 30 willpower damage. This simple strategy was quite effective, but\
      \ there were still many enemies that bested me, including a tentacled monster\
      \ that seemed to gain 15 or more in his willpower stat every single turn.\n\n\
      Although I liked the \"bones\" of the experience, there are just too many issues\
      \ here to recommend: \n[list]\n[*]If you fall in combat, you retreat. You can't\
      \ switch your skills around and then re-engage with the enemy you were previously\
      \ fighting. Once you retreat, you can only go to a different location. This\
      \ represents a missed opportunity for the player to engage with the skills being\
      \ offered.\n[*]Certain locations seem to \"gate\" areas, and I was often disoriented\
      \ as to what river I'd crossed and where I needed to go to complete each quest.\
      \ Certain locations seem to only be present in certain regions.\n[*]Figuring\
      \ out how to view item stats during trades is un-intuitive. You have to click\
      \ on a small button underneath each item to reveal it's stats, one by one.\n\
      [*]It's unclear how to raise your armor proficiency. I obtained many pieces\
      \ of armor that required armor proficiency of 1, 2, or 3 long before I obtained\
      \ the skill. I finally obtained the skill by equipping a random piece of jewelry\
      \ that gave me an armor proficiency point.\n[*]I acquired many seemingly random\
      \ items, such as sulfur and an inactive potion, but these never came into play\
      \ during any of the quests I did.\n[*] I often encountered a trader that was\
      \ meant to help me consolidate my treasures (allowing me to trade multiple treasures\
      \ for one of higher value), but I could never equal the value of even one of\
      \ his treasures, even with all of mine combined.\n[/list]\nLastly, the game\
      \ just began to slow down to a crawl after a while. I reached a witch that seemed\
      \ to have a lot of tasks she wanted me to do, and I just felt like I ended up\
      \ going everywhere but where she wanted me to go.\n\nThe frequency of my battle\
      \ losses also increased, without me feeling that I was getting access to any\
      \ better skills or equipment to improve the performance of my willpower-attacking\
      \ build.\n\nImproving the game would involve covering armor proficiency in the\
      \ tutorial, allowing the ability to retreat and re-engage in battle (perhaps\
      \ if you had not been killed), giving the traders lower value trinkets, and\
      \ perhaps providing some sort of \"overview\" map. The locations seem randomized,\
      \ but perhaps players could be informed of what \"region\" they are currently\
      \ in."
