There exists no guide and not even a playthrough ANYWHERE on the web. So if you really wanna try this out be aware that you may have to try and contact the dev directly in case you get stuck.\n\n/\n\nYeah okay, this is exactly my kind of weird.\n\nAs if the title isn't enough of an indicator, this game is very, very strange. It's kinda like a super niche amateur comic you'd find on places like Drunkduck, wrapped into an RPG Maker game. The whole thing is hand drawn with what I assume is ink and colored pencils. Style reminds me a lot of the webcomic Gnoph.... not that anyone would know what Gnoph is....\n\nOn the surface Soul-Ivy plays and feels exactly like every other RPG Maker game out there. Janky movement, janky menus, everything has that distinct RPGM jank flavor. Love it or hate, it's what you're getting.\n\nThe battle system is suprisinlgy comptetent. Which is good because fighting is what you will be doing for 99% of the game. Every ability requires action points, which can be recharged by guarding. Buffs and debuffs, poison and special moves, it's your fairly standard RPG deal. However the thing that is missing is any kind of levelling system. Your stats are determined solely by your equipment.\n\nYour goal in Soul Ivy is quite literally genocide. You have to eradicate every single enemy on the map. Once an area has been wiped clean you have to neutralize it at a camp fire, making the entire area turn grey and steps will no longer require food. Oh yeah, there is a mechanic I've not seen since Breath of Fire V of all things: You only have a limited amount of steps available, symbolized by \"meat\" that is consumed with every step. Meat is both the currency to buy stuff and the raw marerial that let's you craft new equipment. Despite that actually pretty interesting mechanic the difficulty is still laughable. As long as you pay attention to your health bar & equipment, you will face nary a challenge. And even if you should die, you get the option to cheat death, respawn at the main hub and just continue with 500 free meat in your inventory.\n\nWhile there aren't puzzles, different party members do have different abilites like cutting bushes or moving rocks. You will have to swap member to proceed through some areas.\n\nSo last but not least... how about that story? Well let me tell you, if casual philosophical observations are not your thing, you won't become friends with Soul-Ivy. This is a student game trhough and through.\n\nLook I really have no clue whether I would recommend Soul-Ivy to anyone... because I couldn't tell you who the intended audience for this is. Except weirdos like me.","timestamp_created":1548846947,"timestamp_updated":1587310494,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581185579299926758","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk4DFyfECcf3HuQE="}
