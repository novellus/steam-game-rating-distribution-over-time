    review: 'A lovely puzzle game with a simple story to go along with the wonderful
      colours and excellent design.  This is a game for jigsaw puzzle fans.  There
      are only six separate pictures, and the challenge comes from playing with more
      and more pieces.  The artwork is outstanding, especially if you like the fantasy
      genre (wizards in particular).  This game could be suitable for younger players
      at the 135-piece level; however, there is enough depth to entertain experienced
      puzzlers.


      Pros:

      - art design

      - puzzle design (clearly thought went into how the light effects add to challenge
      and interest)

      - control design (you can play "bare bones" for a challenge, or use a number
      of available sorting presets to make things faster or easier)

      - very nice music

      - Steam achievements


      Cons:

      - limited number of images

      - no "creative" achievements (simple completion achievements)


      Overall:  If you enjoy doing puzzles in the virtual world, this game is worth
      adding to your library.  It lacks complexity as a game, but is well-designed
      for doing jigsaw puzzles.  The music is a plus.'
