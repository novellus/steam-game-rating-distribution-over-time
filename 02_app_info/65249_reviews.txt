This old pack comes with standard scenarios and they didn't find them.\n\nWhy you could want to pick up this pack:\n1) You have Hagen-Siegen and ideally Seebergbahn (DLC, not workshop), you like them and want more scenarios.\n2) You like this era. You are happy to create your own scenarios and browse the workshop. Between this, the E-18, the 103, you have a good start. Mixing with two-axle UK equipment might be a stretch, but might work in yards.\n3) You want an intermediate version of the 151. Much better sounds, interesting liveries, but not the expensive Pro version.\n4) You want something different from the usual rolling stock supplied with most German routes.","timestamp_created":1609331730,"timestamp_updated":1609331730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5azp2fYCdtHhvgI="}
