Turns out a blend of simple rpg tactics, greek history, and anime actually works as a combo.  It was truly a pleasant surprise.  The story is decent, the setting is unique, and the game mechanics are straightforward, which make it well worth it's price tag.  The game is a simple, fun, diversion.\n\nMy only complaint is that there is not - more - available.  The game is great for it's price, but I genuinely want to pay more so that there is more game, if that makes sense.  The art style and game mechanics are just fine, but what I would love more of is a longer story, more battles, and a more fleshed out conversation system.  Basically a larger RPG based in the story's setting.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the developers did a great job making a unique property that is fun to play.","timestamp_created":1602683281,"timestamp_updated":1602683281,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45sPXk/UCde7opwI="}
