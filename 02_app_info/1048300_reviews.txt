Game is bland as far as VR rhythm games go. The music is generally mediocre and too scattered across different genres to consistently appeal to players. There is nothing innovative about the gameplay that would make this a better pick over the dozens of other rhythm games already out there that actually have developers that give a shit about their own games.","timestamp_created":1605314616,"timestamp_updated":1605314616,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwrKON4vUCf7ucrgI="}
