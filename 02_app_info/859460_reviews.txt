Also because I only made it a bit farther into the game before I found myself in a room I cannot leave from, I was sent to talk to a prisoner, and even after talking with him I am still completely stuck.\n\nFrom the very little I experienced I gotta say the graphics for being as simplistic as they are, are actually fairly pretty, the combination of basic geometric shapes and the more advanced and detailed lighting is quite a nice contrast, the animation is also quite nice (from what I've seen which is just a walking animation that is).  Though there is a wealth of small issues that don't directly impact the gameplay but definitely need to be fixed, the biggest one is making it so the sound setting in the menu actually changes the volume, as it currently does not.\n\nYea, so hopefully the developer is active and can get the game working as I would like to be able to provide a full review of the game, as of now, definitely avoid it.","timestamp_created":1528916317,"timestamp_updated":1529001947,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545591473579406738","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ498Xn/+MCcIj0ogE="}
