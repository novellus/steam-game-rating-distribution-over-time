    review: "[h1] Needs more Juice! [/h1]\n\nI purchased this game to play with my\
      \ other friend and loved what it had to offer. The developer has already addressed\
      \ the issue of having a small player base and that is fine as of now. However,\
      \ The game is also well optimised for low-end desktops/laptops and I had no\
      \ issues with connectivity. The game had numerous surprising moments which made\
      \ me and my friend laugh. In a nutshell, it was thrilling, exhilarating and\
      \ unique. \n\nThe game had a minor issue too:\n- Camera angles as the player\
      \ grew in size XD\n\nTo conclude, the game has a lot of potential to grow as\
      \ a whole. And one must give it a try."
