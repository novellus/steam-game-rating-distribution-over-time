      will frustrate and punish you in the beginning but reward you with the feeling

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">The Controls</h2>The controls for Just Ski are borrowed
      from an old, abandoned game called Ski Stunt Simulator. <br><br><br>Your only
      control over the skier is to move your mouse down to make him crouch or up to
      make him extend. It''s a very simple to understand mechanic but requires a healthy
      amount of practice to master. <br><br>The key to success with Just Ski is learning
      to control your rotation while in the air.  It''s all about gaining a feel for
      the conservation of angular momentum:  crouch to spin faster, extend to spin
      slower.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/740230/extras/JustSkiPlus_RedDoubleJumpFullSpeed.gif?t=1606041702"

      Curve</h2><br>Like learning to ride a bike, Just Ski is going to feel clunky

      \ you have to learn how to estimate your rotational speed, crouch, land, to\
      \ not bounce, and so on. When you start landing jump after jump, it feels good.\u201D\

      your mouse up and down to control your skier's posture and initiate jumps. Stick
      the landings. Get to the cabin.
