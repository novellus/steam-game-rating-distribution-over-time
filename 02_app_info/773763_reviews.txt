When I am confronted by the orbment screen however, I feel a certain pang of loneliness seeing as my old arcus are gone. As you can see, this DLC gives you arcus covers. The ARCUS covers are golden in color. This is not to be confused with the color yellow. These are indeed gold. They are applied to your ARCUS portable battle orbment and make you feel happy when you go to change your Attack 1 quartz to an Attack 2 Quartz. Buy this, and have good fun times.","timestamp_created":1527745470,"timestamp_updated":1527745470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":22,"weighted_vote_score":"0.415735304355621338","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw47uu2uMCc6reoQE="}
