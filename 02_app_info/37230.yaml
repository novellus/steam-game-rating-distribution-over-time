    review: This game is really fun IF you can play it.  Lately it crashes just minutes
      into the game.  It locks up everything so that I have to reboot my computer.  Do
      not pay money for this game.  You might not be able to play it.  If they were
      to fix it, it is a fun older type game to play.
