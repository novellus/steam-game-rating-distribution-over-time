    review: "    Monster Mix might be one of the best games I've ever played. It uses\
      \ a very interesting set of game mechanics, & I would say revolutionizes the\
      \ Mix genre of games. I think that as far as games on my steam account go, Monster\
      \ Mix might be one of the most well made, as it is simply has an incredibly\
      \ high quality of production. It impresses me, honestly, that the developers\
      \ of Monster Mix put so much time into a game, made it so good, put so much\
      \ into it, & ultimately decided to only sell it for a measly dollar. That the\
      \ developers would be so gracious to us is honestly amazing, & it baffles me\
      \ that they decided to grace our lives with this magnum opus of gaming for such\
      \ an impressively low price.\n    I would argue that this game alone is more\
      \ worth buying than likely any other game, including games on other services\
      \ beside steam. I genuinely suggest this game if you're looking for a game with\
      \ a heavy story & immersive content, & even if you're a more casual player,\
      \ just looking for some fun, I would nonetheless suggest this masterpiece for\
      \ its incredibly intense & riveting game play loop.\n    One might pass by this\
      \ game when scrolling & think of it merely as a shameless cash grab from the\
      \ developers, to capitalize on the recent rush of players into the world of\
      \ Mix games. I wholeheartedly suggest this game to any player looking for a\
      \ high quality & possibly eye-opening experience."
