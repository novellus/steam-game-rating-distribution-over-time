    review: This haunting little novella is really a gem. It reads like a love letter
      to HP Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe. It's a compulsive read for sure. What I
      particularly love is how this story ties into the events of Caliban Below...
      there are things here that hint at the VR experience, but the two together are
      really greater than the sum of the parts.  It's clear that Blackthorn has huge
      ambitions for storytelling, and if they succeed in bringing this project to
      fruition in totality, it will stand a chance of defining the genre.
