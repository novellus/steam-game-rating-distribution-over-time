It's easy to work with and it works great. I had very time consuming problems exporting the video files, but it helped to disable the hardware acceleration under Settings/Preferences. With that solved I was very happy with the software, so I decided to buy some of the DLC, but wasn't able to, because I had to own The Movavi Video Editor Plus 2021. I then bought The Movavi Video Editor Plus 2021 and a couple of DLC packs just to find out, that it's exactly the same program as the video editor in The Movavi Suite 2021 Steam Edition just with the ability to install the DLC packs. So now I have two Video editors installed. One with and one without DLC packs. That makes me feel a bit like a fool and I think Movavi should be ashamed of themselves for their greediness. Sorry, but I can't recommend buying the Movavi Video Suite 2021 Steam Edition unless You want to feel like a fool.","timestamp_created":1609960986,"timestamp_updated":1609960986,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2eLJ7PYCfIuLwQI="}
