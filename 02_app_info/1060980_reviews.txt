At first I was a bit worried I would get sick driving around on the scooter, but that hasn't been a problem. There is no time limit to complete tasks, so I'm able to explore the town as much as I want. The animals and locals help bring the town to life.  Would be cool if I could visit the local pizza shop for a slice and gas up my bike also. This game has a lot of potential. The town is small, but the mountain region and beach fronts are large. Hope to see more uses of the beach, maybe a paddle board lol.","timestamp_created":1570415378,"timestamp_updated":1570415378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw5Z+D0u0CfrvW0wE="}
