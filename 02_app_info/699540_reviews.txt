So never buy this for action, there is none.\n\nThe game looks pretty good, the narration and story hold up very well... But the performance here is zero, the game is pretty unoptimized(not even getting 60fps most of the time).\n\nGive it a shot if you like these kind of games, but I'd wait for a discount(full price is too much).","timestamp_created":1609688742,"timestamp_updated":1609688742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh5+75PYCfL+NwAI="}
