You basically spend 10 minutes shooting at 1 demon and I honestly thought I was doing something wrong because it took so long for anything to happen. Mr Staypuft eventually shows up which is awesome, but fighting him is pretty nondescript and uninteresting, and the controls reference is also using the Playstation Move controller so you can't actually look at the real controls. Ghostbusters does deserve a proper VR game, and this is kind of a neat glimpse, but oculd have been better.","timestamp_created":1576407316,"timestamp_updated":1576407316,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4tbMhO8Cc8e95AE="}
