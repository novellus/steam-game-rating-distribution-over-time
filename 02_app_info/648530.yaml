    review: 'This is more of a ''maybe'' recommendation, but when you come down to
      it that''s essentially a ''no''.


      First, the good:  The parts of this book that are like an ordinary Choice of
      Games book (which is, in terms of volume, most of it), are decent.  Allying/betraying
      the pirates, getting to know the crew, inscrutable aliens, and building up a
      powerbase: all good.


      But, several times throughout the book, you''ll be asked a brainteaser.  E.g.
      one of those "what number comes next in this series" questions.  And then you,
      personally, have to figure it out and answer.  It doesn''t matter that your
      character''s a world-class hacker whose brain could run circles around anyone
      else on board, you have to do these problems yourself (or, for some of them,
      use google).


      These segments are mostly toward the beginning and end, but every time they
      come up it completely kills the momentum of the story.  It pulled me out of
      the "enjoying the experience" groove and into "oh goody math homework".  And
      toward the end you''ll be enduring four or five in a row as the aliens seek
      to test your knowledge (and again, not that of your character''s).


      In short, it''s a decent book made worse by some very jarring distractions.'
