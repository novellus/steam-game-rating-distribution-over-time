My computer has a 3.6Ghz quad-core Intel with 16 Gb of ram and a G-Force 970 gtx, so not top of the line in any way or form but still it runs games like star citizen without a problem. This game however is choppy in movement and no tool-tips whatsoever. I felt like I was sitting on my old Intel 186 trying to run duke nuke'em smoothly... It DESPERATLY needs optimization. I played the ARK alpha and it was way smoother than this \"game\". Now I am going to see if at least the uninstaller and refund works on it...","timestamp_created":1603849706,"timestamp_updated":1603849706,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475140362977981567","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwoYu5tvUCc9XHqgI="}
