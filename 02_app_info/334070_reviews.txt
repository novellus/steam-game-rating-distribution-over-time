The thing is this game does not offer anything besides the horror cliches and boring, useless exploration in the area where is nothing to explore. Not a single fresh idea, not a tiny drop of originality that would spark an interest.\nI can agree that, in theory, this game could be interesting for someone with very little gaming experience, for someone who is absolutely new for the horror genre. As for the people who have already played dozens of both good and bad horror games... nah, just skip it for something worthy.","timestamp_created":1426575382,"timestamp_updated":1608314117,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.457174628973007202","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uLu/u/YCdJH6OA=="}
