    review: This is a pretty funny and cute little game. It does feel like it's meant
      to be on a tablet or one of those over sized aracade games, like how they have
      fruit ninja as an arcade game. It's bright and colorful and great for kids.
      It's not that deep and won't last too long, but the characters designs are fun
      enough.
