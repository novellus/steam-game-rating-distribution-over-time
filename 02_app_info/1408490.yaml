    review: 'Mario Cart 64 B.C. baybee! Love the idea around this.


      But in all honesty this game is low quality garbage.. which is quite apparent
      after watching the gameplay video. I had a pretty rough time even getting through
      the first level. Too easy & boring. That being said, I knew what I was getting
      in to and still want to reward the devs for good behavior (the idea not the
      execution).


      This game needs:


      Multiplayer - Everything bad about this experience would be excusable if you
      could play with others, Bonus: Let us yell insults as we ride by each other.


      Better physics/gameplay - At least let me physically whip the horses to speed
      them up with my offhand instead of simply hearing the sound when you boost (I
      respect horses irl & don''t condone whipping them).


      Better UI - The UI rectangle stuck to the offhand really puts a damper on my
      experience as I wave to the Plebs in the audience.


      Better Immersion - What''s with team ''red'', ''blue'', ''green'', etc? Why
      not make it Romans, Gauls Thracians, Numidians, etc.


      Sound - This might be my biggest issue: What the hell is up with the music..
      It''s terrible. Not even remotely evocative of ancient Rome. Let''s get some
      drums, horns, flutes, or something. The music is trash and makes me very sad.
