      \ - This is a set of games for brain training. Just a few minutes a day will\
      \ help you improve your memory, attention, speed of decision making, etc. Improve\
      \ your brain and compare your results with other people!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Memory Lamp</h2>This training develops spatial working memory. This helps to\
      \ better navigate in space, remember where in the parking lot you left the car,\
      \ how to get to the library, etc.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Memory Comparison</h2>This\
      \ training increases working memory and fluid intelligence. It is used in neurophysiological\
      \ studies to stimulate the activity of certain areas of the brain, as well as\
      \ in psychology to assess and develop working memory, logical thinking, the\
      \ ability to concentrate and, in general, fluid intelligence.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Attention Symmetry</h2>The trainer develops attention and speed of decision-making.\
      \ Reading an image with an ever-changing color and shape positively affects\
      \ visual perception, attention, and decision-making speed, and an ever-increasing\
      \ level of complexity increases efficiency. Just a few minutes, a couple of\
      \ times a day, will bring your eyes in tone and improve your attention to detail.\
      \ It is recommended to perform a workout before work, which requires a lot of\
      \ concentration.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Find The Unique</h2>The game improves concentration\
      \ of attention, which helps to allocate the desired figure from the background\
      \ and to keep this object, in turn, it increases the focus on different tasks,\
      \ the fulfillment of goals and the completion of tasks to the end.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Speed Comparison</h2>The game is aimed at training the speed of reaction\
      \ and thinking. There is a myth that the reaction rate is the same for all,\
      \ but it is not. You can easily verify this. It is enough to pass the test to\
      \ determine the speed of reaction with friends or relatives. You will notice\
      \ that it is different. Even one person during the day shows a different reaction\
      \ rate. Another myth says that the reaction rate can not be improved. This is\
      \ also not so. A lot of research confirms that the reaction is significantly\
      \ increased due to exercise.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Color Comparison</h2>The game\
      \ develops the ability to suppress inappropriate responses that interfere with\
      \ targeted actions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Speed Symmetry</h2>This exercise is\
      \ for brain training, which improves memory and intellectual analysis. You will\
      \ need to decide whether the displayed figure is symmetrical on the Y axis.\
