You can't change keybindings, you have limited resolutions to choose from, and if you're like me and hate the tearing from missing vsync, well vsync is off and you'll need to make driver config to have it on in this game.\nAnd the game itself, well, you start at a beach I guess. The whole environment looks kinda weird here, not to mention the sea itself which looks like a living blob. The graphics is really poor, yet, it runs bad. Then you run towards the forest or one of the sides of the beach in hope to find something else than invisible walls, but you'll get disappointed. At other points you can walk through solid walls of rock, so I guess that makes up for it.\nI feel there hasn't been much work put into the movement either, with its 1 frame ducking. \nWouldn't recommend it even if it was free.","timestamp_created":1587495127,"timestamp_updated":1587497068,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.688249409198760986","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3tyMz/ECeqnEggI="}
