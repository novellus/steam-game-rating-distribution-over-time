It's more like a choppy android game that someone developer pooped out over a weekend than a real game. Just look at the UI graphics and tell me it doesn't immediately come off as a default stock option from some dime-a-dozen \"build a game\" program. The developer does seem to try, but their efforts are put in the wrong place, because the \"main menu\" is just straight up clunky and drives home the point of \"just because you can, doesn't mean you should\". The game sets a very poor first impression, and it only goes downhill from there.","timestamp_created":1544351200,"timestamp_updated":1549479610,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533472239971160889","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6dCL4ugCfLPutAE="}
