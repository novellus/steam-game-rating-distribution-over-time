    review: "This VN is alot of fun..\n\nYoi is a live wire,, Lenna is cute and Kika\
      \ is fun, some of the things I wish \nyou could have had done to Sol grrrr.\n\
      \nIt was good to see the growth of the 3 girls mainly, though you do get some\
      \ growth on Sol,\nJade,, lol,, a womanizer but a nice person and a crook who\
      \ helps you out His sister, though \nVery cute, has brother issues and he hates\
      \ it.\n\nI got the Lenna Ending,, I was surprised to find that Kika was crazy\
      \ for me to and I could have \npicked her, BUT I had wanted Lenna from the start..\
      \ Yoi makes it Obvious early on that She \nherself wants you,, but I never went\
      \ her way like that, only ever friends and I protected Lenna.\n\nChoices do\
      \ play a part in the story.. I dont knwo what affect it has on the Dance Ending\
      \ choices..\n\nThough a little while before that is a HUGE issue where you need\
      \ to be careful with your choices.\n\nHave Fun being a cute Lupide,,, Yes Faye,\
      \ Your Character IS Very cute.\n\nWell Recommended and I want her Continuing\
      \ Story Please,,\n\nps: Now playing the free Dlc's"
