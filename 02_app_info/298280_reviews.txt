It's more like these old school 8-bit shooters from years ago.\n\nYou collect random upgrades by killing bosses and these stay on your account forever. That sounds like a good thing, but that means meaningful upgrades are very far between and none of them really gives the player that much of an advantage either. All levels are basically the same: a few waves of suicidal enemies and a boss fight at the end, each level with increasing difficulty.\n\nGraphics, sound, music, everything is simple and it already looks a bit dated. Although the sound effects do have a good oomph to them.\n\nThe UI is also very basic and has its issues. After switching from 4k to 1080p, the game can't be switched back to a higher resolution because of how it shows all options: an unscrollable block of text that doesn't fit on screen anymore. The game also crashes once in a while and support seems to be long gone.\n\nAnd don't get fooled by the trailer on the store page. It requires hours on hours to get close to that level of upgrades.\n\nQuite bad.","timestamp_created":1608844613,"timestamp_updated":1609000202,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8dX4z/YCesnwvAI="}
