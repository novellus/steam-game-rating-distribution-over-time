    short_description: As daily life goes on unchanged, the girls - and Haruto - continue
      to sharpen their fangs. They are summoned for a mission of unprecedented scale,
      against the religious organization &quot;TFA&quot;, where Enishi and Kuroe await.
      What kind of hellish scenes will Arisaka have to face on the battlefield?
