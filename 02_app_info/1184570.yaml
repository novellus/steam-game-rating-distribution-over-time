    about_the_game: You play as a young thief who broke into the wrong house, he thought
      the place was empty because he saw the owners leaving with suitcases, but there
      was still somebody in the house. It could be dangerous so you have to get out
      fast. But the house is kind of weird, every door and every window is locked,
      it feels like a cage. Maybe the owners were trying to keep somebody locked down.
      Your main goal is to escape the house as fast as possible by unlocking doors
      and solving puzzles.
