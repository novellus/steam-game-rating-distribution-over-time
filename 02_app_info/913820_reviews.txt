However, the game falls flat due to this game being released about 2-3 years before it was ready. \n\n- There are bugs all over the place and the game crashes repeatedly.\n- There isn't much to do. There aren't enough organizations or teams. This game really should have been a free beta where he asked people what he could improve upon in the game.\n- The game is not in-depth enough. It needs more story lines. It just needs more, honestly.\nThe developer has pretty much given up on it and so nothing is going to change. Don't buy it and let someone else make their own game or try WMMA.","timestamp_created":1603855084,"timestamp_updated":1603855084,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwns3NtvUCcoLJqgI="}
