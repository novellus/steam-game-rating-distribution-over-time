The developer removed the exe from the game to fix it, so anyone that purchased the game could not play it for months. I have never seen anyone disable the game for months to fix it, while people pay for a broken product. Then he banned me for \"hate\", or rather me pointing out his incompetence. Then he removed my thread from the forum which did not break any forum rules (the thread simply stated the lack of exe in the game which other people also pointed out). I have never been treated so poorly as a customer in my life. After all that I have been through with this broken game, he bans me for being somewhat critical of his endless excuses and selling a product with no exe (for over 2 months now).\n\nAnyway here is my old review for the game when it worked...\n\n\n[b] The Eerie Adventures Of Kally [/b] plays somewhat like a roguelite, although the decision making aspect is almost nonexistent, as such the game is little more than a button masher. I really like artstyle due to its aesthetic and detail, but I can't play it for more than 30 minutes because glitches always reset my progress. I already restarted 5 times because I had 3 crashes and 2 other glitches. Sometimes the enemy might leave the stage or controls could stop responding, if that happens you might as well restart the game. \n\nIt is possible to set the game to fullscreen and remove black boarders, but the game menus have some weird glitches that could complicate the process. Aside from all of the technical issues, I think the developer needs to add those basic roguelite elements, you know like picking 1 of the 3 bonuses every so often. There are some randomly generated elements to the gameplay, such as running into random loot. However, the game generally does not give you a choice between one or the other, that \"risk vs reward\" aspect is missing.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ interesting artstyle and stage design\n+ unexpected gameplay elements \n+ decent story and some funny jokes\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- frequent crashes\n- numerous glitches\n- some issues with controls and menu \n- needs more decision making \n- bad enemy AI\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: Kind of Broken [/b]\n\nI think this game has a lot of potential and I really love the aesthetic, but there are too many technical issues. Right now I can't even play for 30 minutes without running into a serious glitch. If you really like roguelites and cartoon animation, keep it on a wishlist and see if developer can address the problems. This is a game that I could enjoy if it was in better condition.\n\n[code]Review By: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]","timestamp_created":1527904482,"timestamp_updated":1540416545,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515410542488098145","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1541266285,"developer_response":"You are the only one who got banned, because i felt no respect by your part, the only person that i faced and treated patiently, and cost me a lot.\n\nYou don't break any rule, but you just treating me and my game like garbage, and i will not accept that, at least, i have respect to left your review here, and let the people know about the things, and keep working until maybe one day, your review turn possitive, because at least i keep going foward and solving problems.\n\nYou are hateful, not for being critical, but for being disrespectful to me, i'm still here working, and talking with valve.\n\nIf you have never been treated so poorly as a customer like that, i never been treated this bad by a customer.  I know it was a bad decision, and i solved it.\n\nIf you show me, that i'm wrong, and that you have some respect at me and the game. i will not only unban you, but also you gain my respect, because i still thinking you are great at criticism like you show in your reviews. Cause i still want to do the things well, so please, don't be rude at me anymore. \n\nYou have been unbanned, i am nice person, it hurts me when people do this things, and i know the failure about not talk with valve at the moment of the exe problem. but i expect good behaviour by your part, anyway, i keep it up working hard.
