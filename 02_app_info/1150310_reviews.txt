Consists of only 3 maps that last about 3 minutes each. The entire \"content\" of this game can be played in 10 minutes. You just propel yourself forward and (poorly) turn with by tilting your head, collecting some coins along the way that are absolutely meaningless. Oh, and after each coin collection, the narrator gives you words of encouragement that get old after exactly 0.034 seconds.\n\nFor perhaps the only decent skiing game that's currently out, download the environment for the SteamVR Home called \"downhill skiing\". It's also free, unlike this travesty I'm reviewing.","timestamp_created":1593569887,"timestamp_updated":1593569887,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.603092789649963379","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sdiKhPMCfa3mkQI="}
