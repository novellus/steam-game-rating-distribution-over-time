February 7th, 2018 is when the next update is released adding the next chapter of the story.\n\nWhile the game is still in early access, a couple of things I've noticed is that the Dev is very active and tends to issues immediately. The game is constantly being worked on which is nice to see. The dev also appears to be very friendly and informative if you look at their update posts or follow them on Social Media. \n\nWhile the game IS in early access and what's available to play is limited, my time spent playing Yoltrund was nothing short of enjoyable. The music was a nice fit to set the feel of the game, the sound effects were well done, and the graphics bring back nostalgia in the best way.\n\nAfter playing through the first part, I'm intrigued by what's going on and I enjoyed the ability to make some choices in the beginning that I believe will effect the outcome of the future as I play this game. I look forward to playing more of it as it's released and I think for the price, you really can't go wrong with showing support for Templarius Studios.\n\nWell done on your release and I will definitely be playing more of Yoltrund when the February 7th update becomes available!","timestamp_created":1517557308,"timestamp_updated":1568436953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525913000106811523","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4+pOIl+0CebbilwE="}
