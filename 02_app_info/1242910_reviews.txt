Whilst wandering home you find the abandoned home of a man who had it all. Except the one thing he needed the most. Kind of brings you up short and reminds you having it all isn't worth it if there is never any time to enjoy it or those you love.\n\nEDIT: The true beauty of this game comes from  reading the dairies and absorbing the story. Then wandering the beautiful surroundings you know the man who lived there missed. There are lakes, ponds, silken waterfalls and peaceful trails. There are pretty spots all around to just relax in. \n\nTake in the view from the glass house, walk the trails and visit the waterfalls. Wander all over the map and see what natural treasures you find.","timestamp_created":1607222971,"timestamp_updated":1607276538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwibXJnPYCceLTtwI="}
