    short_description: Turn on the lights and light up your life! This game is a variation
      of the &quot;Lights Out&quot; games of the 90s. Each light you turn on changes
      the state of the adjacent lights. Can you turn on all the lights?

    review: Fun, simple, and yet surprisingly challenging-- and the music has no reason
      to go as hard as it does, but it legitimately slaps anyway.
