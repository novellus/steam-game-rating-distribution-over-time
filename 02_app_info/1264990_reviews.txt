To be able to perform in this game, i needed 16k dpi + unlimited fps. And the thing with unlimited fps is the game doesnt cap them so you get to 2700 fps and your pc is burning since its not optimised well (2060 i5 9600 etc so not bad specs) If you try to cap the fps with nvidia setting for example, You won't be able to control the ball at 16k dpi and it just won't work.\n","timestamp_created":1607887794,"timestamp_updated":1607887794,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548387110233306885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9ZXlrvYCeq/2uQI="}
