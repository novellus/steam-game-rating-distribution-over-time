    review: A unique setting and an interesting premise. However the characters seem
      pretty two-dimensional, and the plot short and very disjointed and need some
      smoothing over. There are certainly worse Choice of Games stories and this one
      isn't great, but if you like being a 18th century bounty hunter then it'll be
      for you.
