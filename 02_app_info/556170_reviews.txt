I never played drums and I had a blast! 25 minutes of just playing first time!\n\nThe music is in sync from what I can see and hear! \nthe fun starts right away! The music was new to me and liked it! \nYou can adjust the drums in all dimensions on the move it's lots of fun! Highly recommend!\n\nThink of guitar hero! Colored Orbs that matches the drums Colors come down towards the drums, in the distance! \n\nAfter a few minutes you will be drumming away waiting for those orbs to fall so that you can  hit that beat!\n\ndifferent setting from beginner to expert!  Many songs to choose from plus you get a score board to keep up!\n\nThank you for this game!","timestamp_created":1485850217,"timestamp_updated":1485850894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw66vn+dkCcrz1cA=="}
