    review: 'will i be able to write a review considering i refunded it last year?


      well i was very much enjoying it... until i realised there was nothing to come
      after the *battle*... in a way i am almost glad it hasn''t progressed AT ALL...
      and that people are still trying to *wake up the devs*


      Even on offer i would give this one a miss guys... safe to say its abandonned
      and tell you to move along FAST!'
