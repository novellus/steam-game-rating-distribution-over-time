Can't get past a level because your ship is underpowered?  Go back and grind the easier levels for resources.  Grinding is made super bad because the levels are all basically the same, all equally non-rewarding - nothing happens other than the same types of enemies shooting the same types of stuff at you - there are no in-level powerups, nothing exciting in the levels themselves - you just slug to the end, and see if you farmed any components to get the next upgrade that the game thinks you are entitled to at this stage of the game.  Could have been heaps better with a few tweaks in the design.","timestamp_created":1606814878,"timestamp_updated":1606814878,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk6nojvYCdbuntgI="}
