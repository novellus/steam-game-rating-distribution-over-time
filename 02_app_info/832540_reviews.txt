Better interface design. Puzzles are less convoluted, or at least more obvious. The voice acting is much better, specifically in regards to Nicole. The story is a wild trek, but plays fast and loose. Wishing there was more of Nick, but you can't have everything. IDK why this Mulder wannabe is my fav side character, but I adore his weird ex machina bullshit. The music is very good and not annoying. Sound is a bit loud and requires some custom fiddling. Ran into one game crashing bug, but turning the graphical settings down fixed it. Overall a solid adventure game. Would play again.","timestamp_created":1606970321,"timestamp_updated":1606970321,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hqW5k/YCfZb1tgI="}
