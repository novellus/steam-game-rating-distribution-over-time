The story isn't shallow, don't be fooled by the supernatural premise, it's mature and delves into human psychology, behaviourism and mental illness. Beautiful portray of life in essence, where we're often misunderstood, hurt, haunted by experiences from the past, unable to reciprocate love and communicate to one another.\n\nVery pleasant to look at art style, I usually don't capture so many screenshots to look at them later and admire the work authors put into these drawings. Good soundtrack with fitting ambient atmosphere, although you could feel the limited budget here - please use more sound effects / background music in the future.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this one.\n\nedit: So few reviews, game not even rated. What a shame, such a unique experience.","timestamp_created":1599092823,"timestamp_updated":1606398073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iquygvYCf9q4nwI="}
