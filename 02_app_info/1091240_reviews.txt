If we get access to a wider view and tracks snapping together, it would be a better proposition. A game that needs time to mature and so, I will wait and hope. UPDATE:  It is probably just me. I cannot get the track to join properly. I created a layout and put a train on it. It would not go past the first joint. I assume that means the tracks are not connected. Apart from that, it is looking pretty good.","timestamp_created":1586162212,"timestamp_updated":1609985844,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550321221351623535","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwssyo7fYCdffI/gE="}
