That's it.  The attached card game is superfluous and adds nothing to it.  It's the same story no matter what you do.  The only thing that will change is who you lose the opportunity to interact with over time, and that will just be based on who you haven't.  So whoever you chose to romance by the end, they'll probably be safe anyway.  There are different endings, but you can just save before the final choice (which, again, never changes) and do each from that save.","timestamp_created":1561779800,"timestamp_updated":1561779800,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518072307109832764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/JDV0OsCct73xAE="}
