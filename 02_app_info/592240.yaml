    review: "[h1] \"Independence Day (1996 movie) Simulator\", destroying alien ships\
      \ just to protect your beloved USA (i mean, Earth), but in space :). [/h1] \n\
      \nFun little game with acceptable price (current full price is 2,40\u20AC).\
      \ Several stages with number of waves of enemies in them, and your mission is\
      \ to kill them all. Different enemies, different weapons, shield to protect\
      \ yourself, and main boss at the end of the game :) Music is nice, powerful\
      \ enough to keep your adrenaline level high. Visuals are pretty enough regarding\
      \ space, but mixed with \"retro\" style of enemies. But again, for that price,\
      \ not much to complain about. There isn't any story (just basic premise about\
      \ you getting shot and being stranded on a planet, shooting aliens). There's\
      \ still some kind of replayability there, you know, just to relax after work,\
      \ as shooting aliens is sometimes thing you have to do :)\nBig plus for achievements\
      \ also.\n\n[i] PS: you should always support small local developer! [/i]"
