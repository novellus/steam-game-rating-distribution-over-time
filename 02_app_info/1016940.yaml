    developer_response: 'Hey Evan,


      Thank you very much for review and feedback about why you are not enjoying The
      Otterman Empire.


      In regards to Steam Remote Play a large portion of it working is dependent on
      the hosts internet connection so we highly recommend if playing with other people
      the person with the strongest connection host the match.


      In regards to the damage display, we have been listening to the feedback of
      the community and reviews and are working on making this more clearer to players.


      In terms of an online mode we are fully dedicated to supporting The Otterman
      Empire for a long time to come and will update the community once such a feature
      may be on the way.'

    review: The game does a poor job of telling you where damage is coming from and
      why you died, which makes reacting to taking damage difficult. More unfortunately
      though is the lack of online play. It might be fun with friends, but I was completely
      unable to get Steam Remote Play to work properly for the local multiplayer so
      I couldn't tell. This game shows a lot of promise with some fun gamemodes and
      a unique style, but I'm going to wait until they add online multiplayer and
      a bit more polish.
