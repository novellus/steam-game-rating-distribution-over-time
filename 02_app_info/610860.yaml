    about_the_game: You play Sanjuro Makabe, a Mobile Combat Armor (MCA) pilot and
      Commander in the UCA Security Force. The UCA was originally formed by three
      dominant megacorporations (Andra Biomechanics, Armacham Technology Corporation,
      and Shogo Industries). Originally intended as a joint venture that would ensure
      the continued profitability of the three organizations that founded it, the
      UCA is now independent, and the dominant military power in existence.<br>Your
      mission is to locate and assassinate a rebel leader known only as Gabriel. All
      of the action takes place either on the planet Cronus or on the spaceship Leviathan.
      The Leviathan is the flagship of the UCA and is commanded by Admiral Akkaraju.
      Cronus is the only known source of the biologically active material known as
      Kato, an incredibly powerful energy source essential to the process by which
      interstellar travel is possible.<br>Your deadly enemy is The Fallen, a fanatical
      terrorist group lead by the mysterious Gabriel, threatens the balance of power
      on Cronus, and ultimately, control of Kato. You will fight them on your feet
      or from within one of the different types of Mobile Combat Armor, a giant mech
      which can run, duck, strafe, swim or transform into an ultrafast hovertank.<br><br>You
      will know the true power of giant robots!<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Anime-influenced
      graphics and gameplay design<br></li><li>Fight on foot or pilot a giant mech
      in both open and urban environments<br></li><li>An interesting storyline with
      two possible endings</li></ul>

    review: Decided to buy this during the xmas sale after seeing a couple of reviews.
      Once I applied a couple of fixes the game ran perfectly, easily one of the most
      fun experiences I've had in a while. Humor is great and I like the fps elements
      and controlling a mech is pretty fun. Enemy AI can be bullshit at times and
      it clearly wasnt play-tested properly but in my opinion the good outweighs the
      bad. I highly recommend this game for ani fps,mech,anime lover.
