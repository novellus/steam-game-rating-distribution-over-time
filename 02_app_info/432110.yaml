    review: "[h1]Too much wasted potential....[/h1]\n\n\"Back in the day\" I picked\
      \ up 'Echo Tokyo: Intro' for free and although I couldn't recommend the title\
      \ in my review I also stated that it wasn't a bad game or something, just lacking\
      \ in several parts (and the dull narrating voice was in my opinion plain out\
      \ annoying).\n\nAnd here we have the full game. Both games are now normally\
      \ sold and I couldn't help notice that 'Phoenix' sells for almost [i]twice[/i]\
      \ the price as 'Intro'. So imagine my surprise when I managed to successfully\
      \ finish Phoenix in no longer than 20 minutes, while I've been busy with Intro\
      \ for at least 40 - 50 minutes. That's just bizarre...  And it gets worse: I\
      \ own other visual novel games which sell for even less than 'Intro' does while\
      \ they provide an easy 90 minutes worth of gameplay.\n\n[h1]Don't address adult\
      \ subjects if you're not going to follow up![/h1]\n\nThis is the part I plain\
      \ out dislike...  So the main protagonist (Shizume) is looking for a job and\
      \ ends up as an escort, she even allows someone to grope her. However, the pictures\
      \ themselves show absolutely nothing. Heck... even 'Intro' was more naughty\
      \ than this game.\n\nWhy bother to bring up adult topics like escort services\
      \ if you're not going to follow up on them with the animations? That's just\
      \ bad...  Keep in mind though: I'm not necessarily looking for b00bies here,\
      \ but [i]you (devs)[/i] opened the door to it and then you don't deliver.\n\n\
      And that's where my \"wasted potential\" comment came from, this could have\
      \ easily been avoided. For example... instead of doing escort you could have\
      \ made Shizume apply for job as a (semi-) erotic dancer. She'd had to dress\
      \ up in a skimpy outfit (which could easily be displayed because it would be\
      \ less revealing than her undies) and perform in public which could then embarrass\
      \ her a little bit. \n\nIt seems to me as if the game wanted the 'adult tease'\
      \ but without doing the work for it, and yah, I think that's the cheap and easy\
      \ way out.\n\n[h1]In conclusion....[/h1]\n\nIt's really a shame because this\
      \ game honestly has [u]a lot[/u] of potential, it really does. The drawings\
      \ are very solid, some truly manage to create the right atmosphere for the story.\
      \ I also enjoyed the music that's been used, very fitting for the genre.\n\n\
      But it's just bizarre that a game which easily costs twice as much as its predecessor\
      \ (or demo?) provides a lot less contents, so much that it's easily noticeable.\n\
      \nI don't hate on this title, I also don't think it's bad or something, but\
      \ I simply cannot recommend this to others for reasons shared above.\n\nThanks\
      \ for reading!"
