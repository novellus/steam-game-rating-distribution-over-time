    review: This is a brilliant game, however it didnt work for me on Windows 10.
      The resolution was clipped (right side was covered where all the accept/cancel
      buttons tend to be), and scrolling in menus is laggy. There is a community patch
      to resolve windows 10 issues. The patch is basically somebodys shoddy dll files
      to override local ones. They solved the scrolling issue for me, but not the
      clipped resolution. Sadly, unplayable, but others have had luck with it.
