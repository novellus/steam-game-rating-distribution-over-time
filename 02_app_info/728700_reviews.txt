Boston Logan is one of the world's busier International airports and It handles diverse traffic from huge A380s,747s A340s and 777s & also small sight seeing & local commuter jets from Cape Air & loads of business travelers in private jets hopping the 45 mins to NY or a bit more for DC. The two things that  make Boston stand out imho however are the runway configurations & it's location. It's one of the few airports adjacent to the city's downtown with it's skyscrapers right next to the field and also is right on the ocean. KBOS has touchdown zones lower than 20' ASL. You can look out over Boston harbor the Atlantic and turn slightly as see the urban center. As far as game play, however it's the multiple crossing runways that make this one of the best. There'are 2 04/22s, an 09/27, two 15/33s including a short GA 2557' one. Six total options yet only *one* that has no runway intersecting it. It's tremendous fun and can provide so many different arrival & departure scenarios so it can feel different every time you play it. I found myself not getting bored unlike what happens to me fairly quickly with the large parallel airfields. With Boston a wind shift can make a drastically different experience with complex taxi routes to also ponder as you shift traffic.Turn on some snow and it's awesome.  Give it a shot & I don't think you'll be disappointed.","timestamp_created":1608104231,"timestamp_updated":1608104231,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4heietfYCeuLRugI="}
