      /><br><br>Japan, Aichi Prefecture, Central Nagoya. <br> One day in July, just
      before the summer break, Yuuma Takise, an introvert student who was experiencing
      a solitary and gloomy high school life, encountered a strange creature named
      Belb. <br>He could float, slip through walls, and even make things appear out
      of thin air... Belb, who nonchalantly showed off these strange powers, asked
      Yuuma to search for a certain game cartridge. <br>Just what was on this game
      cartridge--? <br><br><strong>Details</strong> <br><br> Yuuma Takise, the protagonist,
      was a regular boy in senior high school. However, due to his extreme shyness
      and poor communication skills he was disliked by his classmates. <br>His one
      and only hobby was to play video games. However, he didn't play them with others.
      Instead he would play them at home, or occasionally go down to the local arcade
      by himself. <br>However, he became involved with his classmate, Ayaka Kirisaki,
      as a result of his younger, more sociable sister coming to visit. A worn piece
      of paper he picked up during her visit would end up toying with all their fates...
      <br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Visual novel. <br></li><li>As there is no translator
      working on the game, it is only available in Japanese. <br></li><li>The game
      is approximately 8-10 hours long. </li></ul><br>* The game may not run properly
