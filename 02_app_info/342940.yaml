      \ /><br><br><br><u><strong>GO ON AN ADVENTURE</strong></u><br><br>Project: Gorgon\
      \ is a 3D fantasy MMORPG (massively-multiplayer online role-playing game) featuring\
      \ an immersive experience that allows the player to forge their own path through\
      \ exploration and discovery. We don't guide you through a world on rails, and\
      \ as a result, there are many hidden secrets awaiting discovery. Project: Gorgon\
      \ also features an ambitious skill-based leveling system that bucks the current\
      \ trend of pre-determined classes, allowing the player to combine skills in\
      \ order to create a truly unique playing experience.<br><br><u><strong>AN IMMERSIVE\
      \ WORLD</strong></u><br><br>When you play Project: Gorgon, we want you to feel\
      \ as if you\u2019re immersed in a whole new virtual world. Rather than trying\
      \ to manage this with just graphics and excessive backstory, we\u2019ve designed\
      \ the game with dozens of gameplay features that make you feel like you\u2019\
      re really there interacting with the world, such as: <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"\
      ><li>Each non-player (NPC) you meet has their own goals and interest, and reward\
      \ players that choose to be their friend.<br></li><li>You can drop items on\
      \ the ground, and other players can pick them up. What\u2019s so great about\
      \ that? Imagine laying down a trail of literal (virtual) breadcrumbs to guide\
      \ your friends (or lure your enemies) into the woods. <br></li><li>Shopkeepers\
      \ keep inventory, so you can buy items that other players have sold to them.\
      \ Want to help out new players? Sell your cast-off items to the shopkeeper in\
      \ the new player zone and watch the new players go to town.<br></li><li>If you\
      \ are on fire, you can jump into a lake to put it out. This type of mechanic\
      \ can have a subtle effect on your strategies, especially when you are fighting\
      \ a fire mage! <br></li><li>You can inscribe messages onto items, write books,\
      \ and even leave notes for other players. Make your name as an in-game poet,\
      \ or pronounce your greatness to the world!</li></ul><br><u><strong>UNIQUE EXPERIENCES</strong></u><br><br>In\
      \ Project: Gorgon you kill monsters - a lot of them - and you take their loot.\
      \ In order to keep the experience fun and interesting, we\u2019ve developed\
      \ unique combat experiences to keep the fights feeling fresh. The loot is randomly\
      \ generated, monsters have unique abilities, and dungeons have puzzles, traps,\
      \ and terrifying bosses! The combat skills are entirely free-form. You can learn\
      \ as many combat skills as you want, and use any two of them at the same time\
      \ to create your own personal \u201Cclass.\u201D Project: Gorgon features dozens\
      \ to choose from, including: <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Battle Chemistry:\
      \ Create huge explosions, inject yourself with mysterious mutagens or program\
      \ a pet golem! <br></li><li>Unarmed Combat: Grapple and control enemies using\
      \ a situational-aware combo system that varies based on where you are and what\
      \ day it is. <br></li><li>Animal Handling: Tame animals and train them to become\
      \ ferocious fighters. Then breed your best and sell their offspring to other\
      \ players.<br></li><li>Necromancy: Seek out corpses and graveyards to raise\
      \ an undead army. No graveyard around? Well, there are always the corpses of\
      \ your friends. <br></li><li>Cow: Got turned into a cow by that boss? That sucks.\
      \ But learn some kicks and how to stampede, and you'll be right back out there\
      \ kicking grass in no time! <br></li><li>That\u2019s just a few! There\u2019\
      s also Sword Fighting, Combat Psychology, Staff Fighting, Sigil Scripting, Mentalism,\
      \ and more.</li></ul><br>Player Choices are important in Project: Gorgon. You\
      \ can learn as many skills as you want, but sometimes power comes with downsides.\
      \ You can become infected with lycanthropy and gain access to very powerful\
      \ skill sets. As a lycanthrope, you are able to roam the world in a pack or\
      \ as a lone wolf; however, when there is a full moon (which is tied to the real\
      \ world lunar calendar) you are stuck in your beast form. There\u2019s no cure\
      \ for lycanthropy.<br><br>You can become a Druid - which will give you great\
      \ power, but you have to vow to drop everything when there\u2019s an emergency\
      \ involving nature. It could be a forest fire, a monster invasion or even a\
      \ pesky insect. Nature never lets you ignore your duties, ever. <br><br>New\
      \ opportunists come open, but others will be closed. Can you bear heavy burdens\
      \ in exchange for greater power?<br><br><u><strong>JOIN THE COMMUNITY</strong></u><br><br>The\
      \ community is a critical aspect of Project: Gorgon. We strive to maintain a\
      \ strong, engaged community, supporting our players through:<br><br><ul class=\"\

    review: If you have a low to mid tier pc I really wouldn't recommend it for now.
      Starting area was misleading in regards to system specs I would need, as soon
      as I left it basically became unplayable. I would suggest 8-16 gb Ram minimum
      until it becomes more optimized. I enjoy the systems, and love that their is
      all types of different skills, but for me currently it's basically unplayable.
      I recommend it for people who's computer can handle more demanding games than
      how this appears. Personally I'll wait until it's more out of Early Access.
      I passed the 2 hour mark trying to optimize settings so likely won't be able
      to get a refund either.
