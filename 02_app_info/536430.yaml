    review: "[i]This review is part of my mini-project to review all four of the Johnny\
      \ games.  The Revenge of Johnny Bonasera is a 4-part episodic series by independent\
      \ developer Rafael Garc\xEDa.  The series began in late 2016 and concluded in\
      \ early 2020.  The developer has floated the possibility of doing a fifth game\
      \ at some point in the future, but the series is currently finished; The four\
      \ games that are out tell a complete story with no loose ends.  Each game in\
      \ the series takes about two to three hours to complete, and each successive\
      \ game is a bit larger and more ambitious than the previous entries.\n\nThe\
      \ series follows a physically weak but terribly ruthless young boy.  In the\
      \ first game, which works as a standalone title, Johnny takes revenge on some\
      \ teenaged punks who ruin his sandwich.  The second, third, and forth games\
      \ change course a little bit and follow a whole story arc as Johnny takes revenge\
      \ on some aliens who have abducted his mother.\n\nMy overall impression of the\
      \ series as a whole is positive.  Johnny is not as big or as flashy as many\
      \ other games; but it doesn't feel like it is even trying to compete with those.\
      \  I am writing these reviews on Jan 2, 2020, the day after Adobe Flash officially\
      \ died.  Johnny feels like exactly the kind of game that would have existed\
      \ and thrived as a mega-hit on a site like Newgrounds or Kongregate had it come\
      \ out 15 years earlier.  With the basic cartoonish art style, large and crudely\
      \ animated sprites, vaguely adolescent humor, and simplicity of design, the\
      \ series brings me a certain nostalgia for that era of gaming.[/i]\n\nThis is\
      \ the first entry in the series, and while I like it, I think it is the weakest\
      \ of the bunch.  I know that this particular entry frequently goes on deep discount\
      \ and has even been given away for free, in order to draw players into the series.\
      \  If you would like to buy this to test it out, keep in mind that the best\
      \ bits are still yet to come.  I believe this one was made as Rafael Garc\xED\
      a was still finding his stride as a developer.\n\nIn this entry, Johnny is up\
      \ against three teenaged punks who lightly bully him.  He decides to pay back\
      \ the minor slight by absolutely ruining the bullies' lives.  The punishment\
      \ he doles out is way worse than the initial incident.  While Johnny does some\
      \ real ruthless stuff in all four of the games, he has absolutely no chill at\
      \ all in this one.\n\nThe first entry ends on a cliffhanger that sets up the\
      \ remaining three games in the series.  It also includes a very short but enjoyable\
      \ bonus game, accessible from the main menu, which gives us some backstory for\
      \ one of the game's minor characters.\n"
