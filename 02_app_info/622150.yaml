    review: '20 years ago, you watched as your brother was swallowed by a strange
      mist. No one believed you, save a paranormal researcher. With his help, you
      intend to find your brother. But when dealing with the paranormal, one must
      keep on their guard. You never know what you might find.


      The HO scenes are fun, the minigames entertaining, and the plot thrilling. Worth
      the price.'
