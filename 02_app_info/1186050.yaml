    review: 'I just picked this game up today and I''m glad I did so far.


      Definitely got some nice old school vibes to it.

      It has definitely been a more chill, exploration focused experience. Lots of
      enemies to dodge or wade through, but exploration is definitely the hook here.


      It''s nice to explore around and open new paths after getting stronger. I also
      like the vision system, it creates a sense of claustrophobia/danger as you walk
      through forests or dark caves. The monsters also cry out when you have disturbed
      the peace, which can be ominous with limited vision.


      The level design and music have been pretty great so far and can''t wait to
      see the areas I haven''t been to yet.


      UPDATE:

      I''m like 24+ hours into it and had a blast. I''ve beaten the game a few times
      at different Completion Percentages and there are still a bunch of things I
      haven''t done, yet. For anyone looking for a chill exploration game to rabbit
      hole into, this is a great option.
