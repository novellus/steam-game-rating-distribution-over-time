The game was incredibly fun and simple, and I was able to get the hang of it very quickly. I was excited to see what content the devs added in the future, but that day never came. The game was just abandoned.\n\n[b]WHY NOT RECOMMENDED?[/b]\nAlthough this game is quite fun and entertaining, their are two reasons why I wouldn't advise you to waste your money on this game, even if it's only 99Â¢. First off, the game gets old and repetitive very quick, so you probably won't get more than an hour of gameplay out of this game before you'll lose interest. Secondly, as stated previously, this game is abandoned, and therefore won't be receiving any further updates, and no more updates means no more content for you to play.\n\n[b]FINAL THOUGHTS[b/]\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a fun game to play for an hour or two for really cheap, you've found your game! But if you're looking for a game that gets regular updates, or really and updates at all, this game is probably isn't for you.","timestamp_created":1585610490,"timestamp_updated":1585610490,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiYDwlvECf8HG/AE="}
