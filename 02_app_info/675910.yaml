    review: "[h1] The Metroidvania Review[/h1]\n\n[url=https://metroidvaniareview.com/2018/11/24/visual-out/]\
      \ Scored Summary[/url] |  |                          [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/30503887/]\
      \ Subscribe to our Curator\t[/url]\n\n[b]How Metroidvania is it?[/b]\nMedium\
      \ Fit \u2013 While the level structure and progression is exactly what you\u2019\
      d want from a Metroidvania, \u201Ccombat\u201D is handled in a very unusual\
      \ way.\n\n[url= https://steamcommunity.com/groups/MetroidvaniaReview/discussions/1/1744478429684685223/]\
      \ Want to hear a different opinion, or want to share your own review? Check\
      \ out our Forum here.[/url]\n\n[h1]Full Review[/h1]\n[i]Visual Out[/i] is very\
      \ weird and hard to describe \u2013 though I\u2019m going to make my best attempt\
      \ at doing so. It\u2019s pretty easy to recommend to anyone looking for something\
      \ completely new. On that same token though it had me questioning whether or\
      \ not \u201Cweird\u201D equated to \u201Cfun\u201D. Eventually novelty fades\
      \ away for just about everything, and while [i]Visual Out[/i] might be the gaming\
      \ equivalent of an abstract painting, it still uses the same shapes that make\
      \ up everything else.\n\nThe most novel thing about [i]Visual Out[/i] is that\
      \ it avoids traditional combat entirely, opting instead for the sort of puzzle\
      \ fights you\u2019d expect from a typical [i]Zelda[/i]  game. Your first power\
      \ \u2013 the \u201CCurrent\u201D \u2013 is this line that extends from your\
      \ stick figure\u2019s hand just slowly enough that I can\u2019t call it a whip.\
      \ If the line connects with a compatible object you can move the object anywhere\
      \ you can see on the screen. Objects function exactly as normal, so if you \u201C\
      plug-in\u201D to an enemy, it will still shoot at you or drop its bombs \u2013\
      \ or whatever it normally does. So early on in the game your task is to passive-aggressively\
      \ shove enemies into innocuous locations so you can get where you want without\
      \ taking damage. \n\nThis unusual approach to enemy encounters gets built upon\
      \ nicely as you progress. You get this \u201CJammer\u201D power that creates\
      \ a negative space in your immediate area, and enemies that enter this negative\
      \ space start functioning differently. Often when \u201Cjammed\u201D, they do\
      \ the opposite thing from what they were doing before. Enemies that would create\
      \ large pixels on the screen will start removing them, letting you pass through\
      \ blocked corridors. Poison bottles will start producing items that give you\
      \ energy. It\u2019s very similar to the \u201Cglitch gun\u201D from [i]Axiom\
      \ Verge[/i]  in the sense that every enemy has two states you can deal with,\
      \ except as mentioned before your goal isn\u2019t really to eliminate your foes,\
      \ just to avoid them or use them to your advantage. \n\nBosses of course are\
      \ the exception to this idea of passive-aggressive combat. Each one is a puzzle\
      \ that requires you to use the powers you\u2019ve found to take them apart.\
      \ Most of them are pretty straight forward, but two in particular might have\
      \ you stumped for a few deaths. Generally the bosses are satisfying to figure\
      \ out; even if once you\u2019ve solved the puzzle it might feel like some drag\
      \ on a bit. \n\nWhile the Current power and the Jammer power are the core of\
      \ the gameplay, there are traditional Metroidvania movement powers as well \u2013\
      \ such as the obligatory double jump and a dash ability. All of these come together\
      \ to create a very well-constructed Metroidvania world to explore, which is\
      \ definitely the best and most memorable part of [i]Visual Out[/i]. In fact,\
      \ I\u2019d say that it\u2019s the game\u2019s core challenge. The voice that\
      \ constantly talks to your avatar and the data logs around the computer space\
      \ give this sense of mystery that drives you to keep moving forward \u2013 and\
      \ it\u2019s that kind of mystery that is fun to discuss on forums about what\
      \ it all really means. [i]Visual Out\u2019s[/i] also uses a power supply accessed\
      \ through on/off switches in the world to change your route through the game\
      \ world. This combined with your weird ability to manipulate enemies provides\
      \ a smart and well-designed Metroidvania space. I believe that keeping exploration\
      \ challenging is why Madameberry Games decided to not show your position on\
      \ the game\u2019s map by default. \n\nAt save points you\u2019re given a miniature\
      \ map that shows where you are, but when you\u2019re actually navigating the\
      \ world your more complete start menu map just shows the layout without telling\
      \ you which room you\u2019re in. If you\u2019ve played [i]Hollow Knight[/i]\
      \ and tried to navigate the world without wearing the Compass Charm, you\u2019\
      ll know what this is like. However unlike [i]Hollow Knight[/i] where the friendly\
      \ humming cartographer gives you a map full of environmental markers you can\
      \ use to orient yourself, [i]Visual Out\u2019s[/i] map is more like [i]Super\
      \ Metroid\u2019s[/i] where you\u2019re [i]only[/i]  given squares to represent\
      \ the rooms. This means if you really want to keep track of where you\u2019\
      ve been, you may want to screenshot the in-game map and paste it into MS Paint\
      \ so you can draw your position any time you make a screen transition. I remain\
      \ neutral on this design decision, because I think it can be fun to test your\
      \ memory \u2013 and even use paper \u2013 but some might argue that the game\
      \ would be better if it just did this for you. \n\nGenerally the world layout\
      \ is good enough that I didn\u2019t feel like I needed the map for a non 100%\
      \ playthrough. However, in the late game they require you to explore the whole\
      \ world in order to progress which made this design slightly frustrating. The\
      \ final \u201Cpuzzle\u201D you need to solve requires you to enter 3 symbols\
      \ into this screen, and the only way to know which symbols to use is to enter\
      \ one of six rooms which [i]might[/i] have a symbol. I suspect it\u2019s all\
      \ random making it impossible to use a guide, and since there are so many options\
      \ for symbols, it\u2019s unreasonable to solve it through brute force. I hesitate\
      \ to call this a \u201Cpuzzle\u201D since it really equates to a scavenger hunt\
      \ \u2013 and honestly I think that\u2019s fine for a game where exploration\
      \ is the focus. It\u2019s just that aforementioned less-than-useful map that\
      \ made it a bit of a pain. I personally stumbled across two symbols and had\
      \ wandered more than I was willing to tolerate, so I guessed the final symbol\
      \ through a trial and error process of trying the 24 remaining symbols one at\
      \ a time (I ended up trying 22 of them before getting the right one.) Thus,\
      \ when trying to answer the question of whether [i]Visual Out\u2019s[/i] brand\
      \ of \u201CWeird\u201D equates to \u201CFun\u201D, stuff like this makes me\
      \ hesitate to give it the highest score. I also feel like the puzzles are not\
      \ clever enough to recommend it to those looking for the kind of intellectual\
      \ challenge that something like [i]La-Mulana[/i] could provide. \n\nWith that\
      \ said, [i]Visual Out[/i] is for the most part fun to traverse. In terms of\
      \ atmosphere, there\u2019s nothing quite like it. I think that if you liked\
      \ the cryptic nature of the narrative in games like [i]Axiom Verge[/i], [i]Hollow\
      \ Knight[/i], or the From Software Souls games, and would like to see a game\
      \ centered around only that story-telling aspect, you might find [i]Visual Out[/i]\
      \ appealing. Even if you just want to see something completely different, I\
      \ give [i]Visual Out[/i] a recommendation. \n\n3 out of 5"
