Most are pretty straightforward, though a number have multiple solutions, making it fun to explore and experiment, with a bunch of achievements that encourage finding some of those extra options.\n\nWhile it has a few outstanding bugs and some performance dips here and there, if you're looking for a casual, fun, easy-going, kinda weird puzzle game, give it a shot!\n\nAnd if you get stuck, I've completed a guide to all achievements (look for the level completion achievements for brief walkthroughs to each level).\n\nLastly, thanks to Kyle Bosman of the Easy Allies for introducing me to this game in his stream of it. Do yourself a favour and go check him and the other allies out on YouTube!","timestamp_created":1531923012,"timestamp_updated":1568478184,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544316470623016357","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpLilmO0CfNurpgE="}
