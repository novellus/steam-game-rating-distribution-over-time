    review: "[h1]They say there ain\u2019t no such thing as a good death[/h1]\n\n\
      [h1]Introduction[/h1]\nI have played many interesting [b]Rouge-likes[/b] in\
      \ my time with games like [b]Dead Cells[/b] and [b]Hades[/b]. [b]West of Dead[/b]\
      \ looked very interesting, with a dark cartoony vibe and they even got [b]Ron\
      \ Perlmen[/b] to do the voice of the main character. From what was being shown\
      \ with some interesting gameplay looked very promising and I wanted to try it\
      \ out. Then it hit me, looks can be deceiving. What I got was a game that had\
      \ a ton of issues that makes the game not polished in any way.\n\n[h1]Pros and\
      \ Cons[/h1]\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The lightning mechanic was an interesting\
      \ feature to use to stun enemies. \n[*]The art style and soundtrack are really\
      \ nice and set the dark atmosphere that the game had. \n[/list] \n\n[b]Cons[/b]\
      \ \n[list] \n[*]The story is very confusing, nothing makes sense. \n[*]Some\
      \ melee enemies made the cover feature pointless. \n[*]Gameplay is buggy, there\
      \ are bugs that can screw you over. \n[*]Every time I picked up a rifle it would\
      \ show me how to use the weapon on every new run and they were not useful either.\
      \ \n[*]Not a lot of variety of weapons and most were not even worth using. \n\
      [*]Getting new weapons and abilities is a huge grind. \n[*]Bosses and [b]Outlaws[/b]\
      \ are either broken or just not that fun. \n[/list]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1] \nThe\
      \ year is 1888. [b]William Mason[/b] is brought back to life and awakes in a\
      \ strange bar, there he meets a barkeeper, who tells him that he is in [b]Purgatory[/b]\
      \ and finds out that he has no memories of who he is. So, he sets out to go\
      \ and find his memories while fighting enemies and getting answers to his past.\
      \ \n\nThat is all that I can remember from [b]West of Dead[/b]. The story makes\
      \ no sense and is entirely forgettable. The characters have nothing special\
      \ to them in any shape or form and they don\u2019t even speak, all they do is\
      \ repeat the same textboxes every single time with nothing new to say. They\
      \ are not even worth interacting with, literally, the only character that actually\
      \ develops is [b]William[/b] himself and he is also completely forgettable as\
      \ well. Whenever I got a new memory from him, I forgot about it five minutes\
      \ later and it never made sense in the first place. I actually forgot about\
      \ one of the characters, there is this one character called [b]The Preacher[/b],\
      \ and when I found him, I was like who is this guy? Only to find out it was\
      \ a character I meet before. \n\nIn all honesty, [b]William[/b] could have just\
      \ been the only character and nothing would change from the story. It\u2019\
      s just that empty with nothing interesting going on and it\u2019s sad to see\
      \ that as there are some nice ideas that it had going for it. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\
      \ \n[b]West of Dead[/b] is a top-down shooter with many gameplay issues. There\
      \ is a cover mechanic where that protects you from getting shot. The problem\
      \ here is that some enemies are melee-based, so it\u2019s completely thrown\
      \ out the window with some enemies, as they will actually go through the wall\
      \ you are behind, which will result in you getting hit. The gameplay is also\
      \ very buggy, one time I was hit by an enemy in which [b]Whilliam[/b] completely\
      \ disappeared and it resulted in my death, or when you start a new run you will\
      \ always get a tutorial on how to use the rifles. The rifles are not really\
      \ useful as the hitboxes on them were small and sometimes did not hit the target.\
      \ That is also another issue, the weapons are not really worth using, as I always\
      \ ended up using the same weapons, [b]Freezer[/b] and [b]Fifth Time Lucky[/b]\
      \ were the two weapons I went after, no other weapon I came across was worth\
      \ using. However, getting weapons is a huge grind on its own. To get weapons\
      \ and abilities, you will need [b]Sin[/b], however, to get that, you will need\
      \ to kill the enemies that are in the areas, there are two problems with this.\
      \ The first problem is that the stuff you want to get will cost at least 100,\
      \ 200, 300, or more [b]Sin[/b] and the second problem is that you will only\
      \ get a certain amount depending on the area you are in, as there is a limit\
      \ on how much you can get per level. Games like [b]Dead Cells[/b] will give\
      \ you many opportunities to get [b]Cells[/b] and the game rewards you for beating\
      \ the levels in a certain amount of time or killing a certain number of enemies.\
      \ \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2297740981 \nEvery\
      \ time I died, I felt a pit in my stomach open, as I did not feel encouraged\
      \ to do another run. I really just wanted to quit, however, I kept playing hoping\
      \ that something might have shined and made the game fun but to no avail, there\
      \ was nothing. Sometimes you will fight these mini-bosses called [b]Outlaws[/b]\
      \ and they are fun to fight when they work. They will either stand still or\
      \ jump over the cover spots and not fight back. There are also some bosses you\
      \ will fight and they were ok but not at all memorable and fun. \n\nThe one\
      \ thing I have to give the game some credit where credit is due is the lighting\
      \ mechanic. The rooms you will enter will be all dark and you have to light\
      \ them up to see them. This will stun the enemies and you will have a chance\
      \ to kill them more easily. \n\n[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1] \nMy favourite\
      \ thing about [b]West of Dead[/b] is the art style. I love the dark cartoony\
      \ atmosphere that the game has going it felt. It shows us how dark and messed\
      \ up [b]Purgatory[/b] actually is, something that I enjoyed. I tested the game\
      \ on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, 16 GB of RAM, and an AMD Ryzen 5 1500X\
      \ Quad-Core Processor 3.50. The game does run really well at 60 FPS. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2297740663\n\
      [h1]Soundtrack[/h1] \nNow I have to admit that the soundtrack for this game\
      \ is awesome. I loved the guitar jiggle that would play after every battle you\
      \ do; it just feels so fresh. The [b]Outlaws[/b] theme is my favourite song\
      \ to listen to, it\u2019s just a shame that they are sometimes buggy to fight\
      \ against as the theme is just that good. Makes you feel like you really are\
      \ in a fight with a gunslinger. \n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1] \nI really wanted\
      \ to like [b]West of Dead[/b]. It had promise and potential to be a unique game\
      \ out of the [b]Rouge-Like[/b] genre. However, what I was presented with was\
      \ a game that had a forgettable story, broken combat, weapons that are not worth\
      \ using, pointless grinding, and a feeling of just wanting to quit playing.\
      \ While I was writing this review, I was kind of frustrated because the game\
      \ just has all these problems and it really sucks. I will admit that some care\
      \ and passion was put into this game and getting [b]Ron Perlmen[/b] to voice\
      \ [b]William Mason[/b] does show that they tried. The issue here is that there\
      \ can only be so much charm and promise that a game can have, that it falls\
      \ short of what the actual product is. I want to like this game, I really do\
      \ but with what I was shown, I just can\u2019t find myself to play it again,\
      \ rather, I want to forget about it."
