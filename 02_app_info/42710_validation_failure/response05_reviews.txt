It has in my opinion the best campaign in the series with a clear goal and everything is well explained, carachters are intresting, fun and likeable and does a good job to connecting to world at war's story (SOMETHING BO3 COULD LEARN ABOUT.) Tho there are some problems in historical accuracy, in the first vietnam mission who takes place in 1963 the song \"Fortunate son\" plays and guess what, that song came out in 1969, In the first mission the song played in the cuban bar (Quimbara) is released 1974 and lastly in the wmd mission hudson uses the AUG gun in service since 1978. Treyarch, how bad could DO A 5 SECOND RESEARCH IN GOOGLE be? Moving onto multiplayer, its pretty great too, it has really good maps and its balanced relatively speaking cause famas is broken, almost like its an AR 10 years older than the others, oh wait it is. But every cod has op weapons, smgs are all trash except for the mp5k and ak74u (wich is also a 1978 weapon :)) it introduced theater mode, gun game and has a currency system wich is not monetized so great! Zombies give u 3 maps wich are some of my favorites in the series, its pretty ez to pack a punch and they are fun to play solo (something that cannot be said for newer cods) 9.7/10 experience but godamnit treyarch! Make some more research next time\n","timestamp_created":1603380945,"timestamp_updated":1610126404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmuXA8fYCcuq4qQI="}
