Uninstalled. Based on reading up on that it could be false-positive. Its actually fun to play. Pending the malware issue is explained/tended to it is  worth a look. Until then I dont recommend it. \n\nUpdate on this review: based on dev response I will take them at their word that this is a false -positive. It is a fun game,  so changing this to recommended. AVG picked up the product as having malware. But defender did not. So it most likely it is AVG - which I already sent to them for analysis so that they can update their fingerprints should no issue be there.","timestamp_created":1608231260,"timestamp_updated":1608560853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1608539221,"developer_response":"Hi ABC. Thank your reaching. We made our game with Unity Software. That's why sometime the old Virus Scaner can see that  .exe game as IDP.generic. If you make an update to your Virus scanner that you used, you will probably do not get any more warning. You can make a search on Internet and see that it is an issue all around the world. But do not worry we do not have any malware in our games! Please contact for more information; seitoentertainment@gmail.com"}],"cursor":"AoJ4gNjswvYCefeAuwI="}
