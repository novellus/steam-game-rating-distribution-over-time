It is simply a scam.\nI could play the game for 11 minutes until it crashed. Since then it can no longer be started and is unplayable. So I contacted the developer and sent him the error message. More than 2.5 months have passed since the message and there is not a single feedback from the developer.\n\nSo I would like to give an absolute warning before buying and consider it a fraud. Unfortunately Steam cannot refund the purchase price because more than two weeks have passed since the purchase.","timestamp_created":1600545468,"timestamp_updated":1600545468,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw5rX80/QCdMjrogI="}
