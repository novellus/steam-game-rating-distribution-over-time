The concept for the game is interesting and looking at all the information for the lore behind the game is comical and intriguing. While the concept and the art for the game is very good, the game play could be optimized better to balance the game for both the destructo and the retronauts. I would give this game a 7-8 out of 10.\n\nPositives:\nPlaying with your friends makes the game optimal and hella fun. I would recommend having the retronauts be in a discord channel while you play to communicate with your friends. \nOverall art and feel of the game is fantastic.\nI like the fact that the humans can still keep going if they die by becoming a securobot.\nPlaying as the destructo is fun and difficult as you try to come up with \"big brain\" plays to win.\n\nNegatives:\nAlthough this game is designed well, it is nearly impossible to win as the destructo. Once the destructo has killed one person, that person then becomes a securobot which has limited mobility and a lot of fire power. Almost too much fire power... Even though the limited mobility creates some balance to the securobot, the amount of firepower makes it incredibly difficult for the destructo. The problem for the destructo though isn't killing all the humans (this happens almost every game I've played.) The problem for the destructo is that you have to go to the control room and have the ship self destruct. Because the destructo has killed all the humans that means there are now 3 securobots all in the control room waiting for the destructo to get there. The control room for the map HQ is actually poorly designed because it is soo open. This means that it is very easy for the securobots to shoot and kill the destructo without moving or anything. I don't know if it would be best to make the securobot have a slower buildup speed or what, but it can be very difficult to get away from the securobots even with their lack of mobility.\nI suggest having 4 people play is best because it seems the ai programming isn't very strong.\n\nHope for the game: \nI really hope they add more maps and different destructo bots with different abilities. I also hope they add more weapons and tools to the game because I love how each of them work. It would be nice if they addressed the balancing issue sooner rather than later because I probably won't want to play too much more otherwise.\n\nOverall really good game besides the balancing issue. 7-8 out of 10","timestamp_created":1566234668,"timestamp_updated":1566234668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvo231ewCdoXW0AE="}
