    about_the_game: 1890, Santiago, Chile. A powerful warlock has fallen into a deep
      sleep. His nightmares are becoming real, and his monsters now emanate from an
      abyss into the world above. It will take a special warrior to enter the abyss,
      and a special composer to score that journey. Patricio Meneses is that composer.

      score, amplifying the dangerous and spectacular world below the surface. This
