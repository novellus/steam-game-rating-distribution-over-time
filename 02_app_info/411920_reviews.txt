Excellent turn performance at low altitude compared with the P-51D. I like the easy start procedure and the fact that the canopy opens/closes with a single click. The flaps are also simple - either up or down. \n\nChallenges: The taxi and landing procedures require a steep learning curve. Best to use an axis control for the brakes (like rudder pedals). I'm getting better at it and feeling more confident, but learning takes dedication. Also, the narrow wheel base and low ground clearance make it prone to scraping the pavement with the wing tips. Breaks my heart whenever it happens!!\n\nOverall - Highly recommend this model for anyone remotely interested in WWII aircraft. Certain functions require a lot of practice, but the payoff is worth it!","timestamp_created":1608405112,"timestamp_updated":1608405112,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzMqavvYCcPjAuwI="}
