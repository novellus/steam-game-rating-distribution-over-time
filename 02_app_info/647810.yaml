    about_the_game: 'VertoStudio VR is a fully-capable 3D modeling studio designed
      to run entirely in VR!  No mirroring or external software is required of any
      kind. You can use it to import FBX, OBJ, DAE (and more) directly in front of
      you, then configure every aspect of the visual display of these scenes directly
      down to the individual polygons.  It also supports a full-scale desktop 3D modeling
      mode that can run at the same time as the VR mode!<br><br>Whether you are mocking
      up a quick VR workflow, or designing production VR environments, this tool eliminates
      all of the pipeline complexity involved with getting 3D assets and content into
      VR quickly.  Using Verto Studio, there is no more guesswork in designing for
      VR.  By including a traditional desktop-based 3D modeling mode, artists can
      move into VR at their own pace, and leverage the benefits of both modes as they
      navigate their way into this new technology.<br><br>Verto Studio VR Features

    detailed_description: '<h1>Verto Studio VR Update With Looking Glass Display Support</h1><p><h2
      class="bb_tag">Version 2.4.0 is Here!</h2><br>This update''s most exciting addition
      to Verto Studio VR is Looking Glass Display support!  You can now use the HoloPlay
      mirroring feature to display a real-time hologram of your Verto Studio 3D scenes
      without the requirement of AR additional glasses or goggles!  To use this feature,
      simply plug in a HoloPlay compatable display such as the Looking Glass Display,
      and click the HP button in Desktop Mode to enable the feature!  We are very
      excited to see what the creative community of Verto Studio users come up with
      now that they can display their 3D work in a whole new way!  For more information
      about Looking Glass support, give the updated user guide a read!<br><br>Additionally,
      the following changes have been made for this release:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Added
      Voice commands to VR mode when running on Windows 10 (off by default, see user
      guide for details)<br></li><li>Several improvements to Desktop Mode, including
      the ability to resize/maximize the Desktop Mode window.<br></li><li>Ability
      to enact &quot;skinny&quot; transform handles / (on by default) in desktop mode
      or to disable them entirely.  <br></li><li>Use native windows file-open dialogs
      when selecting import/texture features running outside of VR mode.<br></li><li>Stability
      improvements and bug fixes</li></ul></p><br><h1>About the Software</h1>VertoStudio
