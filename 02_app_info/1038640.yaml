    review: "This is a very short game and even at a big discount at \xA31.81 I can\
      \ barely (BARELY) recommend it when there are far better hidden object games\
      \ out there (and better discounted too)\n\nI liked the setting, puzzles were\
      \ just ok, music was nice, art was ok.\n\nno dialogue, story was pretty generic,\
      \ VERY short.\n\nverdict, only if you are running out of Hidden object/puzzle\
      \ games to buy, its super cheap and you like Mayan setting"
