I suggest getting it on sale due to issues players have with some of the titles. \n\n\nSeven older HOGs for less that the price of a new one? Yes, please! I've wanted to play some of these for years, so it's a treat to get the chance. I got this bundle in a bundle of bundles, but it would be worth the sales or full price too. I'll post reviews as I make progress.\n\n_____________\n\nMountain Crime: Requital\n\nDid you ever want to be a doctor? Now's your chance! Only your patient seems to be missing, hmm. Fun, old school charm to the graphics, does have an odd flicker to the cut scenes though.\n\nPluses: Nice music, the graphics are old school pretty. Wolves everywhere. Mini games and hidden object scenes seem straightforward, though they are pictures of the objects, not word lists. A loyal wolf friend named Wolfy. OK, that's what I named the hint button wolf, but he sure comes in handy and recharges quickly enough in regular mode. \n\nMinuses: Has an odd jump to the cut scenes like an overused VHS. The graphics in the hidden object scenes can be a challenge if you have low vision like me. Penalty for misclicks. Scenes can be a bit blurry.\n\nRoughly four and a half hours playtime.\n\n_________________________\n\nVampire Saga: Pandora's Box\n\nA game so meta even your pointer is a hidden object! Seriously though, mouse over to options and deselect the custom pointer. It can be done.  Once that is done, well, the game has been pretty boring so far. It's just dull in pacing and the muddy graphics make each object hunt a slogfest. \n\nPluses: A free bonus game in the package.\n\nMinuses: The hidden pointer. Blurry, pixel hunt in the hidden object hunt scenes and items that are mislabeled like a lantern being called a lamp. Super slow hint button. Just plain dull. I wanted to scream by the third visit to the first hidden object screen. No voice acting. Hard pass.\n\nPlayed about forty minutes before giving up in boredom and frustration.\n\n_________________\n\nBehind the Reflection 2: Witch's Revenge\n\nThe witch is out of jail and she's stolen your son! No, seriously, stop giggling, that's the plot. No voice acting, but super bright setting and search scenes are a breath of fresh air. Unfortunately, this game crashes at random. Try a Win 7 compatibility fix and keep your fingers crossed. \n\nPluses: Music is decent, nicer graphics than the last title, interesting if goofy plot. You have a faster hint button. Hidden object scenes range from four to five objects shown as grey images, to bigger ones with word lists. \n\nMinuses: It seems set up to the point where you can leave a hidden object area, enter one within it, or the next one without completing a task. This was confusing at first as I thought the rest of the needed objects were in the next room, indicated by sparkles. Later on, you do indeed need to leave the search area to find items, so super confusing game at times.\n\nHint button is faster, but teeny tiny sparkles that can be hard to spot. A little murky in some searches. Very little voice acting. Crashes at random. I got lucky my first time playing but went back in. Sort of hobbles along on a Win 7 compatibility fix.\n\nAfter the first chapter in the house, the game sort of got bogged down in the second. You assemble a drawing, then a chainsaw, then a skeleton's armor, then a key. I'm not sure what happens after that, I gave up as it just seemed bogged down in one area. \n\nI played an hour and a half.\n\n________________\n\nTwisted Lands: Shadow Town\n\nPretty sure my loving wife pushed me off the boat to certain death. Well, jokes on her as she crashed into the same island I washed up on. Ha! Pretty fun hidden object compared to the last two. At least for a while, it can drag a bit in parts, but the atmosphere was excellent. \n\nPluses: Hint button seems to charge factor, nice balance between puzzling and easy to understand. At least at first. Pretty cool ending. \n\nMinuses: Fetch quest, anyone? No fast travel map. Hint button lags at times, game drags in parts. I ended with things in my inventory. That just feels wrong somehow. Kind of feels like the game was released with parts missing or not completed.\n\nPlaytime four hours.\n\n___________________\n\nSacra Terra: Kiss of Death\n\nWhen you get up to answer the phone your boyfriend spots a book and decides to summon a smoking hot she devil. You throw that ring right back in his face, honey! For some odd reason, you go off to the island to save him. Everyone so far in the game talks like a serial killer, looks like one, or is a demon, so fun game.\n\nPluses: Voice acting ids excellent as is the artwork and music. The puzzle are clever, but can be skipped. The hidden object scenes almost always have a useful item and the story makes actual sense. The fast travel map is the best thing ever, easily letting you see where you are, where things need done, and if you've collected the otherworldly item in an area yet. \n\nMinuses: Get ready for old school HOG mechanics where thirty seconds was the fast hint recharge. Some of the items don't match the theme. You get a big scary book covered with skulls that is a matching game of cute or generic things. Ditto some of the items in the matching scenes.","timestamp_created":1609467524,"timestamp_updated":1609792276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4pjG5/YCcYCjvwI="}
