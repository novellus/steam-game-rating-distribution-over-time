      class="bb_ul"><li> <strong>Never run out of writing space:</strong> simply grab
      the surface, scroll over to a blank area, and continue writing! You''ll never
      reach an edge, because there aren''t any. <br></li><li> Choose from 750+ marker
      color and thickness combinations.<br></li><li> Nothing is permanent: either
      use the built-in <strong>eraser</strong> to clear an area on the board or use
      <strong>undo and redo</strong> to erase recent strokes. <br></li><li> Markers
      provide <strong>haptic feedback</strong> while drawing and feature adjustable
      <strong>marker smoothing</strong> to help you write legibly.<br></li><li> <strong>Import
      images</strong> (JPG/PNG/TIFF/GIF/BMP/ICO) and arrange them on the whiteboard.
      Use them to create moodboards, do homework assignments, prepare presentations,
      or even to do code reviews. <br></li><li> <strong>The perfect study space:</strong>
      import PDF course material, grab a virtual marker, and shut yourself off from
      all outside distractions. You can even record your homework sessions to share
      them with your classmates and the world using the interactive desktop view and
      recording software of your choice. <br></li><li> <strong>Export your drawings
      as SVG images</strong> and view them in the browser when you''re not in VR,
      import them into your office suite, or share them with your team. Also useful
      for recording your own signature for embedding in documents or emails.</li></ul>'
