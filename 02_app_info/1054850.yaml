    review: 'So, this game is really bad. Don''t waste your money. There is no other
      way to put it. I was one of the play-testers for this game while it was still
      in development. Even then, there were plenty of issues with this game. Feedback
      was given, and I hoped the game would be improved upon. My morbid curiosity
      got the best of me, and I purchased this game to see what it had improved upon.


      It hasn''t improved at all. In fact, it seems to be in a worse state then before.
      I''ll go through some pros and cons.


      Pros:

      - The skill tree is probably the only good thing about this game. It appears
      cool. But I can''t bring the patience to continue playing this game to see all
      the skills.


      Cons:

      - The map is a series of boring, repeating textures that provide nothing unique
      or interesting. The mini-map is just a gray rectangle with no features on it.
      You can''t even put waypoints on it. The markers for the "quests" do not show
      what quest they are for, making walking around mindless and confusing.

      - Combat is dull and redundant. Just cast spells or swing at enemies until they
      die. They do the same to you. Some spells are kind of neat, like the stone entrapment
      spell some enemies cast. Nothing awesome though. Also, there is no audio for
      the combat. Yeah . . .

      - Quests are not "interesting" or "meaningful" like the game suggests. They
      provide nothing to the ''story.'' One just has a tree burn down, and that''s
      it. One is to retrieve an item, where the ''choice'' is to keep it or give it
      to the quest-giver. The other quests just seem to be kill some bosses.

      - There is no story. The game itself is just a mindless, empty zone with boring
      enemies.

      - The graphics aren''t good. Now, this doesn''t automatically mean the game
      is bad. I love plenty of games where the graphics are not great (Neverwinter
      Nights, Fallout, Oblivion). But everything in this game just looks like blobs.

      - No keybinding options, which sucks because the controls in this game are awkward.

      - Many bugs and crashes. It crashed on me twice. It wouldn''t let me walk occasionally,
      causing me to have to reload the game. Also had the game-breaking bug where
      all the bosses and quest locations would spawn at the hub, making the game unplayable.
      Even after this happened, if I tried to create a new character and then the
      game would spawn me dead without respawning, rendering it unplayable. I had
      to reinstall the game to fix this issue.

      - The game is too expensive. Originally, it was $9.99, which is an egregious
      price for this game. Even at $3.99, it is far too expensive. The game is maybe
      worth $0.99, but I have played free flash games more enjoyable than this.


      Save your money. Spend it on something else much better. I will be refunding
      this product.'
