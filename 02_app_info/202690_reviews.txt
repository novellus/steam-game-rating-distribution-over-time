Hegemony Gold should have been genre defining and sadly is more of a hidden gem. If you can look past the old graphics and the somewhat harsh difficulty (i play on normal and the game is a sometimes tough challenge but never a grind) then you are in for a treat. The games mechanics are simple yet complex , and original, and the game rewards strategic thinking and long term planning. The importance of blockades, raids on farms and disrupting your enemies supply chain is a core part of the game and not something replicated in other grand strat games like EU, Crusader Kings, Imperator Rome or the Total War series. The world feels alive and vibrant and everything has at least some information which you can quickly access by pressing F1. Combat is easy to manage with a pause function and all orders are hotkeyed to the num pad on any standard keyboard. The Phillip of Macedon campaign is fantastic and i cant attest to the two Greek campaigns as I havent played them.\nSandbox mode is also a lot of fun, however you must keep in mind the game wil not set you missions in the same manner as in the Phillip campaign. You follow your own path completely and at your own pace, there is no rush, no \"30 turns to capture X province\" or else a doomstack will spawn up your arse. The game is not flawless, but its close. \n\nhegemony Gold is simply one of the best games in the genre.","timestamp_created":1608764444,"timestamp_updated":1608764444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1qn1yPYCcInOvAI="}
