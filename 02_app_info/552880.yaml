      \ /><br><strong>STARDROP</strong> is a single-player first-person interactive\
      \ narrative adventure game where you take on the role of a <strong>Salvage &amp;\
      \ Rescue Operative</strong> named <strong>Aryn Vance</strong>. With her partner,\
      \ <strong>John Kindley</strong>, at her side, the two embark on a journey full\
      \ of mystery and suspense with some laughs along the way. <strong>STARDROP</strong>\
      \ tells a genuine heart-felt story about a long lost starship, its crew and\
      \ one individual in particular.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/552880/extras/03_About_Experience.png?t=1609623011\"\

      \ /><br><strong>STARDROP</strong> presents its narrative through traditional\
      \ cut scenes and in-game cinematic story telling as you play. The main campaign\
      \ is where the heart of the game's narrative lies but you will also be able\
      \ to experience the universe of <strong>STARDROP</strong> through its side missions.<br><br><img\

    developer_response: "Ah man,, I'm so sorry that you didn't like the game. I am\
      \ and have been during production very critical of my own work. I've been incredibly\
      \ tense during production regarding the narrative and dialogue because I wanted\
      \ to avoid following tropes in general. I also wanted to create a more positive\
      \ narrative and while I'm hinting at a darker tone, which was done on purpose,\
      \ I really did want to keep things light and have a sad yet feel good ending.\
      \ It's something really difficult to do, it's much easier to have a bad guy\
      \ do bad things or drop in evil alien no:26654 I just did not want to go there.\
      \ Playing with tropes, for sure, but not indulging in them and trying to advert\
      \ many tropes in the process. I've tried to play around with them and I guess\
      \ nothing landed for you. What I've learned is how people perceive things so\
      \ vastly differently so I am always nervous when I get a new review.\n\nFor\
      \ what its worth I have not been careless when it came to the story. In fact\
      \ I've had the general foundation of what I wanted it to be including the ending\
      \ from the get go. In the four years I worked on it, I've gone over it countless\
      \ times and adding in things to what I perceive to be a more rounded narrative.\
      \ I have to accept the fact that what I want the story to be is not what people\
      \ might need or even expect from it and that's just a risk I have to take. I'll\
      \ agree my writing isn't always the best and I am certainly not trained in it\
      \ but I wanted to create a narrative that came from the heart and that had something\
      \ to say in the end.\n\nI really did put a ton of effort into everything, including\
      \ the pacing and while it starts slow (a bit too slow) I always felt that when\
      \ chapter 2 starts it picks up and keeps it going steady. What Id like to know\
      \ is what narrative part(s) fell flat for you. I'm curious to know what you\
      \ kind of expected versus what you got in the end. Maybe something I can work\
      \ with / learn from.\n\nThe only thing I will always fight for are the VA's/\
      \ They're amazing and I'll take the blame if the dialogue wasn't to your liking,\
      \ that's on me. I wanted to avoid clean cut deliveries and attempted to have\
      \ the characters react to things according to their personalities. Even in that\
      \ aspect I would do things differently.\n\nAnyway, super long reply, I know,\
      \ again I'm sorry you didn't like it and will continue to take criticism into\
      \ account for whatever I'll do next. It always hurts when your work just doesn't\
      \ gel with someone. I experimented a ton in STARDROP regarding almost everything\
      \ and some payed off some didn't. People either seem to love it or not at all\
      \ and that's okay. \n\nHope the next game you play is much more to your liking!\
      \ \nTake care."

    review: "I cannot recommend this. \n\nThis game is not without merit -- It looks\
      \ beautiful. The creators have mastery of textures and lighting. \n\nHowever,\
      \ the space designs themselves are mixed, and nearly everything else is lacking.\
      \ It is a poorly conceptualized story poorly told, with poor writing and poor\
      \ acting. Despite trying to write a science-fiction story, the writer of the\
      \ story is obviously not fluent in science fiction, and blunders through many\
      \ well-trod tropes, giving us nothing new or exciting. \n\nAnd the pacing is\
      \ terrible. Every time the story is about to build in tension, create some atmosphere,\
      \ or grab our attention, it manages to break its stride and ruin its momentum.\
      \ It was so frustrating that every time I thought the game would achieve transcendence,\
      \ it instead fell flat on its face. \n\nPlaguing the story are far too many\
      \ references to sci-fi movies the author is obviously a fan of. Those are fine\
      \ in easter eggs, but in this game they are constantly shoved in your face.\
      \ \n\nI've more nitpicks, but there's no point in continuing. The upshot is\
      \ that while I love this genre and had high hopes, this game fails to deliver\
      \ and I cannot recommend this."
