Nov. 1, 2020\n\nNight play in Halloween is okay.  There should be some streetlights here and there...on the fountain and the club house, maybe light the path here and there.  This would give contrast and atmosphere to the dark.\n\nThe stroke is now less effective than before.  The stroke should have strength enough to at least leave a possibility of a hole-in-one on each hole.\n\nThe maple leaf cluster needs to disappear when the ball is selected.  It can cover the course.  The same with the stroke strength text. it could be smaller and translucent, or better yet, displayed under the ball.\n\nHole #1 in Halloween replays on single player.  Sometimes twice.  Sometimes several.\n\nI'll still recommend it.  It can take some getting used to but after that it's a fun and satisfying short play game.\n\n\n\n\n\nI almost didn't buy this game for the reviews that said it was difficult to control.  That's not really true.  I had no problem.  It isn't without its bugs...minor though.  If I condemn anything it would be its physics engine.  Bounce angles are not entirely predictable.  It didn't really distract from the game but you'll curse that first one.  No one is likely to ever get a hole in one but you can shoot under par.  It's fall in the game.  It would have been nice to pick a season, but then they'd have to rename it...Seasons Park Mini Golf.  Works for me.  The distant scenery is static so they could have given options on that as well.  It might have been a good touch to allow different putter weights.  There is an animated windmill.  More of the moving obstacles would have been appreciated.\n\nAll in all it has its appeal and was well worth the dollar purchase.  I won an ice cream sandwich and tried to feed it to the bunny but he wasn't having it.  Maybe next time I'll try the cupcake.","timestamp_created":1571348756,"timestamp_updated":1604242083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y/GRwvUCfKmj1AE="}
