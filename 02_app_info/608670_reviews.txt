It's a shame this little game hasn't received more traction. It lacks the polish of a bigger studio or something, but it has a lot of heart. Nice aesthetic, solid gameplay, and a challenge that will take you off guard if you're not careful. The characters are likable and the world interesting. Not a long game by any means, but it'll provide some pleasant entertainment. Definitely give this one a look!","timestamp_created":1590349019,"timestamp_updated":1590349019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ494aMpPICepmGigI="}
