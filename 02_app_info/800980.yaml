    review: "[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]\n\n\
      [i] Note for Oculus users: you have to press down on the joystick and press\
      \ trigger at the same time near the start button to get game to start. To shoot\
      \ you have to push joystick forward and keep trigger pressed to keep shooting\
      \ [/i]\n\nThis game would make a great eye test of the future. Is that a soldier\
      \ in the distance or a shrub? The pixels look the same! I think I saw it move,\
      \ it's a soldier after all. Shoot! Ha! That's about as interesting as this game\
      \ gets. It's pretty bad. Even at .59 cents, I can't recommend this. Maybe at\
      \ free it'd be nice for a laugh. \n\nIt's basically a stand still wave shooter\
      \ (or a stay crouched wave shooter?). Soldier after soldier keeps spawning,\
      \ almost magically, anywhere in front of you and then moves side to side while\
      \ moving forward and shooting at you. The closer they get, the deadlier they\
      \ are. Luckily, you just have to stay crouched while still being able to shoot\
      \ over the barricade and just keep the trigger button pressed down. Your gun\
      \ will keep shooting. No dumb reloads to worry about. You don't have to worry\
      \ about different enemy types or different tactics. Just more soldiers come\
      \ for you wave after wave after wave.\n\nThere is some strategy. Shoot the health\
      \ pickups. There's other guns to try! But they all involve the same wave after\
      \ wave shooting. Honestly, I got to wave 9-10 in less than 20 minutes and my\
      \ arm started to hurt from keeping it up all the time to shoot soldier after\
      \ soldier. I found it easier to shoot by looking at where the bullets travelled\
      \ over aiming down sights. Although, I have to give this game credit, ADS does\
      \ seem to work! Amazing! You get money for each soldier you kill to buy more\
      \ guns. Sounds like an NRA member's wet dream.\n\nAnyways, that's all there\
      \ is to the game. I wasted .59 cents for you guys. You're welcome!\n\nRate 3/10.\
      \ \n\n"
