      /><br><strong>Gherman Driven</strong>, a middle-aged man, fanatical <strong>conspiracy
      theorist</strong>, who has abandoned all joy of his life.<br>Family, friends,
      work. Gherman remained without anything because of his obsession with the <strong>&quot;Philadelphia
      experiment&quot;</strong>, which led him to neglect every other aspect of his
      life.<br>11 years after the events of the alleged experiment, Gherman found
      a document that marked the coordinates of the <strong>military establishment</strong>
      in which all involved in the project were taken.<br>After spending all the savings
      of a lifetime for trip to Greenland, certainly he did not expect to find so
      much...<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/450110/extras/Gameplay.jpg?t=1459206609"
      /><br>A <strong>story-driven horror</strong> where the goal is to find out what
      lies behind the experiment.<br>All that you have is a <strong>flashlight</strong>,
      a <strong>lighter</strong>, and your intelligence to solve various <strong>environmental
      puzzles</strong>, <strong>escape</strong> from unpleasant situations and <strong>hide</strong>
      from what you find.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/450110/extras/VR_Support.jpg?t=1459206609"
      /><br>This game was developed to be played perfectly in virtual reality.<br>Each
      menu, object, or text, will be implemented in the game to allow who will use
      the Head Mounted Display to have a realistic effect.<br>All you have to do to
      activate this mode, it's open the <strong>game menu</strong> and activate <strong>&quot;VRMode&quot;</strong>
      in the <strong>&quot;Graphic Settings&quot;</strong>.<br>I'll hope you enjoy
      it.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/450110/extras/About_Developer.jpg?t=1459206609"
      /><br>I'm 20 years old, this is my first game and it's a one-man-project.<br>I
      learned to use the engine, techniques and everything related to the development
      of a video game with this project.<br>I hope you like, and leave feedback if
      you want :)

    review: I originally bought the game not realizing it was Oculus only, but now
      it's somehow working with my Vive Pro. There is one issue though. You are probably
      meant to be about 6 feet tall, but the camera placement has you at about 8 feet
      tall. Though this did not prevent me from completing the game. If you so chose,
      you can play the game crouched on Vive, putting you at about the right height
      and most of the time can still sprint, even while crouched. There was one small
      section, where you're in a low duct filled with water. For that one section,
      I had to get off my chair and get down on the ground to be low enough to see,
      but it's not a big section and it's late in the game. As for the game itself
      it was pretty good. Much longer than many VR horror games. Great atmosphere.
      Decent puzzles. A little problem with some of the translations, but I enjoyed
      playing it. Definitely worth the price. Glad I finally got to play it. Rock
      On!
