The first few minutes were fun and all, but as I progressed I started to realize it had a very similar taste to other horror games I have played. the game used very cheap tricks to get the player. loud sounds, standard jump scares etc. And I didn't understand why I was a pizza delivery guy. What difference would it make if I didn't have a role. The game itself is already fine without it. Getting these achievements are really hard. but making a hard game does not make it unique. There are a lot of games like this. look dude, I don't want to be rude, I hope you can take this as a positive note, and I'll respect you for creating a game that other people will enjoy. I may not have liked it, so called not my type of respective horror. Take it easy, and have fun developing games.","timestamp_created":1609861182,"timestamp_updated":1609861182,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo4bN6fYCf+XdwAI="}
