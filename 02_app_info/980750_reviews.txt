There's not really much to it. You basically just pick out the packages that the elves want you to put on the sleigh to get ready for Santa. If you go into it just expecting a simple seek and find game I think you'll find some enjoyment in it. It's clearly meant for children but I imagine some adults might like it too. There are 3 different levels (the larger the number, the larger the level and the more packages you need to find). I went through all 3 levels and I enjoyed the game for what it was. If you're on the fence, I have a video series I'm working on for this game. Currently there are 2 videos and there will be at least one more before the series is finished.\n\nEDIT 11/12/2020: I ended up only keeping the first video up on the channel so I that's all there is right now. I actually am #1 on all 3 leaderboards for this game as of today. If you're looking for a neat little game for the kids for the holidays, I still recommend this. It was a lot of simple fun. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr-XbtNpYfM&list=PL08FwntTpxPASyImRfiCWYuYQ17Tb0mW4","timestamp_created":1543734154,"timestamp_updated":1605227672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.59583592414855957","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnM7B3/UCfqKftAE="}
