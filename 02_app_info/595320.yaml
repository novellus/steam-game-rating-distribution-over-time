    about_the_game: "You are a burglar, and you often rob houses at night when the\
      \ owners are out. You usually pick an object somewhere in the remote parts where\
      \ there are no eyewitnesses or any other things that could stop you. Today,\
      \ you are going to rob a house not far from a little town in Kansas. It belongs\
      \ to a family that has moved in quite recently. You have been to that house\
      \ before so you know there are lots of valuable stuff there, and you have a\
      \ list of what is to be stolen. You have to get to other people\u2019s territory\
      \ and then find and put into your van every item from your list. However, it\u2019\
      s not going to be that easy because, as some rumors say, there have been some\
      \ sorts of paranormal activities observed in the house. People were saying something\
      \ about poltergeist. But you don\u2019t believe in all that stuff, and the only\
      \ thing you want is to rob that house as soon as possible."
