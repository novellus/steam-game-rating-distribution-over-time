    review: 'For the price, you absolutely cannot go wrong with this game if you are
      a fan of Super Monkey Ball style games. It''s a pretty simple, relatively short
      game, but it does a better job capturing the spirit of the first couple of Super
      Monkey Ball than the modern Super Monkey Ball games, like Banana Blitz (Note:
      Super Monkey Ball Retro or whatever the final name will be was not released
      at the time that I am reviewing this game). The stage designs are simple, but
      challenging and rely on precise movements and timing. The whole system of coins
      that unlock squirrel and ball accessories is really novel and adds to the game.
      The mini games are also tons of fun. Overall, I''d say the game is definitely
      worth giving a shot for fans of the genre.'
