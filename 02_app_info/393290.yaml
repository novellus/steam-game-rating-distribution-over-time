    about_the_game: The future of racing is here, and it's called MOTORHEAD. This
      game allows you to hop in one of 10 streamlined racers and test your skills
      on eight obstacle-filled courses that wind through urban, desert, and seaside
      terrain. Play modes include the standard Time Attack, Single Race, League, and
      Head-to-Head competition found in any decent racing game. One unique feature
      of MOTORHEAD is that you can choose between 30 or 60 frames per second. Choosing
      60fps gives the game a polished look, but you're limited to a three-car field.
      While going with 30fps hurts in the visual department, it does expand the field
      to seven cars; you'll probably want to experiment with both to figure out which
      one works best for you.. This futuristic racer has impressive visuals and cleverly
      designed vehicles that help put you in a futuristic state of mind. So if you're
      in the mood for a fast and fun racing experience, get your hands on MOTORHEAD.

    review: "I am disappointed that this was the PSX version and not the PC version.\
      \ I have the PC version, but unable to play it due to compatibility issues and\
      \ would have to setup a virtual PC on Windows 98/XP. I thought that they may\
      \ have re-released the PC version on Steam but to my disappointment, it was\
      \ the PSX version. The graphics are horrible and there is a lot of frame drops\
      \ while playing. The PC version play a lot smoother than this and looked a lot\
      \ better. Why this got put on here with a PSX emulator is beyond me. I wanted\
      \ the PC version of this game to digitally own. Glad it was only \xA33.99 otherwise,\
      \ paying more would of just been even more upsetting."
