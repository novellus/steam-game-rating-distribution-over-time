Though it's much easier said than done; Nagashino as the Takeda is probably the hardest event battle in game, and the Oda aren't easy to overcome even after the battle. This DLC is also quite useful for the Oda as well, as there's a grocery list of items required to trigger Nagashino ingame, so this makes it incredibly easy to jump straight to the event (not to mention without any DLC there's a twelve-year gap between startdates; 1570 to 1582, so this also fills that as well). \n\nOverall, between the new events and missions, difficulty, accessibility and challenge it offers, this DLC is well worth the $3.","timestamp_created":1467236519,"timestamp_updated":1467236519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.707892835140228271","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xZGHz9UCdZ6oWw=="}
