    review: If you can get this *really* cheap it's worth checking out. There is more
      visual polish here than in say, the VR spiderman games (though the Far From
      Home one has much more actual game than this) and it is pretty neat walking
      around the firehouse in VR. Slimer also looks great and I really liked the animated
      Ghostbusters logo who talks to you (sounded like Patton Oswalt but I'm not sure).
      Unfortunately part 2 kind of squanders this setup, but I would love to see a
      proper, full ghostbusters VR game with this level of Visual fidelity. I do actually
      like these little VR promos Sony does for their movies, but the price is a bit
      silly for the amount of content. Good way to kill 10 minutes though.
