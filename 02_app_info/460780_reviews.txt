You really should only play this game if you played the first two otherwise you may find yourself lost or not nearly invested at whats at stake here.  The story writing is great, but without playing the first two the impact of everything happening in the final chapter may not seem as big of deal.\n\nI say that because you won't get the full figure of RedBeard's Madness, or how unlikeable Protus actually is for a guy who initially seems likeable, the perspectives of two of your Companions Nathalie and Khalida who are from the first two games, and the overall love hate relationship you find yourself with Avadon and being a corrupt Federal Police Force in a Fantasy Setting.\n\nYou face Moral Decisions of course, like the other two and they are just as gray and complicated as before, though this time around you seem to be able to pull more weight in hopefully trying to influence Avadon for the better... or worse.  But more importantly you get to see the ultimate closing chapter and fate of Avadon.\n\nThe gameplay has been streamlined and the leveling up has being simplified a little bit, less decisions but less opportunities to screw over your build.  It's pretty straightforward now and hammered out some of the loose ends and more useless options.\n\nThe graphics are mostly the same, minor tweaks... though still the Spiderweb Signature setup.  The writing and mechanics carry the game.  Though the background sounds is still as immersive as ever.  There are lots of references to the first two games, it's nice to see familiar faces...and kill some of them.\n\nOverall, get it but only after you finished the first two and ready to see where it all ends.","timestamp_created":1605564310,"timestamp_updated":1605564310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn+TF6fUCf7TmrgI="}
