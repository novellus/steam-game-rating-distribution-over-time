    review: "Great educational fighting game to play with children or if you need\
      \ brain exercise, by yourself too. It looks a little like Into The Eagles Nest\
      \ for Commodore 64 8-bit computer. Can be played as co-op with one moving and\
      \ one typing numbers and hits enter when there are enemies withing ammo range.\
      \ Shooting is auto aim, since aiming with moving and calculating is just too\
      \ much of challenge. \n\nCons: The game is windowed only and the high score\
      \ list seems to update one game too late.\n\nDevelopment idea: Enemy friendly\
      \ fire on would make this game more tactic and realism. You could lure enemies\
      \ to crossfire each other and dodge their fire yourself."
