The levels are labyrinths good looking, unique, full of unique enemies, puzzles and problem solving. The idea is to traverse these levels to find the correct elements to use to defeat the many different types of enemies and puzzles to continue on to the boss. The art design is lovely. The music is also fantastic. They really add to the ambiance and overall feel to this unique dungeon crawler. The enemies are fun and puzzles are also unique because of the elements and how you use chemistry to traverse and conquer. Monstrous Molecules is aimed towards a younger audience as it is a learning game about chemistry and element building, but do not let that stop you. Learning is fun and is never too early or too late. This is a great take on chemistry, dungeon crawling and puzzle solving. Recommended for any age who likes fun, fairly challenging, learning and puzzling dungeon crawlers.","timestamp_created":1608578299,"timestamp_updated":1608578299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569536387920379639","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x56vw/YCdv+AvAI="}
