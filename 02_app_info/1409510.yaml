    review: So far in Europe on an average Windows10 PC this is not working for me.
      While the game starts fine, there is no world. I start on an empty plain without
      any features and a debug screen overlaid with option to abort. If I manage to
      get rid of the debug overlay I cannot move. Neither the proposed WASD movement
      nor ANY other key gives any result.
