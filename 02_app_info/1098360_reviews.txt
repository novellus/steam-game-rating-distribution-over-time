I recommend this game to people who like to play early access games.\n\nThe idea of the game is to find alien life forms and go kill them with your tank. They're easy enough to find, with bright red indicators and you shoot at them with your souped up tank and try to survive the onslaught. Navigation works fine and the tank is fun to drive. Where the big problem comes in is that all the shooting appears to be done automatically, my mouse presses don't appear to have any effect. This made me think that it must be about driving away from them while the tank autofires, so I worked to steer clear of their pinchers and mandibles. What I figured out is that I don't actually have to do anything at all and the tank will win the game. I just drive into the alien area and let them attack. The guns and missiles just kill  the bug while the tank hovers around 50% damage.\n\n\n[h1]What I like[/h1]\n\n[b]Scenery & Graphics:[/b] I really like the look and feel of this universe. Its a basic low-poly lunar style landscape that works well enough with the game objectives.\n\n[b]Game tempo:[/b] This is a fast moving game with lost of lights and sounds to match.\n\n[b]Heads Up Display[/b]  Overall, the HUD is simple and easy to read, but the neat thing is the mini-map that  hovers over your tank in the game's 3rd person view.\n\n[b]The Tank:[/b] The tank is fun to drive. \n\n\n[h1]What I Like Less[/h1]\n\n[b]The Actual Music:[/b] The music is a cross between techno and hard-rock with a sci-fi bend. The tempo is good for the action that's happening on the screen,but I don't like the metal sound as much as others may.\n\n[b]The Menu System[/b]: The main menu works well enough, but the buttons aren't labeled, so I ended up clicking all the buttons before I figured out how to play. \n\n[b]The Game Play[/b]: Right now, the tank beats the aliens by itself. I'm not sure what my contribution is, other than to drive the tank to the aliens.","timestamp_created":1574904829,"timestamp_updated":1574905018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw6e7p1+4CcerB3gE="}
