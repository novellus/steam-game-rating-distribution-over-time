    review: 'Another decent grab from the bargain bin. I bit hard to play, but there
      is a game here. I almost got to the end. The environment looks nice, and the
      graphics are ok. It would have been nice if they slowed the fall. That trick
      would have been a nice effect and would have added to the production values.
      At present, when you invariably fall off, you fall for like 2 seconds and make
      a little weak splat. More blood, please. [spoiler]Free Idea: Add code to randomly
      grab images from imgur and make them your life ''flashing before your eyes''
      as you fall to your death.[/spoiler] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWR516jdqeQ'
