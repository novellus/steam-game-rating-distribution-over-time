I wanted to learn how to make drinks and this gave me some ideas and skills. The downsides are that selecting menus can be kind of a hassle, and there's no way to reset anything if it drops.

If the bottles could return, it would literally by a flawless game, but I still highly recommend it, especially if you have an interest in bartending.","timestamp_created":1593713874,"timestamp_updated":1593713874,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536231875419616699","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxfqviPMCd7+hkgI="}
