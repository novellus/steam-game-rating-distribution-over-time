    about_the_game: "Summer Knights is an RPG Maker game about a simpler time. A time\
      \ of tag, water balloons, and coming in when the streetlights come on. It's\
      \ about childhood... and how awful it was. This comedy makes fun of childhood\
      \ nostalgia by forcing you to remember what it's really like to deal with eight\
      \ year olds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour choices in this game determine how you\
      \ experience this. Make fun of the childish antics, and you'll see the world\
      \ as it is. But if you play along, you'll see the world as it isn't. Will you\
      \ fight sticks or orcs? Will you sail the sea or will you cross the street?\
      \ Regardless, the annoyance of childhood will shine through, but perhaps an\
      \ honest glimmer of what we loved about it as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game's\
      \ music was composed by PengoSolvent. Get the soundtrack on bandcamp now."
