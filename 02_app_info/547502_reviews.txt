Mass Transit does add a lot of options, but the expansion is by this point has been rendered redundant in a number of ways. Let me explain.\n\nWhile on the surface Monorails look really useful due to being plopable directly on roads, the have largely been rendered obsolete by the revamped metro network, and they are almost crippled by being paradoxically loud and slow. This design decision on CO's part continues to baffle me, as monorails are known in real life for being two things; quiet and fast.\n\nTPME is basically a requirement to fix the network's slow speed limits, and either modded stations will be needed, or they must be kept as far from residential zones as possible or else they WILL make cims sick, or cause abandonment due to noise complaints. This leaves monorails as mainly something to connect commercial, office, and industrial zones with major intercity transit, which... metro did just as well even before the revamp. After the revamp? There's no real reason to use monorail aside from personal preference.\n\nThe monorail trains themselves also have the issue of using the ship shader, so their night lighting is bugged and textures suffer. This even effects some mods' monorail trains. As it stands, I REALLY wanted to love the monorail network, but its implementation sadly leaves much to be desired. TPME can help make the viable and even robust by removing network speed limits, but this is most certainly not a point in Mass Transit's favor.\n\nBlimps are a basically useless due to how slow and ponderous they are, with the same capacity as a bus. Even more than the monorail network, it has been rendered obsolete by Sunset Harbor's helicopter network, which is faster and quieter.\n\nFerries and cable cars stand out as the true useful options for this DLC, especially for crossing bodies of water, and both are actually well made and fun to use. There are also some new highway and road options, but nothing major.\n\nFinally there are some new hubs, mainly in the form of large, multi-platform train stations. These can work great for cities with extensive passenger train networks, and they can connect directly with the metro network to let cims get around your downtown area. There are also bus/ferry hubs that are quite useful, as well as a bus/monorail hub and a monorail/train/metro hub that serves well as the centerpiece of a large monorail network.\n\nWhile I do not regret purchasing Mass Transit, and I did have fun with it, I would personally recommend getting Sunset Harbor instead, unless you just really like monorails and blimps.\n\nOverall, my feelings on this expansion are mixed. I cautiously recommend, but I also strongly advise you to think before buying and consider the alternatives.","timestamp_created":1609916937,"timestamp_updated":1609916937,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4st6h6/YCc/32wAI="}
