It has a nice feel to it. Also being low res, helps keep the frame rate at a decent level for smooth gameplay. \nThe game play reminds me of an old, Commandos (yes, I have been playing games for decades) but it still looks fresh today. I like that you can play different ways to suit your style or mood, all stealthy and quite or fast and furious taken out all you see in front of you. \nThe game is well balanced but it’s not as easy as it looks, and there is also the timer to keep the pressure on. When you complete it there is a definite sense of achievement, however you’ll want to go again to get a better time or try to complete it a different way. There are a good variety of mobs with various difficulties to keep you on your toes.\nAlthough it’s only an early access game it plays well, and it feels like it’s longer than the four levels. I hope more people get to play it to encourage more development moving forward and I think to enhance the stealth style play it would be great to have a non-lethal take down.","timestamp_created":1591026349,"timestamp_updated":1591357407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ48d+SwvICf8vNiwI="}
