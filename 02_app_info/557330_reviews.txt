Doesn't mater how pretty a game looks or how impressive the story seems if you're waiting any more then a minute or two for the game itself to load.","timestamp_created":1577942230,"timestamp_updated":1577942230,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.439560443162918091","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1579399273,"developer_response":"Thanks for the review. Unfortunately that was a bug that showed up in the latest update, and I was away for the holidays. I should have it fixed soon. If you wish to wait a day or two for the patch, that would be great, otherwise feel free to request a refund. Happy New Year!\n\nEdit: The issue has been resolved."}],"cursor":"AoJwv/Srsu8CfJWR6QE="}
