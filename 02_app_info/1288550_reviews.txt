The gameplay changes slightly once you become infected, since you have to avoid yourself and others who are infected, yet also chase the opposite team making for quite a challenging game.\nCasual couch game taking advantage of the Steam Remote Play, yet still allows for single player against an AI, overall it is a fun game you can play with friends and it is good to see the developer adding new features.","timestamp_created":1591873713,"timestamp_updated":1591873713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538628935813903809","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tqbE0fICf5q0jQI="}
