    review: 'port of a tablet game.  has a fixed resolution that made the game unplayable
      for me because of slow-down.  was a neat little game but inability to do simple
      things like change the resolution gives this one a pass.  if it''s ever updated
      to be an actual PC game and not a lazy tablet port, i''d recommend it.  until
      then don''t bother.


      i refunded this game after being submitting a ticket about the resolution problems
      and getting a response that the resolution was fixed in this PC release.  maybe
      you''ll have better luck.


      down vote only because of technical issues, switches to recommend if it''s properly
      fixed.'
