There are beautiful backgrounds and fun Christmasy songs.  Oh and you get to design your own... cabin in the woods!  Don't worry, it is serene and peaceful and not horror-like at all.  I swear.  \n\nSo you do your Match-3 level and then no matter how many stars you get, you still get 10 coins.  Oh and if you like a challenging Match-3 games?  You came to the right place.  There is a timer down below that will keep you on your toes.  I sometimes blink and it is almost half way done.  Wait a second, did you say you actually want a relaxed/casual game?  Then just ignore the timer and do your own thing!  When the timer runs out: you get one star, but at least your heart will be at a resting state.\n\nGotta point out one thing... on level 74 that is (there are 80 levels btw)... okay on that level, there are 4 empty blocks up above where items are supposed to come out of.  Unless that's just my game of course.  You can still pass it... just interesting.\n\nSo okay, did you get all that?  Good!  Now go ahead and have some fun.  Make decisions on your own time.  Thank you for the very challenging game!!! :> :) =)","timestamp_created":1600740807,"timestamp_updated":1600740807,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lcrl2fQCc/qkowI="}
