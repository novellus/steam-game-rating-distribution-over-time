    review: "it is a sad story about a man who had lost almost everything, the end\
      \ was at least. i didnt really think this dlc was really any good until the\
      \ twist at the end. it was mostly boring imo. this dlc have a new song too,\
      \ namely some beautiful piano playing at the end. \n\nthis dlc is about 3 hours\
      \ long and has you play as an alpha series called sigma. the dlc have a new\
      \ weapon (ion laser), a new drone weapon, a new enemy type and ofc a 3 new levels\
      \ to explore.\n\nedit: i forgot to mention that i had some very blurry doors.\
      \ it was only 2 or 3 i think."
