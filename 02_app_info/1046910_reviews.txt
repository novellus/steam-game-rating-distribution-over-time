Whether you never got to dissect a frog, you're in school now, or just curious, I highly recommend. You have a hologram doctor and guides bringing you through the whole lab. While the dissection itself is just following lines and plucking organs the entire application is very thoughtful. They include a human anatomy chart on the wall for you to refrence, as well as many pop up charts with extra details. The setting itself is also very nice, feeling like a real lab, with the added addition of a jukebox and some good tunes! Very very happy with this.","timestamp_created":1560965198,"timestamp_updated":1560965198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.657787322998046875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi9axuOsCd5fewwE="}
