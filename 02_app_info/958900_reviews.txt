I was that upbeat for the game I had even joined their discord group which had nobody bar the developers which was a clear red flag! The Game didn’t register my left hand. Developer said I needed to remove the 3rd and 4th cameras but still the same issue. It looks nice but the single player is a wave shooter and with 1 hand obviously it’s terrible. It jumps from wave to wave erratically too. Multiplayer on the trailer looks awesome but couldn’t find a match after multiple tries. A lot of fixes need for this, so I had to get a refund. Seems like they invested a lot with the marketing and actors and my feeling is that they ran out of funds as the game has been released before the scheduled 2019 date and it still needs a lot of work. I’d say for everyone to wait until there are significant updates and improvements before buying. I will keep my eye out as it has potential to be great...but as it stands it’s just a big disappointment","timestamp_created":1541341699,"timestamp_updated":1541341699,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598124563694000244","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u/vH7+YCfPiErgE="}
