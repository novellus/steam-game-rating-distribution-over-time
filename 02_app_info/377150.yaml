    short_description: '&quot;Tactical Genius Online&quot; is a turn-based strategy
      game with the focus on multiplayer, in which the gameplay is broken up into
      two phases: concurrent planning and execution. Players give orders to their
      units, and only when everyone has finished their moves, the turns are put into
      action.'

    developer_response: "I would like to say a few words in defense of the game.\n\
      \n1.\tAbout \"Pay to Win\" - absolutely all content in the game (without exceptions)\
      \ is unlocked by winning the games, daily playing, getting positions in different\
      \ ratings. The majority of top players have never paid us real money. We chose\
      \ the FTP model because the game is multiplayer-oriented and players themselves\
      \ are interested in this model, if they want to find opponents for games.\n\n\
      2.\tThe three basic units are enough to play strong; the other units just add\
      \ the variability. Also to prevent our game from becoming P2W, we add the possibility\
      \ to select the rating group for searching the opponents - you always can play\
      \ against players with similar levels as yours!\n\n3.\tMoreover, the game has\
      \ the tournaments mode, where every player can earn gold, using all what the\
      \ game contains right away. If someone thinks that the reason of his defeats\
      \ is the lack of units or heroes, he can play tournament mode up to 3 defeats\
      \ in a week.\n\n4.\tThe need to specify each hexes is critically important for\
      \ our game, because each step can change the outcome of the game. At the time\
      \ of writing this review you have been playing for 0.2 hours. In the description\
      \ of our game we placed the particular emphasis on that fact that this game\
      \ focuses on multiplayer. If you had played several multiplayer games, the most\
      \ of your questions would have been settled.\n\n5.\tUpgrades during the battles\
      \ are critically important precisely because our game is not P2W! We strive\
      \ to create the same conditions for all our players, in such a manner that no\
      \ one has a priori the more \"powerful\" units, than the opponent has. And that's\
      \ the way it is for players who play tournaments mode as well as for players\
      \ who have unlocked all upgrades in the game. Besides, different ways and methods\
      \ to upgrade units during the battle add lots of variability.\n\nWe emphasize\
      \ once again that we have already written on the game page, in the video and\
      \ etc., to prevent players, who aren't interested in that kind of game, from\
      \ even downloading it in vain: our game is intended for those players, who are\
      \ interested in turn-based multiplayer. For those players who prefer other kinds\
      \ of games (not turn-based or turn-based but in single player mode), there are\
      \ a lots of interesting games, much more interesting than \"Tactical Genius\
      \ Online\" and we don't even try to compete with them.\n\nThanks for recognizing\
      \ the potential of the game :)"

    review: 'Tactical Genius Online (TGO) is not ready in its current state. The objective
      of the game is to capture your enemy''s capital before they capture yours. You
      play on a hex-grid map with towns that you can capture to expand your production
      limits. The game is played in turns with each player taking their turn. In order
      to capture a town, you must send your unit into it and it will be considered
      captured the following turn. Your units can be upgraded to gain either active
      skills or passive skills.


      Conclusion, wait till this game upgrades a few more stages before buying it.
      Pixeltales.ru needs to improve this game by a lot to catch up with other hex-grid
      games. It''s too far behind at the moment.


      [h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]

      1. Potential

      I would say that it could grow into a much better game. However, there are many
      kinks to sort out.


      [h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]

      1. Pay To Win

      Units and Heroes are locked behind a pay wall requiring one to pay cash to unlock
      heroes and types of units. E.g. Chief Engineer (Hero) and the Necromancer (Unit)


      2. Graphics

      Very dull. It''s the plain kind. You need to spice it up to make it look more
      interesting. You could refer to Endless Legend or Age of Wonder for hex-grid
      battles with decent graphics.


      3. Tedium of Upgrading

      Why do I need to click on my unit, find the super tiny upgrade button and click
      on it, just so I can choose which upgrade to take?


      4. Movement

      1 tile followed by another tile. Why can''t I just click on the tile I want
      to go to and the AI will fill in the movement in between?


      [h1][b]SUGGESTIONS[/b][/h1]

      1. Units

      Spec an initial build so units that are produced come in that build, rather
      than having to upgrade mid battle


      2. Movement

      Final tile movement, that''s it. Just click on where I want to go and the game
      will pathfind for me.'
