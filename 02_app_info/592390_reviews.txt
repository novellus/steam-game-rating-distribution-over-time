As usual, the main problem is the lack of players. I played be myself for 30 min, and I knew this was a great game. The graphics are good, weapons feel punchy and the pump shotty is a beast. I bought it for my friend straight away. The maps are fine, there is a really small map which is really hard, there is also a metro map, and the best map is a town in the forest map. It has multiple regions and Is the only map to utilise one of the biggest pros of this game, crafting. I have played for over an hour and setup an epic base with turrets. It is sad that the game uses crafting and basebuilding only in one map. I would suggest the developer to use it in all three maps. You can craft in every map, but the problem is the complete lack of materials in those maps. I have played this game solo and I can tell this is a very fun experience. But there are cons as well. \n\nHere is the list of things that need improving:\n\n-use the crafting system more\n\n- more zombie variety (I only saw two types of different zombie skins)\n\n-Gun attachments and the possibility of building a gun upgrade bench. \n\n-Material supply drops. ( After every night a possibility to collect materials from a supply drop on a random location on the map)\n\n-Longer days( days too short.)\n\n-Optimisation ( I was playing on max settings with rx vega 56 and i7 8700k and was still struggling to keep 60 fps.)\n\n-Zombies getting started in doorways due to high count\n\n-zombie physics (something like this would be very cool, with zombies climbing over each other like in \"world war Z\" the movie)\n\n-vehicle crafting (if you build a vehicle you can escape and therefore win)\n\n-Add collision to trees (you can walk through them right now)\n\nThese are just some ideas and improvements that can be added to the game.\n\nThe developer did a very good job with this game and I am looking forward to future updates. \nIf you are not sure about this buy it, play it for an hour if you dont like, just refund it. \n\nMy vote for this game is positive, and I wish the developer luck in the further development. \n\nComment for questions and discussions in the comment section.\n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1532119955,"timestamp_updated":1609249198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+8Gu1/YCcKzBpgE="}
