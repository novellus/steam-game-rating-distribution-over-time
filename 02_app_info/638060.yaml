      and monstrous will be available, summoned with your magic or found and 'befriended'.
      Use their abilities to scout the area and combat your opponents and their servants,
      avoiding confrontations that could otherwise bring a swift end to your efforts

      trial provides opportunities to improve yourself before the next trial, assuming

    review: "[Edit 2018 01 20]\nafter some discussion with devs, i decided re-purchase.\n\
      and starting to check things more even with odd melee rule.\n\nthe price increased\
      \ by about 3 dollars according to update version 0.96-x\n\n<the current feature>\n\
      1. there is no long running campaign. \n2. game/progress is limited to skirmish\
      \ on a relatively huge fixed map. (enemies either)  \n3. default key bindings\
      \ is kinda accustomed one. and can be changed easily in option.\n4. music and\
      \ sound are ok. (i don't care) but the graphic is hand-drawn with own style.\
      \ its hormy and funny. i like it.\n5. all in all, option covers everything needed.\n\
      6. you can make your avatar with a lot of choice. (parameters and spell choice)\
      \ but this part is still on the way. (might be changed dramatically)\n\n<oddities>\n\
      game could be played only with keyboard, its good thing in itself, but again\
      \ in odd fashion and sometimes it becomes very cumbersome. for that reason,\
      \ i can't play for enough long time to have a taste of this game yet.\n\n<conclusion>\n\
      might become better for seeing dev's active effort. this impressed me a good\
      \ hope.\nbut when taken in practical way,\nif you had enough patience (or forgiveness),\
      \ could wait for future updates, and were a lover of old-fashioned TBS IGO UGO\
      \ game, then this game could be your thing.\notherwise, i can't recommend this\
      \ game for 15 dollars. its a bit too ambitious.\n\n[Edit 2018 01 14]\nit doesn't\
      \ matter forced move of melee getting changed to have JUST a chance of automated\
      \ defense from RNG or getting even terrain effect of enemy occupying grid.\n\
      \nnot changing my negative review yet.\nbut dev is very responsive and the game\
      \ seems to be getting update so often. i would re-purchase in near future.\n\
      \nfor those who want to know more detail, please go to forum thread from the\
      \ link in the dev's post.\n\n[Edit 2018 01 01]\ndevs talk about combat system.\
      \ so there could be possible changes in the future.\nif the changes could evaluate\
      \ downside of forced move, total experience of this game should change dramatically.\n\
      but until then, my conclusion in original review never changes.\n\n[Original\
      \ Review 2017 11 24]\nbasically, moving and any action are separated. that is,\
      \ every action needs AP.\nthis means player needs to care for AP to get better\
      \ position. \nbut when killing mobs, player char moves to the grid of the mob\
      \ with no AP use.\nif player had to enter into enemy's grid when combat like\
      \ chess (and it has no AP), this makes sense. but player can do melee attack\
      \ only from adjacent grid. while ranged attack works with keeping current position.\n\
      \nthis odd rule not only breaks tactical meaning of position, but also means\
      \ forced suicidal advance in any condition.\nthis made me feel so stupid."
