An illegally addictive game, super relaxing, the levels are fun and the sandbox mode is a great addition...YOU MUST HAVE THIS GAME!...the satisfaction of finally making a working contraption is incomparable. I would rate this a 6\/5 if I could. Bravo!&quot; -banjo_vr<br><\/li><li>&quot;One of the best games I have played...simple, engaging, challenging, immediate replayability, and a great pick up and go game...I loved the way the &quot;story&quot; built and was revealed, and I don't mind admitting that the end scene made me cry because it was so beautiful.&quot; -TastyZombieSnack<br><\/li><li>&quot;A game made with love. This game deserve more than 5 stars, and the new cubes and colours update is such a great add on. The first time I saw the colours tool I felt like a child!&quot; -marcodead<br><\/li><li>&quot;Not many games deserve 5 stars. This one has a natural learning curve, unlimited solutions &amp; you can leave and come back to it again without skipping a beat. If you are patient and MacGyver-like, this game is for you. The creativity is it's own reward. This is a very complete game and will only get better in 2020&quot; -LarryLizzard<br><\/li><li>&quot;The puzzles are challenging but fair and each level is incredibly satisfying to complete...This game is worth every bit of $15 and is easily one of my top 3 games...it deserves way more attention.&quot; -Itz_jalex<br><\/li><li>&quot;Your game is seriously addictive and so much fun to play. I was really hoping for a game like that on VR and now my dream will come true. Can't wait to see the final game!! Nice work! &quot; -little_angel_950<br><\/li><li>&quot;A perfect Rube Goldberg sim.

My 14-year-old son has worked on Rube Goldberg projects over the years in school and is a hard sell on new VR apps...I love seeing him do something creative like this...He was pleasantly surprised how many levels\/rooms there are as well. He never complains about it being hard to manipulate. Thank you to devs for stretching his imagination during this time.&quot; -blert23<br><\/li><li>&quot;My 9 year old daughter loves Rude Goldberg machines. During Covid-19 Stay at home, this is a great way to let her escape and make them. It's a great thinking and physics learning experience for her (and me). To buy the actual marble runs etc. in reality wouldn't come close to this for options, cost and no risk of choking hazards ;-)&quot; -Gamerrangerbob<br><\/li><li>&quot;[...] I definitely need to get this for my classroom.&quot; -17102<\/p><br><h1>Awards &amp; Recognition<\/h1><p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Forbes' &quot;Top 50 VR Games of 2019&quot;<br><\/li><li>Oculus, &quot;7 Must-Do Things in VR&quot;<br><\/li><li>Finalist, Auggies' &quot;Best Game\/Toy of 2020&quot;<br><\/li><li>PC Gamer's &quot;most anticipated VR games of 2019&quot;<br><\/li><li>1st place, VanVR Experience Contest<\/li><\/ul><\/p><br><h1>Discord Community<\/h1><p><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/discord.gg\/EqTDVmy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  ><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/746560\/extras\/join-our-discord-450p.png?t=1601072892\" \/><\/a><\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/746560\/extras\/rows-of-pingpong-balls-2-12-secs-compressed.gif?t=1601072892\" \/><br><br>Gadgeteer is a physics-based VR puzzle game where you build chain reaction machines to solve fun, intricate puzzles.
