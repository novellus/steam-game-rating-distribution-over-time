    review: 'Most indeededly, yes.


      Ive had a blast with this one, space survival? sign me up.

      This potential was put to great use. The fact that just two devs made a really
      clean and fun VR experience is impressive. Ive really enjoyed my time in Star
      Shelter. The intro was pretty breath taking, and was not expecting to need another
      set of pants for it either.

      There are tons of bugs tbh. Could be memory dump issues... not sure.

      But still worth every penny.

      Cant wait for Star Shelter 2!'
