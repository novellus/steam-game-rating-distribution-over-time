    review: I don't know what drugs the developers were taking but I advise everyone
      to not take them. Settle Down scenario is particularly glitched, arrive at each
      station 2-3 minutes early to get hit by a timeliness 'penalty' of at least 100
      points, signals don't appear on the HUD and when you go to switch the headlights
      of the class 158 on the only option you get is the tail lights, do yourself
      a favour and don't fund the developers drug habits.
