    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality[/h1]\n\n\
      You can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/YIRZqZX0XHo\n\nThis\
      \ is not a good game. There's so many issues with this game. First of all, you\
      \ can only teleport. There is no smooth or snap turning. The game runs horribly\
      \ on my 1060 GTX. I was getting frame rates anywhere from 90 FPS to 20 FPS.\
      \ The frame rates were all over the place in this game. \n\nBut that's not all.\
      \ The AI is horrible. There are so many bugs in this game, I can't even take\
      \ the time to describe them all. The sounds are pretty awful as well. The same\
      \ lines keep repeating over and over. \n\nThere are 5 different maps. They each\
      \ have a different objective. Mostly, you're looking for treasure though. There's\
      \ one underwater level where you just get moved around underwater and then just\
      \ open a chest at the end to find your treasure ... a jar. Then the level ends.\
      \ Seriously. On another level, it was telling me to climb a tree. I still have\
      \ no idea why I climbed it. It didn't do anything and had nothing to do with\
      \ finishing the level. Most of the levels you just shoot at dumb AI though.\
      \ \n\nYou press grab to switch different weapons. It seems like you can just\
      \ stand there like an idiot and take lots of damage. It doesn't seem to matter\
      \ because I don't know if you can die. And your helicopter pilot's name is Bunny.\
      \ Bunny is the second best thing, next to all the particle effects from the\
      \ explosions which do look cool. It may also be the reason why the game runs\
      \ so poorly.\n\nThere's not a lot of content. I think you can finish the game\
      \ in 30-40 minutes ... if you can get past all the bugs. \n\n[b]Rate 3/10. It's\
      \ really bad. It's so bad that even $5 feels like they are over-charging. Too\
      \ late for me to refund my $4 USD though (sale price). At least I had a good\
      \ laugh at how bad this game is. I'll always remember my helicopter ride with\
      \ Bunny and shooting a wolf and see it keel over while howling.[/b]"
