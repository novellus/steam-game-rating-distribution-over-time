    review: "I've changed my review to positive more for informational purposes regarding\
      \ the bonus game. There has been an update and I can now see other bonus content\
      \ so I am assuming the bonus game is working now.  I played this game on an\
      \ other computer so I would have to play this game again to even see if the\
      \ bonus game was there let alone to play it.\n\nI really disagree with the practice\
      \ of needing a bonus game to finish the story which is why I never recommended\
      \ an ERS game on big fish. But as there is only the CE version being sold on\
      \ steam it's not as big a deal here.  This was one of the best series of games\
      \ at the time of release years ago, it does feel dated but still a good game\
      \ and hopefully now I can finish this game and play the others back to back\
      \ I will finally understand the whole story! :) \n\n[strike]There are 2 other\
      \ reviews saying the same thing and it's still not fixed- there is no bonus/extra\
      \ content at all and this includes the bonus game.  There is a strategy guide\
      \ and in it, it says the bonus game can be accessed in the extra area in the\
      \ main menu the problem is there is no extra content.  I don't know why as this\
      \ never happens in any other game, but I thought maybe the extra content would\
      \ show up after you finish the main game but it doesn't.  To make matters even\
      \ worse the main game ends on the worst cliffhanger, doesn't even attempt to\
      \ try and finish the story and you need the bonus game to finish the story (as\
      \ you do in all this series and a lot of ERS games).\n\nAs the dev knows about\
      \ the problem as it's been reported in the reviews months ago, they are either\
      \ unsupportive, deliberately false advertising a CE when it's a SE, either case\
      \ is unacceptable and they need to be held unaccountable until this is fixed.\
      \  I have the other 2 games in this series in steam, but haven't played them\
      \ here (I've played the SE version in big fish) both seem to have extras and\
      \ although I can't see the bonus game I take it is there, as no one has said\
      \ anything about it missing and it's just this game that has the problem.\n\n\
      For anyone who thinks we just don't know where the extras are, you can see from\
      \ the big fish walkthrough where the extras are supposed to be in the main menu\
      \ and you can see from my screenshot there isn't anything anywhere.\n\nhttps://www.bigfishgames.com/blog/walkthrough/haunted-halls-revenge-of-dr-blackmore-walkthrough/\n\
      \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1751866927\n\nIf it\
      \ says it's a CE then the very least it should have is a bonus game when you\
      \ know there is a bonus game.[/strike]"
