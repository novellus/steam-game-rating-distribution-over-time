    review: 'I am not a composer or music fanatic, but every volume adds more fantastic
      music that is great for playing when my group gets together for the physical
      version of the card game. I initially had some issues finding the soundtrack,
      but most Windows users should be able to locate in:


      steamapps/common/sentinelsofthemultiverse/soundtrack.'
