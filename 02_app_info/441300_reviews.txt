The gold edition dlc is retarded though and I wouldn't recommend it. There is a surprising amount of quality in the popular maps section. I love this game and would recommend it to anyone looking for a old school fps.","timestamp_created":1494388948,"timestamp_updated":1494388948,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567567586898803711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwreh+NsCfLnieA=="}
