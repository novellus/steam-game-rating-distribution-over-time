I just got through this game and let me tell you...holy cow! The combat mechanics are very simple and easy to grasp which you think would make it boring right? WRONG! The enemies are pretty difficult and the learning curve is pretty high. If you make a simple mistake you get punished for it hard. Kind of like Dark Souls. This game is also filled with puzzles that progressively get harder and harder as the game goes on. Some of the puzzles nearing the end had my brain fried! I'm glad I gave this game a chance it's definitely worth the price I paid. I would say this game is not meant for the casual gamer. It's more for gamers who like punishment and torture. Do you have what it takes to make it through this game!? Onto New Game + wish me luck everyone!","timestamp_created":1559106235,"timestamp_updated":1559106235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568805694580078125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p6X+gOsCd8agwgE="}
