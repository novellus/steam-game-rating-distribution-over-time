[/h1]\n\nBefore I go in depth to how this has turned out so far, here's a summary of what I feel if you are looking to buy this. This game is unfinished, and has most of its story behind DLC that will be released next year. If you really want to give this game a shot and enjoy it, best wait as right now this game isn't even worth being installed on your computer. The DLC promises a bigger narrative with more stuff happening but since nothing really happens in the story right now, I don't feel that it will be any longer than 20 minutes, which is not worth it.\n\nAlright so about the game. It's story is really really small. It's a simple story about a introverted collage student trying to... do something. See an issue here is that there is no motive for the main character or the reader for one bit. The story also doesn't dive deep enough for us as readers to understand what is the goal of our protagonist. The store page says \"Can you guide an aspiring artist to success?\" but nothing from the visuals shows that she is an artist. The actual text from the story doesn't showcase that Ingrid (the main character) is an artist either, other than the introduction in the beginning. From there, Ingrid goes to class to scold her roommate, the professor asks one question, and then they go to their dorm and dress up for some party. At the party, there's some weird things going on which \"transports\" the character to different timelines or something, one where the main character is married to someone we just met in the story, one where there's a knife pulled on her, and then the game ends right when Ingrid tries to ask the professor something. \n\nThis isn't complete or gripping at all because nobody can be invested when nothing really happens. If this was slowed down to an hour nothing of the sort would be happening, and even when it's sped up to 10 minutes, it doesn't feel like anything has happened to the characters. The game considers its story gripping, but it's only gripping because this 10 minute story ends on randomness, which doesn't make it really gripping at all, just makes it feel uninspired. The game also has diverging story lines, but they aren't really diverging since the story ends the same way. This could be expanded on in the DLC.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is highlighted, which while isn't bad, isn't anything that stands out. It's your classic piano background melody that fits with what's shown on the screen most of the time. It's not something I feel anyone will go out of their way to listen to but it's not harmful in any way.\n\nI feel in it's current state it's a hard pass, even if it was free. And when the DLC comes out, I still don't think it's worth installing it, unless if the story actually has depth. This is because the first impressions of this make this feel like a demo for an engine, more than an actual story game. \n\n[b]And that's probably my biggest issue[/b]. This game has potential, but it's not doing anything with that. It tries to act like there's a ton here but most of the screenshots on the store page show most of what you are going to see. It relies on the possibility of future DLC as a way to hold people over but nobody I feel will be biting their nails at what happens next. More people seem interested if this game will even continue more than seeing where the story will go. It's sad really, because I know how long this game took to come out and how many people were dogging on the developer saying it will never finish, but it's inexcusable as it's still not finished in it's current state and they are charging 3$ for it.","timestamp_created":1607340541,"timestamp_updated":1607344838,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575688064098358154","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1607385017,"developer_response":"Thank you for the review. \n\nTo reiterate, Ad Movere started writing about two months into 2020, after that i had switched art styles as i found an artist who could help. The rate I was getting art back was not matching the speed I was programming, and as a result, as the release date crept (which I couldn't move, due to Valve) I had to split the game into chapters. The script for the other two are complete. But they will take a lot of time to fully program and finish (as they are a lot longer) I do appreciate your critiques and will put them to use. Thanks for your review.\n\nAs for the price, the game was originally going to be free, but due to having other people working on the game with me who required payment, I had to make it 3 dollars to compensate.
