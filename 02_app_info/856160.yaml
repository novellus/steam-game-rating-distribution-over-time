    review: "Hi there\nThis is my first attempt to write a review, and i'm also an\
      \ ESL guy - so please don't juge me too hard.\n\nBasically, i ramble through\
      \ the new vr games looking for a new sensations. Star Baron looked like prety\
      \ promising release.\nThe idea of riding a sci-fi beast mounted with lasers\
      \ was a great attractor for me. And i could say it was nicely embodied.\n\n\
      The main good thing is - i was really able to experience the feeling of ride\
      \ without heaving a seasick after couple of minutes of playing. \n\nThe second\
      \ good thing is the way main character sometimes talks with the beast. It reminds\
      \ me of a badass speeches of Duke Nukem or Ben Throttle, but with some meaningfull\
      \ roar in responce.\n\nLevel design is reminding me of some megalomaniac landscapes\
      \ from Star Wars. I guess that was something from \"Force awakens\".\n\nAI of\
      \ human engineers is hilariously dumb. Sometimes i'm asking myself \"So, that's\
      \ the way the guys with university degree attempt to fight tank-like creature\
      \ on the open spaces, huh?\". They should've been called stormtroopers, lol.\n\
      \n\nTo be honest, i still have one thing to wish of the game, mostly about the\
      \ making controls provide more rein-like experience. \nI can do \"Strafe Leap\"\
      \ with Touch Device gesture - it feels great. So why not try to perform \"Turn\"\
      \ with similarly gesture (instead of moving thumbstick), just like you do it\
      \ with the rein to control horse in real life? I belive, that could be an awesome\
      \ update.\n\n\nThanks and good luck to you all!"
