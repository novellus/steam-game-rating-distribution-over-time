In March, the game received its first negative review for having no executable file, and today in November when I tried to take a second look at this game to see if he has made any progress, I got the same \"missing executable\" error.\n\nIt sure looks like that this game hasn't even had an executable game to play from at least March to now in November, that's a minimum of EIGHT MONTHS.  Hard to believe that this game has seen eight of the ten months it's been on Steam (80%) as a complete scam or fraud.  Now you get nothing for your money except an error and the developer just doesn't seem to care.\n\nNoel's Hope now scores a big fat ZERO for the zero care this developer shows for his only title on Steam now... and Noel's Hope makes my list of some of the most dreaded games on Steam.. M.I.S.S. #70.\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED.. Unless you want to pay money to see a \"missing executable\" Steam error.\n\n------------ OLD INITIAL LAUNCH DAY REVIEW --------------\n( No longer is the video below an accurate representation of the missing file error today)\n\nIf you'd like to see my launch day video of this game and my encouragement and list of suggestions of report of issues this game had at launch day, you can watch that video below:\n\nWatch My \"First Play on Launch Day\" Impressions and Review Video HERE:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6u_6HAuXxA&feature=youtu.be\n\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!.  ALL YOU'LL GET IS A MISSING EXE ERROR!!!","timestamp_created":1548719767,"timestamp_updated":1573196768,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548717975616455078","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwsLT1pO4CeI+7uQE="}
