    about_the_game: "The Hunslet LNER/BR J94 saddle tank from Meshtools is now available\

      \ Hunslet Class 50550. At the outbreak of World War II, the War Department amended\
      \ the design to allow for speedier and cheaper production of this general purpose\
      \ 0-6-0 saddle tank, and the Hunslet Austerity tank was born. A preferred locomotive\
      \ for shunting yards and around shipyards and docks, the J94 was an agile locomotive\
      \ thanks to its short wheelbase and efficient hauling capacity.<br><br><br>After\
      \ the War, 75 J94s were transferred to the London &amp; North Eastern Railway\
      \ (LNER) and subsequently to British Railways, and incredibly the Class continued\
