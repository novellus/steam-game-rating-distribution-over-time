    review: 'This is probably the first story I''ve seen that discusses both the problems
      and importance of hatred. With it''s well written lore and characters, Slimes
      is a game I can very much recommend for people looking for a unique narrative.

      Though I''ll also note that the narrative is very morally draining. I found
      myself putting the game down for days after an hour of playtime out of necessity,
      so don''t go into this expecting something uplifting.


      The turn-based combat is very well designed, constantly encouraging you to come
      up with new strategies to get past different enemies. Even by the end of the
      game where I had thought I found an undefeatable strategy, I''d still get caught
      off guard by encounters where one of the two party members would be stunned
      or debuffed in a way that countered it. The way combat strategies tied into
      the story of the two protagonists who completely hated each other made the design
      all that much better.


      Only complaint I have is in the UI. Slimes suffers from using a very basic version
      of RPG Maker UI, where the game''s core mechanics and the functionality of RPG
      maker don''t fit well together.

      For example, every time you want to use a gun, you have to use "Equip Gun",
      select the only character who can equip guns, get taken out of the skill menu,
      then go back into the menu to actually use the gun. This is only a bigger annoyance
      where if you want to reload outside of combat, you have to manually equip each
      gun and reload it, going through dozens of menus after each battle.

      The game does give you a "Full Reload" skill about halfway through, but considering
      it only exists to make the UI less painful, it honestly should have been unlocked
      from the start.


      None the less, if poor UI and heavy writing don''t sound like a deal breaker,
      very much recommend this to both RPG fans or people looking for a new kind of
      story.'
