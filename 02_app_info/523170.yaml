    review: 'I don''t think this game needs a review, because it''s free, but i''m
      gonna go on ahead and say that HOLY F*CKING SHIT THIS GAME HAS POTENTIAL. These
      were my initial thoguhts looking at the info :


      "You can build guns"

      Meh...

      "Over 40 parts"

      Okay, I guess...

      "Pimp-My -Gun"

      That sounds kinda interesting...

      "Revolver Sniper Rifles and 3 barreled AUG 20s"

      This is getting cool...

      "A rocket launcher"

      You''re close!

      "Completely customizabe RPMs, recoil, and damage"

      F*ck it! I''m playing this sh*t!


      Pros :

      - Think of a combination of Minecraft and H3VR (Major)

      - Parts snap together with nodes making it easy to build. (Minor)

      - Completely customizable guns down to RPM, Amount of ammo, Precision, and Bullet
      Type. (Major)

      - You can make RPGs, Swords, and M90 Thumpers (Grenade Launcher), so it''s not
      entirely about guns. (Intermediate)

      - Gunsword (Minor)

      - Actually shootable targets that will respond to the damage output accordingly.
      (Minor)

      - Saving guns feature (Major)

      - Good shading (Minor)

      - Visible Bulletholes (Minor)

      - Almost no noticeable glitches (Intermediate)


      Cons :

      - The guns are just named random things like "Sieck.sfwep" or "Caopolroh.sfwep"
      (Minor)

      - The part grabbing is innacurate which can ruin an entire gun''s build (Major)

      - No Tutorial (Intermediate)

      - The node-snapping is sometimes really off and can ruin an entire gun''s build
      (Major)

      - Unrealistic reloading, for example, you don''t have to pull a bolt after sticking
      a magazine into the receiver. (Minor)

      - Some barrels are too big for any receiver (Minor)

      - Cheap-sounding click Sound FX (Minor)
