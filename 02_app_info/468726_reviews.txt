I own quite a few of the various seasons and expansions in real life but for $10 I didn't mind picking this up to play online.\n\nI use this game to introduce my friends into tabletop who aren't into board games but like video games. I usually describe it as L4D in tabletop form and it sells it to them and they all have enjoyed it so far. Definitely make sure you're familiar with the rules though to ease them into it!\n\nI do wish there was more content but luckily the workshop has just about everything and great scripting too.","timestamp_created":1608799434,"timestamp_updated":1608799434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0eb6yfYCdcPbvAI="}
