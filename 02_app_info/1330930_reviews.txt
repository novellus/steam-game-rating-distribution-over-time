Love the lowkey D&D-type references and character banter, love the fourth wall breaks, love the amount of sass Seeker manages to compact into their one smol body. The jokes are great, as are the character designs and interactions. The goat really does say maa! Seeker's pronouns default to they/them and can be customized to your liking, a revelation that absolutely floored me!!! Trying to puzzle out the mystery was a blast for myself and my partner. Excellent game, only wish there were more and/or that it were longer!","timestamp_created":1609499841,"timestamp_updated":1609499841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ntLq3vYCd5+vvwI="}
