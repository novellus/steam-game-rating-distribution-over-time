Hit detection is almost always spot on, allowing one to dodge blocks and traps fairly easily.  There's a fair number of stages, raising the challenge in an appropriate curve.\n\nCONS: As the game presents everything right away, it leaves little to the imagination as the stages progress, simply becoming longer and more difficult.  The hit boxes on moving traps is the only real frustration, as it can be difficult to judge as they change locations.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS: A balanced list of simple tasks and more intuitive puzzles that can force you to think carefully on how you want to play a stage.  The one exception is a single achievement that requires 3 of your friends to both have owned and played this game, something not too common with a game this old.\n\nFINAL: A fun little brain twister, even coming back years later to complete the achievement list.  It has it's ups and downs, but overall, it's worth a look, especially with it's current price.","timestamp_created":1573528782,"timestamp_updated":1573528782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy/jnru4Cf6DE2QE="}
