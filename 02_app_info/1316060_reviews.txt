The controls in particular are atrocious with both gamepad and keyboard controls being an unworkable disaster. This should have used a mouse for aiming and indeed many of the keyboard bindings seem geared towards this style of gameplay but the mouse isn't used at all outside the main screen. Oh and that reminds me, you can't properly change keyboard binds once you've started playing, you have to quit to the menu and change there. Again, a disaster. The maker of this game seems to be aware of how unintuitive the game is because there are actually written messages indicating what is hidden beyond reach when you reach your typical metroidvania barrier.\n\nOverall, this is a good first attempt for microbat studios, but not good enough for a recommendation. I hope microbat can learn from the mistakes made in this first attempt when he/she makes their next game. Time for me to refund...","timestamp_created":1601397769,"timestamp_updated":1601558116,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579187393188476563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6q6T8vQCfdXtpAI="}
