      \ shunting locomotives, and so a plan was put in place for a fleet to be procured\
      \ and most of the large loco manufacturers would get involved in development\
      \ and production of the new type.<br><br>The first few prototypes were ready\
      \ by 1955, and this new loco, called the DB V 60, would soon be developed by\
      \ the dozen with a total of 942 delivered by the time production ceased in 1964.\
      \ There were 2 main variants produced, a lighter and heavier version for different\
      \ kinds of freight work, under the computerised classification system these\
      \ became BR 260 and 261 respectively.<br><br>In 1987, the locomotives were grouped\
      \ along with many other shunters as Kleinloks (minor locomotives) in order to\
      \ save on driver training costs and as part of this switch they were all reclassified\
      \ once again, this time becoming BR 360 and 361. Some locomotives were fitted\
      \ with radio control equipment and had new Caterpillar 12-cylinder engines installed,\

    review: 'Wonderful! I had high hopes concerning this locomotive and I''m glad
      to say that it did turn out to be great! It''s very detailed, the weathering
      is very nice, the amount of services is quite large. It takes some time to master
      driving it, there''s quite a bit of complexity inside the cab and the throttle
      and brake systems are not as easy as in other german locos I drove in this game.


      I think the only thing I''d kinda wish for to appear in addition to this DLC
      would be services for other german routes than Ruhr Sieg Nord and an old-school
      version of the loco.'
