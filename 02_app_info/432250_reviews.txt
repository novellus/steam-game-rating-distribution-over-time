The game itself is only a parody of simcity, that, even with your personal political point of view touched doesn't make it a bad game.\nI've seen it on an Italian channel (Parliamo di Videogiochi), that really explained how well it was at the beginning, now the dev is disappeared, but I've boyed it anyway, hoping something change and other people buy the game.\nI really hope the dev come back and finish the game, it was stopped at the beginning for literally 200 angry guys that leaved bad reviews with no real clue of the actual game but only hate for every kind of critique and lack of respect for other people work and entertainement.","timestamp_created":1580075743,"timestamp_updated":1594222353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456431567668914795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4ptPDl/MCeLSq7gE="}
