It's such a weird mix of Boomer Shooters while also being it's own thing. Don't come into this expecting Doom (well not all Doom but some of it is in there). Theres a really well done story, interesting level layouts. It all connects to each other, theres \"Stealthy\" type moments in the game. It's really quite a fun time. I've played about 3 hours here on Steam but I played this game on CD-Rom for years.\n\nThis edition adds Mouse Control and damn is it an absolute godsend.","timestamp_created":1609638202,"timestamp_updated":1609638202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqbn64vYCco32vwI="}
