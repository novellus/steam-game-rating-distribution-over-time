    about_the_game: Jitusmi's Blue-Light Filter is a tool which allows users to reduce
      the amount of blue light emitted from the user's monitor screen. Blue light
      is usually seen as a bad thing as it can cause things such as eye strains. Blue
      light can also affect your sleep as blue light can suppress the secretion of
      melatonin which can make it harder to go to sleep during night time.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Features</strong></h2><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Time-based filters<br></li><li>Strength of filter<br></li><li>Note
      Keeper</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Time Based Filter</strong></h2>Jitusmi's
      Blue Light Filter allows the users to be able to set the blue light filter depending
      on the time of the user's day. This can allow users to set the blue light filter
      to only enable at a certain time of the day which can provide the power of enabling
      the blue light filter during the night time when blue light is the most effective.<h2
      class="bb_tag"><strong>Strength of Filter</strong></h2>Jitsumi's Blue Light
      Filter allows the users to set the strength of the filter. This allows users
      to adjust the sensitivity of the filter depending on the time or what the user
      is doing.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Note Keeper</strong></h2>Jitsumi's Blue
      Light Filter allows users to keep notes. This can allow users to remind themselves
      about something that might be happening.

    review: "This software requires a constant internet connection to work, and even\
      \ when a stable one is presented, it will crash every few minutes. \n\nHave\
      \ emailed the dev a couple of times with no response. Why is the constant connection\
      \ needed for a simple light filter, you ask? Who knows. If you believe the dev's\
      \ intentions are entirely innocent despite this, bear in mind that every time\
      \ your connection drops, this thing will stop working and ask you to email the\
      \ dev with a bug report. They won't reply. Like I said before, it'll crash with\
      \ alarming regularity, even with a clean connection.\n\nI've had it for a good\
      \ while and there haven't been any attempts made to update or improve anything.\
      \ I'm sorry to say this is literally one of the worst things I've ever seen\
      \ on this platform. \n\nI'll remove this review if it's ever fixed or if the\
      \ dev ever replies, but we both know that's not going to happen."
