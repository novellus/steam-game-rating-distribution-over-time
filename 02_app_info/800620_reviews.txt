This whole story builds the foundation of yourself and how you become a villain. Your special super power is awesome and I absolutely love the inclusion of another main character you control, its such an awesome perspective and I am in love with this whole idea.\n\nBuilding up your character and learning about your past, forming rivalries, seeing every ones reaction to your choices as you sit in the sidelines maniacally laughing to yourself is so sweet and addicting. The romance is very solid, there is was so much emotional conflict. You truly shape the story how you want, you wont feel like something is going completely out of your control as your choices help keep the story in the line you want, its perfect.\n\nThe whole game was very lengthy in an amazing way, i was entirely hooked and never felt that things were going too slow or too fast. The ending was also great, it did not feel like a cliffhanger and I felt like this was a proper ending to this first part of the story. I have no regrets on my choices and I am extremely excited to try the second part!","timestamp_created":1609742256,"timestamp_updated":1609753678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi/qy5vYCeuinwAI="}
