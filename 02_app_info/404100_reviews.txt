And you can retry for infinite times, just without any recovery on HP and ammo. (which is pretty fair and good for practice)\n\nRecommended.","timestamp_created":1605106589,"timestamp_updated":1605106589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41Nvz2/UCfY3hrQI="}
