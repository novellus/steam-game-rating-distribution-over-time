    short_description: Slaughter 3 is the third-person shooter with lots of guns,
      fun and a nit of dark humor. The single player campaign offers a threadbare
      story, taking the player character Russell through a bunch of levels and missions.
      Break through the enemies, destroying everything that moves!

    review: 'Basic gameplay, simple mechanics but very solid game, with a cool leveling
      and progression system.
