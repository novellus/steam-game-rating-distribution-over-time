The story is okay, though not compelling, the voice acting is consistent, and the atmosphere and setting are very well done.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n-  standard, but well-executed, word-based HO scenes with some objects requiring an extra step or two\n- interesting and occasionally challenging puzzles\n- pleasant, intelligent protagonist who feels more real than many\n- easy to follow integrated Guide\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- the lack of a map is frustrating; there are areas with a fair bit of back and forth\n- no collectables, no achievements (not even in-game achievements)\n- little re-use of what should be reusable items; the bonus chapter allows more re-use of items\n\n[b]Note:[/b]  I didn't try the Hint system, since I avoid using Hints out of habit; there is a good chance that the Hint system makes up for not having an interactive map to show you action points; I did refer to the Guide twice, but that was partly because I left the game and came back to it a couple of times, which is never optimal\n\nThe game is worth getting if you don't mind a game with an older look and feel, including no map and less than perfect graphics.  The HO scenes and puzzles are a bit more challenging than more recent games, and the variety of puzzles is nice.","timestamp_created":1598416132,"timestamp_updated":1598416168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.592183470726013184","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxOTBlPQCefDnnQI="}
