Game took me about 5 hours to finish (ignore hour count - I accidentally left it running overnight after attempting to play through steam link on mobile) and the experience and self-satisfaction of beating it was well worth the $0.50 I paid for it (sale). Having played and beaten it, I do think the $2 asking price is a fair one. Early stages are pretty trivial as you learn the concepts, but the last 5 or so really gets challenging and take A LOT of planning as one wrong move can mean a level restart since you cannot undo a move (would have been nice feature).\n\nWould really like to see extra levels (not necessarily harder) and Steam achievements added.","timestamp_created":1576011273,"timestamp_updated":1576011273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4svLl+O4Cf8m74wE="}
