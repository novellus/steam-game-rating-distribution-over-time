Don’t overlook this gem.\n\nI must admit, towards the end I was done with the combat, even though it was what roped me in from the start, the story was what kept me going. Mid second area the story just jump starts and you’re emotionally hooked.\nThe last thing I expected from a puzzle fighter was to overwhelm me with the story and character arcs!\n\nHow it work:\nYou move along a grid with 4 different tiles. The longer the you move the harder you hit. You also fill up your special depending on the tile. As you progress in the story you unlock new abilities, weapons and upgrades. Completing additional objects gives you points which you can spend to buff certain stats or special passive abilities for you character.\n\nThe Good:\n+Story\n+Writing\n+Combat\n+Cool special moves\n+Diversity in build paths\n+Boss battles/special battles\n+Side content\n\nThe Bad:\n-Music is okay at max\n-Too easy (or maybe I’m just pro who knows?)\n-Some normal battles don’t really offer a challenge\n-I beat the game and I want more\n\nI didn’t think the game would capture me like this, don’t listen to the other reviews that been playing for 6 hours and give their opinion, they don’t know how good it gets.\n\nEven though I wasn’t excited about the fighting towards the end, it still made me laugh how powerful I managed to make my heroes. The synergy between certain skills can almost give you an endless turn :o\n\n8/10\n","timestamp_created":1606305691,"timestamp_updated":1606305691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41/bR//UCfoq0sAI="}
