I was first drawn to the way it looked from preview video and I'm glad I found it.\n\nThe maps are awesome. Plenty of variety and most importantly, in my opinion, is that the obstacles are hard, but not impossible. I find myself making steady progress every session, but not so much that it feels like I'm breezing through. It's this balance that brings me back to the game when I find the time. To add to this, once you complete the game, you can re run it with the aim to unlock the other achievements, giving you a constant goal to hit while not getting bored.\n\nI highly recommend this to both verterans of the genre and certainly to people that are new to it.\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1519835824,"timestamp_updated":1519835824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.468609869480133057","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+MfR7uECer6umgE="}
