    review: 'When I saw this appear ages ago I was a bit weirded out; I never thought
      Galaxy Force 2 was any good and relied too much on the cabinet. This is excellent,
      however, and the missile-zip motion and ever-so-brief invulnerability work well
      as both tactical battle options and escape techniques for more new gameplay.


      I enjoyed this, it''s not much of a review but I wanted to recommend.


      Please please please add the DLC ships to CS mode, even if they''re only available
      once a level has been completed with a Darius ship.


      Border Down DLC would be fantastic. Unless you''re done after producing the
      dozens of packs already available (thanks for these, I''m slowly making my way
      through them).'
