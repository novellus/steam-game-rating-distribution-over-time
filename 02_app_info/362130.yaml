    review: 'With just RPG Maker stock material this game manages to create more atmosphere
      and excellent storytelling as many triple A games do proving that you don''t
      need a big budget or high end technology to produce a good game. This is truly
      16 bit classic JRPG magic.


      Positives:

      - captivating story that ''sucks'' you in, you want to continue playing to discover
      the story

      - well written dialogues

      - well chosen soundtrack

      - no grinding necessary (enemies are visible) but people who want to grind can
      choose to do so

      - nice variety of character / personalities

      - well balanced although on the easy side (for me difficulty was fine)

      - well dosed use of humour

      - good game lenghth (not too short, not too long)


      negatives

      - lack of variety in enemies

      - lack of interaction with objects!

      - only stock RPG Maker graphics (not a negative at all for me personally)

      - game is too easy for players who like a challenge


      Overall: an excellent RPG game, warmly recommended for people who like narrative
      driven games.
