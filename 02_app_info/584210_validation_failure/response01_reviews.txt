Which is completely pointless. But we trying to stop them by robbing them - which is not. 75% of live vegetation filled with cocaine plantations and nothing else. No potato or even rice. People around walking near the road. If you run them on a car - they die. If you go slow - they dodge - immersive. Lamas looks like a dogs or dicks from afar, even upclose! Lamas were in trailer, but not ingame, so: if you saw lama - it's not. It's something else. I saw lama once. Game lagging because of them. From opposite side you can smash enemies balls, when get closer, feel some relief to continue shooting with no interest at all, utill you smash someone once more - that's the only reason to go stealth anyway. Sexism toward men. People wearing clothes too, which is good. Suprised by that. UBI can easily forgot it. DLC will come. It'll cost another 30. UBI will explain us where they get this stupid clother, bacause it not selling anywhere and nobody will wear this shit anyway. ONLY! If it's free, as they fuck you with free gun coloring and free stickers on your forehead - main reason you bought it. That will be pretty interesting. Than you drive Watch Dogs port cars with handle of your father's dick when he shiting himself in fear watching his son running in green shirt and red hip-hop hat towards his penus to cut it with gigantic katana, while he fucking your mother's grandpa on your keyboard, so hard to handle this peace of shit! Nachos, muchos, buritos, la paetas, huetas, mingos and flamingos - best words in the game. Your squad will filled with: \"NO! It's 40578 fps for me, it's something wrong with your enthernet\" or \"go ARMA?\" - so you cannot play this game with no one, cuz you surrounded by mut'endas de mudakenas si vperdelas vtoi jopendas. #60D'S_in_my_G'S","timestamp_created":1488162538,"timestamp_updated":1606438363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507389187812805176","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ494PMg/YCfc+fcw=="}
