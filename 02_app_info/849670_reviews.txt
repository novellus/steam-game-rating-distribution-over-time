VR multiplayer is a bad buy, in general these days\n\nThis game is affordable and very fun. Several different game modes (CTF, king of the hill-ish, deathmatch, etc). The movement reminds me a lot of Tribes jetpacking and skiing combined with directional boosters thanks to VR motion controls. They did a very good job of making a visual system that minimizes discomfort despite the high speed of movement too.  \n\nLike all VR games, this won't have the online population of CSGO or Overwatch.
