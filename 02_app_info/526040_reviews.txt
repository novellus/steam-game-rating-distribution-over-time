Frontiers adds a lot to Anno 2205 that the game desperatly needed to be a good game. Invasions finally bring the military game into its own, the new sectors provide new challenges and the synthetics provide a potentially powerful late game advantage (if you can provide for them, the enitited silicon *****). Unfortunately, like all things, timing and presentation is key. The choice to not include this on the season pass or the gold edition are both baffiling and insulting to the consumer. And purchasing this may set a worrying standard which only encourages further dlc to be seperated from the supposed \"complete\" package. It is a dangerous move that could destroy what credibility the Anno series has left, given how 2205 is pretty subpar compared to 2070 and 1404.\n\nTLDR: If you enjoyed Anno 2205 and want more of it, and either didn't get the season pass or don't mind ponying up another 12 US dollars, then by all means, ignore that fat thumbs down on this review and purchase this dlc. For myself though, given the fact that Ubisoft saw fit to charge for that last little bit that 2205 needed to at least be remotely near as good as its forebearers, 1404 and 2070, and seperate that charge from the season pass/gold edition for that little bit of extra cash, I can not recomend this dlc. It is an awful move that only serves to highlight Ubi's greed.\n\nEDIT: When I first wrote this, Frontiers was not included in the Season Pass, which Ubi later changed. Probably for the best, all things considered.","timestamp_created":1475627140,"timestamp_updated":1605937323,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":180,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.755662918090820313","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v9vU9PUCfvXTYg=="}
