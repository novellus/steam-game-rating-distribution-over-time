Cute characters and cute writing. I just wanna make the clouds happy.  \n\nGame play wise, your objective is to get a direct line of sight on the enemies in each room, or indirectly by using the newly happy units to make others happy. The units move like chess pieces, and there are walls and other barriers that prevent movement and line of sight. The caveat is that you only have a certain amount of turns per level to find a key and defeat the boss. This means that the strategy comes from trying to use as few turns as possible to complete each room. This to me makes it feel kind of similar to match 3 games. You are trying to set up combos so you dont waste time moving things around individually. I think its pretty unique and fun. \n\nIt is an Early Access game and I ran into a couple of issues. My game did crash once, but loaded up right at the turn I left off at. However I did have a room, when using the diagonally moving character, was unable to move away from the door because of an indestructible object and impassable object in both of the possible movement directions. This meant that I lost the run unfortunately. \n\nIt is a rougelike so each run is a random level layout, and each room is pretty random. The roguelike elements are well done. The playable characters are unique, and the trinkets you can collect can impact your playstyle or make the game a tad easier. I do think it could use more variety of trinkets and such, but is fine as is. \n\nIn terms of challenge, I think its fair. I managed to beat the only two levels currently in the game in roughly an hour; with a bit of luck of course. However there are two other unlockable characters which require clearing 100% of each level. After spending a few hours on it I have been unable to accomplish this. Because of the highly random layout of each room, using only a few turns per room for so long seems impossible. A couple rooms have an obvious 1 turn solution, and others take at least 6 because you can only immediately \"attack\" one enemy or future enemy. I think each room could stand to have either less enemies or walls, because having 8 different things barricaded in a corner is frustrating and feels like I had no chance. If the room doesn't allow for an ok start, things get out of hand quickly. \n\nAs a personal preference, I find for a game about spreading happiness, the monochromatic art style makes it feel pretty lifeless, and gets to be a bore to look at after a while. I think the game could benefit from some more color. \n\nOverall I recommend the game if you are into puzzle games and roguelikes. I look forward to what will come from Early Access development.","timestamp_created":1595996965,"timestamp_updated":1595996965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533468544483184814","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1596024463,"developer_response":"Thanks for the review!\n\nSorry you lost your run from the diagonal hero being blocked!
