    about_the_game: "<strong>Welcome everyone! The Age of Fear: The Undead King Gold\
      \ is the outcome of almost seven years of work on the original game, initially\
      \ released in 2011. Over this period we listened to our amazing Community and\
      \ implemented new features, mechanics and more content. Lots of new content\
      \ in fact! Thank you for supporting us - you guys are the best!<br><br>First\
      \ and foremost, we are adding a sandbox layer (extended World Map) to the game\
      \ while keeping both campaigns. It took us a long time to introduce procedurally\
      \ generated battles and shops, but the effect is well-worth it - according to\
      \ our testers it at least doubles the playtime! Oh, did I mention themed factions'\
      \ (upgradeable) bases?<br><br>The Age of Fear universe has evolved tremendously\
      \ as well during that same period. Through the series, there are now six playable\
      \ factions, each with its own lore and unique units. Currently, the game features\
      \ more than two hundred units (from the initial forty) with almost 800 (!) unique\
      \ spells, abilities and items. That is a lot of variety!<br><br>To better introduce\
      \ the player to the AOF universe, we have added multiple extra dialogues, cinematic\
      \ battles and legendary landmarks along with events. On top of those expansions,\
      \ the engine was reworked, graphics were improved and even completely replaced,\
      \ and the really good AI was enhanced further (which is the trademark of the\
      \ series!).<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/832770/extras/krill-campaign.jpg?t=1587246301\"\

    review: Fun game! The inventory management system is rather tedious and grinding.
      I cannot say I care for managing the equipment of fifteen to 12 soldiers. However,
      this is still a good turn based wargame. If you liked Baldur's Gate or Fantasy
      General, you'll like this.
