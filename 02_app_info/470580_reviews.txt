The game is very good, the story, design and game play are very well thought out. I am a big fan of unique puzzle games, kind of tired of the same stuff so I look for more original designs and this one fits the bill with a nice light and shadow based game play that adds new concepts as you go through the levels to keep it interesting, even to the point where I would have liked to see even more levels with certain mechanics (like the movement of the sun or the shadow mirroring levels). Given this it must also be noted that there are some issues which I am sure could have been polished with more time. The controls are less responsive than ideal (mainly the jumping), there were some glitches where I had to restart the level as my shadow no longer jumped, the respawn points were often off leaving you in an area that forced a level restart plus a few other minor bugs. None of these really were much of an issue though, so I still really recommend trying it out.","timestamp_created":1609799599,"timestamp_updated":1609799599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uZDi5/YCf/DDwAI="}
