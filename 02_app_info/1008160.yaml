      \ uses the default network interface the operating system and local routing\
      \ table offers for this task.<br>It should be possible detect available hosts\

      \ networks as long as the hosts respond to IMCP echo requests and the TTL is\
      \ high enough so that the packet will no be dropped by any router in the path.<br><br><strong>Determine\
      \ Ping</strong> (time in ms)<br>The Ping time is determined by sending an IMCP\
      \ echo request to the target IPv4 and waiting for the IMCP echo reply. The Ping\
      \ time is the locally measured time from sending the IMCP echo request to the\
      \ target until the IMCP echo reply received. The IMCP echo reply has to be received\
      \ within a give time-frame (timeout), or the Ping attempted will be considered\
      \ as a timeout and the IMCP echo reply will be dropped.<br>\t<br><strong>Determine\
      \ Hops</strong> (number of routers in the path)<br>There is no 100% accurate\
      \ way to get this information. SubnetPing uses an approximation technique to\
      \ guess the hop count based on some assumptions. This is because the router\
      \ has do decrease the TTL by at least one, and most of routers do exactly that.\
      \ The reply packets might have another base TTL than your request packet had.\
      \ <br>The base TTL has starts at 256,128,64 or 32. Therefore it should be correct\
      \ if the packet has less than 32 hops in total and every router in the path\
      \ decreased it by only one.<br>\t<br><strong>Measure Packetloss</strong><br>Packetloss\
      \ is calculated based on the attempts to ping an host with an IMCP echo request\
      \ and the number of received echo reply responses within a given time-frame\
      \ (timeout).<br>\t<br><strong>Resolve MAC-Addresses</strong><br>Determine the\
      \ MAC-Addresses by sending ARP requests to all available hosts.<br>This works\
      \ only on the local subnet of the Computer your scanning from. <br>It is not\
      \ possible to resolve the MAC-Address of any device behind a router using ARP\

      \ by using the operating system's default DNS server of the default network\
      \ interface that is selected thru the routing table for accessing hosts in subnet\

      \ SNMP devices (BETA)*</strong><br>Determine the device description using SNMPv1\
      \ and SNMPv2 requests via UDP port 161.<br>There are still some problems detecting\
      \ SNMP devices.<br>Some devices respond only to SNMPv1 community = \u201Cpublic\u201C\
