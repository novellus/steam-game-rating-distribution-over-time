    about_the_game: "The year is 2030. Business is as usual in the isolated research\
      \ city of Rokumei\u2013that is until several explosions suddenly go off in the\
      \ nuclear research facility known as \u201CLABO.\u201D The city sends in \u201C\
      Sirius,\u201D an elite rescue squad, to deal with the situation. But the situation\
      \ only gets worse when LABO\u2019s nuclear reactor melts down, sending the facility\
      \ into lockdown\u2013with members of Sirius and survivors still trapped inside.\
      \ With lethal radiation leaking everywhere and not enough anti-radiation medication\
      \ to last until lockdown lifts, the survivors make more and more grim discoveries.\
      \ In their struggle for survival, in a deathtrap full of fire and radiation,\
      \ they learn that doubt is their greatest enemy, and trust their greatest asset.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story of Root Double features two different protagonists:\
      \ Watase Kasasagi, a rescue squad captain who has lost his memories in the hours\
      \ after the incident, and Natsuhiko Tenkawa, a student piecing together the\
      \ clues in the six days before. The only key to survival lies in the player\u2019\
      s hands with the Senses Sympathy System (SSS). Unlike traditional visual novels,\
      \ Root Double does not have clear cut \u201Cchoices,\u201D but rather, the game\
      \ uses SSS to allow the player to manipulate the story based purely upon emotion.\
      \ Your emotions projected upon the characters, particularly your trust in them,\
      \ shape the progression of the story. Only with effective use of this system\
      \ and completion of both protagonists\u2019 stories can the player piece together\
      \ the truth and hope to discover a way out of the facility."
