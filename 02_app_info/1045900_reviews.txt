I love this game and I really hope you keep updating it! I saw Grillmastah's video back in March and added it to my wish-list, and finally purchased it today.\n\nI love the interactive mini-game with the aliens because I love the techno music! The scenery is spectacular! When I first saw the Blue Hills (I think that's the name of the area) I was blown away. The imagination and creativity that has gone into this game is awesome. I really like the non-melee game-play. When I get a new game, if there's a way to turn that off, I do that right at the start. Not every game needs to have \"things\" trying to rip your face off All the time. \n\nThank you for making it! Please keep up the great work!","timestamp_created":1608883266,"timestamp_updated":1608883266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwncy6zPYCcrL+vAI="}
