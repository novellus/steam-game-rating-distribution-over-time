Not much since it's restricted to the four Gymkhana tracks.\n\nHere's the cold, hard numbers:\n* A category 3 Extreme-Khana vehicle\n* Costs $195,000.00 in game\n* Has a starting performance index of 449\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/fJWVCk1.jpg\n\nIt has by far the highest acceleration and braking ratings, great traction (even in the sand based track and despite not being AWD) and cornering, and presumably runs on pixie dust because the fuel dial is permanently set to empty.\n\nIt's far from essential to the lineup since the Mazdas already in game feel a tad similar when upgraded, but I'm personally a fan of the car so I couldn't resist grabbing it. It also makes up for the disappointment of realizing the Mustang has an AWD drivetrain.\n\nOverall, it's a very solid and fun car, and arguably the best Gymkhana car available, so it's up to you if this is worth its asking price or not.","timestamp_created":1548895682,"timestamp_updated":1548896239,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.647535026073455811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42Z/a0OgCepnOuQE="}
