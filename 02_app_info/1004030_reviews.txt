The enemies move in formations according to the beat of the song, but that's the only \"rhythm\" element of the game. Lastly, the default primary weapon, the yellow gun, is apparently the most effective; the other weapons don't seem to compete with it. I'm afraid the best feature of this game is the soundtrack, which, unfortunately, isn't available to download.","timestamp_created":1604973425,"timestamp_updated":1604973425,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lt731/UCc427rQI="}
