Also, all of the art is at ridiculous quality - 5000x2379px background images and such. This is probably why the artbook is 260 megabytes despite only being 74 pages.\n\nThis one is actually good, though it makes it a shame the Steam backgrounds for FIVE are as weak as they are instead of being the pictures in this artbook.","timestamp_created":1561814568,"timestamp_updated":1561814568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553944885730743408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxOHZ0esCcYmXxgE="}
