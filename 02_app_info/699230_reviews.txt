I fell in love with the fusion style jazz soundtrack, the funny story, the chill gameplay, the never ending load screen story, and have mentioned it at some point to everyone who loves the top down shooter/comical/fun/relaxed style bullet hell gameplay. I don't want to write a bloated review, other than to say I was that impressed with it on Xbox I bought it again on PC when it went on sale. Had I never purchased it on Xbox, I'd happily have spent at least $5 on it to support the developer(s?) in hope they'll keep making awesome, fun, unique games that I really had a blast playing. If you want a fun little underrated gem of a game, made with a ton of passion and love, do yourself a favor and pick up Birdcakes. Like me, I'd wager chances are solid you too will fall in love with the charm. :-)","timestamp_created":1578424544,"timestamp_updated":1578424544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsOXbwO8CcOnG6gE="}
