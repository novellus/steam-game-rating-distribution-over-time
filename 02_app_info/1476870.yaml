    about_the_game: '<strong>Robo Gauntlet is a chaotic strategy game where you input
      programming cards into your robot''s command-line registry at the same time
      as other players and then lean back and watch as the robots perform the actions
      and cause mayhem!</strong><br><br>Players assume control of one of many robots
      in a hazardous testing facility filled with moving conveyor belts, laser beams,
      bottomless pits, and a variety of other obstacles. There will be two game mode
      types; coop and versus.<br>The goal in a game of versus is, apart from survival,
      to be the first to reach a predetermined number of checkpoints in the correct
      order. The real difficulty however is movement, which is accomplished with the
      randomly dealt programming cards.<br>The goal in a game of coop is to work together
      to reach a common goal, be it collecting or moving something, finishing a specific
      task, eliminating the baddies, or even fighting a boss.<br><br>The program cards
      specify movement, such as move one or more spaces forward, turn left or right,
      move back, or turn around. The cards have to be arranged by the player in the
      specific order they wish the cards to play out and the robot to move. Each player
      receives nine cards each turn. They use five of the cards to specify their robot''s
      movement for the given turn, playing each card face down into one of five available
      &quot;command-line registries&quot;. All robots move simultaneously, each player''s
      robot performing each register in turn. Robot priority is resolved by where
      the robot closest to the transmitter goes first. A robot moving into an occupied
      space pushes the blocking robot, and any additional ones beyond that, into the
      next space providing that there is no wall or other immovable object in the
      way. When players'' robots are damaged they receive virus and bug cards that
      dilute the draw pile. To get rid of these bugs the player needs to program the
      bug into a register to be able to discard it after played, effectively squashing
      the bug. Each player has a very limited amount of time to program their cards
      since as soon as the first player has programmed all five registries a timer
      is started. When the timer runs out the remaining players that haven''t finished
      programming will get their unfinished programming scrambled. This combined with
      the unpredictability of the plans of the other players and the hazards of the
      facility often leads to one''s robot moving in unexpected ways!<br><br>Players
      also have the option to upgrade their robots with weapons and device upgrades,
      which add to the carnage and mayhem. These upgrades can cause additional damage,
      allow robots to move differently like breaking normal movement rules, affect
      the movement of other robots, and disrupt opponents'' plans in other ways.<br><br>The
      game realizes a reversal of the concept of computer simulation games: rather
      than computers simulating some real-world action, human players try to simulate
      the actions of a computer.'

    review: Fun and promising game. Even though the game is unfinished I had a blast
      with my friends. Crazy stuff happens when your programming goes wrong and even
      though I pretty much knew I was going to lose I just had to try and catch up
      till the very end.
