Unfortunately the controls are not direct enough and actually do not give you back the feeling of the original Gameboy Tetris. Controls are troublesome. This needs to be fixed.\n\nAnd then there is no options menu. Game is in the center of your playground and you can not manually recenter it yourself. This is a no go for a controller game, since I play controller games in front of my PC and not like a normal room-scale game in the center of my room.\n\nOverall and since those two issues are a game breaker for me, I can not recommend this Tetris emulation for VR.\n\nNO RECOMMENDED until problems are fixed.\n\n[i] Twitch Channel : https://www.twitch.tv/mrorange55\nYoutube Channel : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1UE5TPoF0HX0HVpF_E4uPQ/videos?view_as=subscriber [/i]","timestamp_created":1499801570,"timestamp_updated":1514724430,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.726390659809112549","comment_count":13,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi5Kn1uACdtDTfw=="}
