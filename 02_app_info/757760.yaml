    review: "I\xB4ve been playing through the entire campaign with my group and here\
      \ is my feedback, I will put any spoilers as spoilers. :\n\nThe good:\n-Everything\
      \ is perfectly coded up, some tokens do not have an image\n-Very interesting\
      \ setting, it\xB4s kind of like Jurrasic Park in space. Leviathan itself has\
      \ quite a bit of variation.\n-Combat in general was very good too, as the enemies\
      \ are usually too strong for a simple brute force attack, and you need to think\
      \ (or aim) to take them down.\n-Story has some interesting twists that caught\
      \ my players totally off guard and is fun to follow.\n-Almost all character\
      \ builds will be useful in this adventure. \n\nThe bad:\n-Glitches with some\
      \ images\n-The campaign is set on one planet only, so no space combat or visiting\
      \ other planets.\n[Spoiler]-Side-story with Eco-terrorists that kind of just\
      \ fizzled out[/spoiler]\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this Adventure."
