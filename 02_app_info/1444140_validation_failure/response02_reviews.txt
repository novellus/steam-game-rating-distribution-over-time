How about the experienced player who buys all the DLCs? Where is the traffic? With traffic set to 100% the volume is to low. Most of the airports with the exception of  KJFK & KATL have very low traffic volume and become boring for experienced players. I shouldn't be able to control the airports on x4 speed at 100% traffic. Its at the point to make things interesting you have to create or download custom schedules. I mean this is a game about controlling aircraft. Where are the aircraft? \n\nNow that my rant is over, I do enjoy this game. The airports are nice and the different layouts make things interesting. Just please increase the traffic to make it challenging.","timestamp_created":1603039008,"timestamp_updated":1603039008,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60000002384185791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0MKknvUCdb3VqAI="}
