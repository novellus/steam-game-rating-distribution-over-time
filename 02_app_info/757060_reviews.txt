A series of different types of fast-paced minigames, all involving a pistol, that scores you after you've done them and gives you a final bonus stage at the end.\n\nThis is not to be confused with your run of the mill VR zombie shooters or shooting ranges. While technically the game is made up of shooting ranges, the game plays to challenge you, and to make it fun at the same time, and that's the difference.\n\nI bought this on sale, but it's worth full price. Can't wait to see what they bring out of early access. This does not feel like an early access game at all - I can't fault it. Maybe lack of multiplayer? I don't know. I'm nitpicking.\n\nEdit: HOWEVER, this game has been in early access since December 2017 and says it's only going to be there a few months. I've created a thread in the steam discussions asking for an update now that it's April 2019. The game is short-lived and needs to be honest about whether it's done or not.","timestamp_created":1513576982,"timestamp_updated":1555134554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506139934062957764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw+cPPiuoCdPW6kgE="}
