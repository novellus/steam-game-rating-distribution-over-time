Fair warning, it’s written to be pretty bleak, don’t go in expecting slice of life or true happy ends. \n\nLooking at the lovely character artwork and gentle music, I often felt extremely at peace and contemplative reading this. At other times I just found everything very haunting and mysterious. The backgrounds are mostly just real life imagery with a strong blur effect, but it works very well here and sets the mood nicely. \n\nThere are three main girls you interact with, in order, followed by a kind of epilogue tying it all together. I didn’t like the way the interactive parts were handled, as you’re essentially railroaded into making heartless decisions to continue. If you choose the kinder options, you get a bad end with that particular girl- which actually reads more like a good, if vague ending- it’s a little confusing. \n\nIt’s not that I’m against the MC doing bad things, but at the times they happen, they come completely out of the blue and seem to happen just because the author needs them to.\n\nI also felt that there were a couple of brief scenes that were written as crude for the sake of being crude, but there’s not too much of that. \n\nIt’s nice to have a more contemplative story that doesn’t follow all of the standard progression, although some of the standard anime tropes (tsundere, etc.) still apply. \n\nThere are myriad technical issues such as the script being unable to properly deal with an apostrophe, causing extra spaces to appear. The visuals are either viewed in a small window, or if maximized, you get a larger picture but it’s set all the way to the left of your screen with a large black bar on the right side. You’re unable to take screenshots through Steam. I’ve heard, but not confirmed, that there was supposed to be more voice work but it wasn’t implemented properly in the English version. \n\nAll in all, I found this just unique and enjoyable enough that I feel it’s worth pushing past the technical problems and giving it a try.\n","timestamp_created":1609722574,"timestamp_updated":1609722574,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy6a85fYCdqCgwAI="}
