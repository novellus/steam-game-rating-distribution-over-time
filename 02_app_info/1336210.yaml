    short_description: Welcome to the ER, Saint Icaros, where the patients wake up
      with missing body parts. Your memory is a bit foggy because of the terrible
      accident. Lucky for you, our doctor has a wonder drug that will make you heal
      in no time. So, do as we say and stop wondering why there are never any visitors.
