    review: 'positives+++

      +Pieces picking is accurate. If I pick a piece that is currently under other
      pieces by the round part, it will accurately pick this one up.

      +A lot of the images are actually quite pretty and well drawn! I like the anime
      crunchy art style.

      +Quite a few images to solve.

      +Higher levels are harder and fun to do.


      negatives---

      -Early levels are way too quick/easy to solve for my taste.

      -The cursor being a puzzle piece is fun at first but quickly become not fun
      to use because it doesn''t have a pointy edge like a regular cursor does.

      -It is hard to read some of the options in the "Preferences" menu because the
      text is directly display on the background image. It would be better for example
      to add a div with a grey color and opacity to it so it''s easier to read the
      text.

      -Ok, I don''t know why, but after quitting the game for the first time and restarting
      it, the preferences menu is not the same? Now it''s a 100% black background
      instead of the image of the girl from the main menu. (Easier to read than the
      other but could be improved).

      -I don''t know why when I toggle "Display" > "Window" my cursor is moved to
      another place.

      -The edges of puzzle pieces are weirdly pixelated.

      -I don''t know why clicking "Credits" goes to the same screen as "Start"

      -Why bother putting achievements if they are bad? There is a lot of potencial
      to create good achievements for this type of game.

      -I don''t know why there is the same menu in the selection of puzzle menu as
      the main menu. Why not just put a "Back to main menu" button instead?

      -I nearly had a heart attack when starting the first puzzle because of a high
      beat song playing (there is no music at all in the menus so it''s quite startling).

      -Not the most relaxing music to solve puzzle D8. If I wanted to have some high
      speed music I would have played DDR instead.

      -Strangely, the music keeps playing in the menu after it started in the first
      puzzle lol.

      -When returning to the main menu and from a puzzle (house icon) and then clicking
      "Start" music, stops abruptly. (Music starts again when a puzzle is selected.)

      -No transition when finishing the puzzle, it just jumps right into your face
      :/

      -No sure why the edge puzzle pieces have an uneven black line (not smooth)

      -When you mute and unmute the music, it restarts the music. It would be nice
      for it to just continue de music where it was.

      -I have no idea to what the option "Text Speed" is applied to.

      -Puzzle pieces don''t snap to each other, only to the board.

      -When there is a piece under the spot you want to place your piece, even if
      your piece goes there, it won''t snap. You need to move the other piece first
      so that the correct piece can snap to the grid.

      -Not sure what right click is supposed to be doing?!

      -You don''t know the image in advanced. It can be nice, but most of the time
      on a more difficult puzzle, it''s just annoying because pieces don''t snap together
      so you need to blindly find their spot on the grid first. You can''t, for example,
      snap the face together and continue from there because the pieces don''t snap
      together.

      -Why does it take so long to load the more advance puzzle? Really, 27 seconds
      to load "Aozora Meikyuu" "Level 7" (11 x 14 (154) puzzle pieces). :/

      -If you quit the game in a middle of a puzzle, it doesn''t save. You will have
      to redo the puzzle from the start. This is quite a basic feature that is missing
      from this kind of game (being able to save your progress).

      -You can''t bring a big puzzle piece to the exact spot when it''s in the corner
      of the game. If you drop it, the auto-snap still snaps it correctly but it''s
      just a bit weird that you can''t drag them over the correct spot because of
      the boundaries of the game?!

      -If you quit from the main menu, it quits without asking if you want to quit.
      If you quit from the puzzle selection menu, it asks if you want to quit. No
      consistency here.


      Overall, the pictures that I have solved are nice and of good quality. Too bad
      the rest of the game is not very polished (bugs, weird UI, startling music,
      etc.) Not sure about the tag "sexual content" because there is nothing sexual
      in those that I solved. A bit of light ecchi but that''s all. I had fun playing
      the most difficult puzzle, the easier are just too easy for my taste.


      I would like to recommend the game. It has potential, but it''s really lacking
      in basic aspect. Since it''s quite cheap I guess you could still get it, turn
      off the music, remember to finish a puzzle before quitting and enjoy solving
      the puzzles there are.
