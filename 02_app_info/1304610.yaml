      to participate in a special test that will help refine a brand new kind of game!
      <br><br>Lab Rat was generated by the world's most advanced machine learning
      algorithm - me. I have been meticulously trained on the best interactive entertainment
      available today and my data indicates you will be completely satisfied with
      the result. However, your valuable human feedback is required to help me further
      adjust and develop this experience.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1304610/extras/WideSteamGIF_GunTank_A.gif?t=1608216895"

      divert lasers, and manipulate electricity to overcome 100+ surprising genre-bending
      puzzles.<br></li><li>Outwit a metrics-obsessed machine intent on heckling you
      for your humanity.<br></li><li>View and contribute to in-game analytics that

      Game:</h2>Lab Rat is a hand-crafted narrative puzzler masquerading as a machine-generated
      video game. This satirical adventure stars a metrics-obsessed AI who will monitor,
      profile, and guide you as you solve over a hundred unique spatial problems.
      Over time this AI will develop a hilariously-misguided understanding of humanity
      based on your performance and survey response data.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Team:</h2>While
      Lab Rat pokes fun at the absurdity of algorithmically-generated interactions,
      this game's is lovingly hand-crafted by a team of expert human developers. Lab
      Rat is directed by Gwen Frey (creator of <i>Kine</i> &amp; co-creator of <i>The
      Flame in the Flood</i>). It features environment art by Mike Snight (Lead World
      Builder, <i>Bioshock Infinite</i>), writing by Matthew Burns (creator of <i>Eliza</i>),
      and puzzles by Lucas Le Slo (beloved experimental puzzle designer).<h2 class="bb_tag">Date
