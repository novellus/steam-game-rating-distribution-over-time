It had great potential . but every scene battle is the same . boring boring boring . \nlies lies lies so I say stay away from this game as reminds me of those traveling faith healers more you put in the hat the better you feel all the way up till they leave town. \nthis is them  do not buy unless you want a bunch of false promises","timestamp_created":1450346389,"timestamp_updated":1542855394,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605499148368835449","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwraDWnOcCe8eoSw=="}
