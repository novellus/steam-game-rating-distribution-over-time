Level design is uninspiring. Enemies move too fast and their attack patterns are too fast to memorize. And the controls feel broken especially with the default key settings. No extra lives and no continues. I Can't get past the 1st stage. Weapon power ups are disappointing and the music is not the worst I've heard but compared to games like Zed Blade and Gradius, it's nowhere near the level of those 2. And in terms of challenge, it doesn't come as close to games like Radiant Silvergun or Ikaruga.  My final rating for AF-Zero is a 4.75 out of 10.\n\nIf you REALLY want a good 2D Shooter here, Try Raiden III or Raptor: Call of the Shadows. Or for consoles, try R-Type Dimensions on Xbox 360, PS4 & Nintendo Switch, Galaga on any device, or Star Soldier: Vanishing Earth for the Nintendo 64","timestamp_created":1561234113,"timestamp_updated":1561234113,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540069699287414551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1562971377,"developer_response":"The game has the possibility to gain several extra lives, controls working perfectly."}],"cursor":"AoJ4nsCzwOsCffWDxAE="}
