As other reviews have mentioned, there is a problem with entering Hawklin Castle, a plot-relevant and unskippable location about an hour into the story, which is a huge pain to get to in the first place. From what I've seen, this doesn't seem to occur for absolutely every player, but if it does happen to you [b] there is absolutely NO way around it and you WILL NOT be able to progress. [/b]\n\nI submitted a ticket for this issue back in January and haven't played the game since out of sheer annoyance, and only heard back from Beamdog earlier this month, which for some reason I went completely unaware of (no notifications at all) until I got an email saying my ticket had been closed due to my lack of response to it. Nice.\n\nThe replies I got to the ticket were, in order, a reply telling me they had a fix in an opt-in beta patch and that I should try it, and then a later reply saying that the patch was now live in the game and they were convinced I would have no more issues. I really appreciate their hard work, of course - but I would a lot more if their claims of a fix actually were true.\n\nFor clarity I tried loading up the save where I originally had the issue - no dice. That's fine, I thought. The save is likely configured to the old patch and most likely wouldn't work anyway, and I'm silly for trying, so I started a new game. \n\nAlthough I did see some of the other issues they fixed at work (Your jousting horse that you borrow doesn't disappear upon spawn-in anymore which was a nice touch, because that was nearly unavoidable before unless you've been playing this dumpster fire of a beautiful game for as long as I have), I reached Hawklin Castle with a spring in my step and a fire in my belly - only to be immediately yeeted to my desktop screen with the EXACT same crash notification as before, with not even a hint of anything different. Even the crashlogs were identical.\n\nI'm currently attempting to re-open my ticket, but at this moment, it's still listed as closed. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt with the current real-life situations happening, and I understand they might be a few men down just now. But I am seriously fed up. \n\n[b] TL;DR - DO NOT buy this now. [/b] The chances of you not even being able to progress in the module are far too high to waste your money, no matter how tempting it might seem especially if you're in lockdown and looking for cheap stuff to play. While normally I would say that they were undercharging for this module - it's not worth anything in its current state. If you want a module to play, look at the other options, but leave this one well alone for now.\n\nIf they confirm that the castle actually gets fixed, I will edit this review, but in the meantime, take this as a warning to stay away and check out NWN's other options.\n\nEDIT OCTOBER 2020: After months of having this issue with no response to my appeal to reopen my ticket, I finally took matters into my own hands and tried to fix the game myself. I figured out how - it basically involved deleting everything in the Documents folder and forcing NWN to redownload it all (several times for some reason) but eventually I got it working, so I at least have a little evidence that the issue was either on my end or the update that carried the fix for my issue got a botched install and I never noticed. Either way, problem seems to be fixed now. I won't be taking my review off negative simply based on my experience with Beamdog which I honestly found disgraceful - I needed further help or at least prodding in the right direction and was ignored, which is honestly disgusting. \n\nSo, to summarize - great game, AMAZING module, terrible customer service. I genuinely hope I never have to interact with the customer service again.","timestamp_created":1585699625,"timestamp_updated":1602270682,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.639372408390045166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwucuxh/UCffXz/AE="}
