The DLC expands on the story, and you must do it before finishing the main quest, but you can delay it indefinitely. You are free to come and go from the DLC islands, so if you just wish to grab the stuff, you can.\n\nHowever, the mechanics....\nThere are new zombie types. An electrified zombie, and a heavily armoured zombie. The electrified zombie is literally immortal. If you kill it, it will just get back up in the next storm. Ad infinitum. Isn't it great when the enemy has literally god mode on? Moving on, the heavily armoured zombie on the other hand is a pretty good addition, don't listen to the NPC and popup, you can kill it with conventional weaponry, but fair warning, it takes 3 direct headshots from a high powered weapon (read, golden sniper rifle, golden three prong boomerang, forget melee, you'll be torn limb from limb).\n\nThe new fog mechanic is just annoying. Realistic, yes, and fog does come at appropriate times, like dawn, but it is annoying. To be fair, the implementation of it is neat, it's realistic, it doesn't last forever, so you can just wait it out.\n\nThe storm pylons, however, are infuriating. They keep alive the electrified zombies even outside of a storm, and you have to either lure the electrified zombies out of it's range, or drain it's charge by recharging your DLC weapon but it will be recharged on the next storm by a lightning strike. Oh, and did I mention that the electrified zombies can simply charge each other, meaning if you kill one, you have to kill the other fast enough, or you'll end up in a perpetual resurrection cycle? I'm sure there is a parallel world where this is considered as fun.\n\nThe rest are... just gimmicks for the new islands. Like the iguana is just a reskinned deer, the boots are only useful there and nowhere else, the blowgun is only useful there and in fog...\n\nEssentially, I found this to be more frustrating than rewarding.","timestamp_created":1604001654,"timestamp_updated":1604001654,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz9z8uvUCfe70qgI="}
