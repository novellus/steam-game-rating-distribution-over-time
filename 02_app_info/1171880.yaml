    review: 'It plays well, but there is not much else to it unless you want a simple
      reflex challenge. It''s a top-down hack&slash with bullet hell elements where
      you have a little droid that auto-aims (kinda like Nier). Unfortunately, there
      are no upgrades or RPG elements, the goal is just to finish the stage with what
      you have. Your character has a one-button combo, dash,  stamina for droid, and
      occasional bomb charges that clear the screen. At the time of this review, I
      only finished 2 stages, but I think there are only 3 in total, not including
      boss fights. Even though the game is challenging, I think the difficulty is
      fair because enemies have nice attack indicators. So far the boss fights have
      been very fun, each with multiple stages. The only criticism I have is in regards
      to music, the soundtrack is recycled on some of the stages, and so are most
      of the enemies, with a few new additions as you progress. I wish the dev would
      have added more mechanics to it, but for what it is, the price is fair.


      Also... Is that Yellow Flash?.... No it can''t be....'
