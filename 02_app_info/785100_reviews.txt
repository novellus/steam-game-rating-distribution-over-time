It is this but it is also so much more.  The story is a straight up documentary of a daughter interviewing her father and mother who were both involved in some high level secret stuff during the Cold War.  A lot of the game revolves around you exploring a map and discovering recordings, intel, photographs anything that relates to the daughter, T’s, life or her parents and colleagues.  You find the intel, solve a 9 digit code and get to the next level.  Each level takes about an hour to play.\n\n---------------\n\n[h1] PROS [/h1]\n\n+  art.  Let’s just get this out the way because it’s the first thing you see on the store page.  The art is bizarre.  It is all carboard cut outs which are drawn on one side and then are just natural on the back.  You scrunch up into a little ball and roll around like Sonic the Hedgehog (but the controls are not good, see CONS).\n\n+  immersive.  For a game that looks the way it does, it sure does make a good point of keeping you deeply involved in the story by giving you lots of real life recordings, videos, documents, photographs, snippets of daily life.  \n\n+  its not just about the Cold War.  There is a level of storytelling that moves away from the parents and their roles as intelligence agents.  The story inverts and takes a look at T’s secrets, her pains, her quite frankly weird life.  It must have been so strange as a kid and teenager to never really “know” your parents.  In the videos and recordings they are masters of deflecting questions and changing the subject.  It would have been a very frustrating upbringing for me and I could feel that although T loves her family with all her heart she has been so calm and patient with them, waiting for this day.\n\n+  quirks ahoy!  There are so many little powerups and things you will find along the way that keep the game fresh and interesting.  I don’t really want to say what they are because that will ruin the experience I think.  \n\n+  unique.  I haven’t really seen or played anything like this before.  \n\n+  puzzles.  There are puzzles but they weren’t overly hard.  There were only a couple where I had to rethink what I was doing.  The game is fairly self explanatory.\n\n___________________\n\n[h1] CONS [/h1]\n\n-\t Movement.  Oh my my.  The movement is just terrible.  I admit I did get used to it and I was much more adept towards the end.  There was a lot of cursing going on before that though as this really bad, mouse only, controlling drove me up the wall.  I think it might be because this released on PC and mobile and it is more suited to a touchscreen control.  \n\n-\tIts all about the tudse bridges yo.  (I have no idea if my take on Danish slang even works.  Let me know below).  It is a short game and could probably be completed a bit faster than I did my playthrough.  So you might want to pick this up on a sale.  \n\n___________________\n  \nI want more of this.  And I am sure I’m not alone.   I have always said that games are an excellent medium for documentaries.  We have games like That Dragon, Cancer and Kursk.  We have excellent fictional narratives like Edith Finch, why not do the same with true stories?  We also of course have excellent directors’ commentaries in tons of our favourite games.  Devolver gave us a gamescon right  here on Steam to play during the COVID-19 lockdown.  There is a wealth of potential here and I am definitely dying to see some more high quality playable documentaries.\n\nIf you are looking to expand your Steam library with some more diverse games, then Cosmic Top Secret is unlike anything you have ever seen before.\n","timestamp_created":1598979384,"timestamp_updated":1598979384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":49,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.799158275127410889","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrKSmpfQCeuiWnwI="}
