    review: While I am enjoying the game, I'm finding it buggy. Not everything is
      being saved, when I load a saved game at the drone pad I ended up trapped there
      because the code for the gate was no longer entered. All audio in the game is
      not working for me, but I have seen videos where there is audio. Hoping it'll
      be corrected by removing and reinstalling, it is a pretty cool game despite
      these issues and I would like to finish it.
