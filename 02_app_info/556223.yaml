    review: "This is simply a cool aircraft with about thirty preloaded flight plans\
      \ that sequentially take you around the country.  I'm about five flights in\
      \ and so far they don't take you directly to any place of interest.  For example,\
      \ one stop is in Buffalo, about twenty miles from Niagara Falls, but no flight\
      \ takes you over the falls so you'd have to know that it's nearby in order to\
      \ deviate from the flight plan to see it.  Also, all the flights are IFR by\
      \ default so you'll have to constantly make those little adjustments that the\
      \ Microsoft air-traffic controllers take you on, so I soon learned to modify\
      \ the existing flight plan to be VFR using the GPS, then I just go on autopilot\
      \ via that (with deviations around controlled airspace or to particular things\
      \ that I want to see), switching to an IFR flight plan only if the weather becomes\
      \ truly IFR.    \n\nThe Beech 18 is a sweet classic and I love the sound of\
      \ those twin radials, though the tail-wheel lock doesn't work, nor does the\
      \ tail wheel retract with the main gear--it and its doors just hang out there\
      \ at the back.  Also, there's limited documentation on the aircraft and none\
      \ about the journey itself.  Still, all-in-all it's a good product and I'm enjoying\
      \ cruising around the country.  Each leg so far is about 1.5 hours long which\
      \ is long enough to feel that you accomplished something but not long enough\
      \ to drag.  \n\nIf you buy this, I suggest you buy the book \"I'll Take the\
      \ 18\" by Scott Gloodt which is an excellent memoir of his years flying Beech\
      \ 18 freighters across the American midwest in the 70s and 80s.  He's a good\
      \ writer covering plenty of quirky characters and the challenges and joys experienced\
      \ over many years of flying freight.  But most of all his book is a pseudo love\
      \ story between a man and a sometimes cantankerous and rough around the edges\
      \ but rugged as hell piece of machinery that carried him safely through many\
      \ challenging situations.  He goes into some technical details and nuances of\
      \ the aircraft which should be interesting in computer pilots who enjoy emulating\
      \ real-world flying.\n\nAlso go to http://ryardusa.com/beech_lesson_1.html to\
      \ see a complete configuration table for this aircraft (recommended throttle\
      \ and propeller settings for various phases of flight)."
