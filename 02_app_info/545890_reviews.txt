I didn't get to play it due to being too busy etc. Finally got to play it the other day.... really looking forward to it, started the tutorial level....and suddenly found it's now a timed race through everything, and after repeatedly dying on the first spring box with the spikes on the left of it....and then after getting past that, to find that any slip off the path drops you all the way back to the very start again, just meant that I gave up in anger and frustration.\n\nUnable to refund as owned too long, so got the last couple of trading cards, uninstalled and given up with this.","timestamp_created":1520936881,"timestamp_updated":1520936881,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525316417217254639","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tuG5j+ICcY/KmwE="}
