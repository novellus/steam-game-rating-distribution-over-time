    review: "First of all, the bad:\n- As it stands, the [u]English translation is\
      \ quite frankly terrible[/u] (at least the developer is up-front about it),\
      \ so if you intend to read in English, this is a no-go at the moment. Which\
      \ brings me to my second point.\n- The Steam version has [u]no Japanese aka\
      \ original text[/u]. The only reason I could think of is that the publisher\
      \ wanted to save on licensing fees, since if you wanted the original, you probably\
      \ would've gotten it through Getchu / Amazon.jp etc, not Steam. However, this\
      \ is a visual novel, so omitting original text makes for a bewildering choice.\
      \ For me personally, this is unacceptable, especially with VN releases moving\
      \ in the opposite direction with simultaneous dual-language options etc.\n\n\
      Your Diary came out way back in 2011. The + and +H versions were released in\
      \ 2014 with three additional routes. Let's just say I got the +H version through\
      \ other means back then, and I'm buying this now to support the developer and\
      \ encourage more studios to release their material through Steam. If you've\
      \ ever tried to properly buy/import one of these from overseas, you know how\
      \ much of a hassle it is. Just to be clear, I would [i]not[/i] have bought this\
      \ on its own without Japanese subtitles, but I've already read it, so fair's\
      \ fair.\n\nSo why am I giving this a positive review? It's because I think the\
      \ original deserves it. This is for the devs: I hope the English re-translation\
      \ goes smoothly, and the original text is added, so players on Steam get the\
      \ version they deserve. Hence the following is my [u]review of the original\
      \ your diary +H in Japanese[/u].\n\nWhen this was released, in my opinion, it\
      \ was an underappreciated title with very high production values. Just look\
      \ at the opening movie with cover from Duca. It doesn't even feel like a 2011\
      \ title. That was almost ten years ago. This was Cube's second VN, and I get\
      \ the feeling that they wanted to make a real splash. The CVs alone say a thing\
      \ or two: Naomi (Idolmaster, Little Busters, Aokana, Shinikissu), Yoshino (Eustia,\
      \ DaCapo), Sawada Natsu (Irosekai, Aokana). The voices were well-matched, and\
      \ their performances are spot-on.\n\nThe premise in your diary is simple: Tomoki\
      \ goes to an old bookstore, and he ends up being chosen by Yua, a shiawase no\
      \ kami (deity of happiness) inhabiting the titular diary book, who is determined\
      \ to help him find happiness in life. What does happiness mean to different\
      \ people? What does happiness mean right now? These are central themes to your\
      \ diary.\n\nThe first and best impression on me is the atmosphere. The pastel\
      \ shades, paperback feel, and gentle piano / strings complement Kantoku-sensei's\
      \ art style so well. The characters are really well-drawn even by today's standards.\
      \ Throughout much of the common route, you have moodmaker Kaho and Hibiki bouncing\
      \ ideas off of each other and doing rapid-fire conversations trying to get Yuuhi\
      \ and Tomoki together, with Yua's innocent antics added in for laughs. Of course,\
      \ the characters are all a likable bunch, and they get their own quiet moments\
      \ too. It reminds me of August's Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai, where the conversation\
      \ flows naturally and almost everyone in the group has something interesting\
      \ to say, unlike some VNs with less competent writing. Of course, what they\
      \ say is pretty much in line with what you'd expect from a chara-ge. This kind\
      \ of VN has no central mystery or anything of the sort. It's about the characters.\n\
      \nSpeaking of writing, usually I wouldn't think of mentioning prose in a typical\
      \ VN. However, there are sections in this one that read like they belong in\
      \ an actual book. In other words, the original writing is pretty good (IMO)\

      \u300D\n\nMy best attempt at translation:\nFor some reason or other, just while\
      \ we were headed into my room, Yua clenched her mouth and reluctantly suggested\
      \ that we head out to the veranda. And thus, for some time, the two of us simply\
      \ gazed upward towards the night sky. It's a regrettable, cloudy sky. But even\
      \ so, the stars still managed to flash their brilliant light from between tiny\
      \ cracks in the clouds. It felt a bit chilly, with the caressing breeze against\
      \ my skin, and somehow, that made me realize only now, how tired I really was.\n\
      Tomoki: \"Today was exhausting, eh?\"\nYua: \"Mm, I'm alright...\"\n\nBottom\
      \ line: If you're looking for a classic VN that is buoyed by the strength of\
      \ its characters, rather than cheap gimmicks and shallow writing that plagues\
      \ too many VNs these days, your diary is an instant recommendation from me,\
      \ [i]once the publisher restores the original text and comes up with a translation\
      \ that can do justice to the original material, that is.[/i]"
