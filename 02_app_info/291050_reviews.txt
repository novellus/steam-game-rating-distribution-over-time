If you're familiar with Loren and Queen of Thieves this one will feel right at home.  I enjoy the exploration interface and the \"classic\" RPG elements of turn-based battles that take a little thought and tactical approach.  The dialog isn't anything to write home about and the story isn't anything special but it's definitely a fun 10 hours of gameplay.  All-in-all, I'd recommend this one to anyone who has played Loren and is looking for more from the developer.  If you can get it on sale then more's the better.  Of all this developers RPGs I highly recommend Loren and I hear very good things about Planet Stronghold 2 which just released this year.  I'm excited to check that one out next.  Support this indie dev!!!!","timestamp_created":1609335662,"timestamp_updated":1609335662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw26z42fYCeMrjvgI="}
