And not the good kind, mind you.\nI can usually enjoy these types of games as a time waster or to blow off some steam...but this game is basically just frustrating because it doesn't even tell you the controls and tasks given to you are also not explained which then result in failure unless you figure it out youself at some point. This wouldn't be a porblem if you didn't have to start the whole damn level over from the start...trial and error is a garbage mechanic imo anyway, so yeah. Others might not be bothered as much but I'm honestly just annoyed at this point.\nThis all makes this whole game just a garbage experience. Which is why I gave up bothering with it so incredibly quickly.\n\nSince I only wasted 0,89 Euro on it, my wallet doesn't demand a human sacrifice in exchange for this insult. But I would suggest to not buy this at full price. It's usually on sale quite often so get it then if you must.","timestamp_created":1594861629,"timestamp_updated":1594862174,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520201981067657471","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw86/MqvMCdY3IlQI="}
