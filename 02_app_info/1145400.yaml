      /><br>&quot;I, Olias, Archmage of the Tower, hereby proclaim that, you, Talif....&quot;<br>&quot;...are
      <strong>not</strong> a Wizard by the rules of our Tower!&quot;<br><br>Talif
      is an Apprentice on his way to becoming a Wizard. Heed the Archmage and traverse
      the island''s 4 Dungeons, and collect the 4 Elemental Gifts, uncovering the
      secrets of the Wizard''s island.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1145400/extras/magic.png?t=1594410227"
      /><br>Talif casts magic by using four elemental orbs: fire, earth, water, and
      wind. Combine the orbs to discover new Elements, and take advantage of your
      enemies'' weaknesses. Check your <strong>Spellbook</strong> to see what you''ve
      discovered, and what''s left to find!<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1145400/extras/enemies.png?t=1594410227"
      /><br>&quot;Being a Wizard isn''t just about might. A Wizard must be thoughtful,
      and wise. Never be just a weapon, Talif.&quot;<br>Being a Wizard isn''t all
      about strength, a Wizard must also be thoughtful. Use <strong>Consider</strong>
      on your enemies to learn more about their strengths, weaknesses, and lore.<br><br><br><img
      src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1145400/extras/skills.png?t=1594410227"
      /><br>Talif improves in many ways. Experience is a method of progressing, of
      course. However,  using more spells improves his ability to <strong>Cast Magic</strong>,
      using <strong>Consider</strong> more helps Talif become more wise, mitigating
      attacks improves his <strong>Defense</strong>, and engaging in <strong>Encounters</strong>
      helps him understand how to better control them. <br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1145400/extras/tailor.png?t=1594410227"
      /><br>Talif''s <strong>Gloves</strong>, <strong>Helms</strong>, <strong>Cloaks</strong>,
      and <strong>Accessories</strong> carry special properties, which can augment
      certain spells or elements. Tailor Talif''s gear to meet the needs of the current
      challenge.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1145400/extras/never_alone.png?t=1594410227"
      /><br>Talif takes on the challenges of the island by himself, but he is never
      alone. Check back with the Wizards in the Tower as the Gifts are collected,
      and hear what they have to say.'
