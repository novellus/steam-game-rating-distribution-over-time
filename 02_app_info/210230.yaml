    reviews: "\u201CNancy Drew: Tomb of the Lost Queen is one of the best ever of\
      \ the Nancy Drew mysteries. It's a compact, tightly-crafted whodunit that drips\
      \ with history and intrigue. With cunning deceptions, cave-ins and cobras aplenty,\
      \ the game's got the right balance of scary but not too scary.\u201D<br>\u2013\

      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >USA TODAY</a><br><br>\u201CHer Interactive\
      \ has clearly done extensive research to create puzzles, events, and characters\
      \ that are authentic and faithful to the world of archeology in Egypt while\
      \ taking creative liberties where appropriate. Most of the puzzles require knowledge\
      \ of Ancient Egyptian culture, all of which is imbibed in game. I applaud this\
      \ studio for entertaining me and making me feel like an Egyptologist simultaneously.\u201D\

    review: Lot of cipher puzzles if you're into that. Cool setting.  The ending feels
      like part of the game is missing? Characters will reference things that didn't
      happen, but otherwise, pretty good!
