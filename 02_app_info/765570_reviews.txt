First off please angle the guns down, I play a ton of vr fps games and this is the only one where my wrists are sore after playing for so long. There are a lot of bugs to. Like for example one of my guns started floating upwards and to the left but it was still parented so I still had control of it. The weapons accuracy seems pretty bad considering my iron sights will be directly on a orcs chest and they are not taking damage when I shoot. At one point all of the barriers were up... and a new wave never started. But it was a good idea, and if you fix those problems and give it more of a finish I think it could be great. Oh and one more thing, TAA or whatever your using makes it too blury, maybe add a setting for it or something because it was like me not wearing my glasses.","timestamp_created":1530109466,"timestamp_updated":1530109466,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw2bLooOQCdqS1pAE="}
