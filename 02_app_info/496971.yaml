    review: "The DLC is pretty cool if you love DEATHSMILES. One more character with\
      \ 3 more stages. Its like Deathsmiles in space to me. Seems as tho Taito / Degica\
      \ is out for a money grab at first sight, but its actually a pretty decent DLC,\
      \ the $5 isn't really too bad, if you must though, just wait for it to come\
      \ on sale. Generally speaking DARIUSBURST CS is quite expensive for a shmup,\
      \ but has tons of content. Sadly there are no continues, so as a casual gamer\
      \ whos merely average with shmups, i may actually never get to the end on this\
      \ one, so sad really.... \n\nPS. anyone considering an DLC on D:CS, each pack\
      \ gives you a unique ship with its own strengths and weaknesses and also you\
      \ can choose any installed DLC stages or D:CS stage, you can really mix things\
      \ up! very unique concept to me..."
