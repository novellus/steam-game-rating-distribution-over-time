The game is very shallow, and what is available is bugged, As a vivid 4X player I struggled to win at leats one session. I tried for total domination, and was close to wun despite such facts that in half cases the fleet just decided not to fire or not to shoot. However, because of the bug in media mechanism (which is the only remotely innovative feature) I was not allowed to declare war on one of the races, \nThen I hed for technical victory. This requires to build 4 buildin. One of the planets which built it got destroyed, and the building was never to be offered again to build. \n\nBroken, unplayable game with nothing interesting or innovative. Avoid.","timestamp_created":1524686511,"timestamp_updated":1524686511,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535564303398132324","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ubuZ/+ICdq+DnwE="}
