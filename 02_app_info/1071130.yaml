      \ of innocent people have been murdered! But it's not all good news; the tyrant\
      \ Heavenly Peter has escaped your clutches, and you have been tasked with the\
      \ mission of finding him...<br><br>Your journey will take you through a richly\
      \ detailed landscape built from hundreds of different Renaissance paintings.\
      \ You will steal a ship, feed a donkey, compete in a talent contest, assist\
      \ an inept street magician, sing, dance, play the (magic?) flute, poke a man's\
      \ face, hunt for treasure and have a chat with Our Lord God Almighty... But\
      \ will you find Heavenly Peter? And if you do, how will you take your revenge!?<br><br><img\

    review: 'Funny, challenging enough, & playable in a night. Everything I hoped

      through.


      Shout out to the small time-keeping fella.'
