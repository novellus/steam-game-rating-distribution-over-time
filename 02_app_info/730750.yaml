    review: "On the plus side, this DLC does offer a new class called the Bard, which\
      \ is alright although I still prefer summoner/archer mixes. It is also bug-free.\n\
      \nThe rest of the content is more of an inconvenience than an enhancement and\
      \ throws the game way out of balance.\n\nThe towns you start in are now randomly\
      \ sized. So if you've got your clan members set up a certain way to be in homes\
      \ and so on, when you end that game and kick off a new world half of your clan\
      \ members are outside the walls. So either you have to spend time messing with\
      \ their positions, or more likely you won't realize they have moved until the\
      \ first monster invasion kills some or all of them.\n\nA couple of the new clans\
      \ are OP in my opinion.\n\nBut the worst part is the orcs. They completely take\
      \ over the game. \n\nA randomly placed orc raid using a dimension gate can be\
      \ far stronger than anything an opposing clan might throw at you. They'll send\
      \ raids of 25 orcs which are 10 levels higher than your clan. It's hopeless\
      \ when this happens.\n\nThere are these orc scouts, which are summoners. Each\
      \ summons can bring in around 5-7 orc berzerkers, which are strong, fast melee\
      \ units. There can be many orc scouts on a single level, so you can start to\
      \ get a picture of how this ends up going. Orc scouts can make an area absolutely\
      \ impassable - new orcs can be summoned as fast as you can kill them, so either\
      \ you wind up dead if you get surrounded, or there are simply so many orcs that\
      \ you can't physically kill them all.\n\nOrcs, basically generic monsters, in\
      \ this DLC are not only are capable of wiping out clans, but they often kill\
      \ everything on the level that isn't an orc. So if you get a quest for say,\
      \ dread warrior skulls and they share a level with orcs, you might have to redo\
      \ the level several times because the orcs will wipe out the dread warriors\
      \ before you can reach them. Even if you don't have a quest like that, the game\
      \ often becomes a grind where you're mowing down thousands of orcs. \n\nI love\
      \ the base game, but this DLC takes more than it gives."
