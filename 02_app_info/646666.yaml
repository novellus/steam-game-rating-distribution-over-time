    review: "If you're a Star Wars fan and you're looking for a decent pack of tables\
      \ to start out with I would thoroughly recommend this pack. There's 4 great\
      \ tables here to sink your teeth into, all with some unique and clever designs\
      \ to them. I genuinely believe this table pack to be one of the best in the\
      \ Star Wars Pinball section of FX3, but also some of Zen's finest creations.\
      \ Let's break down the tables one by one.\n\nEpisode IV: Ok, so this one is\
      \ probably the table that most people will try out first. The original. The\
      \ film that started it all deserves an amazing table that does the franchise\
      \ justice. And I can vouch that this table is it! This table is absolutely incredible\
      \ in the way it changes the playfield as you go. I also love how it incorporates\
      \ hidden playfields and narrative all within the centre section. There are times\
      \ your balls change direction around the death star, or even end up in a closing\
      \ trash compactor. There's so much to see and do hidden within this table and\
      \ everything has been an absolute joy to discover. Great multiball modes too!\n\
      \nDroids: Probably the easiest table in the pack. Good for pinball newcomers.\
      \ Lots of simple shots, and well laid out modes that anyone can get their head\
      \ around. It has good flow and some memorable dialogue from your two favourite\
      \ droids. Well worth your time.\n\nMasters of the Force: This table can seem\
      \ a little daunting at first. Visually its extremely striking with it's juxtaposed\
      \ colours and the snowglobe at the top, but don't let that fool you. There's\
      \ a lot to do here with some extremely challenging shots, hidden playfields\
      \ and high scoring multiball modes. I love this table but my only gripe is I\
      \ find the left reverse scoop SUPER hard to hit, making some of the Dark Side\
      \ fights difficult to complete. I think I just need to get better, though.\n\
      \nHan Solo: In my opinion the best table in the pack. No \"mission\" hole is\
      \ present, so modes are naturally chained up by just shooting ramps and playing\
      \ the table. There are 11 modes in total, the vast majority of them are multiball\
      \ modes. Some include different weighted plastic balls, some have you shooting\
      \ in the dark. This table is incredible. The ramps feel so good to shoot. And\
      \ I absolutely LOVE the way the balls lock on the Death Star. At first it might\
      \ seem a little confusing but just shoot away and you will be rewarded for your\
      \ time.\n\nHonestly. This pack is some of Zen's finest work. They are absolutely\
      \ astonishing tables and would be tables that I'd be super proud to own if they\
      \ were real. If you're new to pinball and love Star Wars, definitely check this\
      \ pack out. at \xA31.75 a table, you really can't complain!"
