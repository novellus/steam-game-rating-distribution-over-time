    review: 'I love ancient architecture, so this pack is a must if you''re into that

      added a new drink stand: Pipshot Mate (mate [mah-tey] is a green tea that people
      from Uruguay and Argentina drink). That would''ve been a nice addition to those
      whose family is from South America'
