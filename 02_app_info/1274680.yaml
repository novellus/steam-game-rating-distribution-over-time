      \ companion album. The music in the Pattern release is generated by the movement\
      \ of the player through the landscape, so there aren't static tracks in the\
      \ usual sense. What I'm including here are the thematic tracks we'd originally\
      \ intended to &quot;announce&quot; each environment, but which have been left\
      \ out of the game to give the procedural music more space.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nI'm also including a selection of &quot;walking&quot; ambient tracks recorded\
      \ live during a few excursions through the environment to reflect something\
      \ of what the game sounds like during play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComposed and\
      \ performed (and walked) by Michael Bell."
