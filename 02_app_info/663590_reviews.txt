The amount of time that probalby went into this vs the amount of time and enjoyment someone can get out of it is amazing. This is what you need to do for a first game in the indie scene. There is no fullscreen function, no controller functionality. The main menu is very barebones, Its done in a lowres pixelart style, and the main character has a very limited spriteset There isnt even an up or down sprite even though you spend about half the time going north or south. All of this saves devtime which is what you want when you are putting out your first game. That being said it was an enjoyable expirence. The pixelart graphics were A strong point. The trees look very realistic. These arent your normal lollypop every tree is the same type things no. They actually look like they were modeled off of real trees in wintertime and there are many different types. As the day goes on there are various lighting effects that happen with the snow and trees that look like they must have been done by hand instead of some particle shader. In foxfolk you are a fox just trying to survive the winter mostly by looking for sticks and hunting animals. Wood can be a hastle to find. You dont know how many times I wished my fox could use an axe. They have a fireplace and a stove you would think they would be smart enough to use an axe. So many times the wifefox and kidfoxes are freezing in the burrow because I cant find any wood while Im surrounded by trees.  In order to win in this game I had to constantly jump to go faster. Its a cheat you know well if you have played games like skyrim. I dont know if its possible to win without spam-jumping.","timestamp_created":1609138472,"timestamp_updated":1609138472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxJCI1PYCfaCCvgI="}
