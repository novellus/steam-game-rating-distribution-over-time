Is this the deepest, most complex groundbreaking game ever? No, however, it is fun. If you have played a previous title from the developer, Ammo Pigs, you can see how this game is an evolution of that. Ammo Pigs is a fun game, but a deeply flawed game mostly due to it's buggy nature. \n\nI can happily report that absent from this game. This game is a solid platformer with some mega man and metroid elements thrown in for good measure. I personally love the art direction and the music. As long as you are not looking for innovation, if you want a solid retro like title complete with difficulty and the occasional cheap death, then this one is an easy recommend.","timestamp_created":1606061861,"timestamp_updated":1606061861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iOWv+PUCfIf0rwI="}
