Usually its never good (or at least the stuff i heard and in my opinion).\n\nBUT holy moly was the Voice acting amazing in this Game. The VAs did such a good and convincing job, i was blown away. really really enjoyed it!\n\nonly negativ part i could name would be that the game is a bit buggy and that some Scenes play different if you want to rewatch after Unlocking them. For example i unlocked all the Romance Endings for all the Girls and if i rewatch it it shows the Friendship Ending.\n\napart from that great game! love it.","timestamp_created":1610024505,"timestamp_updated":1610024505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46om87vYCfpKiwQI="}
