I almost quit the game for good and was going to give it a thumbs down, but I decided to keep going to see if it got better and it sure did.  I have to admit that the contols are a little strange and take some time getting use to, but it is turning out to be a fun and addictive game.  I have been waiting for a good pirate game for a very long time and never found one meeting my expectation yet, but this is not a bad overall concept.  The game has crashed on me once so far, which is always disappointing.  I will update this review after I have completed this game.  UPDATE:  I am still giving the game a thumbs up overall, as I did have some fun, but I am not going to complete the game as the sea battles get a little boring & I just don't like the controls.  Overall the game concept was not bad but a thumb down on most of the battle mechanics.","timestamp_created":1609063533,"timestamp_updated":1609270687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511627912521362305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40b6A2PYCcKnZvQI="}
