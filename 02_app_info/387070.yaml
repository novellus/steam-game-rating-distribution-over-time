      /><br><br><strong>SHORT BIO</strong><br><br>When Carrie-Ann was born, the doctors
      told us that we had a very special girl. We didn''t really know what that meant,
      only that it seemed to involve sending her to &quot;special schools&quot; because
      she couldn''t handle being in a normal one. So we sent her to the newly opened
      St. Mary''s Boarding School for Gifted Children. She seemed to be happy there.
      She even made a friend called Ava. I didn''t like her, though. Ava told Carrie-Ann
      stories, disturbing ones, about things her parents and other people allegedly
      did to her. I told Carrie-Ann to stay away from her, but I don''t think she
      ever listened.<br><br>One day Carrie-Ann called us saying that some of the students
      had gone missing. We spoke to the teachers but they said it was just a story:
      a made up urban legend. We tried to speak with some of the other parents, but
      nobody seemed to be talking about it. Not too long after, the school closed
      down. &quot;Structurally unsound&quot; they said. Oh, if only I''d known then
      what I know now. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>SNEAK,
      STUMBLE AND STALK YOUR WAY THROUGH THE GAME IN FIRST PERSON - with future support
      for Oculus Rift.<br><br></li><li>SNOOP AND PEEK - as you venture deeper into
      Saint Mary''s you will come across holes and cracks in the walls to peer through.
      Tread carefully, as it''s never nice to spy on others...<br><br></li><li>TRUE
      HARDCORE SURVIVAL MODE - no weapons, no armor, no easy means to protect yourself
      from the horrors that lurk within the school. <br><br></li><li>DISCOVER CLUES
      AND ABANDONED ITEMS - piece together the troubled history of the school and
      its past as a hospital.<br><br></li><li>YOUR PHONE REVEALS THE TRUTH - use the
      camera of your phone or tablet to find clues or discover hidden texts. Some
      things are best left in the dark... <br><br></li><li>EPISODIC - Experience the
      game like a show, with each episode given you a new theme, environment, as the
      story unfolds.<br><br></li><li>SHATTERED MEMORIES - Place items you find in
