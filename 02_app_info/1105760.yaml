    about_the_game: "This small bus, designed for transportation over short distances,\
      \ was manufactured from 1967 to 1989. Its good maneuverability is an advantage\
      \ both in urban conditions and on highways. It does not consume much fuel and\
      \ is easy to maintain. The small windows are compensated by additional openings\
      \ on the roof; the narrow doors have pneumatic actuators and allow only one\
      \ passenger at a time. The vehicle does not have an individual door for driver\
      \ access, and the driver\u2019s cabin is separated from the passenger compartment\
      \ by a curtain or a small partition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC includes two\
      \ variations of paint and headlights."
