    review: "Update #3: I'm changing this to a \"recommend\" mainly based off the\
      \ fact that the developer pushed out an insane number of patches in the first\
      \ weeks of release to try to make it a better game and it is definitely better\
      \ as a result. I still have some issues with a few things here and there but\
      \ they deserve a thumbs up for all the work they put in. I've included a link\
      \ to the full series (I played through the game in 3 parts) and you can clearly\
      \ see the changes from part 1 to part 2 to part 3. By the end, the gamebreaking\
      \ stuff was no longer present. Some people will still be on the fence but it's\
      \ a recommend from me - especially if it goes on sale. I enjoyed the final version\
      \ of the game enough to give it a thumbs up. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O0d8U5F1zg&list=PL08FwntTpxPACBXeVvsSB2I_LURxNq81r\n\
      \nUpdate #2: The game has gotten better. It's still not at a state where I can\
      \ recommend it yet but the dev has been working hard and has been pushing patches\
      \ for all the issues we've been locating so that's definitely a plus. It's getting\
      \ there. I'll update more when I've had time to test the newest patch. Here's\
      \ my newest video showing some of the changes and updates to the game so far.\n\
      \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVGMg8C59wY\n\nUpdate: I'm changing this review\
      \ to remove some things about the dev attacking me. That was a misunderstanding\
      \ with someone who appeared to be the dev but was not. I did refund the game\
      \ (the first refund I've ever made on Steam) mainly based off my interaction\
      \ with the person who appeared to be the developer. \n\nThe game is borderline\
      \ unplayable. I could not progress due to a bug that you can watch in my video\
      \ on my Youtube channel. There are sound issues, there are texture issues, there\
      \ are issues with item placement (where they are literally placed in a spot\
      \ where your character CANNOT reach them), and there are progression issues\
      \ that literally make it impossible to go further in the game. And that's just\
      \ the start. \n\nThat being said, with some patches the game could actually\
      \ be decent. I'm not saying the game will never be a good game. I'm just saying\
      \ at this point (November 4th) that the game is unplayable in my opinion. \n\
