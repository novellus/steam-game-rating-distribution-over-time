    review: Substance Designer is a powerful tool for creating textures that can be
      imported into game engines and applications for 3D modelling and animating.
      There is a steep learning curve and even the basic tutorial is overwhelming,
      but the results you can achieve are amazing, particularly if you are aiming
      for realism.
