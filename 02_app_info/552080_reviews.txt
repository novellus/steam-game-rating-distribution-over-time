And I gotta say this is one of the most immersive experiences in a video game for me. We were actually scratching our heads trying to get the ship to re-power while under fire from a destroyer. Fair to say I'd recommend this one to anyone in this niche and also people looking for a good immersive game thriller game to play. 7/10 really fun","timestamp_created":1609912767,"timestamp_updated":1609912767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4oeqR6/YCc9j1wAI="}
