    review: "Some really cool additions. At first I thought it was just islands and\
      \ a few new bits and bobs, but they've added new items and a few new options\
      \ to manage your prisoners such as transfers. \n\nThe reason I don't recommend\
      \ this is purely how buggy and unpolished it is. This is 6 months after initial\
      \ release I am playing this too, plenty of time to fix the bugs. I have janitors\
      \ unable to find and clean rooms without me manually putting them there, I have\
      \ doors that do not close automatically, the yard thinks that it isn't secured\
      \ with walls and doors when it is... \n\nThey've added nothing that makes it\
      \ feel remotely like you're building on an island, you still have the default\
      \ ambient noises of roads and a city in the background it's absolutely ridiculous.\
      \ They've added floor tiles that don't bend when you make a corner such as the\
      \ new cliffside floor tiles, it's really unpolished and it breaks my heart a\
      \ bit.\n"
