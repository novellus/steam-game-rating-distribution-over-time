Hands down, one of the best soundtracks ever put into the game, I would even compare it with the original 'Streets of Rage' OST in terms of how well it captured the tone of the world. Not just a lot of amazing techno tunes that were badass and perfectly painted the universe, but also a lot of really good atmospheric themes that created an immersive mood for each area. Sadly the game is only just decent in comparison, but the soundtrack elevated it so much. Also, 57 tracks? - are you mad? And I would say I like 56 of those lol, sorry but I feel like that 'Green' fight theme was not used in proper context, the fight needed a different song. Normally I would not spend $9 on game music, but in this case, you got to pay respects to the music overlord. (oh and I have to say really nice sound quality, the bass is just perfect).","timestamp_created":1590767102,"timestamp_updated":1598247935,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.633913576602935791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wYPAj/QCevyCiwI="}
