    review: This game's lots of fun - i'm gonna keep it simple with, you get unlockable
      characters, unlockable power-ups that change the way the game plays. If you
      find the game easy then play it on a harder mode, if that's still simple then
      try a power up to change the game play. For example you have a few unlockable
      slow down options that slow down the bullets if they get near you, which is
      good to position the bullets for better score. You have another slow down power-up
      to give the game the "cave slowdown" feel. I stream this game regularly on https://www.twitch.tv/brianreboot
      so if you're wondering how the game looks please take a look.
