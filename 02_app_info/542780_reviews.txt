The physics are true-to-life and the graphics are incredible. The crashing animations are very accurate, and so are the physics. For example, hitting a traffic cone head on sends you flying 30 feet into the air, causing catastrophic damage to the exhaust system and rear bumper, but leaving not even a scratch on the front end.\n\nRecommend to everyone who like anything. Stop what you are doing and download this.\n\n\n\n\n\nBTW Im called benisgayxd on the leaderboard","timestamp_created":1485723555,"timestamp_updated":1509809368,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":17,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51349186897277832","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvNXpw98CdoLocA=="}
