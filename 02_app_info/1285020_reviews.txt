For example, an additional story mode for VS would be pretty nice, similar to how VS CPU mode would work in PDP games.\n* Would be great to see some customization options for time attack and the like to make use of the extra columns that the story mode provides.\n\nOverall I have enjoyed my time with the game, and I expect to go back and replay the entire thing again. Time attack mode with the leaderboard is going to give me something to really dig into for some longevity. Definitely worth the price tag and then some, but would be great if we could see some more stuff added into the game, even if as DLC.","timestamp_created":1607364961,"timestamp_updated":1607364961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rtyan/YCdIKDuAI="}
