      Its levels are in the shape of small squares on the game board. The whole square
      is entirely visible and the level does not imply long passing. However, each
      of them will require quick thinking and fast reactions! On the whole, this game
      doesn''t contain very large and complex elements and can be used by beginners
      of the Supaplex world. But at the same time we think it may be of interest to
      professionals! In total we can say - it''s a game of UNUSUAL SQUARE LEVELS!<br><a

    review: I think the original was called Megaplex and released very long ago, but
      this is a great remake. A superb modification of the Supaplex puzzle game albeit
      very difficult, sometimes almost diabolically so. I recommend playing the classic
      Supaplex first and only then giving this a shot. Supaplex HARD requires the
      player to use some very obscure, peculiar techniques which I previously used
      to think were nothing but exploits of the Supaplex gameplay mechanics. However,
      in this game these my-so-called-exploits are perfectly accepted and in most
      cases you cannot complete levels without them. The quick save option is a tremendous
      help and lets you prevent rage episodes after failing a level because you only
      considered 99 moves ahead and not the fatal 100th. I may be exaggerating a little
      but it does require quite a bit of thinking ahead. In conclusion, brace yourselves
      - this grabs you by the balls from the very beginning and does not get easier,
      but you'll feel like a mastermind when you complete all the levels.
