Too tedious. The slow movement speed and the requirement to kill all enemies are terrible for an adventure roguelike. The original bomberman had you competing against other players, racing for power-ups. This game gives you unlimited time to grind and look for power-ups, making it a chore. I'd love this game if there was a way to play where:\n- The player is much faster.\n- Defeating enemies is optional (paths are always open, or maybe require just 1 kill to open)\n- There's some reason to go fast other than the achievement, e.g. the boss gets an extra heart for every 3 minutes it takes to reach them, or lots of fires randomly appear over time.","timestamp_created":1606183151,"timestamp_updated":1606183151,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42bz++/UCeYiVsAI="}
