    review: This game does not support online versus  match making. If you want opponents
      in this game you have to have friends who have purchased this game. There is
      a free version which does support online versus option but it is NOT THIS GAME.
      I am going to have to give it a thumbs down until there is a matchmaking option
      for this paid version. I am asking for a refund but willing to re-purchase it
      if online matchmaking is made available on the paid version. I do not like the
      online free version because it does not have playable controller support, I'd
      say it pretends to have controller support but none at all. The paid version
      seems to have decent controller support but no online matchmaking.
