Crazy!  Seems to be extremely optimized as it is small but brings with it a bunch of fun online matchups.  3 units, ground forces, a tank and 2 drones.  I think I am best at the tank as it is easiest, but splitting up the ground forces and controlling individual groups of them with two joysticks on the same controller at once is awesome!   Units can't turn around (they can't and it seems intended) so the game is a simple match up once you go to War War!\n\nAlso if you are playing with 4 people if you die you can control the animals on the screen and they can be a lot of fun in a disruption sense!\n\nOverall great game if you like the old-school style graphics which you can see in the video, it shows it off pretty well.","timestamp_created":1596812144,"timestamp_updated":1596812144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw2PXa5PMCfqj9mQI="}
