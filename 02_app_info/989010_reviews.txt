There is no feedback loop - as in, no way to review your progress, re-do lessons later on, quiz yourself on whether you actually learned anything. The model is fine for VNs, but not for language learning.\n\nAlso, there does not seem to be an option to turn down the background music. While the music isn't  bad as such, it does get annoying really quickly.\n\nIt looks cute and all, and I wish it was better, but unfortunately this is not good.","timestamp_created":1586593934,"timestamp_updated":1586593934,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549753189086914063","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq8WXtPECeKjx/wE="}
