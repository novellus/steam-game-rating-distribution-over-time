It has some charm and I like the music, but the actual gameplay ruins what could be a nice simple platformer. Poor camera centering makes this game frustrating and nauseating at times, and bugs make it ridiculously hair-pulling if you want to finish the game. My favorite among these bugs is when the axe traps just float off into space, where they can either hit you where they shouldn't be or alternatively they might randomly snap back into place, usually as you're walking through the empty trap area. Especially toward the end of the game this bug in particular can really ruin the gameplay.","timestamp_created":1609651145,"timestamp_updated":1609651145,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kumr4/YCefH7vwI="}
