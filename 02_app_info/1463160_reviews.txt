They have a whole different feel from the other official packs. It seems like there was a professional choreographer involved with these, or at the very least they put a lot of time into studying the BTS dances and implementing similar motions.\n\nCon: I would prefer if you could turn the dancers off. They do spawn in the same zone the blocks spawn in. Though they didn't have any effect on my ability to play the maps.\n\nDifficulty: I beat two of the expert+ maps on my first try. But the way you move differently in the maps kept them interesting and challenging. Those two will at least be good warmup maps. The rest of the maps are going to take some time for me to beat. (For reference, I've beaten maybe half of the OG expert+ tracks)\n\nOther: They regularly use the zones you can't stand in, so you have to move your body around pretty heavily in maybe half or more of the tracks. Similar to FitBeat in the OG tracks.","timestamp_created":1606796862,"timestamp_updated":1606796862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo8yjjvYCf6+btgI="}
