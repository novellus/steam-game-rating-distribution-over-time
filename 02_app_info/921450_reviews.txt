The game is still fun and I would recommend it to anyone.\n\nAt the time of writing this I am only 30 minutes into the game, but this is 100% something I can see myself dumping time into. This is a cool take on the Tower Defense genre where instead of just placing traps at the random locations given to you, you get to build the structure to suit your needs.\n\nA constant need to reload all the traps makes you really think about how you are building something, and if you will have enough time to go refill the trap and get back in time. \n\nAny issues I found in the game I reported to the developer who got back to me right away.","timestamp_created":1544716250,"timestamp_updated":1574956508,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554531455039978027","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtqSu2e4CcoCctQE="}
