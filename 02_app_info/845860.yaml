      rooms have different rules for drawing cards, so choosing the right room for
      your situation is key!  (If you can''t find a useful room, you can always draw
      a single card instead.)<br><br>At the start of your next turn, if you have more

    review: "Recomiendo este juego si te gustan: los juegos de mesa, los juegos con\
      \ un interfaz bien hecho, los colores, los juegos con un buen tutorial, los\
      \ juegos de reglas sencillas pero con profundidad, los juegos que se pueden\
      \ jugar en poco tiempo. Por poner alguna pega, la \xFAnica que se me ocurre\
      \ es la m\xFAsica: acompa\xF1a bien el juego, pero enseguida te cansa."
