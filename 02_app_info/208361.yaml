      \ freight trains across Wyoming without the need for double heading and helper\
      \ operations over the 1.55% gradient of Sherman Hill and the Wasatch mountain\
      \ region. Adaptations of the previous Challenger Class locomotives showed that\
      \ larger fireboxes, longer boilers and more driving wheels achieved their aims.\
      \ What followed was the monster Big Boy with its articulated wheel configuration,\
      \ huge water tank and 68in (173cm) driving wheels.<br><br><br>In 1941, Alco\
      \ Locomotive Works delivered 20 Big Boys and another five were put into service\
      \ in 1944. Although rarely run at such a speed, the Big Boy was capable of an\
      \ 80mph top speed and towards the end of their life were regularly hauling more\
      \ than 4,000 tons up the Wasatch gradient unassisted. The last revenue service\
      \ by a Big Boy was in July 1959 and eight of the original 25 locomotives have\
