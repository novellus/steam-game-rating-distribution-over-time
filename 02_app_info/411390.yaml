    about_the_game: <strong>Please note that this game is only available in Japanese.</strong><br><br>&quot;Getsuei
      Gakuen&quot; is a light novel originally written by Tomokazu Sugita, a multi-talented
      artiste working in various entertainment fields and most known popularly in
      Voice-casting. Together with the producer of &quot;BLAZBLUE&quot; series, Toshimichi
      Mori, they joined hands to create a whole new visually stunning Adventure game,
      &quot;Getsuei Gakuen -kou-&quot;!<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2></li></ul>The
      game revolves around the protagonist, Kou, who has just barely been transferred
      to Getsuei Gakuen High School, and right on his first night after the transfer,
      he encountered the mysterious hostile creatures that prowl the night --- the
      &quot;Hazards&quot;. He survived the ordeal, after being saved by a fellow student
      girl of the same High School, but just as he assumed he was safe, the girl turned
      around and killed him... or so he thought. <br><br>The very next moment, he
      woke up on his bed, all safe and unharmed. Puzzled by the previous night's encounter,
      he set off for school, only to realize that &quot;today&quot; is the &quot;first&quot;
      day of his transfer... again.
