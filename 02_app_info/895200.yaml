      It's like a prototype of VRMMO in the light-novel &quot;Sword Art Online&quot;\
      \ series. The feeling of pulling a sword out of a sheath or exchanging a sword\

    review: 'Currently unplayable for me (Oculus Quest 2 user), as the hands are completly
      messed up. The left hand us downward and the right hand upward for some reason,
      which makes for a poor experience. I''m getting a refund for this game, until
      this bug is fixed.


      A shame really, cause I was looking forward to try it.'
