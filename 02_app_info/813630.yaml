      /><br><strong>Supraland is a First-Person Metroidvania Puzzle game. The main
      sources of inspiration are Zelda, Metroid and Portal.</strong><br>Supraland
      assumes that you are intelligent and lets you play independently. The story
      is minimal, gives you an overarching goal to pursue, and then sets you free.
      Despite child friendly visuals, the game targets experienced players. Playtime:
      ~12-25h<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/813630/extras/Metroidvania.png?t=1605202397"
      /><br>You explore a large interconnected world in which most ways are at first
      unpassable until you find new abilities to overcome those obstacles. A cornerstone
      of Supraland''s design was to create abilities that are so versatile, they will
      keep on surprising you by how many different usages they have. If you combine
      your abilities, the possibilities become even bigger.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/813630/extras/pacing.png?t=1605202397"

      /><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/813630/extras/Headershot1.png?t=1605202397"
      /><br>Most of the game is about exploring the sandbox world to track down secrets.
      Often you will think you are about to get out of bounds and beat the level designer,
      but right there is a chest waiting for you with a very rewarding upgrade. Supraland
      respects your lifetime and doesn''t bloat the playtime with unlimited no-brainer
      collectibles.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/813630/extras/PuzzleDesign.png?t=1605202397"

      /><br>The deeper you get into the game the more you will be facing creative
      puzzles you''ve never seen anywhere before, encouraging you to stop and think
      about what abilities you have and how you can use them in yet another way. Puzzle
      types that I already knew from other games were immediately rejected in the
      design process. And it''s important to me that once you understand the idea
      behind a puzzle, you can pretty much immediately solve it instead of having
      to go through a cumbersome, frustrating execution.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/813630/extras/Combat.png?t=1605202397"
      /><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/813630/extras/SupralandFighting500.gif?t=1605202397"
      /><br>The fighting mechanics are inspired by old-school, fast-paced shooter
      games like Unreal, Doom and Quake, encouraging high-speed strafing and jumping
      while throwing shot after shot at hordes of charging enemies without ever having
      to worry about weapons reloading.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/813630/extras/FreeDemo.png?t=1605202397"
      /><br>In the demo you can play the first big section of the game and decide
      if it''s for you. The demo progress continues into the full version; you don''t
      need to play anything twice!'

      \ so far before I noticed it was almost entirely made by one man. [...] It really\
      \ does stand comparisons with Portal, Zelda and Metroid, which is no mean feat,\
      \ and not words I\u2019d offer lightly.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://t.co/orOmZJjIFQ\"\
