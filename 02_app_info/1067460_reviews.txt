Really? I'm a big fan of Jinxed, so when I saw that this also had the Immotion name attached to it, I had high hopes that it would be good. I was hesitant, cause $10 did seem a bit pricey, but I figured it must be amazing, and that's why the price point would be so high. It's not. It says it's like the \"highest, fastest, scariest\", but the drops are super small, like 20 feet, then you go into a turn and then again. The one time that it seems like there's going to be a huge drop, there isn't. With all the lights and twisting corridors of Jinxed, I can't believe this is all there is to The Tower and that it's $10. It should be $3 and it's still just okay. Invest in No Limits 2 : Roller Coaster Simulation and you can download hundreds of truly scary coasters, like 016 (OTM) Bravery, 023 (OTM) Catalyst or Call of Cuthulu and try the flatride Devil's Dance 2017.","timestamp_created":1570906660,"timestamp_updated":1570942554,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+aHe4e0CcI3/0wE="}
