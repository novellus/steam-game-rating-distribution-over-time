Full concert show. If you're into great song writting, classical or even Trance music, this might be worth checking out. This is perfect for easy listening, or even sitting in front of the tv, pretending you are attending an amazing concert experience. If you are in doubt wether if you should buy this or not, check some of the clips out on youtube. I highly recommend this for Above&Beyond-fans.","timestamp_created":1545853589,"timestamp_updated":1545853589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44LqD9ucCdsXBtgE="}
