For the sale price (75% off), I would recommend this game if you enjoy [i]super casual[/i] exploration puzzle games. Don't expect the puzzles to be challenging. Most of the game consists of walking around to complete mini quests by finding objects to proceed and collecting notes so you can get a fuller picture and understanding of the story and characters. It's easy to get lost and movement is quite slow (you can only run outside), so just be aware that a good portion, I would say at least an hour, of the game is just walking and trying to find your way around. \n\nStory-wise, rather than horror I would say it's more of a mystery game since there are little to almost no mechanics where your character is in danger. The main premise is trying to uncover and piece together what happened while trying to find and save her father.","timestamp_created":1602930537,"timestamp_updated":1610026436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2rjD7vYCerSxqAI="}
