      of Train Simulator, West Coast Main Line North brings you well over 100 miles
      of highly-detailed railway line, with stations, yards, cuttings, viaducts and
      stunning scenery. West Coast Main Line North recreates the route between Carlisle
      and Glasgow as it appeared in the early 1990s, with no less than 26 realistically-modelled
      stations and halts. Also included is the brand new Class 86 electric locomotive,
      which was built specifically to haul express passenger services on the route,
      and which comes with accurate British Rail Mk3 buffered coaches. Built to cover
      the distance quickly and comfortably, the Class 86 can really stretch its legs
      on this long and fast line. For a change of pace, there are also full recreations
      of the yards along the route including Polmadie, Mossend and Kingmoor yards.<h2

    review: 'After Fixing my Issue of Missing Buildings & Stations ive decided to
      change my review to a Positive because of the intense detail the developers
      have put in like putting inteiors in and making an almost 100 mile Route which
      noone could probably do today the train that comes with it doesnt seem to work
      unfortunatley when you apply power it just stays at 5mph


      so my new review comes to the conclusion of an 8/10



      P.S TO FIX THE MISSING OBJECTS ISSUE TURN UP YOUR GRAPHICS'
