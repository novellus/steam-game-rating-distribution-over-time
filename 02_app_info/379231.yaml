    review: Well this is a great little package, the Gee Bee is really well rendered
      and the sound effects are excellent. Alabeo has done a great job with this package,
      the detail and accuracy are really top notch. The in-cockpit engine noise is
      the deafening roar that it should be! Great fun to fly, highly aerobatic but
      very tricky to land. The original aircraft was absolutely lethal and all the
      original examples were lost in accidents, which gives you some idea of how tricky
      they were. The flight model in the game is perhaps a little more benign, but
      still a challenge. Aerobatics with a smoke trail are great fun! 10/10
