    developer_response: 'It has been quite some time since this review, but we appreciated
      your feedback and thought you might want to take another look.  We just released
      a major update that addressed a number of community concerns, and improved the
      game in every way. It won''t change everything, but that feeling of "work" is
      hopefully gone!  Check out the huge patch notes here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/897800/eventcomments/4048138220344223014/'

    review: "Below the line is my initial review, from January 30th, 2019. A major\
      \ update has tackled the concerns therein head on, which means it's time for\
      \ a new one. I've played through the first 41 levels so far and on a preliminary\
      \ basis can say that the changes worked\u2014the game remains fun and challenging,\
      \ but not challenging in a tedious way. I now provisionally recommend it (a\
      \ fuller review will have to wait until I've replayed a lot more of it).\n \
      \ \nThe art is good for its style, the writing is excellent (it's amusing without\
      \ overdoing it), mechanics are good, difficulty curve is smooth (so far), and\
      \ the overall conceit is charming. The controls are slightly annoying from time\
      \ to time, but not nearly as annoying as they used to be, and now well within\
      \ the bounds of acceptable.\n\nWith the changes, I expect to finish it now.\n\
      \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe concept is great and a lot of the levels are extremely\
      \ fun. So why don't I recommend it? Because the difficulty curve is far too\
      \ uneven and too many levels rely on the pure physical challenge of mastering\
      \ chaining together a sequence of extremely precise mouse movements and click\
      \ timings, with nothing interesting remaining to \"figure out\" apart from the\
      \ necessary physical practice, long past the point it ceases to be play and\
      \ instead becomes something akin to athletics, or training for performance art\
      \ (in the sense of, e.g., juggling or ballet). It might be fun to watch someone\
      \ else stream it, but to do it yourself is... well, work."
