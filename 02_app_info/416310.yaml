    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Goblin Defenders: Steel ''n'' Wood" is a Strategy game. The game was developed
      and published by Alawar Entertainment.


      At first glance, the game looks like it was developed for mobile devices. I
      guess it was originally developed for mobile devices before it was ported to
      PC.


      There is a second installment for this game series but it is only for mobile
      devices.


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals in the game are well done. The visuals can
      be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are two different difficulty game modes to choose from: Normal and Hard.


      There are two campaign modes to choose from: Campaign and Survival. The campaign
      mode features five different areas with two levels each. The survival mode features
      endless waves of invaders.


      The defense towers can be upgraded to the max but it would require an "x" amount
      of coin to do so. The highest upgrade level has to be purchased from the shop
      with gems.


      There are several different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the
      game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need
      to be completed before they can be unlocked. The achievements are in-game only.


      Miscellaneous


      There are six different trading cards to collect. Only three of those trading
      cards are given out by the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the
      trading card: Purchased from Steam''s Community Market; Trade with friends;
      Booster Packs and its'' Booster Pack Creator.


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
