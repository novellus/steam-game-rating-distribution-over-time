The game feels like the first chapter in a much longer story, both because of its length and because of the way the ending is written. The lore initially seems very interesting, but then turns out to be much more stale than expected. The three cases don't really become more difficult or engaging as the culprit is obvious from the start. All in all this feels more like a proof of concept than a finished product.","timestamp_created":1609939670,"timestamp_updated":1609939670,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv7r46/YCdvT/wAI="}
