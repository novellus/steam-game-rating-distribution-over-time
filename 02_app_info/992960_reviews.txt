It's an other-worldly experience. However, it's very limited in content and, in my opinion, it's over-priced for what it is.\n\nYou may get 10-20 minutes of relaxation entertainment from this app, but there isn't anything here to draw you back in after that first wondrous experience. It does get repetitive. Unless you can showcase this to several friends or family, it may not be worth the purchase price. \n\nYou do have full locomotion that is headset-gaze based (not controller), you basically move forward to where you're looking. You have snap turning as well. You can take screenshots by pressing down both grip buttons and you can stop the landscape motion by pressing trigger. \n\nI would have liked to have other scenes included (at least 3 different scenarios), other than this one that just has some slight random variations each time. You can touch the bouncing balls that make chime sounds to get another random variation on the same theme. It will also change the music (that all sounds kind of the same). I would have liked the option to listen to my own music. It would be cool if the scenes reacted to my music. \n\n[b]Rate 5/10.
