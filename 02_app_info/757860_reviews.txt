There are 8 levels which get a bit more challenging than they may look if you go for the time trials since you'll have to learn the levels well enough and manage your momentum considering your angle and inertia. I do enjoy movement-based indie games so it was fun for me to play through this.","timestamp_created":1601489377,"timestamp_updated":1601489377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525471031665802002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47pKN8PQCfNeHpQI="}
