Same goes for Frost but at least she's granted following the completion of chapter 4 in Story Mode.\n\nKahn is good. Experts can comment on his combos and speed compared to the others - numerous websites created tiers and assigned a mediocre-good evaluation to Kahn. I, on the other hand, can comment on what it feels like controlling the villain that acted as boss in MK 2 & 3. \n\nIt's amazing! I modified his default variation to give him the ability to throw a hammer not just the spear. The former has krushing blow while the latter is good for great distances and it is also pretty fast. Then you have his shoulder charge (can be modified to a spear version) and you can laugh at the opponent or taunt them just as he did to you more than 2 decades ago. These will make you stronger for a short period time or your enemies weaker. \n\nAs for the fatalities? They are disgusting and the use of hammer is important for both. Friendship is clever and fun. Khan's voice actor did a great job. Gears include changing the looks for the hammer and the spear as well as giving Kahn a different helmet. Skins are not that great in terms of variation - I preferred the fully clad Kahn that looks like a samurai from ancient times. \n\nOverall, I'm very satisfied with the character. His kombos are great but you have to be careful when inputting the first hit as the animation can take slightly longer compared to the others.","timestamp_created":1607735233,"timestamp_updated":1607735233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.750961661338806152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4npmfqvYCeKGluQI="}
