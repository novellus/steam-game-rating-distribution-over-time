There's no flashy graphics, alien invasions, or apocalyptic scenarios.  It doesn't spend a bunch of screen time ratcheting up false tensions, piling on mountains of expository dialogue, or following predictable movie tropes.  The \"hook\" is presented with an unapologetic lack of explanation.  The viewer is thrown into the chaos alongside the characters trying to piece it all together.  This is smart sci-fi and a great character-driven thriller.  \n\nMultiple viewings are encouraged and rewarded.  I've seen it several times and I've loved it more each time.  There are lots of little details that might be missed on a first viewing which have profound implication upon subsequent viewings, such as one character's quick glance at an object in the room or a line spoken off camera that is barely registered the first time around.  I won't ruin the plot in this review and suggest going into this film knowing as little as possible.  It's interesting piecing it all together and if you love it as I did, you'll want to watch it again and again to pick up on all the subtle details.  I had a bunch of \"oh sh-t!\" moments on my third viewing once I started paying really close attention.\n\nThe way it was filmed is also really interesting.  This is an indie film with a $50k budget shot on Canon 5D's.  It was filmed at the director's own house over the course of 5 nights with only pair of cameras, a skeleton crew, and completely natural lighting.  The most interesting thing is that the acting is entirely improv.  The actors had no scripts.  They didn't know the story ahead of time.  It was filmed like a mystery dinner party, with the actors staying in-character, and the director as master of ceremonies pulling strings behind the curtain.  Before each scene the actors received a small sheet of notes directing them as to what their character should accomplish.  He left it in the actors' hands to craft the scene, only pausing to \"right the ship\" when they started veering too far off course.  What we get from this are natural conversations and genuine characters while the actors work together to craft a coherent story.  They're figuring it all out as they go, just like the audience.  It's a fun way to create a film, certainly too risky in the big-budget space, but it really works here to create a compelling, refreshing experience.\n\nI have a couple gripes with the Steam version.  It appears this film is only currently available at a maximum of 544p resolution.  The store page suggests 720p and proper 1080p options are available, as listed in the recommended system requirements, but these options were not present at my time of viewing.  I've also viewed this film on Amazon Prime Video and it has a 1080p option, so it shouldn't be a matter of availability of a \"full HD\" version.\n\nAlso, some scenes are particularly dark due to filming outdoors at night and using only natural lighting sources.  Due to the low-light conditions and digital compression there are occasionally color banding and artifacting issues.  Despite these technical issues, this is one of my favorite indie films of all time and I look forward to see more from this director in the future.","timestamp_created":1459789338,"timestamp_updated":1498217417,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.682009637355804443","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kvGt6twCf//qVA=="}
