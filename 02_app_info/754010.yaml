      use the full functionality of all apps, activate the full trial in the settings
      screen. <br><br>This download includes:<h2 class="bb_tag">Medical Imaging XR</h2>Medical
      Imaging XR is our DICOM Viewer for virtual reality. Load and display your own
      DICOM data from CT and MRI and edit and compare several DICOMS side by side.  4
      DICOM datasets are already preloaded: examine a head, a heart, a neck and a
      full male body. Rotate, scale and cut the data with your hands and use filters
      to segment and fade out parts of the body. To load your own DICOM click on the
      + button on the library.<br>Medical Imaging XR is developed for medical professionals
      and medical students.<h2 class="bb_tag">Dissection Master XR</h2>Dissection
      Master XR is the human anatomy lab for virtual reality. Discover professionally
      dissected human bodies in VR. Each body part is dissected to create perspectives
      that make even the smallest anatomical structures accessible.<br><br>The super
      high resolution human anatomy models provide visualization of sub-mm structures
      such as small nerve branches, small blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and membranes.
      The serial cadaver dissections are designed to teach 3-dimensional relationships
      normally visible only during a dissection or an operating room procedure.<br><br>Many
      structures are annotated. At the moment there are 6 layers of head and thorax
      available. More datasets and annotations are constantly added.<br>Dissection

      XR</h2>Study and teach accurate male and female anatomy models in XR, created
      by Zygote, the world leader in human anatomy models. The app offers the most
      immersive digital way to teach and study human anatomy. Discover male and female
      anatomies side by side in virtual reality. Scale the models, cut the data with
      your hands, and disassemble and study the structures. Anatomy Master XR comes
