    review: "Plunder is an action RPG that's sort of a cross between of Sid Meier's\
      \ Pirates! and Dink Smallwood.  You sail around a fairly large map, have lite\
      \ naval battles complete with boarding attacks, and land at various locations\
      \ to explore towns, find side quests, and explore dungeons.  \n\nThere's a pretty\
      \ good variety in weapons, with each type also having a few unique variants\
      \ that are worth finding for the novelty alone, like a bow that lets you steer\
      \ the arrows after firing or a hand axe that heals you when you do damage, and\
      \ even more build customization in the other equipment and stats.  The dungeon\
      \ exploration is pretty engaging, as they all have distinct puzzles and riddles\
      \ to access all the unique loot.  You can hire AI crew members to tag along\
      \ behind you, and even unlock your own settlement that you can expand and improve\
      \ with all the money you stop really needing otherwise.\n\nThere's a few problems\
      \ - items on the ground vanish if you leave a map, even ones that were hand-placed\
      \ to appear the first time you enter, so if you go exploring and bail before\
      \ completing an island or dungeon, you might not have the tools necessary to\
      \ do so.  The storage is extremely limited, even if you take into account the\
      \ stashes on your ship, and juggling weapons and items when you find something\
      \ you want to take along is frustrating, especially if you're trying to complete\
      \ multiple quests that require delivery.  The ally AI makes recruitable crew\
      \ mostly useless, and sometimes downright hazardous [your own musketeers tend\
      \ to shoot you in the back of the head during ship boarding] and the final ship\
      \ upgrade is unnecessary, extremely expensive, and makes you go painfully slowly.\
      \  It was always fun finding a new unique weapon or unlocking a new spell, but\
      \ many of the spells are too situational given the extremely fast pace of the\
      \ combat, and casting requires a free offhand that's better used for a shield.\
      \  You can go fishing, but about half of the spots where fish appear are literally\
      \ inaccessible with your hook.\n\nPlunder is a great game that feels straight\
      \ out of the era of Flash games that were more compelling than a lot of AAA\
      \ titles of the time, with just enough to see and do to keep you hooked without\
      \ becoming a slog."
