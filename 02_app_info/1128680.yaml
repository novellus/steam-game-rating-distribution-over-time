    review: 'I wasn''t sure what to expect when launching the game. It turns out it''s
      a pretty good puzzle game in the vein of adventures of Lolo or chip''s challenge.

      The puzzles are well designed and will test your sagacity and ''thinking-out-of-the-box''
      capacity.

      There are boss levels too which are working well.

      The crude graphics work hand in hand with the stupid story to give the game
      a zanny feeling which isn''t bad at all.


      Only problem is the music that is awful and some of the sound effects are very
      grating too. You''ll want to put the game on mute.

      Also: there is such a thing as "too much". There are too many levels and it''s
      really discouraging to finish the game. Some of the later levels are either
      filler, or way too difficult and require to memorize dozens of twitch-second
      manipulations on every level. It really stops being fun.

      It doesn''t prevent you from finishing the game because the filler levels are
      in optional sections, but it''s still a pity, especially if you were proud of
      100%ing the game on your own until then.
