    review: I love this style of game, but this one doesn't react to clicking well.
      It also doesn't queue up or let you "turn in" two of the same with a single
      click to the location. For example, you have the character take two customer
      orders then click to turn them in. It only turns in 1 of the two and won't permit
      a second click until the first event happens. Not worth the aggravation.
