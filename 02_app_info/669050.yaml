    review: "[code]This review has been brought to you by the [b]Lewd Games Reviewers[/b].\
      \ If you\u2019re interested in spicy games that\u2019d rise err\u2026 the room\
      \ temperature feel free to check out [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38444643/]our\
      \ curator[/url][/u] (we will love it if you follow it too ^^).[/code]\n\nThis\
      \ game sure was something else and I\u2019m giving it a thumbs up, but with\
      \ some reservations (I explain it at the end). Before anyone gives me weird\
      \ looks let me tell you that I\u2019m not precisely into futa animal-like girls\
      \ but everything else was good enough for me to overlook that detail. It felt\
      \ refreshing to have a main character who wasn\u2019t a prude like many other\
      \ VN protagonist, let alone be a woman who actually likes sex quite a bit. I\
      \ also found all the characters to be quite likable, to the point I didn\u2019\
      t mind how barebones the main story was. I would be a bit hard-pressed to choose\
      \ a \"best girl\" (I\u2019m torn between Elizabeth Margaret and Lara) but Alcina\
      \ is definitely the cutest one (sorry doggo girl).\n\nI found the puzzles fairly\
      \ easy and the boat ships battles became a tad too random to me in the later\
      \ stages of the game, but what bothered me to no end is that some routes can\
      \ only be followed if you buy their respective DLCs (\u251B\u25C9\u0414\u25C9\
      )\u251B\u5F61\u253B\u2501\u253B\n\nAll in all, it was a fun game that I\u2019\
      d have tried to fully complete if all routes were available without any DLC\
      \ purchase."
