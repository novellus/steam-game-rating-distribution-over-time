If you need it for one of your routes, get it, but otherwise I would recommend another train for the same price.","timestamp_created":1603757172,"timestamp_updated":1603759183,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yeLfs/UCet+sqgI="}
