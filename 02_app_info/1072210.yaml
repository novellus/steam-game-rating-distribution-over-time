      \ through many mystical worlds and dungeons, fighting the creatures within.\
      \ Bluey is out to stop the Cure, a virus that was created by Sparkle Evil, a\
      \ corrupted government agency set on ruling the world. He is also avenging his\
      \ father, who was slaughtered by the mutant King Spider. While on the road to\
      \ King Spider's castle, you encounter 9 legendary beasts and one optional boss\
      \ who all have a reason to cut your life short. There are 5 unique worlds containing\
      \ dangerous enemies that will keep you running, and some towns where you can\
      \ stop by a shop. In these shops, you can purchase new upgrades or even a skin\
      \ with soul tokens (the in-game currency), which you can get by killing foes.\
      \ Even though Bluey may seem alone, he has his trusty pew pew gun and petrified\
      \ shotgun to guide him through hordes of enemies. Also, his handy bombs to send\
      \ foes flying, and a grappling hook to explore new areas and get across pits\
      \ full of lava.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1072210/extras/steam_image_1(1).png?t=1579033365\"\
