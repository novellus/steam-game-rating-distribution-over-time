    review: 'This is the first Smile Game Builder release I have played so far (think
      RPGMaker in 3D). The current state of the English translation is so bad I cannot
      recommend this game. There could be a decent story and it seems to follow a
      lot of JRPG tropes, but there is no way to really tell at the moment. The stock
      assests combined with CGI stills looks odd, but it seems like there is at least
      some effort here. If the translation improves I could see this game being worth
      buying on sale. I mostly view this as a showcase of the engine features and
      it does a good job in that regard. Stay far away if you are looking for anything
      else.


      12/31/17 Edit: I tried playing this again due to the updated English translation.
      The game will no longer lauch and is currenlty unplayable. Buyer beware.


      03/31/18 Edit: What sorcery is this?!?! The game is working again and the English
      translation is a little better. I will try to get further this time and see
      how it goes.'
