This is a memory match couples game in a small cafe with only 5 tables. The flash graphics are quite appealing for the first levels. But then you realize it becomes a grind of endless puzzles to fill the above love bar with correct couple matching. The love bar goes even in the last levels all over the screen. At the end you cannot see colors anymore. It's so ridiculous and pointless to finish this quantity of the same puzzles over and over again.\n","timestamp_created":1550964147,"timestamp_updated":1550964147,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.695307135581970215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s9iqjukCctLWuwE="}
