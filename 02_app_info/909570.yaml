      ><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>During the game you will learn to create new\
      \ bizzare weapons that will help against the dangers lurking in the galaxy.\
      \ You will travel to different planets trying to conquer them and free the Spuds\
      \ that are still alive. You will find new Spuds heroes among them, that will\
      \ join your cause and help to restore the civilization on your home planet.<br><br>You\
      \ will use different Spuds heroes and their unique skills to battle against\
      \ your enemies. Providing support from discovered and carefully crafted weapons\
      \ will allow your Spuds to come home unharmed. You will be literally throwing\
      \ everything you have at the enemy. There are many different turrets to choose\
      \ from that support different playstyles and are useful in different situations.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Living galaxy</strong></h2>Other players will probably\
      \ not allow to make your job too easy, as they will be creating their own Spuds\
      \ tribes. Some of the Spuds are not particularly loyal and easily impressed,\
      \ so if you lose a battle against other commander\u2019s forces they will simply\
      \ abandon you and relocate to his/her planet.<br><br>You will be fighting in\
      \ an asynchronous mode, where the other players will fight against what you\
      \ have left on the planet when conquering it earlier. Your Spuds population\
      \ will determine you player level and collecting more Spuds will unlock new\
