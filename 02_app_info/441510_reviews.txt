I mean overall the game is good and its addicting, however I will say you shouldn't 100% it.  I as well as most people get stuck on 3-8 gold, the level is stupidly brutal in difficulty and is a rather extreme difficulty spike.  \n\nBut its a rather simple game with simple mechanics that sometimes you have to think to fully do well in it.","timestamp_created":1519019116,"timestamp_updated":1519019116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575320065021514893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3oim1uECd4q0mQE="}
