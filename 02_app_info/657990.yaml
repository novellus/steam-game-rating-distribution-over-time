      \ around the time of The Walking Dead, the mod went multiplayer with custom\
      \ servers. From there, things would never be the same. After roughly 3 successful\
      \ years of development in Minecraft, a standalone was starting to brew up. As\
      \ the community demanded more advance content, Minecraft was limited and a standalone\
      \ was born! Here we are today!"
