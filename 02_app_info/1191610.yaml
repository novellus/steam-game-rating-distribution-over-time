    review: "I really enjoyed this game! I am into solving crimes and story-driven\
      \ games, and Memory delivers on both sides!\nMemory is a game developed by a\
      \ small company, so I didn\u2019t expect a AAA game but was still pleasantly\
      \ surprised by a few things:\n- I especially like the fact that the author gave\
      \ each character their own personality, only by using texts - pretty cool!\n\
      - This game is loooong (that\u2019s a very good thing in my book, pun intended)\
      \ and be aware that the story takes some time before really taking off; like\
      \ with any good crime story, the story seems at first to go into one way before\
      \ completely changing direction.\n- I enjoyed that the search for clues is interspersed\
      \ with short puzzles; also that a whole set of these puzzles are chapter titles!\
      \ I love this kind of nerdy attention to details, ha ha\n- The phone booth to\
      \ \u201Cjump\u201D from one area/building to an other is a nice idea, but be\
      \ still ready to do a lot of back-tracking (think Resident Evil without actions\
      \ and zombies ;) )\n- It was challenging to get the \u201Cright\u201D ending\
      \ but ultimately very rewarding!\nOverall, I strongly recommend this game for\
      \ whoever love a good crime story and enjoy looking for clues everywhere."
