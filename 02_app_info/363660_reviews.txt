But this was disappointing. The controls are rudimentary and there's no HUD or cockpit other than something bizarre, and I didn't see a way to remap keys or even view the keys other than mash everything on the keyboard until something happened. I landed at an airport to pick up a package, and didn't really see an acknowledgement that I got the package. I assume I did. All you can do at the airport is click on gas or click on the plane area. Why bother implementing the walking to do these things? The flight itself was a bit wonky, it seemed to sometimes want to level off other times I was perpetually trying to adjust. I presume that if I connected up my flight stick it just wouldn't work because this game doesn't look like it would support anything like that.","timestamp_created":1607312181,"timestamp_updated":1607312181,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48LDRnfYCe9TytwI="}
