    review: 'Update: no longer works on W10, not sure if it works on previous versions
      of Windows? Anyways, thumbing it down until it is fixed



      Fun and good looking 3D tower defense game. It is a bit grindy, but I don''t
      mind it since there is a lot of stuff to play around with.


      Pros:

      - Nice, colorful and charming gfx

      - Every map has 5 difficulties and good incentives to beat them all

      - Some maps have traditional lanes, while on others mobs can appear from unexpected
      places

      - Many heroes to unlock, controlling a hero feels a bit like playing an action-RPG

      - Tons of stationary towers to unlock

      - Heroes, towers and weapons can evolve and level up

      - Potions and magic spells can be purchased

      - You can farm money and materials

      - Perfect for when you have a little bit of spare time


      Cons:

      - On a crowded map it can be too easy to lose control of the hero by accidently
      clicking on a stationary tower

      - Does not properly support special resolutions like 3440x1440

      - No cloud save

      - Not the best translation to english, but everything is still easy to understand
