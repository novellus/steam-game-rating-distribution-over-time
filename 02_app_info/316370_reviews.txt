And started to try this game now in 2018.\nThis game has buggy skill and quest.\n\nSkill - ( When stun monster with a skill and killed, it will just freeze there for about 10secs before the body drop dead on the floor to pick up loots. )\n\nQuest - ( The map will show numerous \"!\" meaning there are quest to take, but quite a lot of them can't be taken and even when quest are done completed, it still will have \"!\" mark shown on map. )\n\nAnd you can't possible make food/potion(HP regen) yourself because the materials are rare or the shops just randomly sells stuff.\nExample you could loot meat drop from monster but you would need coal or spiced powder which i still don't see shop selling it. So you had to purchase food from shop insead. Making the drops lost its purpose to be honest.\n\nNow im stuck in a quest for about an hour plus and even Google or discussion forum doesn't have any thread about it damn it.","timestamp_created":1540400996,"timestamp_updated":1540400996,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540041267871856689","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6rvD0+YCccGirQE="}
