You have to visit the three factions of your kingdom: the peasants, swamp people, and aristocrats. You can either convince them to join your rule, or, if you do not like them, decide to not have relations with them. <br><br>The order you visit the factions is up to you, and if you visit one faction before another the other factions will take notice. <br><br>At the core of the game is diplomacy and the question &quot;what would you do if you were thrust into a leadership position?&quot; That question is significant since the player has a large amount of agency in determining the direction of the story. For example, you could decide that you do not like how any of the factions operate and tell them that you don't want anything to do with them!<br><br>All of this culminates in a final strategy battle at the end of the game. Here your faction loyalties are put to the test as you control your forces and battle back the enemy army.

The strategy is done through dialogue where you choose how to position your army for the coming attack. <br><br>A single play through can range from 1-3 hours depending on how fast you read and go through the story. For most people, it will likely be in the 2 hour range.
