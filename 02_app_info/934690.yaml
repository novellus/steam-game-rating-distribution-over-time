    review: 'My first game in the Marblehead Lima I scored a Kraken award (5 kills).

      I destroyed 3 ships with the guns, one with torps, and the final kill was a
      ram.


      This is a good fun ship. It''s a bit fragile and doesn''t stack up well against
      higher tier ships. Same tier, it can be a real bully.

      Someone threw all their guns on a small ship and added torpedoes for giggles.
      It''s always an entertaining game in this boat.


      The torps reload fast, so you''re always going to have them as an option.


      Do not run to the front line, you''ll get decimated. This isn''t a tank, it''s
      a low level gun spammer.

      Play midfield, support the front, use cover. Pick on isolated targets, bully
      destroyers, set things on fire, and just keep

      shooting. That''s the appeal of this ship, it''s all guns, just keep shooting,
      but don''t get shot (too much).


      Do not go broadside to the opponent in this ship. Never do that. Use your angles,
      reverse if you have to, just never show your side unless you''re 100% sure you''re
      going to secure a kill.
