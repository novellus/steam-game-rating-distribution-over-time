There is an innocence only an Indie game maker can create which I find very pleasant.  The scenery looks like something from a Model Railroader but the textures are so interesting I have a good time just looking at the crafting of the scenes.   Puzzling is pretty straightforward but also interesting.  Just when you think you got it all figured out a little curve ball comes your way to keep you on your toes and shows us the developer put some effort in creating a good gaming experience.    \n\nThere are a few mini games here as well a very crazy game of Putt Putt golf.  Don't even try to use the laws of Physics here, just swing away and hope for the best : )    Eventually that over sized white ball will ever so slowly sink into the putt adding to a nice set of achievements.  \n\nThis could be a nice game to play with a young teen.  Slightly mature theme but not any more so than a cop show on TV, and moves quickly enough to keep their attention.","timestamp_created":1592241621,"timestamp_updated":1592241621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gOG/3PICdoqcjgI="}
