This time, Patient #17, aka Nikolay, is exploring a decrepit, abandoned factory that he used to work at. Carrying on with the enigmatic method of storytelling, this episode is actually crafted out of Nikolay's own memories, but any correlation of the events shown here and the previous entries is completely shrouded in mystery. Episode 3 comes off feeling more like detective work rather than having to do anything with horror or psychological thrillers.\n\nAgain, the puzzles are extremely easy, and again a chunk of them don't even need to be completed in order to finish the episode. This entry is a bit shorter than the others, coming in at around 20-30 minutes of playtime as most of the events, puzzles, and notes are all within close proximity of each other. Episode 3 is a much more enjoyable part of the In Fear I Trust series, and out of all four episodes it's really the only one worth playing. It's easy to play as a stand-alone, as no events in the series are well connected. However, having to purchase the base game in order to play this episode rules out any hope of actually recommending it as a purchase.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]2.5/5.0[/b] - It's not awful, but it's not great.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore\n\n[h1]Related Reviews:[/h1]\n[b]Review for In Fear I Trust - Episode 1: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/THNEmbalmer/recommended/522690]Here[/url][/b]\n[b]Review for In Fear I Trust - Episode 2: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/THNEmbalmer/recommended/523850]Here[/url][/b]\n[b]Review for In Fear I Trust - Episode 4: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/THNEmbalmer/recommended/523852]Here[/url][/b]","timestamp_created":1521957634,"timestamp_updated":1521963060,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.615604400634765625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsqmEruICcajEnAE="}
