I am not at the point of understanding how to make strategies, I just want to know what is happening. For example, I was playing a game where I though I was in the lead and suddenly lost the game with no clue of what ever happened. There is no event logs so its hard to keep track of what is going on. \"System crash\" seem to have a similar combat mechanism and it does that better.\n\nYou have a dozen of cards in your hands which makes it overwhelming to know which card t play as it requires a lot of analysis. The is also no summoning cost, which can be OK since epic card game does that too, but you have card levels. So you end up with the Yugioh syndrome where you always play the strongest cards first. I also don't understand the turn sequence, the difference between attack and defense, \n\nYou also have cards that has like 10 times more hit points than other cards. I don't say it's a problem, but I have an hard time figuring out it they are really balanced. Else, besides the special powers, all cards have 4 combat stat but it does not seem to matter much since damage is cumulative and most units roughly have the same stats. Again it could be my misunderstanding of the game.\n\nAlso, it was not clear which game feature was for multiplayer or for solitaire play. I don't really want to play MP, so maybe an icon indicating that this section is MP would have been useful.\n\nAs for the artwork, I have nothing to argue. For the user interface, it was sometimes confusing. I happened to play a card in a column when I actually wanted to look at my enemy card. There was also a stack of cards but I could not look at the card underneath. So yes, the user interface needs some improvements.\n\nI know I will have to give it another try, but so far, it's meh! I was hoping for better.","timestamp_created":1598537294,"timestamp_updated":1598537294,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi+yPmPQCfOmPngI="}
