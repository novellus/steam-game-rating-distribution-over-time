    review: 'I played this like 2 months ago so I forgot some details.


      If you like I wanna be the guy and/or similar type games, I''d highly recommend
      this game.


      The game has high replay value - I played several hard/impossible runs and by
      the time I beat hard/impossible there were still levels I haven''t seen before
      in new runs. And I''m sure there are more, if you care about replayability.


      The achievements add replay value as well.


      Also, I really liked the magic tower mode. That one is less roguelike and more
      platforming. There is one bad game design where basically if you die, you always
      end up at 1 hp for boss fights and that can quickly get hard when you are fighting
      end game bosses with 1 hit. It is also possible to trap yourself in magic tower
      because part of the mode is a bit of puzzle and going in the right direction
      / using the key in the right place at the right time. For the most part, honestly
      fairly well designed mode. You can reason your decisions out by checking to
      see where else you can go and also make backup saves. Tho I had to reload the
      entire mode a few times, but luckily that was early game. There is also some
      gems at the end I missed bc I used the wrong key / wrong path, so basically
      you can complete magic tower 2-3 times depending on how many achievements you
      are trying to go for.


      The bosses are pretty meh except for some bosses in magic tower. The only noteworthy
      bosses is the last boss for hard/impossible mode, and there are several nice
      bosses on magic tower mode, though as the creator as also mentioned, can get
      a bit unfair with the RNG attacks. Usually I don''t rly have an issue with "RNG"
      attacks, but legitimately in this game that can be an issue with some bosses
      late game in magic tower.  It just forces you to try a few times but nothing
      too crazy


      Overall, nice platforming game for the cost.'
