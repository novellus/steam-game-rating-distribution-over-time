There seems to be multiple systems put into the game that will be fun (the fishing minigame is pretty cool, cant wait to try to fill the fish exhibit in the museum)\n\nOverall seems like a lot of potential for relaxed, low stress fun.\n\nAnyone who likes Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, Littlewood, or Stardew Valley should find a lot to like here.\n\nI plan on updating this review as I play more, and especially once the game hits 1.0.","timestamp_created":1609878651,"timestamp_updated":1609878651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4h9iP6vYCd+PnwAI="}
