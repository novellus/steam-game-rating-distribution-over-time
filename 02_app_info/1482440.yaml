      \ will find puzzlement, exasperation and elation in the same proportions as\
      \ in the actual game. So it's probably a good guide.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's\
      \ quite a simple level, once you get what's going on. People are pretty much\
      \ split down the middle on this. Half of them get it in 10 minutes, the other\
      \ half spend a long time here. Which also good.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are\
      \ two main hurdles. One is realizing what information is being given to you\
      \ ( what's the little cube 'saying' ). The other, is realizing what assumption\
      \ you have made, which is not true ( about teleporters ).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      You can use the guide in the community section if you get really stuck.<br />\r\
