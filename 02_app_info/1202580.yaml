    review: 'I was impatient to finally be able to play this game and it was definitely
      worth the wait! A really good game with cute moments, lovable characters, great
      music and a lighter story~

      Helping Edward paying off his debts and watching him grow as a character was
      so rewarding! Plus, both romance give more details about the character, be it
      through his personality or past (especially with Francis'' route). And if you
      prefer to see Alex with someone else from Beyond Eden, you can always play cupid.
      A feature that I''ve never seen in any of VN I have played! The game doesn''t
      feel repetitive as you have lots of things to do during this journey (uncovering
      mysteries, solving cases, gambling...)

      Again, the VA did a wonderful job bringing the characters to life, especially
      for the three main characters! It was awesome! (The bloopers and special episode
      got me laughing hard). The CGs are all magnificent with great alts for the steamy
      ones!

      A great experience for me whose a big fan of Beyond Eden (and of Edward)! I
      totally recommend it!'
