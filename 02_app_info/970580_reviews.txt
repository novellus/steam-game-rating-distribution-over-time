The problem is the 'power-ups' (aka cheats?): the ice cubes, bombs, and especially the teleports. They seem needed to solve some levels (at least for 3 stars completion), but because they are widely available (5 of each / level) they are completely overpowered. Why would you try to solve a level without them, when you can use them? It removes the incentive to actually solve the puzzles the hard way. It breaks the game. Shame.\nThe achievements \"use 'cheat X' 100 times\" are completely stupid as well.\n\nThis feels like a port of a mobile game, where the aforementioned power-ups are an IAP.  I can't recommend that.","timestamp_created":1609703670,"timestamp_updated":1609703670,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj5j05PYCcLeWwAI="}
