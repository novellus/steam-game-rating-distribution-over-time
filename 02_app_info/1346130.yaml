      \ started sweeping across the globe, the arcade scene was (and continues to\
      \ be) heavily impacted by the closing of bars/arcades and the implementation\
      \ of social distancing. This left both our company and the <i>Killer Queen</i>\
      \ community in a rough spot, so we set out to create something unique that would\
      \ help bring our players closer together while we all navigate the difficulties\

      \ THE BLOOD QUEEN</i></strong>, the fast-paced, high-flying, single-player 2D\

    review: "I purchased this because I love Killer Queen Black so much and wanted\
      \ to support the dev and this universe anyways I could. For some reason I thought\
      \ this would be a Metroidvania title, but instead its closer to that of an endless\
      \ runner that rotates levels daily, monthly, or you can select a random run.\n\
      \nGraphically its simplistic, and certainly doesn't feel anywhere nearly as\
      \ polished as Killer Queen Black. You seemingly just run forward, jumping to\
      \ collect flys while avoiding enemies, spikes, and pits. You can occasionally\
      \ find a berry and transform your character, the same as in KQB, but here your\
      \ goal it to get a high score, or perhaps reach the end although I don't think\
      \ I'll be finding out because I suck at the same but I'm also not having that\
      \ much fun with it either. \n\nThe platforming and movement feels a bit too\
      \ weighty for me, the graphics are rather basic and at times glitchy, and as\
      \ someone that loves chiptune usually the music here isn't my cup of tea. As\
      \ protoype and proof of concept this is fine, but it needs a lot more polish\
      \ and well...everything before I'd recommend it to anyone. I know I didn't play\
      \ for all that long, but I've already lost the drive to keep playing, and honestly\
      \ that makes me feel bad/sad."
