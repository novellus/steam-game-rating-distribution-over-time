    review: "A very fun yet very difficult little time trial obstacle course game,\
      \ controls are very responsive (so long as your responsiveness setting is at\
      \ 10, 1 \"smooths\" out jerkiness), though they are not rebindable (not that\
      \ the control scheme is bad, it's actually good), and there is no long respawn\
      \ delay or need to manually respawn after dying (which you'll be doing a lot\
      \ in this game), which makes it very much based on your skill and patience with\
      \ a joystick.\nEach sector has its own central gimmick and visual scheme.\n\
      Graphics are simple and clear, though the music loops, while good, are a bit\
      \ on the short side.\nAs far as challenge goes, some levels are short, especially\
      \ around the start, only requiring a few seconds to complete, while others,\
      \ especially as you progress further, are full blown obstacle courses which\
      \ make achieving the seemingly high par time difficult. Some levels have (possibly\
      \ unintended) shortcuts which can shove off many seconds while going for par\
      \ or leaderboards. \nUnfortunately I cannot speak for the local multiplayer\
      \ mode, as I do not own 2 controllers.\nOverall I'd recommend this game to people\
      \ who enjoy challenges and time trials, as long as you have a working controller."
