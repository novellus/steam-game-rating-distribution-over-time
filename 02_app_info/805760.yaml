    review: 'You start this game as a young kid who initially commit rather minor
      crimes, but who soon becomes an obnoxious, disgraceful adult. Initially, you
      steal minor things, and lie to adults. Then you steal evidence from a crime
      scene, aiding a paedophile in going free, only to give the material to a child-molesting
      priest SOLELY because you want a photocopy card. You photograph your underage
      classmate doing sexual activities and spread photos around the school.


      Later, you get obsessed with a woman, and attempt to manipulate her into ''fixing''
      you. You get one of your coworkers fired by setting them up. You (mildly) poison
      an innocent person in order to manipulate another coworker.


      Be warned, there''s a highly sexualised chapter where you have to do ''stuff''
      to a giant set of lady parts. A bit surreal, but I''m a grown adult. It might
      not be suitable for younger players.


      A later chapter and you''re defending a woman who loves her dog *too* much (if
      you get my drift) and also a paedophile friend of yours because child porn ''doesn''t
      hurt anyone'' if ''it''s for personal consumption''. WHAT!!!!!???!?!??? What
      sort of sick people believe this stuff???


      The chapter after that I got stuck because you have to grab something out of
      your inventory and use it on screen, and you are only given about 2-3 seconds
      to do it. It''s not possible to do that on my laptop trackpad, so I couldn''t
      even progress if I wanted to. I can''t hit the top right inventory icon, then
      move down to the inventory at the bottom, then move to the upper centre of the
      screen, all in the time allowed.


      In my view, forget this game, go for something like Projectorface if you like
      this black and white aesthetic. I hope your obnoxious character gets hit by
      a truck or something at the end of this, because I can''t possibly empathise
      with such a ****head'
