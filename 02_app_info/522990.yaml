    review: Fun little game about tracing lines. I played on my wacom tablet which
      was more enjoyable than with a mouse. A bit tedious to memorize the spells,
      but could be a fun little game for small kids, but ultimately it feels mostly
      like a minigame, maybe better suited for mobiles.
