Composed by the band Cur√©label, the soundtrack for [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/365160/Kona/] Kona [/url] does an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere in the game created by the developers over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Parabole] Parabole[/url]. Each track is not only fitting but composed well. As stated in the description, it's Quebecois rock music that blends tradition and modernity. And it does pretty well, with unique sounds and good melodies there's a lot to like about the soundtrack in and of itself. Overall, this is a really good soundtrack, and I'd recommend it if you liked it enough in the game.","timestamp_created":1596240934,"timestamp_updated":1596240934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx/bX0/MCe6/ZmAI="}
