    about_the_game: "Spies &amp; Soldiers is a low fantasy strategy game with procedural\
      \ content and simple mechanics, providing a hit of pure strategy gameplay without\
      \ the overwhelming complexity often associated with the genre.<br><br>The game\
      \ is a two-player, turn-based digital board game, based on simple mechanics\
      \ from which complex strategies arise. Each match plays out across a uniquely\
      \ generated world map, so every game is different. <br><br>Key features include:<br><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Online head-to-head multiplayer.<br></li><li>Simple mechanics\
      \ and complex strategies.<br></li><li>Fast-paced gameplay.<br></li><li>Simultaneous\
      \ turns.<br></li><li>Procedural maps.<br></li><li>Single player skirmish mode.</li></ul><h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Game Mechanics and Strategy</h2>There are two primary systems:\
      \ military strength and subterfuge. To grow an empire and win, players must\

      \ They can also turn the tide of battle, assassinate other spies, sabotage castle\
      \ defenses and more. A spy\u2019s effectiveness is determined by its rank, with\
      \ the most highly ranked spy in a region having the upper hand. Working from\
      \ the shadows, spies are hidden and can only be seen by an enemy spy of superior\
      \ rank."
