    developer_response: 'You should connect your controller after the game starts
      (it is stated in the games page) and the game will run as suppose to . Sorry
      for that , its a bug i could not fix.

      You can always play with your cursor keys but if you have your game pad connected
      before you run the game it will not work.

    review: This may be the worst video that I have ever seen.  I might be missing
      something, but there is apparently no way to turn left, and the car seems to
      want to go into reverse all the time.  There are no real instructions to the
      game, so maybe I am missing something, but it should not be that complex to
      get such a simple game running. If you like doing donuts in a car and driving
      in a circle, this is the game for you. I do not recommend buying it.
