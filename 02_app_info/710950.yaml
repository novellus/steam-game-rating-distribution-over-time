    review: 'certainly very interesting, i''ve done one full playthrough but unlocked
      a few endings from saves near the ending/spots i suspected i might die if i
      chose "wrong". i...think i solved the murder? it seems at least that the person
      i accused and against whom i gave apparently good enough evidence went to prison
      in the end although they "never said why they did it" which implies that they
      did it and i got the ending "resolved" which heavily implies that i solved it.
      perhaps i just need to play some more.

      nevertheless it was very interesting and at times scary as i wondered who to
      trust, how to keep myself alive, and watched helplessly as others died knowing
      doing anything would probably kill me. small moments with love interests were
      also nice although i confess i didn''t do many of those this time around since
      i was more focused on solving the murder. overall a good mystery/horror game'
