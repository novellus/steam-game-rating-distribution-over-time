This is fine in a game like The Witness, but there are so many slopes and winding paths that I couldn't stand walking around not long after the tutorial.\n\nThe world itself looks nice, and I'm sure the puzzles are cool, but I was barely able to find any before I gave up, so I can't really comment on their quality. The game lacks any kind of coherence or player guidance in general, which other (similar) games have done far better.\n\nDespite having an interesting concept, I cannot recommend this.","timestamp_created":1608850221,"timestamp_updated":1608850221,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477941185235977173","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/MS8y/YCfYLzvAI="}
