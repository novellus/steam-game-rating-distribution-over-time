Apart from the new area, two new challenge maps and some new outfits and weapons, it offers a unique new story with some impressive visual elements along the way.\nHowever, the game tries to set up the story in a way that there is a huge reveal at the end, but the \"twist\" becomes so painfully obvious after a few minutes already, that it fails horribly at delivering a revelation to the player.\n\nAll in all [i]Baba Yaga[/i] is not a bad expansion, but for the asking price of 9,99â‚¬ you might want to wait for a sale as the DLC can be finished in a very short amount of time (somewhere between 1 to 2 hours, a little more if you want to collect all the different hidden items).\n\nStill I am giving a thumbs up because I did enjoy my time with it.","timestamp_created":1547717706,"timestamp_updated":1547717729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.63576042652130127","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rsvKregCcYHHuAE="}
