It's fun trying to find all the different bits of dialogue and get the achievements but the game is very short. Was able to 100% the game at the time of this review without any guides or hints to help, so about an hour and a half of content maximum if you try. It's a good game but maybe closer to two to three dollars in value due to the amount of content in the game. Would love to see a full blown RPG based on the concept though.","timestamp_created":1580157306,"timestamp_updated":1580157306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyeCt9O8CdMrF7gE="}
