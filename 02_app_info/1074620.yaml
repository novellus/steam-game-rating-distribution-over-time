      /><br>Adore is a monster taming action roguelite where the main character, Lukha,
      is able to summon and control creatures to fight by his side in a simple and
      innovative way.<h2 class="bb_tag">CUSTOMIZE YOUR PLAYSTYLE</h2><br>In Adore,
      you can customize your game style according to the creatures you capture. Each
      of them has very different characteristics and abilities. Ranging from more
      fragile creatures, however, with high damage; slow and enduring or creatures
      with higher control abilities like stun and freezing.<br>On top of that there
      is the Synergy System, which allows for even more varied playstyles and powerful
      combos.<h2 class="bb_tag">CREATURE COLLECTING</h2><br>Keep your favorite creatures
      with you, level them up and create Bonds with them. But be careful, if they
      die, there is no comeback.<h2 class="bb_tag">CREATURE BOND</h2><br>Bonds are
      strong ties that grow between you and your creatures, creating new traits and
      making them unique.<h2 class="bb_tag">SYNERGY SYSTEM</h2><br>Your creature can
      earn synergies with other <strong>types</strong> of creatures. This means that
      it will activate a bonus or even change an ability when you are in control of
      that required type.<h2 class="bb_tag">SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2><br>Each creature
      also has a <strong>special ability</strong> that can be used when its energy
      bar is full. You have to decide when is the best moment to use the <strong>special
      ability</strong>, saving it for a situation where it would be more effective.<h2
      class="bb_tag">RANDOM GENERATION</h2><br>Each run is a <strong>new experience</strong>.
      The map, all creatures, items and affinities are all randomly generated. Encouraging
      the player to always adapt, explore, try new compositions and different combos.<h2
      class="bb_tag">COMBO SYSTEM</h2><br>Every time you break an enemy's defense,
      you can time attacks with different creatures to keep the enemy staggered.<h2
      class="bb_tag">STORY</h2><br>Draknar, the <strong>God of the creatures</strong>
      is losing his power. A curse is spreading and taking control of all his creatures.
      His last option is <strong>Lukha</strong>, an apprentice from one of the remaining
      villages of Adorers. Lukha, during his journey, discovers not only many secrets
      of the immense and mysterious world of Gaterdrik, but also, a conspiracy to
      kill Draknar.

    review: I remember reading about this game a while ago before it came out in early
      access. I just saw it now on sale and picked it up but to be honest. i wish
      i had paid full price. This game is AWESOME! Like many others have said, the
      art style is great, the game is very responsive to my quick movements and button
      presses and the way you tame, train and fight with the monsters is so much fun.
      The amount of combo attacks is great. You can even use the environment to set
      up traps with your monsters. The lighting snake is my favorite for this. I struggled
      at first but once you get the hang of things and learn the attacks and time
      things right, this game is just awesome. I highly recommend picking it up. I
      would like to see this game style get AAA backing. Thank you devs!!!
