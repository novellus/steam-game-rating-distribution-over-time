But once it became mostly completing the ink style block puzzles, I got bored. I kept hoping the next level would return to the point and click, hidden object style puzzles, but no, maybe after a few point and click steps out of the area, yet another block puzzle. And then another, and another. Too boring at that stage (early in the game), I never would've purchased a block puzzle game, ever. Very disappointing purchase.","timestamp_created":1607825891,"timestamp_updated":1607825891,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ464P5rPYCe9HXuQI="}
