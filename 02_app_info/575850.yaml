      \ />\r\nHire characters of unique classes, and wisely use their strengths, skills\
      \ and weapons to defeat enemies as you travel through the continent of Kaus\
      \ in the single-player survival campaign, or challenge other players in co-op\
      \ battles and multiplayer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClasses <br />\r\nClasses differentiate\
      \ themselves in terms of a variety of battle stats: from strength to magic power\
      \ and defense, movement capability such as walkable distance and jump height,\
      \ as well as frequency of action. Moreover, fighters of each class specialize\
      \ in the use of a weapon and its related techniques. The knight is your all-round\
      \ balanced warrior, the dwarf a front liner with great defense, the lionman\
      \ an unstoppable force of nature, and the list goes on with eight carefully\
      \ diversified unit types, each with their own strategic role in battle. <br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nWeapons <br />\r\nThere are many different weapon types: swords,\
      \ bows, axes, knives, and all have their characteristic attack patterns and\
      \ allow the execution of specific techniques. Axes can be used to break your\
      \ opponents armors, knives thrown to inflict status ailments, while hand combat\
      \ is good to move targets and open paths through your enemy's defense line.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMagic<br />\r\nAll magic skills belong to some element,\
      \ and different elements include skills that are quite different from each other\
      \ expecially in terms of range and area of effect. <br />\r\nWater skills can\
      \ hit multiple targets in wide patterns, and they can target only positions\
      \ lower than the caster; Earth skills always affect the positions around the\
      \ caster; Lightning skills can only strike single targets and have no height\
      \ limitation; Wind skills target multiple positions and have the widest range.\
      \ <br />\r\nIn addition, some elemental skills may cause some status ailments,\
      \ like Ice skills inducing Paralysis, or Lightning skills inducing Darkness.\
      \ <br />\r\nDifferent characters have higher or lower affinity with each element,\
      \ making them more or less vulnerable and able to deal more or less damage.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharacter customization <br />\r\nYou can develop your\
      \ characters by learning new skills and balancing their battle stats to suit\
      \ your strategy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame customization <br />\r\nBuild your\
      \ own maps with the in-game map editor and share them in the online gallery.\

    developer_response: Go fullscreen from Settings/Options. KBM support works, everybody
      uses it. If you want to give the game a negative review at least base it on
      facts or check with the developer instead of misleading other players.

    review: "Good soundtrack. Leveling system seems strange. No real story; Series\
      \ of dungeons and towns. <s>No fullscreen</s>. KBM support seems there, but\
      \ it doesn't work.\n\nAfter posting: \nDeveloper states there is fullscreen.\
      \ Went back and checked. Must have overlooked. \nKBM wonky so far. Will evaluate\
      \ further."
