Aside from Steam Achievements (currently profile limited), Steam version offers nothing else to the free version.[/b]\n\nA rare miss from [i]Nannings[/i], for me anyway. [i]Super Space Jump Man[/i] is an auto-runner, i.e. the astronaut runs automatically clock-wise the planets. Jumping gets him to next planet, and the next, until the finish worm hole.\n\nFirst, it was a little too easy, and I only got annoyed by the weird jumps (it's initially difficult to predict where you'll be landing). Game then introduces the usual spikes, sawblades and periodic lasers as traps. Half-way through, time limit is also introduced in the form of oxygen, postponed by collecting oxygen tanks.\n\n[h1]Annoying game mechanics[/h1]\n\nWhile the gameplay is fairly casual, I grew to resent the traps. Sometimes they are really well placed (kudos I guess) so that if you immediately jump to the planet, you'll get gloriously impaled.\n\nThe issue is that usually only the very next planet can be seen, and shortly after successfully jumping the next one becomes visible. So, unless you go around the planet to wait for the camera (an important choice once the time limit is added to the mix), each jump becomes a leap of faith. You might be accidentally jumping off the screen (bottom of which is death), or straight towards a nasty trap.\n\nThis makes the gameplay feel unfair. I can't plan for longer than half a second, and many a death feels like I could have avoided it if I had been able to see it sooner.\n\n[h1]Mediocre at best[/h1]\n\nUnfortunately, I did not enjoy this title much. My playthrough was about 35 minutes long.\n\nFree version is virtually identical to the paid version. Try that first. Only differences are some Steam features like cheevos (note that it's still profile limited) and Steam Cloud (a nice touch but superfluous for such a short game).\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9997062/]~Twistorian Curator~[/url]","timestamp_created":1595208709,"timestamp_updated":1595371406,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.638417422771453857","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq/jiufMCcNyxlgI="}
