Amazing right.  But still its got some issues and lacks complete polish.  Like one example is magic missile says no save but monsters were saving for no damage.  That really makes me mad.  Also I rolled a 44 on a necro and he got no bonus points on creation.  Like what what?? 20 years you shouldnt have errors like this.  Still though its pretty awesome.   Hard as balls too.  I made a all magic party with 2 priests at front that put extra stat life and I am having to fight things one at a time to win because monsters save on every spell.  So basically infinite save scumming allowed because unorthodox party with no fighters.  See if I can pull it off.  \n\n","timestamp_created":1609552187,"timestamp_updated":1609552187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpqzS4/YCdLHKvwI="}
