    review: 'Like the last.. "review" I have done I am not trying to say too much
      about the series so that way no spoilers are made.


      I really liked this series, and unlike a lot of others it does end in a nice
      way. Of course they set it up to possibly be continued but it is a nice ending
      if left where its at.


      While for me a lot of the story was predictable it was still a good one. I have
      no issues with recommending this anime to anyone and think a lot of people would
      find this one enjoyable.


      This is also one of the few anime where I did not actually hate any of the characters.
      One character in particular I kind of liked though she is a bit of a odd one.
      ( Not going to say who, but if you end up watching the series you will find
      out yourself.. Ya''know? )


      Now here is where I will give a warrning again about steam''s video player and
      crunchyroll. The video player needs work. Part of it is due to the fact that
      how things are handled by Valve and Crunchyroll and until some things are changed
      I feel it will probably always be a problem. On the bright side this anime is
      not censored at all. ( and there really is not a need for anything to be censored
      anyway. Gore or otherwise. )'
