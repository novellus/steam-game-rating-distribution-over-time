    review: As a proof of concept for an IT gaming course, this is decent enough,
      but apparently they're charging for it. The AI is non existent, jump over them
      and suckerpunch them in the back, all controls are with the keyboard, except
      the punch button was with the mouse. I only stuck around for the achievements,
      once I got the necessary kills/death/timeout and diamonds, I just hopped every
      enemy and eschewed interaction with most barrels for a quick speedrun past the
      20 levels.
