    about_the_game: The Lucd Client provides an immersive easy to use user experience
      that facilitates a collaborative approach to Visual Analytics (understanding
      data) and Exploratory Data Analysis (preparing and transforming data for analysis)
      and is the primary mechanism to accomplish these tasks with a secure interface
      into the Lucd Unified Data Space (UDS). The stunning 3D UI accesses the UDS
      remotely via a secure network connection (SSL/TLS).

      \ and Finance - Annuity and Investment</h2><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1126120/extras/Picture1_600.png?t=1592919940\"\
      \ /><br><br>Technology driven companies are emerging across all verticals. These\
      \ tech savvy organizations leverage dynamic, industry leading technology and\
      \ speed to market capabilities that can be a hinderance to traditional vertical\
      \ leaders. The insurance and \uFB01nancial markets are not immune to this pressure.\
      \ Large insurance and \uFB01nancial \uFB01rms are slow in many ways to pivot\
      \ and adopt such technology and strategies. While economic pressures, budgets\
      \ and cultural adoption challenges headline this resistance to change, the market\
      \ is pressing forward. Arti\uFB01cial Intelligence is a leading technology which\
      \ delivers new insights from traditionally ignored data points which can provide\
      \ demonstrable bene\uFB01t and transform the organization by delivering new\
      \ outcomes.<br><br>Lucd\u2019s JedAI Insurance and Finance solutions are able\
      \ to work along side traditional analytical and business intelligence tools\
      \ and fuse nontraditional data sources. Lucd JedAI is able to fuse data from\
      \ all sources regardless of data type including realtime data, imagery data,\
      \ NLP etc to run simulation models for risk and investment. The results allow\
      \ organizations to more e\uFB00ectively manage \uFB01nancial decisions and risk\
      \ assessment.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1126120/extras/Picture2_600.png?t=1592919940\"\
      \ /><br><br>As an example, Lucd JedAI lead a risk assessment project associated\
      \ with disaster. The responsible party needed to assess \uFB01nancial risk associated\
      \ with a tragic event to which compensation exposure hinged on evaluation of\
      \ dozens of data sources. These data sources included geospatial data, hand\
      \ written notes, temperature data, weather data, stored data, voice records\
      \ and many others. These data sources did not \uFB01t the traditional capabilities.\
      \ Lucd JedAI was able to provide a simulation model which assessed compensatory\
      \ exposure. This resulted in \uFB01nancial market stability and provided accurate\
      \ risk assessment.<br><br>In many ways, organizations are not fully prepared\
      \ for the impact of today's challenges. Insurers and \uFB01nancial \uFB01rms\
      \ are combating a new set of industry threats. Lucd JedAI is able arm insurance\
      \ and \uFB01nancial \uFB01rms with the tools and capabilities needed by leveraging\
      \ enterprise ready AI. Lucd JedAI delivers the most secure, governed and explainable\

      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Event Driven Simulation Modeling</h2><br>Events can drive\
      \ behavior.  Simulation models can leverage valuable data to model a discrete\
      \ sequence of events in time.  Whether it is pandemic response planning or preparedness\
      \ for the next disruption an organization may face, simulation models can provide\
      \ forward looking insights.  This can not only be done for response during an\
      \ event but also it can be used to address challenges post-event.  In the case\
      \ of hospitals and health organizations, what will the future hold?<br><br><strong>Hospitals\

      s AI simulation capabilities in relation to today\u2019s crisis, Lucd ingests\
      \ real-time COVID -19 data coupled with hospital patient information, bed counts,\
      \ fire department, police and ambulance information and more in order to look\
      \ forward and enable planning and preparedness.  As hospital organizations attempt\

      \ manage, staff and plan for the likely surge of elective surgeries as the current\
      \ crisis progresses.   This capability will reduce cost, maximize revenue and\
      \ mitigate risk as the new normal and its guidelines govern business practices.\
