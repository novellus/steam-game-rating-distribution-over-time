    review: '5/10

      I hope that wolf learns how to walk fast... Finding puzzles are the real pain
      here. I had to use a guide to finish the game. Kinda liked the story but it
      doesn''t worth to waste time. Puzzles were too childish at the beginning, but
      after ch3 they became boring. And if you miss a puzzle you have to play the
      whole game again, it is insane... I always like puzzle games but this one just
      was not my favorite.'
