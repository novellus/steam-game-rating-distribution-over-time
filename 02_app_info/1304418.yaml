    about_the_game: "The DB BR 182 is a locomotive which is capable of diverse duty,\
      \ irrespective of region or intended use, all while meeting the latest standards\
      \ of safety and technology of the time. Deutsche Bahn ordered 25 of these locomotives\
      \ for \u201Cuniversal\u201D work, giving them a fleet which they could operate\
      \ on both passenger and freight services in Germany and Austria. <br><br>Classified\
      \ as the DB BR 182, these locomotives have spent their lives filling in for\
      \ other traction wherever necessary, particularly on commuter networks which\
      \ were amidst fleet upgrades. The same is true on the Mitteldeutschland S-Bahn,\
      \ which was not receiving its order of DB BR 1442 units fast enough to replace\
      \ aging motive power, so the DB BR 182s were drafted into service with DoppelStock\
      \ vehicles for push/pull passenger operation.<br><br>The DB BR 182, along with\
      \ other \u201Cuniversal\u201D similar locomotives, are known for being some\
      \ of the fastest accelerating in the world. Not only that, but they are renowned\
      \ for a unique quirk in their traction motors: as one accelerates, the three-phase\
      \ motor sequence produces a finely tuned \u201CDo Re Mi\u201D melody, rising\
      \ up through 13 notes before settling into a more traditional sound set. In\
      \ addition, as typical braking uses the traction motors to slow down, the same\
      \ can be heard in reverse, stepping down gradually until the locomotive comes\

    review: "Habe mir die Lok gekauft, da ich eine wollte wo auch wirklich alles funktioniert.\
      \ Inzwischen fahre ich nur noch mit dem Ding auf fast allen Trecken. die Trans\
      \ Rapid Strecke hatte ich mir schon vor der Lok gekauft und somit gab es jetzt\
      \ von meiner Seite kein Gejammere wie bei anderen. Allerdings fahre ich kaum\
      \ auf dieser Strecke von Dessau glaube nach Magdeburg oder so. Die ganzen Strecken\
      \ um Hagen, Ruhr usw fahre ich mit der Lok und alles ist so weit wunderbar.\
      \ Der AFB Schalter ist \xFCbrigens links unter dem Pult, wer suchet der findet."
