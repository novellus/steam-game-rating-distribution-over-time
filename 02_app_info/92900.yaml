      \ farmer </strong>with all the necessary tasks like cattle breeding, growing\
      \ grain and other resources, and dealing with products from your farm. Your\
      \ fields can be cultivated with machines from CLAAS and even your animals have\
      \ to be taken care of. <br>The complete Agricultural Simulator allows you to\
      \ ride many genuine CLAAS tractors. Choose between many different models of\
      \ tractors, combines, extensions and hangers. Sell your products and invest\

    review: 'Edited:  Originally, I had given this a positive review as I was enjoying
      the game.  The issues I saw were mainly equipment tumbling in the garage when
      the garage door was opened.   You ignore it and it will correct itself when
      the garage door closes.   There was also a noticeable delay in the game starting
      after launch.  Just wait, it will start (at least it did for me). There were
      physic issues where a tractor or combine would occasionally fall apart piece
      by piece and float into the air, which seemed to happen at the edge of fields
      or a bump.    In spite of these issues, I just saved often and continued on.


      I figured out how to generate the most money to help me quickly buy more land,
      upgrade buildings, as well as equipment purchases and upgrades.   I also started
      to hire farmhands as I grew in size.


      I later discovered that if you play for awhile without saving, the game will
      lockup and crash.   Therefore, I am reminded to save the game often.   So far,
      seemed OK with the saving often work around, but,  i started having major issues
      after I had purchased the third farm.  The game did not seem to be able to handle
      such a large operation.  It started to crash shortly after I started to do some
      farming activity.    I don''t know if the game intended for me to sell off the
      earlier farms as I progressed to bigger farms.   I was trying to run all three
      farms at the same time with two farmhands operating at each one.  Apparently,
      it was too much for the game to handle.  I had also noticed that the game will
      lock up if you try to use equipment bought for one farm to do something on another.   For
      example, I was hauling a trailer of barely from one farm to the silos of the
      other...CRASH.  Therefore, it''s reasonable to assume that each farm is independent
      of the other.


      I got this game in a simulations bundle and should be the only way you end up
      with the game in your library.   There are probably less buggy farm games out
      there so I do NOT recommend this game as an outright purchase.'
