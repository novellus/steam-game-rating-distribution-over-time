    about_the_game: "The subterranean mining city of Bravst is vast. It has flourished\
      \ under the rule of its authoritarian governing body known as The Order. The\
      \ Order has fostered an industrial and scientific revolution by harvesting a\
      \ powerful resource from oil rich mushrooms which grow deep underground. Dietrich,\
      \ an engineer, is trapped in a long-abandoned district of the city after a freak\
      \ accident. Completely alone with only intermittent contact with the city via\
      \ radio, he must traverse the ruins to escape. As he navigates the dark tunnels\
      \ and abandoned dwellings he discovers clues leading to a revelation as to why\
      \ this area of the mines was condemned. Now, time is against him as the rulers\
      \ of Bravst hope to keep their secrets locked away in the depths of the mines.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Luminist is a single-player third-person shooter in which\
      \ the player, armed with makeshift light-based tools and projectile weapons,\
      \ must repel swarms of cave-dwelling monsters in an effort to escape the treacherous\
      \ mines. In addition to the main story there is also a \u2018Horde\u2019 game\
      \ mode where the player can hone their skills defending against endless waves\
      \ of monsters."
