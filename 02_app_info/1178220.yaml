      \ /><br>Take command of one of the continents of the world and prepare yourself\
      \ for global nuclear conflict. It is your job to ensure the complete and total\
      \ destruction of your enemies, while you do all in your power to prevent enemy\
      \ retaliation against your peace-loving citizens.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1178220/extras/ICBM-ifyouwantpeace.jpg?t=1607612904\"\
      \ /><br>Research and develop your nuclear arsenal. Will you focus on developing\
      \ new technologies, or mass producing existing ones? It takes a true strategist\
      \ to research and build a balanced force that can deal with a multitude of enemy\
      \ tactics.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1178220/extras/ICBM-manyroadstovictory.jpg?t=1607612904\"\
      \ /><br>In ICBM, you can try out different strategies every time you play. Will\
      \ you overwhelm your enemy with intercontinental ballistic missiles? Use bombers\
      \ to deliver massive payloads? Or maybe use submarines to deliver nukes from\
      \ the least expected locations? These strategies and more can all be used to\
      \ ensure victory. ICBM has 20 unit types and 12 nuclear weapon types to use,\
      \ plus 44 technologies to explore.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1178220/extras/ICBM-adjustthegamespeed.jpg?t=1607612904\"\
      \ /><br>Take the time to carefully plan your next move, or just nuke your opponents\
      \ as fast as you can. Increase the contamination speed for a swift and painless\
      \ nuclear war, or slow it down for an endless nightmare. In ICBM, you can constantly\
      \ adjust the game speed to your own pace.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1178220/extras/ICBM-forgealliances.jpg?t=1607612904\"\
      \ /><br>Use diplomacy to gain strategic advantages. Share information, technologies\
      \ or even the location of your nukes with your allies to wage war against common\
      \ enemies. Be aware however that these alliances do not have to last and you\
      \ might find yourself fending off attacks by your former friends. <br><br><img\
