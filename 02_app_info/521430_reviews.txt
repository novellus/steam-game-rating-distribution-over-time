The core idea of the game is fine, but the implementation is poor.\nThe developer recommends using an XBOX controller, but the right trigger of my XBOX controller (which is the default for switching between worlds) was not recognized. I had to rebind the right trigger to SPACE in order to get it to work. But the main issue with this game is that you cannot reliably do walljumps, so I got  frustrated at the first level where you have to use long series of walljumps to climb up between walls full of saw blades - I kept falling off the wall.","timestamp_created":1608249275,"timestamp_updated":1608249275,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p47IufYCeOqHuwI="}
