The game is really bad. And I don’t know if this is made to be walking simulator or survival horror but it fails to be any of that. Or even as the combination of both. \n\nDon’t even get me started on bugs and glitches. I haven’t seen this much since The Force Unleashed 2! And that's saying something because that game was almost unplayable at the time. Hell, enemy AI in this game is stuck running in place! Or he will run randomly all around the place and hit the wall or a tree and get stuck, you guess it, RUNNING IN PLACE! Oh, and trust me, that’s not even the half of it. Textures break, objects disappear... I mean, I can go on and on, but I think you get the point.\n\nUgh, and as a conclusion, I can only say that this game is total mess. Such a mess that I wouldn't even recommend it if it was free to play. Don’t waste your time.","timestamp_created":1549486348,"timestamp_updated":1599336464,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.603542327880859375","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6Lf4r/QCfImYugE="}
