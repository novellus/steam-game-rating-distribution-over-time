In fact, it's actually a novel idea. You're a corpse that spins around slowly, you're orbiting a sun, and asteroids are flying all over the place, so you have to time your jetpack burns to dodge asteroids and collect points. Also, you can give your astronaut a different looking skull, which does stuff like making you spin faster, giving you a shield, making the screen purple, etc. If you played Hotline Miami you know what I'm talking about.\n\nHowever, the gameplay itself is bare-[b]bones[/b]. Look at how long I've played this game. A couple minutes. Look at all the other reviews - how long have they played it? A few more minutes than I did. This would be fine if it were a free flash game or mobile game or Steam game; it's a 0$ game on steam. It's fine.\n\nIf you think that 0$ is worth about 10 minutes of gameplay, then go ahead and pick it up, if you don't then don't get this game.","timestamp_created":1522108334,"timestamp_updated":1606440895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.725726187229156494","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4odjVg/YCfprXnAE="}
