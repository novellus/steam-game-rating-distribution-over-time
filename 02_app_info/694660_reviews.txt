This was due to it's lack of content. However, I decided to try it because I like shooting zombies. \n\nPros:\n\nSmooth gameplay (no lag)\nIncreasing difficulty\nGuns and ammo\nThe moment when you realize you have to eject the mag. insert a new one and pull the slide to engage the first round\n\nCons: \nLack of content \nmenu glitch (cannot interact with it; sometimes)\n\nLike all new games they have little to offer in the beginning. However, if this game gets enough funding, I can see it being a very great and well developed game.","timestamp_created":1539448265,"timestamp_updated":1539809701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1540086222,"developer_response":"There is a lot going on behind the scenes. I also am working on 7 other projects. I switched back to End of Days being the main project so I have been pumping out work for it. My youtube channel has videos of what I've been doing and things you can expect to see in game. I will be recording another video today.\n\nA lot needs to be done still, but here is a casual live stream I did to show off version 0.2.0 https://youtu.be/HULvui_DvNg"}],"cursor":"AoJ4yO3zweYCc6nPrAE="}
