    review: An interesting kinetic novel, centered around a heavenly scribe who cannot
      seem to fulfill the full measure of the calamities he is ordered to undertake.
      And thus he is banished to the mortal realm to atone. But is his true place
      in the mortal realm, and not the heavens?
