And let's just say that it did not disappoint. Here is my opinion to the game as a whole. Its pretty much a mobile game on desktop. Or rather...ita a 3D version of the original world's hardest game...but in a simpler sense.\n\nThe game graphics were very nice and the challenge was definitely there. After nearly 2 hours I have nlt even beaten 3 levels. But depending on if my viewers give me my like goal....I may have to finish the game lol.\n\nIt looks as if I am going to have to finish the grueling game in due time. I just hope that the many swears that are going to come out of my mouth don't get me kicked out of the house....\n\nHere is the first video of this game in my channel. Who knows if I will make a second üòè\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rTsiaRAYrlc","timestamp_created":1595663355,"timestamp_updated":1595663355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x9G8wvMCevO1lwI="}
