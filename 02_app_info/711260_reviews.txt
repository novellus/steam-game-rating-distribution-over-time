The game was created by only one person which is super impressive. Usually when this is the case a game like this would turn out to be lacking but this game is actually really fun.\nImmediately the most impressive element of this game is the graphical presentation, its very realistic and textured well. Another thing I love is the design of the main character you play as the biohazard bot himself has a charm similar to beloved characters like Wall-E, Johnny 5, and R2D2. The game has great platforming and exploration and I love the new weapons you get while trying to make it to the end. The sound design is really cool too. Very atmospheric and immerses you into the game. Brilliant use of lighting also. Better than most major titles coming out today. Excited to see what this devloper does next. Would love to see more enemy designs in the next installment. I almost forgot to mention the physics are off the chain.\n15 bucks is a steal for this fun platformer. I also love the ability to rotate the camera despite the game being a sidescroller.\nWould absolutely reccomend.","timestamp_created":1510793818,"timestamp_updated":1510793925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.613225698471069336","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mLqV4d8Cc+uyiwE="}
