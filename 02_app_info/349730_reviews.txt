They have successfully gamified content creation.  You can start you climb up the wizards tower with any of the heroes in the box, but soon, you'll start thinking to yourself that certain powers would be more fun if they worked 'this' way, or you might be inspired by something you see in a level to give you your own idea for a monster, character or item.\n\nPretty soon, you'll discover that you're climbing the tower with a team of your own construction, with all unique powers you designed yourself.  And then you'll get your ass kicked.  You'll think, oh,  did I design this power poorly, or did I play it poorly?
