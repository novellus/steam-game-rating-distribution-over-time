    review: '[DISCLAIMER: I originally wrote this before all towers had been released,
      and I had only one medal in the new towers at the time.  All towers are now
      available, and now I have two medals, and my opinion has not changed much so
      far.  I still haven''t played all the way through everything, but again, it
      can take months to do that in this game, and I''d rather this preliminary report
      be available to anyone who''s on the fence.]


      With that out of the way, my suggestion is to read up through to the heading
      that most closely applies to you:


      [h1]"I don''t want any spoilers at all; I like discovering things on my own,
      and I accept the risk that I may end up not liking it.  I just want to know,
      did they [i]obviously[/i] put less effort into the DLC than the rest of the
      game?"[/h1]


      If you''ve already played the base game long enough that you feel comfortable
      saying that you will still be playing it months from now, then I don''t think
      you''re going to be disappointed by the DLC.


      [h1]"I don''t want spoilers on the new content, but I do have some basic expectations
      for what the DLC is or should be, and I just want to know if those expectations
      are met or not."[/h1]


      First off, although the new towers are available for selection as soon as you
      install the DLC, I wouldn''t get the DLC under the expectation that you could
      just play them from the very beginning.  The new towers are hard, building on
      concepts you learn in the first twelve towers.  A couple of them put you up
      against rough opponents right at the start, too, and it might help you to arrive
      with some medals already in hand so you can give yourself some breathing room
      to try different options.  It''s better to think of the new towers as "end-game
      content" rather than simply "additional content".


      Also, because of this, you probably shouldn''t get the DLC purely on the premise
      that getting extra medals will help make the first twelve towers easier.  The
      new towers do provide you with more options for how to progress, but getting
      low-tier medals in the new towers is going to be just as difficult, or maybe
      more difficult, than earning high-tier medals in the earlier towers.  This isn''t
      really the kind of game that''s designed to allow you to "cheat" your way out
      of coming to a deeper understanding of how the towers work; all the DLC does
      is provide new milestones for you to reach.


      As long as you keep all this in mind, though, the DLC does feel like a natural
      extension of the main game.  Just like the main game, it continues to use tools
      introduced in earlier towers while still adding new tools of its own.  Also
      like the main game, each tower has a central gimmick, a specific idea it plays
      with that requires you to approach the game from a new angle.


      [h1]"I want SOME spoilers.  Describe some of the new content to me so I can
      know what I''m getting into."[/h1]


      It goes against my principles to provide [i]full[/i] spoilers, but I can give
      you some generalizations.  If you''ve been reading the developer''s updates,
      you already know that the new towers continue to use weapons and accessories
      like the ones in towers 11 and 12.  You see some existing favorites making frequent
      returns, but they also throw in some new ideas that I think are very interesting--for
      example, [spoiler]weapons that [i]punish[/i] you for using them[/spoiler].  The
      presence of equipment greatly increases the complexity of choices you can make,
      sometimes changing your entire approach depending on what you pick up.


      I mentioned that there continues to be a central theme for each tower, so here
      they are, if you''re curious:


      Tower 13: The central theme here is that the DLC has new weapons and accessories,
      and the developers want you to know about them.  Expect to make use of equipment
      early and often as you progress through the tower.


      Tower 14: [spoiler]You''re probably already familiar with the fact that Life
      Crowns can get your HP multiplier above 100%.  However, did you know your multiplier
      can go LOWER than 100%?[/spoiler]


      Tower 15: [spoiler]I think the idea behind this one is that you have access
      to certain powerful resources from the beginning, but you receive better rewards
      the longer you hold off on using them.  It''s basically the marshmallow test,
      but with Continental Potions.[/spoiler]


      Tower 16: [spoiler]I think this one just provides a healthy balance of all the
      concepts that have been introduced up to this point in time.  It feels like
      the most "normal" of the towers.[/spoiler]


      Tower 17: [spoiler]There aren''t many enemies, but the ones that do exist are
      extremely powerful, and you can''t return to lower floors once you go upstairs.  Do
      you use your keys now, or hold onto them for later?[/spoiler]'
