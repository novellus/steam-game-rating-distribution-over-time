    reviews: "\u201CI guess what I'm saying is I really like Meow Wars, because I\
      \ like cats, card games, and multiplayer.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Board+Game/Meow+Wars/review.asp?c=78339&amp;srch=meow+wars\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Pocket Gamer</a><br><br>\u201CMy philosophy\
      \ is simple: Add cats to anything to instantly make that thing better. Card\
      \ battlers are super popular right now and there\u2019s no shortage of them\
      \ on the App Store, but wouldn\u2019t they be SO much better if they were filled\
      \ with cats? Don\u2019t answer that, it was a rhetorical question, the answer\
      \ is obviously yes.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2018/06/04/meow-wars-beta-testing\"\

      \ Wars also doesn\u2019t require pre-game deck building, which makes it a purrfect\
      \ game to play when you\u2019re busy, have a cat in your lap but desperately\
      \ need to pee, or with friends at a cat-lovers gathering. (It has a Versus mode!)\u201D\

    review: I'm feline good about this game, too bad I didn't cat-ch it when it cameowt
      because the multiplayer is dead as a dead bird now, and it certainly does not
      have a meowsive single player catpaign. The comcat mecatnic is a breath of fresh
      air in a hair-filled room of clones, and I would have liked to see it explored
      fur-ther.
