    review: "At best a mediocre platformer that suffers from many programming bugs...\
      \ The gameplay is too linear and simple, completely based on hand-eye coordination.\
      \ The enemies are predictable with varying speed of walking that only needs\
      \ the player to use their eyes and intuition to progress however as i mentioned\
      \ earlier the bugs will eventually make the gameplay utterly frustrating. \n\
      \n1. Two objects next to each other have 'dead zone', so if you need to make\
      \ a jump from platform to platform as you stand on multiple boxes, you will\
      \ not be able to make the jump and simply fall and die. This is a very frustrating\
      \ programming issue and you will encounter this countless times as you progress.\n\
      \n2. Your reactions are often faster than the programming of the game allows\
      \ for. Therefore you will not be able to make jumps and simply fall off the\
      \ map and die. This once again is a repeated issue throughout the game.. Simply\
      \ infuriating!\n\n3. Once you climb a ladder and an enemy is approaching you\
      \ will not be able to jump standing directly on 'top' of it and may get killed.\
      \ What you need to do is move a little in the opposite direction from the enemy.\
      \ However if there is a cactus behind them, you will not be able to clear the\
      \ jump and will take damage ( - 1 life) or die and have to restart a level.\n\
      \n4. The 'life' drops in crates are rare in each level and may be down to as\
      \ little as one per level so breaking all boxes and barrels once you got all\
      \ the achievements associated with those simply takes unnecessary time away\
      \ and does not produce the drops that you require.\n\n5. Controls are set and\
      \ even when you change them in 'input' section of the menu, they don't change.\
      \ I tried re-loading and re-installing the game several times and changing both\
      \ primary and secondary control inputs, but it didn't make any difference so\
      \ thats a big minus in my book...\n\n6. The levels are generic and don't introduce\
      \ any new challanges to the player, so the game becomes 'interesting' only to\
      \ those who like to get all the achievements. As a gameplay goes it quickly\
      \ becomes boring and frustrating because of it's countless and glaring programming\
      \ shortcomings..\n\nUnity engine is very powerful and has the ability to deliver\
      \ superb results, envolving and adaptable gameplay and customizable controls.\
      \ However this developer chose an easy route and brought out a very simple and\
      \ mediocre title.\n\nI have played a much more interesting and progressive title\
      \ back in 1989 - 'Prince of Persia'. using an old DOS operating system, so almost\
      \ 20 years later using Unity engine, I as a gamer expect much more from the\
      \ developer..\n\nOne redeeming feature of this title - if one can even call\
      \ it that, is the price and if you are after another 'perfect game' count on\
      \ your account, it's a cheap investement and will deliver exactly that, however\
      \ if you are after something envolving and progressive - look elsewhere..\n\n\
      WARNING: After getting all the achievements the game will not be counted in\
      \ your 'perfect game' counter!"
