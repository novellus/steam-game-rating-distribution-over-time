      \ /><br>Endurium is a VR arcade style defense game designed to test your reflexes\
      \ as you progress from light cardio to light-speed combat against wave after\
      \ wave of beam drones and plasma blade wielding bots.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>\u2022\
      Focused on freeform combat</strong></h2>Like a rhythm game, but without the\
      \ rhythm. Instead, pace fluctuates randomly moment to moment and you are free\
      \ to destroy most beams with whichever hand you'd like. The goal is not only\
      \ to survive against incoming beams, but also to return fire when the opportunity\
      \ strikes and take out the drones that fire those beams! Deflect blaster bolts\
      \ and engage in fierce melee combat!<br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1236620/extras/combat.gif?t=1606005737\"\

      \ you progress that you can spend to increase your stats. Increase the number\
      \ of hits you can take, the length of your blades, the damage caused by your\
      \ energy waves, or even the time-dilation that occurs when you take damage.\
      \ Earn credits even on a loss, so there's never a reason to go back in difficulty\
      \ - continue to push yourself and face ever intensifying challenge! Additionally,\

      \ temporarily slow time? Gain the ability to throw your swords, or switch one\
      \ out for a blaster! Equip an auto-targeting system to help destroy beam drones,\

    review: Another great lightsaber game for the VR collection. The game gives you
      plenty of levels to understand the fundamentals of the game but I really enjoyed
      the endless mode, as it allows you to customize the amount of bots as well as
      the types of *beams?* that come at you. on the higher difficulties, with the
      8 max bots, it really does become an intense exercise. You've really gotta challenge
      that inner Obi-wan Kenobi. As a lightsaber game, its on par with Beat Saber
      and modded Blade and Sorcery. Definitely worth a pick up.
