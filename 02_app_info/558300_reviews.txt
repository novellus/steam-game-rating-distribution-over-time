Not because they're not good. In fact, they have a pair of very useful bonuses (extra speed on both tactical and strategic maps + extra effectiveness on Ocean planets) with zero downsides in terms of racial traits. But that's just it: they're boring. EXTREMELY boring.\n\nHow one can make Cthulu-esque fish people boring is kind of amazing actually. They simply need some extra traits that make them genuinely unique. For example, make their beacons act as warp gates, so they can warp around the map ignoring starlanes really early and even into neutral/enemy territory, but have them cost 1 BC per turn instead of zero. Have extra effects for all Trilarian workers when in any \"aquatic\" biome (Swamp, Terran, Ocean, or Gaia) but have major penalties when in any non aquatic biome (Volcanic, Desert, Barren, Arid et cetera), thus incentivizing terraforming into aquatic biomes. Let them gain immunity from space monsters . . . something. \n\nAs it is, you'll probably get them anyway if you pick up the 3-pack on extra races, which is recommended. But if you're thinking of picking them up individually,don't. They're just . . . lame.","timestamp_created":1530217856,"timestamp_updated":1530217856,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513189554214477539","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwO+FpOQCcOXHpAE="}
