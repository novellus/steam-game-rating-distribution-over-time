That's exactly what you want from a puzzle game: challenge and innovation. \n\nThis is *the* game that utilizes time-manipulation mechanics to their fullest, while others can only do time re-wind.\n\nEven the art style is spectacular.\n\nThe \"Hidden Content\", as well as the story underlying it all, which you don't really get from the get go, blows your mind.","timestamp_created":1439908060,"timestamp_updated":1609985052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1sml7fYCcKKRQw=="}
