But this is just frustrating, can't say it's thrully hard but just bad development.\n\nIn a point enemies are too huge and has really long attacks and you can dodge one attack but not the other 3 attacks on the screen. So the best strategy is to shut your brain down and just spamm attacks while sliding throught the floor eventually you kill everything.\n\nBut if you waste time dodging and such you end up being knocked back and waste time while you take more and more damage.\n\nThe space you have to move is extremelly small in comparation of the size of the enemies and their attacks, so again you better just swalking forward spamming attacks and hopefully the enemy will die before you. game doesn't seem to reward skill at dodging or \"cutting rockets\" what's the point of cutting rockets if oyu gonna get hit by a massive flamethrower anyways?\n\nBut then some bosses can be beaten buy just crouching in a corner spamming attacks nonstop.\n\nCouldn't complete this game was really boring and braindead.","timestamp_created":1590435167,"timestamp_updated":1590435167,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52070009708404541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sdfUpvICduigigI="}
