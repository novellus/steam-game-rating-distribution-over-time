I would call it a visual novel, except that there are no choices to be made - it is simply a story that you are told in the form of a .exe application. I guess this wouldn't be so bad if the story itself held up, but that also falls on its face. While intriguing, the storyline suffers from problems such as pacing (it sometimes jumps from one direction to another in a bit of jarring fashion, while other less-important segments will drag on for some reason), or lazy plot devices (such as the ending... no part of it in particular, really; I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, but the whole ending was some of the laziest writing I've experienced). Also, the story is a short one - you can get through the entire thing in 20-30 minutes or so, assuming that you're actually reading everything.\n\nAside from the story, the application itself wasn't the best either. With no way to fullscreen the app (that I could see, anyways), you're left to view everything in a window that is about 1/3 of the display. Alt+Enter also didn't work. The images that accompany the story were decent, however, I felt that the images didn't change frequently enough to keep up with what the text was trying to convey. Sometimes, the story will deviate from the scene that is currently presented to you on  screen, lessening the effectiveness and impact of what the text is actually saying. The sound is fine overall; the only real criticism I have in that respect was the sudden and abrupt stops to the audio that would follow a scene transition. It probably would have been a better choice to at least fade out/fade in the audio at those points, or even crossfade the two sections of audio together during the transition, rather than the abrupt ending of the audio followed by a couple seconds of silence.\n\nUltimately, SLG Remix isn't worth what is being asked for it. 3 dollars? No way. It seems more like a class project that someone made and decided to charge money for. If you really must add this to your collection, wait for it to go on sale for 50 cents or something.","timestamp_created":1604410185,"timestamp_updated":1604410185,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469798654317855835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40pKTx/UCfvyDrAI="}
