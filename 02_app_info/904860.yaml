    short_description: The dead city of Time Beach, in the American state of Misuri,
      generates a sense of fear and loneliness. This city and its districts are completely
      cut off from the real world. The main character is Caleb Ridus, having got there
      for not understandable reasons, it is necessary to understand what happened
      in this city.

    review: "ich bin selten angepisst oder habe kein verst\xE4ndnis, aber dieses game\
      \ ist einfach schmutz. erstes szenario ist so bombe. unreal engine wird im schlafzimmer\
      \ noch voll zur geltung gebracht. es ist so sch\xF6n anzusehen und dann kommt\
      \ die n\xE4chste szene und ich wackel mit 20 fps durch einen dunklen raum der\
      \ mal absolut garnichts mehr mit dem flaire des ersten szenarios gemein hat.\
      \ \xFCber 3 jahre habe ich nun gewartet ob sich an dem gameplay noch etwas \xE4\
      ndert (nach EA wohl gemerkt). \n\nes ist genau so unstabil und dreckig wie zur\
      \ zeit vor der ver\xF6ffentlichung der EA version. also ganz im ernst, wer in\
      \ einem halbdunklen raum  ohne animationen mit 12x5,2 ghz, ner gtx 1080 ti,\
      \ ssd und 32 gig ram mit 20 fps durch die gegend d\xFCmpeln muss ist einfach\
      \ lost. spielspa\xDF war f\xFCr mich sofort im eimer. ich habe so lange gewartet\
      \ und die performance ist immer noch dreck. sry, sowas bringt man nicht raus,\
      \ oder man behebt es. zudem sieht die grafik (ausser im schlafzimmer am anfang)\
      \ nicht ansatzweise so geil aus wie in den gezeigten bildern und videos. dieses\
      \ game verdient es nicht gekauft zu werden da den entwicklern anscheinend die\
      \ lust auf nachbesserung vergangen ist und es den eindruck macht das alles daran\
      \ getan wurde um es schnell zu verkaufen und gut aussehen zu lassen. finger\
      \ weg leute"
