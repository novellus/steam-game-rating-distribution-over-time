The storyline is nonlinear and there are tons of path to choose from. What is fun is that any action you take can change the whole adventure. The difficulty is quite balanced, hard but fair. Iâ€™d recommend this game to anyone who likes challenging RPGs and rich stories.","timestamp_created":1574871325,"timestamp_updated":1574871325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.608912646770477295","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4lKvp1u4CdYSO3gE="}
