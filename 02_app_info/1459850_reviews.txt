Then I was really surprised as I saw this was done by one person only! (Pls upvote if you also recognized that).\n\nTo the game; seeing that there are already base dialogs, base locations, and aims to provide a real-world experience I can see there is a huge potential for its future. Yes, the dialogs and words are a bit off, but I'm personally ok with that since this is an early access version, and also the game author mentioned it.\n\nLooking forward to seeing your next steps man!
