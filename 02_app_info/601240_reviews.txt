After that I didn't played for months. But eventually I got back to it and played it (a little bit) like addicted. My mind didn't let it pass, that I couldn't master the ripple. And I knew, there must be a proper solution to evry level. \nSo I worked hard with try and error until I had a solution for nearly all levels up to 30 and the easier levels above.\nwhat a relief after I finally saw the solution to level 22 reaching nearer!!\nTo not get crazy I made most of the remaining  levels with the \"to cast adrift\" technique.\n\n\nI think despite its simple mechanic this is a really complex game!\nit gives a good mixture of try and error, logic thinking, and following the intuition.\nAlso I learned something about myself, (that I often do the same \"mistakes\"). \nIt was a great experience, liked it much!","timestamp_created":1568736488,"timestamp_updated":1568736488,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpOX+n+0Cfuyz0gE="}
