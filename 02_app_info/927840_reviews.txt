They had the nerve to respond to my last review, still below, talking to me like I was a moron who didn't understand game intros. THE CONTROLS DON'T WORK AFTER THE INTRO!!! THIS is my problem. If you think I want anything to do with these assholes again, think again. You shouldn't either. The fact they made such a stupid assumption is proof of how useless this development team, publisher, and game really is, DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP FROM THESE CRAPPY PEOPLE! Make their crappy little half-assed game studio go under, maybe that will humble them.\n\nI tried to play this game, had no idea what was going on, controls wouldn't work, and it was just annoying, I thought it would be fun visually, instead it is an uncomfortable train wreck. Basically a piece of trash so far. I only bought it because it was really cheap, and now I would rather have the dollar back than this crap on my steam library.\n\nPS. Piss on steam for allowing developers \"respond\" to my reivews despite having comments turned off. I guess I will stop using Steam for reviews, since it only benefits them. I will start putting them on my own damn site where I actually get what I am supposed to, NO SPAM!","timestamp_created":1605110576,"timestamp_updated":1605276621,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47985348105430603","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1605202825,"developer_response":"you use keyboard and mouse or xbox gamepad to play this game after the intro"}],"cursor":"AoJ4jKv84PUCccPirQI="}
