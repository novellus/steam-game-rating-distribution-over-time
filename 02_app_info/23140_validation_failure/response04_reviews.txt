The puzzle part is solid, but the definition of words is something else entirely. There were times I had no idea what the word was supposed to be. And no, that's not because I'm an idiot, because I am, but it's because the word had absolutely nothing to do with the definition, or vice versa. It could be because the game started in Dutch instead of English (a first for me really, normally ALL my games start in English), or maybe something else, I don't know. Other than that, it is a good puzzle game so I am recommending it to at least the puzzle-loving gamers.\n\n[Rating: 71/100]","timestamp_created":1316716369,"timestamp_updated":1402225447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533146560192108154","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hcrJvcYCe4yMAw=="}
