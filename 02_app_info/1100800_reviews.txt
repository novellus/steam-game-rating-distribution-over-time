Now to work on vol.3 :/)\nNot a bad continuation of the story. The plot thickens, as they say.\n\nMy personal opinion is that I kinda feel bad for Mitsuki because she is barely a part of the story anymore, and we really only get to see and hear her feelings in the additional scenes. Although we are introduced to Makimura, the doctor of the surviving group. She is extremely endearing when we get to know her more and she overcomes her past issues. At first I did not like this direction of replacing Mitsuki with Makimura, but now, after finishing it and reading Mitsuki's additional scenes, I know they aren't going to be dropping our OG heroine. I just cannot wait to see how they have the two women interact together.([i]Let's go harem route because I have not forgotten about sweet Tokiko![/i]) \n\nEverything about the graphics and sound of this continuation is on par with it's predecessor. Nothing really changes except we get a tiny, mini split in the story. I'm pretty sure that it was just fanservice though, which I obviously chose the first time around because I would not have been able to leave Tokiko behind. :/\nI am not sure if they are gonna expand on this in the coming volumes. I can see it happening though. It happens in every decent VN, more than one heroine/love interest means more than one ending. I forsee the series having more choices down the line.\n\nThe story... I really hate that they decided to do this series in volumes like this. It does feel more like I am really a light novel series because I do not get everything in one go like other VNs. It is sorta frustrating because I really want to follow this story. The H-scenes are just a bonus at this point. We have the intelligent zombies, a possible rebellion at the safe haven, and someone other than our protagonist might be able to walk among the dead. I just want to know. Let us just hope that volume three does not take another eight months to get to us.\n\nOverall I had a good time with this addition. My only true complaint would be the length. When you compare to other VNs that have trilogies or just more than one entry, I Walk Among Zombies feels [b]painfully[/b] short. Just take Grisaia into consideration. Each entry has an immense amount of read time([i]I got mine from denpasoft since steam wasn't doing eroge back then[/i]). I probably spent well over 100 hours reading the whole trilogy. Just the two volumes of Zombies took me almost 15 hours. I feel like they could have just waited until the novel this VN is based of off was finished and then made one entire game from it that took maybe 30-40 hours to complete. That is my only real complaint though, so props to Seacoxx for making a very enjoyable, if not short, VN.","timestamp_created":1610029320,"timestamp_updated":1610029374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo9PO7vYCfqekwQI="}
