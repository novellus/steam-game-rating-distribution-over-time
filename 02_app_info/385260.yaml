    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Abstract</h2><br>Lamia must die! was a contest
      entry done for Encounters of Boss Kind. Since it actually placed 3rd of 28 entries
      (going for a tie with Demon Slayer Z), I went ahead and improved the game with
      improved graphics and more depth involving battle system before release to general
      public. It has an opening, the fight against Lamia herself and then the ending
      which is afflicted by which of the heroes survive. If all four heroes survive,
      there's a special ending. The battle can be somewhat tricky and requires use
      of strategy. The difficulty is medium-hard to hard, depending on how familiar
      with RPG mechanics you are.<h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2><br>A horrible monster
      has been terrorizing the local town for years, doing terrible, unspeakable things
      to the citizen. One day, a paladin leads several other heroes towards the cave
      where the monster lies in, them being the final hope for the town of Clearmill
      and to save it from total devastation.<h2 class="bb_tag">Characters </h2><br>You
      have a party of four characters, with the ability to choose between two paladins,
      a mage and archer. You also have Bishop and Rogue who join your party in your
      quest to defeat Lamia.<br><br><strong>Eric </strong><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/385260/extras/Eric.png?t=1591303374"
