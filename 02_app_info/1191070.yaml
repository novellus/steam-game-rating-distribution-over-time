    review: This is a great survival horror game. Very PS1 era graphics with modern
      controls. It takes place in an old Japanese hotel, with lots of dark rooms to
      explore and items to collect. If you played Aka Manto, this is way better in
      my opinion as Yuki doesn't show up every 5 seconds (as well as more accessible
      hiding places) and the map doesn't feel as claustrophobic. This game is a steal
      at 5 bucks. It even has two different ending, think you can get them both?
