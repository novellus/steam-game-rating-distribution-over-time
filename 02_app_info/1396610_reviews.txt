Realistically Do It With Hay has at most 15 minutes of content, thickened with the bale stacking and having to do some DIY platforming for one achievement. Nice visuals just don't make up for the wonky physics though, stacking the bales goes fine right up until you try to jump or bunny hop onto them, then both they and you go flying and you must start over...provided the timer hasn't run out, again. Pitchforks serve no purpose other than to poke the truck driver when he falls asleep, so trying to reach the stacking objectives while managing your stamina meter becomes ridiculously hectic.\n\nBought this in the Pickle Drugs bundle for just under $4.50 with 5 other titles and am refunding it, that should say it all lol","timestamp_created":1609681882,"timestamp_updated":1609681882,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.606828510761260986","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuYmh5PYCdb6JwAI="}
