      \ already available on the market, from grand adventures to smaller, more casual\
      \ moments. It is nice to come across an experience that puts more focus on the\
      \ relaxation applications of VR over action packed titles. This is where Zen\
      \ Space Flight \u2013 VR Showcase comes in as it offers a unique way to relax\

    review: "[h1]Experienced on Windows Mixed Reality[/h1]\n\nYou can view my gameplay\
      \ & review here: https://youtu.be/s9rtxvZjQKM\n\nThis isn't a bad VR music visualizer.\
      \ There's just better ones (even some free ones). I would have recommended this\
      \ game / app, but one of the major listed features on the store page no longer\
      \ works. YouTube music integration doesn't work and hasn't worked for quite\
      \ a while with no response from the dev. As such, I can't in good conscience\
      \ recommend this game. \n\nYou can still play your own music. I believe it does\
      \ have to be .mp3 format though. I know that .wav format did not work at all.\
      \ Adding your own music is very easy and can be done within the app. There are\
      \ three different environments and four different visualizations. You can also\
      \ vary the levels control, particles, color length, base & treble height & sensibility.\n\
      \nEven though I only paid .99 cents, I just can't recommend this app where there's\
      \ a major feature that's advertised on the store page that just doesn't work,\
      \ especially with no response from the dev. Also, there are better free music\
      \ visualizers. This isn't a bad music visualizer though. If you're looking for\
      \ one where you can fly around and where you can easily add your own .mp3, then\
      \ this may be right for you.\n\n[b]Rate 4.5/10. I would have given a positive\
      \ recommendation and a 6/10 if YouTube integration worked. [/b]\n\n[i]p.s. Vision\
      \ VR and Cosmic Flow: A Relaxing VR Experience are both free and much better\
      \ IMO.[/i]"
