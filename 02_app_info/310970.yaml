    about_the_game: Legions of Ashworld is a turn-based war-game, which brings a sense
      of adventure to strategic war-gaming with its first-person view of an open world
      environment. The game is set in a ancient fantasy world of kings, wizards and
      fearsome creatures. When a powerful empire invades the lands governed by humans
      all the realms are plunged into a great conflict. It is the player's task to
      organise the opposition to the invading forces, uniting the kingdoms into an
      alliance and ultimately in taking the war back to the invaders.<br><br>As the
      various characters encountered across Ashworld are recruited to the player's
      cause, the player can then move them around the lands, having them performing
      a variety of activities, such as hiring mercenaries, buying goods and provisions,
      and attacking hostile forces. The lands of Ashworld contain many places of interest
      - especially noteworthy are various temples, from those occupied by servants
      of wizards' orders which provide magic services, to ancient abandoned ruins
      where valuable magic items can be found. Outside the territories where humans
      reside other races live who may become important allies if persuaded to join
      the war. <br><br><br><strong>Main features:</strong><br>- an open-world environment
      where exploration supplements strategic planning and tactical decisions<br>-
      easy management of resources<br>- hand drawn graphics in the style of classic,
      golden age, illustration<br>- designed to cater for custom scenarios/modding<br><br><br><strong>Special
      notes</strong><br>Legions of Ashworld is a hard game, suitable for players wanting
      something different with a lot of challenge. Those who are not ready for the
      defeat should stay away.

      nario dans lequel on fait comme on veut mais on perdra si on fait le mauvais\
      \ choix (perdre du temps \xE0 trop explorer par exemple et pas avoir assez de\
      \ soldats l\xE0 o\xF9 \xE7a attaquera)\nMais en soi ce n'est pas non plus un\
      \ mauvais jeu. \nJ'irais bien mettre positif parce que le concept est ludique,\
      \ mais un n\xE9gatif parce que ce n'est pas le monde un peu ouvert que j'attendais."
