THE PICTURES ARE MISLEADING!\nIncludes: BNSF ES44DC in Heritage 2 paint scheme. \n\nPros:\n-It has working dynamic brakes, you can use them on any mountain route.\n-Above average headlights (effect). Its almost as bright as the F59PH, F59PHI, P42DC, Dash 8-BWH headlights. This means you can see the headlights at a distant which makes this DLC more realistic with that respect.\n-Interior lights\n-Heritage 2 paint scheme, will make your consists more diverse.\n\nCons\n-Reused engine sounds from CSX, NS, & CP ES44ACs. Of course you can always just use sound mods. \n-Windows and doors inopperable.\n-Incorrect Horn. Same horn as the H3 BNSF ES44DC\n-PRICE\n-No rolling stock included.\n-Only 1 loco.\n-You cannot use this DLC outside of the US!\n\nGrade: D\nNeeds to be updated in terms of Sounds, Price and the description.\n\nOnly buy when there is a sale. Sure it will make any BNSF scenario more diverse but its not worth the price.","timestamp_created":1534743444,"timestamp_updated":1599418702,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531914889812469482","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi5OysvQCePvuqAE="}
