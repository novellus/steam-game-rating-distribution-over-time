    review: "[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]\n\n\
      [h1] The Good [/h1]\n+ randomized gameplay makes for infinite replayability\n\
      + enemy AI is better than most of this genre, does a good job of patrolling\
      \ and being unpredictable yet still smart\n+ nice use of sound, even if you\
      \ can't always tell where it's coming from, really needs better spatial audio\n\
      + nice concept, executed well\n+ easy, normal, and nightmare difficulties for\
      \ even more replayability\n+ no jumpscares\n+ almost full locomotion\n\n[h1]\
      \ The Bad [/h1]\n- awful graphics\n- seems every asset was bought/donated in\
      \ the Unity store and it shows\n- punishments for wrong order are barely noticeable\
      \ most of the time and if you get one wrong, you'll have 2 punishments at least\n\
      - last part can seem like cheating by the AI until you figure out how to beat\
      \ it\n- sometimes you're just unlucky\n- not really dark enough, so there's\
      \ no need to use the flashlight ever really except in some houses\n- not really\
      \ scary\n- can't turn with controls, have to physically turn \n- game crashed\
      \ on my once during my several attempts to beat it\n\n[h1] The Ugly  [/h1]\n\
      -- dying several times in a row due to bad luck\n-- the graphics are really\
      \ one of the worst in VR\n-- did I mention the game looks ugly? almost ruins\
      \ the entire game!\n\n[b]The Skinny: [/b] You basically walk or run around putting\
      \ out randomly spawned candles in a particular order (also random) that you\
      \ have to memorize. Or you can just accept your punishments like not being able\
      \ to use your flashlight for 1 minute or not being able to move for 8 seconds,\
      \ etc. The enemy AI patrols around and you have to avoid it. Get caught and\
      \ it's game over. Put out all the candles then ... I'll let you figure that\
      \ out.\n\nRate 5.5/10. I honestly did NOT want to turn on my flashlight because\
      \ the game looks so ugly. However, I had fun so buy it on sale."
