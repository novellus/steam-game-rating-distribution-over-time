    review: 'Just a heads up, this review has spoilers.

      despite the illusion of choice given to you in this game 99% of what you do
      in this game DOES NOT MATTER, and 80% of the choices will just get you the bad
      ending/game over screen.

      checking in on all the locations does nothing to affect the good end of the
      game where you survive the killers fury.

      The ending you ask? after escaping a basement set up by the off-brand Ghostface
      the person who called your character in to investigate the murders (who is probably
      the killer) suddenly tells you to leave town for your safety, which makes NO
      SENSE.

      After an hour of sifting through the iffy controls you don''t even get to find
      out who the killer is!

      As for the VR aspect, it was done poorly, during EVERY cutscene there''s this
      weird black border directly outside your line of sight to keep you from turning
      around to see the camera man for when they were recording all this.

      Not to mention when your presented with a choice its fixed to a point of view
      on the headset screen meaning your going to go cross-eyed if you attempt to
      read the choices.

      The game is okay, and it definitely reeks of being an advertisment for another
      low quality CW11 drama series, but it is not worth the 2 dollars! My coat rack
      was scarier than this game! that''s not even a joke! My reaction is on youtube.'
