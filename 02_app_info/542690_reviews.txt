First mode is composed of various match 2 tile puzzles of increasing difficulty, where you match 2 tiles with a maximum of 3 straight lines. Second mode is more of a memory game with the tiles hidden by a question mark, which you can reveal for a few seconds by clicking each tile and trying to find a match under the same 3 line rule of the first mode. The second mode becomes more difficult towards the later puzzles as it puts your memory to the test with a larger number of hidden tiles. In both modes, once you reach the maximum possible tile matches in a given puzzle, the remaining tiles will auto-shuffle until you finish the puzzle, which is nice. If you enjoy word search type games or games that test your memory, you should enjoy this.","timestamp_created":1539405724,"timestamp_updated":1539405724,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502369701862335205","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlufuteYCeOrKrAE="}
