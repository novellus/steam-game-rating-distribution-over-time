    review: Is it a bad game? kinda. Does it feel unfinished? Yes. However, I had
      fun, so maybe other people will too. It is less complicated than ck2, so if
      you want something more complex, I would get CK2 and download a Sengoku-Era
      mod. However, for small brains like me, this game may give you enjoyment.
