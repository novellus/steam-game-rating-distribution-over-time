You teleport in some parts of this game, but mostly you're just watching the cinematic scenes play out. The controls are awful and you can tell this is a PSVR port. There are also some light puzzle elements. The game takes about 90 minutes to complete. \n\nThis could have been a much better game, if they had hired better voice actors. One of the main characters sounds almost as robotic as the actual voiced robot in the game. Unfortunately, the writers of this story did not help her out. There is not much depth to the characters or to the plot. In fact, the story starts out very much by the numbers, then suddenly takes a turn into left field. Just when the story starts getting weird and interesting, the game ends.\n\nYou do have snap turning, but you have to press in your joysticks. You control a Mars rover-type vehicle, but the controls are terrible. You have like an overhead view of the vehicle while you're controlling it. Then the voiced parts have you clicking one of 2-3 answers to respond. Overall, the controls are pretty bad except for the puzzle portions. While some puzzles were too easy, some of them were nice. Definitely casual type puzzles so don't worry if you are bad at puzzles.\n\nOverall, I did enjoy this game, but I often felt like I was fighting against the controls. There's also terrible wave shooting sections in the game, but thankfully, they are not too long. The game ran smoothly on my 1060 GTX and I was getting a steady 90 frames per second. The visuals, while not great, still hold up in 2020.\n\n[b]Rate 6/10. Buy on deep sale recommendation only. Definitely better than the average walking simulator in VR.[/b]","timestamp_created":1591493916,"timestamp_updated":1591493916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1r6bxvICc6DPjAI="}
