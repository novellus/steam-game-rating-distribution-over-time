I rarely 100% speedy or twitchy games, and usually ignore speedrun mechanics, but I enjoyed this game enough to 100% it.\n\nThe control scheme is minimal - you can only switch between two colors, jump, or hold jump to gain additional height -, yet it has a high skill ceiling and lots of room for expression. Firstly, you have a double jump which isn't consumed by running or falling off platforms, so you have lots of control over your movement at any moment. Secondly, there's a clever optional mechanic: if you time your color switching right before you land on a platform, you gain a temporary speed boost. This renders this only moderately challenging game as difficult as you want it to be.\n\nThe 25 levels are varied and even transform while you complete objectives in them, so you simultaneously practice the level for the optional speedrunning, and also unlock more platforms and speed boosts to assist in that endeavour. If you don't care about the objectives, I expect the game would feel rather short; but if you try to complete them all, and care about the par times, then this is quite a meaty game for the price.\n\nFinally, I personally really liked the game's simple yet colorful presentation.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this game a great deal. I highly recommend it if you like auto-runners or obstacle dodgers like Bit.Trip Runner, Super Hexagon, Velocibox, etc., or high-speed platformers like Super Meat Boy or Celeste.","timestamp_created":1609972981,"timestamp_updated":1609972981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40MP37PYCcdyQwQI="}
