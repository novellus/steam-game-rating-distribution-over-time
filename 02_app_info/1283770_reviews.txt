Trying to access the inventory is impossible without multiple button mashing. I spent a maddening 85 mins just running around looking for red weed to make a jug and then find some bottles all so I could get some water to pour onto a generator and short it out so I could get a wheel thing. Here's an idea, why not just switch the damned generator off. Simples. Don't waste your time like I just did. Refund requested.","timestamp_created":1609867035,"timestamp_updated":1609867035,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l7Dj6fYCe5ThwAI="}
