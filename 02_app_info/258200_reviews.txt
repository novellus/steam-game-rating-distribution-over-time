So by yourself, roll dice and play an  adventure classic board game with old school RPG themes, art and Medieval Times music.  It's not full of sound and visual effects, but enjoying basic RPG gaming at its start. There is a crazy cast  of characters to choose from.

Whatever character card you choose to be, will help you navigate the board and each have certain stats to beat the game. Stats of Strength, Craft, Fate, Gold and Lives. Now dice roll each turn to travel the board and collect followers, objects, spells and stats to get to the end game mission with a talisman and win.  Game is called Talisman. There are quick story missions for some character cards to try out. Try each one and find out who you just like playing or imagining yourself as.... Collecting the emerald ring to take to the world, defeat a dragon or climb the tower of command? That's simple, but how many turns? What crazy adventure will happen to you? Will your dice rolling be horrible just when you need it? And that's the fun, with your imagination running with it. Not for everyone I'm sure. Multiplayer and more people is always going to be more fun. BUT REMEMBER THIS IS SOLO. Achievements are needed for the game.
