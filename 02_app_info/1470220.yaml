    review: "I picked up this game because it puts together elements from so many\
      \ other games I've played in the past.  When I was younger I had written a small\
      \ game in Visual Basic similar to this about managing a movie theater: Buying\
      \ movies, keeping snack bar stocked up, managing personnel, advertising etc.\n\
      \nBut this game goes beyond all that incorporating elements from \u201CThe Movies\u201D\
      \ or maybe more accurately the BBS door game \u201CMovie Mogul\u201D (producing\
      \ your own movies) and of course the fact that it visually looks like Sim Tower\
      \ is kind of nice as well.\n\nI\u2019ve only played for a short while so this\
      \ review isn\u2019t comprehensive but first impressions are good.  As with any\
      \ business management game it\u2019s slow and repetitive which some people don\u2019\
      t care for and sometimes I don\u2019t care for it either but sometimes it\u2019\
      s exactly what I need.\n\nOne technical improvement that could be made is to\
      \ have the game window (when in windowed mode with CTRL+Enter) be resizable.\
      \  I normally have my PC set up with three screens but using a driver that let\u2019\
      s Windows see it as all one wide screen.  Also there are monitors that are \u201C\
      ultra-wide\u201D.  By default the game is full screen taking the full width\
      \ and the top & bottom of the display is cut off if it\u2019s too wide.  You\
      \ can easily go into and out of windowed mode but the window is the same size\
      \ as the game was when full screen and the window is not resizable.  I was able\
      \ to get going by disabling my driver but other people who have one ultra-wide\
      \ monitor may have an issue with this unless this is fixed.\n\nAlso note that\
      \ the min. requirements says Windows 10 but I am running it fine on Windows\
      \ 7.\n\nThere aren't a lot of gamers that like business management games but\
      \ if you do then this one is definitely worth checking out.\n"
