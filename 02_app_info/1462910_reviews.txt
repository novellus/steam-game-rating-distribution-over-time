Sage flees from the only home she's known, the Village, into the woods after discovering a growing blackness on her body.  However, the woods are far from safe as she comes across the Twisted, individuals who've succumbed to the same corruption that inhabits Sage.  In your travels, you will come across a couple individuals who may strongly influence your decisions (positively or negatively) and affect your ultimate fate.\n\nIf I had a complaint here it would be that I couldn't turn off some of the world-building critical part of my mind.  As an example, it is mentioned that the Village is walled off, and no one leaves unless exiled.  It also mentions monster attacks during the day which caused me to think 'so how do these people eat?  If they get attacked as soon as they leave, that leaves farming out.'\n \n Visuals:\nAs a visual novel, don't expect to see a large variety of characters or backgrounds.  However, the \nOne thing that will stand out is that Sage, as well as other characters are essentially anthropomorphized deer.  They walk on two legs, are covered in fur, and have antlers.  This might turn some people off as they prefer normal humans, but I didn't mind it.  \n\n Gameplay:\nThe only gameplay you really in Twisted is through your choices.  At moments of the story, certain actions and decisions appear.  As such your choices do matter for Sage's ultimate fate.  The Steam page itself says there are two diverging storylines, but there are some variations as well.  Perhaps you don't win a certain person's heart, but stay as close friends...that sort of thing.\n\n Sound/Music:\nAs a visual novel, Twisted has a limited soundtrack that I did like.  While it isn't something that I want to listen to outside of the game, I'm just glad that it wasn't anything that made want to turn the volume off and listen to a podcast.  \n\nThe same goes for the sounds effects.  While not common, when they do appear they are used to great affect like the sound of someone running through the grass, given an additional edge for what is meant to be a chase scene.\n\n Difficulty:\nThis game is about as easy as visual novels get.  You make a choice, and see what happens.  The only difficulty I found was if you decided to get all the Achievements.  There are only a small handful of nodes which really change things, so fine-tuning your decisions to get one of the more elusive achievements might be tough.\n\n Extras/Achievements:\nThis game doesn't really have many extras, but does have a decent number of Steam Achievements for those so inclined.\n\n Recommendation\nWould I recommend the game?  I actually would, though it is a bit on the shorter side (roughly 40,000 words).  At that word count, some people might find it tough to justify spending $9.99 on the game.  In a case like this, you might want to wait for a sale.\n\n","timestamp_created":1607488892,"timestamp_updated":1607488892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxr3zovYCfb6puAI="}
