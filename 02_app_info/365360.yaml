      \ /><br>Battle Brothers is a turn based tactical RPG which has you leading a\
      \ mercenary company in a gritty, low-power, medieval fantasy world. You decide\
      \ where to go, whom to hire or to fight, what contracts to take and how to train\
      \ and equip your men in a procedurally generated open world campaign. Do you\
      \ have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory?<br><br>The\
      \ game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer. On the\
      \ worldmap you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good\
      \ coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply\
      \ and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle\
      \ Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical\
      \ map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat.<br><br><img\

    review: "First of all, I'm an old tactical rpg player : played everything from\
      \ X-Com to Urtuk (great btw), Fallout Tactics, etc. So I'm kinda difficult to\
      \ please. But I must say this is one if not THE best game I ever played in the\
      \ genre. I never felt so attached to my \"bros\". I give you an example : I\
      \ recruited a pretty standard unit, a simple farmer who turned out to be quite\
      \ effective with a polearm. So the days pass, he survives the early game nightmare\
      \ (you basically struggle for food, money, everything) and eventually becomes\
      \ the best soldier in the company. Then comes an orc ambush during the night,\
      \ in the middle of the woods. I lose two guys including him, but... wait, no\
      \ ! He's not dead the game says, he just lost a fking lung ! The other poor\
      \ lad was clearly decapitated but the farmer survived a heavy blow by an orc\
      \ warrior. Now, Roland the Breethless has become my banner man, his weakness\
      \ makes him even more badass. This is just of my bros, I've got twelve of them\
      \ and they're all special. No other game ever achieved that to me. Don't be\
      \ fooled by the old school graphics, this game is a pure rpg for hardcore gamers.\
      \ It is sometimes extremely difficult, I still avoid the undead when I see them\
      \ and still s*** myself when I cross the path of a pack of direwolves. \n\n\
      No magic, just dudes with weapons trying to survive in one of the most hostile\
      \ worlds I've seen in a game. Like in Darksouls, prepare to lose bros and fail\
      \ in your quest, save after save. Or quick save every 9 seconds if that's what\
      \ you want. But death is part of the trip, and looking at the names of the fallen\
      \ comrades will give you chills I rarely felt in any game."
