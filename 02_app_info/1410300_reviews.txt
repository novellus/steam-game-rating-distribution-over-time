I love the drop in/drop out feature and the massive number of gamepads supported.\nThere's also a bit more to it than you might expect:\n  Several ships to choose from, each with their own unique style\n  Bring dead allies back to life\n  Collect space dust to power up\n  Collect debris from destroyed alien ships to unlock new ships and upgrades\n\nPlay it now!  you know you want to.","timestamp_created":1608049156,"timestamp_updated":1608050118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw17HQs/YCcJS9ugI="}
