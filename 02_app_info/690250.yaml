    review: 'The controls on keyboard are awkward and you cant manually set them yourself
      and the arrest button has been removed unlike what was on the SNES version of
      the game.

      Only got as far as the first level with this and the controls like I said are
      making this difficult to play.

      from what I,ve seen of the game so far its pretty much the same Judge Dredd
      that I remember but it clearly wasn''t the SNES version they ported because
      the sound effects for explosions and bullet arnt the same as well as a few minor
      things missing from the 95 version.


      I havent played with a controller yet but hoping its better. As you can probably
      tell I had the SNES when I was a kid.


      I want to recommend this because I loved this in the 90s and I love Dredd but
      I''d say steer clear.'
