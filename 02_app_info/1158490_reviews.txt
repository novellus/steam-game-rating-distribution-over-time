The German's have a couple Jagdpanzers, and lots of heavy artillery. The heavy artillery will have difficulty being accurate enough to destroy the Soviet tanks but you can count on your Jagdpanzers to kill even T-34's when given enough time. \n\nOverall a good DLC to have, but with how horny I am for Tank Desant units means that you probably shouldn't take my opinion too seriously when there are more tanks than trucks.","timestamp_created":1605636078,"timestamp_updated":1605636078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm8fX6/UCc6r9rgI="}
