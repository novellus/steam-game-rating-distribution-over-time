While the game can be scary at some points, most of the time it is just walking simulator. The controls suck. You cannot die, like it is actually impossible, so that removes the fear of potentially dying. They try to add a story in, but it just doesn't work. Definitely do not buy this game at full price and probably not even on sale. The game is probably worth $10 max.","timestamp_created":1610006219,"timestamp_updated":1610044271,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mb2H7/YCcdWbwQI="}
