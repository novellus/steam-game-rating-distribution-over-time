    review: 'Almost identical to Choco Pixel, Choco Pixel 2 and Choco Pixel 3, except
      for a couple of new ideas.


      Minimalist puzzle game with 50 levels. From level 1 to 30, it is pretty straightforward,
      but then, some of the levels are very challenging. And as far as I am concerned,
      I really like this mix between easy and difficult levels, I enjoyed playing
      this game.


      One of the main issues was that, sometimes, after working out a solution for
      a difficult part of a level, you have to be careful and think about how to get
      out of this part of the level. If you make a mistake, you will be stuck with
      no way of getting out, so you will have to restart the level, and try to remember
      how you solved the difficult part, which is not always easy ...


      Still, if you like puzzle games, I recommend this game !'
