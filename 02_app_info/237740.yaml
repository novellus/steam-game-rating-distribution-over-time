    review: Way to difficult even as a tribute to difficult games from the late 80s
      and early 90s and downright cheap. To many deathblocks and not a fan of Angry
      Video Game Nerd. However the game itself can be fun at times! Also the music
      is amazing!!! The best thing in this game is the music it's fuckin amazing and
      incredible the soundtracks in this game really pump my blood!!! Easily the greatest
      soundtrack I've heard in an old school platformer!!! The Dungeon and Dickholes
      level theme is easily my favorite in the entire game it was beyond epic!!! This
      is at least still way better than it's shitty horrible sequel!
