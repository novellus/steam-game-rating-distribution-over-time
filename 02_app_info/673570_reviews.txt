You play as a pilot of the Iranian Air Force. Missions are across three different time frames: World War II (Iran was technically neutral), the Iran-Iraq War, and during operations against ISIS. Controls can take some getting used to, though that might just be my easily confused movements (usually in differentiating up and down movements). Since this covers combat zones that areâ€¦ not usually seen, it can be an interesting game. Being given instructions in Farsi, is a bit distracting though (English subtitles).\n\nWorth a try, especially if you get it on discount.","timestamp_created":1598013899,"timestamp_updated":1598013899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j6DDiPQCer7pnAI="}
