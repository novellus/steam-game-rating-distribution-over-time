    review: "   This has to be the absolute worst running game I have ever played.\
      \ I liked the prospect of being able to play in an historical context, but the\
      \ controlling the pawns with a seemingly random rythym is so hard to do. Not\
      \ to mention how roughly the game moves; there is no clear dilineation between\
      \ the sounds I am making with \"wasd\" and the examples that are expected of\
      \ me. the controls either need to be simplified or they need to be easier to\
      \ understand. If you expect me to follow a pattern, I need to be able to see\
      \ that pattern (i.e. Dance Dance Revolution).\n   I quit the game in the first\
      \ minute out of confusion. Firstly, there is not currently an instrutions or\
      \ directions screen/ interface, just \"continue\" and \"quit\". Secondly, there\
      \ is no clear game tutorial sequence-- even having a single fram that says tutorial\
      \ would have been nice-- because \"Listen closer\" is so vague. Thirdly, the\
      \ reason I quit is that I thought the game had frozen. \n   Now after reading\
      \ the reviews and all discussions, I found that the game is based on the rythym\
      \ of the background noises. This by the way should have been mentioned in the\
      \ game description. I tired to give the game another chance and I will say that\
      \ I was able to make so much more progress, I marched down the trail, linked\
      \ up with my battalion, and then I stumbled into a bug where my men were left\
      \ behind while marching to the range. This is when I quit for the second time.\
      \ \n   I will not be giving this game a third try until significant changes\
      \ and/or updates are made. I am all out of words, I dont think I could be more\
      \ disappointed.. \n\n      J."
