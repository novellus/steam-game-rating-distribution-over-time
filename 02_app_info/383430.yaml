    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A PARG (Permanent Alternate Reality Game),\
      \ like The Black Watchmen, uses the real world as its game world, blurring the\
      \ lines between fiction and reality. You'll find yourself investigating in-game\
      \ &amp; online, using the web and interacting with websites, companies and NPCs\
      \ we have created.</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Warning:</h2><br><strong>If this\
      \ is your first Alternate Reality Game, please take the time to try the demo.</strong>\
      \ The Black Watchmen is unlike any other game on Steam. You will have the opportunity\
      \ to complete tasks unique to PARGs. You must be prepared: There is no virtual\
      \ world, and you have no in-game avatar. You have an agent name, and the whole\
      \ web to investigate for NPCs, fake websites and stories that blend the real\
      \ word with our fiction. Several times during missions, you will be interacting\
      \ with real world entities (players, businesses, organizations, etc.).<br><br>You\
      \ will not be able to complete this game alone. Only with the help of the community\
      \ will you be able to rise through the ranks, and become a veteran agent of\
      \ The Black Watchmen.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The World of The Black Watchmen</h2><br>The\
      \ Black Watchmen are a paramilitary group dedicated to protecting the public\
      \ from dangerous phenomena beyond human understanding: ritualistic murder, occult\
      \ secret societies, and paranormal activity, to name but a few.<br><br>As a\
      \ global organization, The Black Watchmen offer a wide range of skills and services\
      \ for covert missions anywhere in the world, on behalf of any group, corporation\
      \ or government that can afford them. Often called in as a last resort, The\
      \ Black Watchmen pride themselves on their discretion, strength and efficiency.<br><br>To\
      \ maintain objectivity in the field, you, as an agent, are never informed of\
      \ the identity of the client. You are given only mission parameters and told\
      \ how to distinguish friend from foe, but the lines are often blurred\u2026\
      <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Gameplay:\
      \ Different missions require different skill-sets.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Crack\
      \ ancient codes and investigate bizarre occurrences<br></li><li>Join a squadron\
      \ of soldiers raiding a rupture site<br></li><li>Hack through the virtual defenses\
      \ of your enemies<br></li><li>Research an occult group and uncover hidden connections</li></ul></li><li>All\
      \ Around You: The game is played using coded websites, wikis and real world\
      \ references.<br></li><li>Mission Hub: An interface that acts as a hub for information,\
      \ mission briefings, puzzles, and more.<br></li><li>Agent Map: See the locations\
      \ of your fellow agents around the world, and keep an eye out for potential\
      \ location-based missions.</li></ul>"
