    short_description: Shoot your way through the sands and catch as many chickens
      as you can. Why? Because you get to keep any gold you find for yourself! A skill-based
      perma-death shooter with challenging AI rather than floods of kamikaze sprites.
      How many chickens can you catch before your inevitable demise?

    review: Great price, great gameplay, haven't seen all the hats yet but there are
      4 modes (maybe) and a fair share of guns to choose from. Also I believe the
      maps are randomly generated so thats a plus. I've had no cons with this game
      so far, so as of right now I recommend you to turn on some jazz and catch some
      chickens. 10/10
