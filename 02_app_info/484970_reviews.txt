(See my separate review of the initial game.)\nThis DLC adds three new characters and they enter the dungeon via a new entrance going thru a section full of goblins & orcs before rejoining the original dungeon part way thru. Therefore more new missions & achievements to complete.\nThere is also the gauntlet mode, where you can playthru the original dungeon as a monster character to defeat the warlock (six different ones with various strengths) in a version which has little actual plot but is combat-heavy.\nI bought this at half-price, which made it superb vfm.","timestamp_created":1522167146,"timestamp_updated":1604083953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.690724790096282959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41tW2vfUCfNjenAE="}
