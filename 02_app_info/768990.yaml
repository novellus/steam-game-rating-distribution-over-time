    review: 'sucks sucks sucks x100

      really2 regret purchasing this. even for $2 this is not even worth it.

      seems like after 5 mins u''re not in the center anymore. and steamvr always
      failed to recenter u in the game.

      locomotion not working right, lots of time I got fall down suddenly, and just
      spawn in the top and fall to the center, not to mention lots of times cannot
      go to the right places like hitting the wall.

      teleporting is not working good too. lots of time I teleport too high or too
      low or even out of space


      cannot found how to buy new weapons in the store. it closes after a little time
      too, so as the control is not that obvious, this is really2 annoying


      the gameplay is not half as good as in the trailer video.


      avoid this. this is really2 early access. this should have been free demo instead
      of asking to pay'
