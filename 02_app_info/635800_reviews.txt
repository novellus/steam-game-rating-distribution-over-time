I had to get this for the Kagari background ever since I laid eyes upon it.\n\nLuckily, I know a bit of Japanese so I can put my Japanese comprehension abilities to the test by watching this with English subtitles while comparing it to the original Japanese lyrics.\n\nVideo-wise, I have no complaints regarding its video quality. At 720p, it already looks extremely high quality. Of the languages you can select for the video track, they include English, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, and Japanese. All of them come with their respective subtitles except for Japanese because it is already expected that you would be able to understand the verbal parts of it aside from the singing without overlaying it with Japanese word-for-word because by any standards, that would be too extreme.\n\nBecause there are already subtitles present by choosing the video track, there is no need to enable captions as it simply adds on a duplicate layer of subtitles over the subtitles themselves. Thus it had been mentioned before in another review how it is \"hard-coded\" into the video. Though for the best viewing experience with the least strain on your eyes, if you don't care so much for how pretty the subtitles look, you can set the video track to Japanese and turn on English captions.\n\nAs of now, this video is no longer downloadable but instead pops up in your web browser. On the upside, that saves you the time of having to download and take up space on your computer.\n\nIt was challenging to find where I can write a review for this video as any empty text box is virtually hidden from sight. The only way I was able to write a review was by getting to another page upon clicking on [url=https://store.steampowered.com//recommended/recommendgame/635800]\"None of your friends have watched this video recently. Tell them why they should,\"[/url] which brought me to that link.\n\nTo finish off, I would highly recommend this video to any other die-hard Key fans such as myself. The concert itself was a very enjoyable experience, and I felt like one of the excited fans in the crowd cheering for the singers on stage.\n\n[b]Songs I knew in order:[/b]\n1. [i]Philosophyz[/i], the opening of the [i]Rewrite[/i] anime by NanosizeMir;\n12. [i]Song of Revolving Stars (Hoshi Meguri no Uta)[/i], the ending of the anime [i]Planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~[/i] by Lia;\n14. [i]My Soul, Your Beats![/i], the opening of the anime [i]Angel Beats![/i] by Lia;\n19. [i]Your Letters (Kimi no Moji)[/i] from the last episode of the anime [i]Charlotte[/i] by Anri Kumaki;\nand [u]Encore[/u] 25. [i]Bravely You[/i], the opening of the anime [i]Charlotte[/i] by Lia\n\nThere were also some shock moments when I recognized the voice of Kud, Haruka Shimotsuki, the moment she said \"Wafu~,\" but I didn't know the song she sang for the visual novel [i]Kud Wafter[/i], [i]Stardust (Hoshikuzu)[/i], since I never played it.\n\nAlthough I did not know all of the songs, that did not hinder my experience one bit as I still enjoyed the rest of the songs as they were excellently sung and were beautiful to the ears.","timestamp_created":1609169096,"timestamp_updated":1609188329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44qjG1fYCdveQvgI="}
