Survive many hazards, explore a seemingly endless metropolis and beyond as the world around you implodes and history marches towards its inevitable conclusion.<br><br>This is a cyberpunk inspired first person shooter with light environmental puzzles and a long, detailed singleplayer campaign focused on story and world building. G-String aims for an old school approach where there is minimal hand holding and your biosuit automatically keeps track of your health stats, ammunition count and armor condition.<br><br>You need supplies to heal yourself, replenish your ammo\/armor but your suit automatically takes care of your lights, sprinting and breathing (open air and underwater). Your on-board neuro-enhancers, air filters and light sources automatically recharge using movement and\/or sunlight. <br><br>Courtesy of Bortz Bioengineering your biosuit is very resilient but you do have to be careful: prolonged exposure to toxins will lead to fatal failure! You need to watch out for all sorts of environmental hazards, especially later on when the pace picks up considerably.<br><br>Your telekinetic\/pyrokinetic abilities will be available from the start and throughout most of the game, they should be enough to make progress until there are more means of input available.

From the slums of Greater Chinatown to Low Orbit Earth and Beyond your adventure will take you through several distinct locations. No important story elements were cut and the game was not  divided into episodes- yet another reason why development took long.<br><br>The finished product is not perfect nor will it ever be perfect however it has reached a stage when it's hopefully good enough for release considering the time and resources available to me at the moment. <br><br>The goal with the initial release is just to put out a game that can be played form start to finish with no issues.
