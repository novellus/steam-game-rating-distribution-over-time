    about_the_game: '<strong> In the industrial era, the engineer  has a dream. The
      world of machines that uses the combined power of the magic and steam engines.
      Being a mechanical device designed by you, you venture out into a lucid dream
      that moves as your imagine.</strong><br><br>&quot;The engineer has to make his
      way out of his dreams and defeat the boss. As time passed, bizarre and powerful
      monsters will appear and cause pain to the engineer. Can the engineer escape
      his lucid dreams?&quot;<h2 class="bb_tag">concept</h2>Lucid Steam is a game
      with a fairly complex system. Basically, it is a rogue-like game dealing with
      turn-based dungeon crawling, and you have to develop a path, design, and battle
      with items as well. The dice arrangement battle also includes a luck element,
      and when the depth of play increases, it becomes more fun to play. Use the synergy
      of various equipment and artifacts to pave the way and defeat the boss!<h2 class="bb_tag">Game
      map</h2>    In the game map, you can explore and move to earn loot. Tiles with
      monsters placed on them, tiles with loot chests, event tiles where you don''t
      know what''s going to happen, and so on.<h2 class="bb_tag">Card</h2>   The route
      card is the card that makes the way. It can be distinguished by a yellow icon.
      When constructing a path, you can rotate a given path. However, in the case
      of a tile that has been constructed, the path is fixed unless it is a special
      case.<h2 class="bb_tag">Move card</h2>   Move cards are cards that allow you
      to move between created routes. It can be distinguished by a green icon. Unless
      in special cases, only the connection path can be moved. There are special movement
      cards such as a jump that can move a path that is not connected, and a pioneer
      that makes a path on the path after moving a path that is not connected.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Shop and treasure chest</h2>   There are special tiles among
      the path tiles. Shops and treasure chests are tiles that can definitively acquire
      items. You can purchase items that enhance your character with money in the
      store, and you can definitively obtain artifacts from the treasure chest.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Monsters and events</h2>   There are also tiles on which monsters
      are placed. It''s up to the player to decide whether to take a new path to avoid
      it or fight and move forward. Items can be obtained when the battle is over.<br><br>
      Tiles with question marks don''t know what to expect. Encounter other special
      tiles such as optional events, shops, treasure chests, and battles.<h2 class="bb_tag">Defeat
      conditions and nightmares</h2>Lucid Steam explores the basic cards and dungeons
      that are initially given, and a deck of new cards is given. When this deck is
      exhausted, the player must use his hand to proceed to the next floor. If you
      fail to reach the next floor, you lose. You can also lose health in battle,
      and losing all health will result in loss.<br><br> Avoiding battles in the game
      map from scratch and focusing solely on map design is not a good option. The
      nightmare gauge that accumulates as the turn passes, increases the monster''s
      stats as the stage passes. It is initialized when moving to the next stage.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Battle phase</h2><br>   The battle takes place when encountering
      a monster. At the beginning of the turn, you roll the dice to see the result
      and choose your action. The dice consists of three scales: physical attack,
      magic attack, and defense. After the dice are rolled, it is important to use
      items that add dice scales or swap equipment to take advantage of yourself this
      turn.<h2 class="bb_tag">Equipment item</h2>Equipment item has 11 different states,
      and some equipment has special effects.<br><br>Basic Physical Attack-This is
      a stat that can damage statically when performing a physical attack.<br>Magic
      Basic Attack-This is a stat that can damage fixedly when performing a magic
      attack.<br>Basic Defense-This is a stat that allows you to obtain a fixed amount
      of defense when defending.<br><br>Strength-This is a stat that increases the
      effect of the physical dice scale.<br>Intelligence-This is a stat that increases
      the effectiveness of the magic dice scale.<br>Agility-This is a stat that increases
      the effectiveness of the defense dice scale.<br><br>Physics Dice-This is a stat
      that gives an additional physical dice scale.<br>Magic Dice-A stat that gives
      additional magic dice scale<br>Defense Dice-A stat that gives additional defense
      dice scales.<br><br>Warm-up time-Equipment with warm-up time cannot be installed.
      Activates at the start of the battle and reduces the warm-up time by 1 at the
      end of the turn Equipment with preheating time of 0 can be installed.<br>Cooldown
      Time-Equipment cannot be equipped in equipment slots with cooldown time. It
      works when equipment is replaced/installed, and the cooldown time is reduced
      by 1 at the end of the turn. Equipment can be replaced/installed in the equipment
      slot with the cooldown time of 0<br><br>In addition to the status, there is
      also Equipment item with special functions such as an operation that activates
      when equipment is replaced, and residual heat that activates when equipment
      is dismounted.<h2 class="bb_tag">Token</h2>If you use a token in battle, you
      get a dice scale that matches that pattern. Tokens can be used as keys on the
      game map.'

    review: 'This game is currently a bit rough around the edges, but with a bit of
      polishing could end up really great!


      Right now though, it could use more tooltips to help people understand what''s
      going on and what effects what.'
