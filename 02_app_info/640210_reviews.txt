I really like the adventurer's guild premise, but every quest is filled with arbitrary nonsense and unbeatable tasks. I've tried sooo many times to make a mage character, not one time has it paid off to have. There is no system for what quests are available at any given time. Most of them seem like you're supposed to lose, and the other's are deceptively simple. I've had to scrap several characters because I know how the available quests are going to go, because I've tried a million times. You can't single handedly defeat an enemy with the hardest difficulty with the gear you got for $10 at the beginning of the game? Oh well you lose reputation, you suck. You need 3 materials but you know that getting those materials will get you killed? You suck, EHH. You can't defeat a tribe of goblins by yourself and going the diplomatic way just makes things worse even though you have points in the diplomatic skill, suck EHHHHHHHH. It's not fun. I get excited about giving this game another chance but its the same every time. Make a character, select comically impossible quest, die/fail quest.","timestamp_created":1606797927,"timestamp_updated":1606797927,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523593485355377197","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pdSnjvYCdYmctgI="}
