The items are sometimes too hard to find. I'm only playing this(or replaying) because I had played this about 10 years ago, so I'm just enjoying the nostalgic feeling. Nevertheless, the story is not too boring but I personally think that this game should be free.","timestamp_created":1608125901,"timestamp_updated":1608125901,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jL3xtfYCeuHZugI="}
