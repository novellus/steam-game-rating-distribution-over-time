      \ /><br>Hey, you! Yes, you! Do you want to be a landlubber your whole life?\
      \ Or maybe you dream of making a fortune, sailing dangerous seas and learning\
      \ the secrets of king crab catchers? Are you not afraid of risk, storms and\
      \ crab claws? If you are brave enough, come with me to Dutch Harbor!<br><br><img\

      \ /><br>For a few days every year, experienced crab catchers and greenhorns\
      \ brave the elements side by side, putting their health and life on the line.\
      \ The goal is to earn a fortune and become known as the best crab catcher. Now\
      \ you can become one of them!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1099610/extras/02_Crab_catching.gif?t=1586876448\"\
      \ /><br>In <i>Deadliest Catch: The Game</i> you will compete with dangerous\
      \ sea rallies to catch more crabs than you ever thought possible. The task is\
      \ not simple \u2013 it is a battle against time, fishing quotas, crab migrations,\
      \ and most importantly: the sea. Such is your underwater fate.<br><br><img src=\"\

      \ /><br>Your ship is no different from those that sail from Dutch Harbor every\
      \ fall to seek a fortune in the marine abyss. You will conn your vessel in all\
      \ conditions: breeze or gale, no storm can scare you, however terrifying it\
      \ may look. The troubled sea, the soaked ship deck, the vessel floating on the\
      \ waves - and you to overcome it all!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1099610/extras/04_Equipment.gif?t=1586876448\"\
      \ /><br>At your disposal we leave not only this fishing vessel, but also all\
      \ the onboard equipment - the crane, the winch, the launcher, and the coiling\
      \ system. We will teach you to use them, step by step. Remember, no-one was\
      \ born with the rudder - or a crab - in their hand. However, you will manage\
      \ the vessel by yourself - as captain and fisherman at the same time. All devices\
      \ are handled by you in first-person mode to have the best view of everything\
      \ happening on your boat. You will also get original crab pots - thanks to them\
      \ you will be able to pick out all the crabs from the vastness of Bering Sea.<br><br><img\

      \ /><br>Remember that you must follow Alaskan law. Not all crabs can be caught\
      \ and sold! A realistic 3D model will help you judge whether you have caught\
      \ a handsome and expensive male, a protected female, or a baby. Analyze the\
      \ water and seabed to better predict where crabs may be found. <br><br><img\

      \ computer and other players! Invite your friends to compete for the title of\
      \ the best crab catcher. Load your pots on board, sit at the controls of your\
      \ ship and see which one of you is the fastest and most effective in catching\
