For $1.50 it wasn't bad.[/h1]\n\nI liked it!  I found the characters surprisingly three dimensional for such a short, cheap game (although they still weren't super complex).  \n\nI found the ability to enter in our own responses interesting in theory, but lacking in practice, a) because the responses the characters give back are (obviously) canned, and b) you get the same questions over and over again, so there's not a point to typing your responses more than once.  It would have been more interesting if the game gave different prompts per character, or if there were a bigger selection of random prompts any character could give you, so you have more incentive to actually use that mechanic throughout the game.\n\nI also think that the game missed an opportunity to have a story, which I think would have enhanced the overall experience.  Online dating seems like an obvious backdrop this game could have used, for example.\n\nOverall I think the game is worth $1.50, but I personally would have preferred it to be longer/more involved, and cost a little more.","timestamp_created":1606521225,"timestamp_updated":1606521225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48o+IhvYCds+EtAI="}
