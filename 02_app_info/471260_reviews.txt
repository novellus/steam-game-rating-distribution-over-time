On one hand, it was MOSTLY light-hearted and cute. Only unlocked 3 of the endings (think there's 6 possible). Velvet is a psychotic b!tch (fair warning, her story arc is fu**ed up). Translation left something to be desired, but FAR from the worst I've read. Oh, and a couple bones to pick with this game is the fact that there's no skip option, so an auto-clicker became SUPER useful; secondly, there's no backlog ability, so pay close attention to dialogue and save often (few times that I had to skip back 5-10 mins of auto-clicking). Only reason my time on the game is so high is because I passed out one night with it running. If you're unsure, get it on sale like I did (summer and X-mas are the usual massive blowouts).","timestamp_created":1599963352,"timestamp_updated":1599963352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvOnPwvQCe4O8oQI="}
