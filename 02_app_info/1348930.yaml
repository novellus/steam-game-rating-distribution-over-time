    review: Yes! Any fan of asteroids will like this one.  You can collect pill pick
      ups that increase your fire, sheilds, tone down rock behavior, and more I haven't
      discovered yet.  Nice flashy explosions and there is more to this game than
      meets the eye.  Game is actually FUN to play and look forward to entering the
      rock swarm and getting to know jack, because I don't know jack yet. cheers!
