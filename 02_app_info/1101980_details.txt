There is only one street in the real Baishizhou (explained below on the geographical knowledge of Baishizhou). Although Baishizhou is small, there are many shops, and its population density is very high. There are 150,000 people living in it! It is in these places that the game unfolds its story.<br><br>Q: Why is the place of the game Baishizhou?<br>A: Firstly, the author of the game lived here for more than two years and was very familiar with it. Secondly, considering the cost of production, it is impossible for him to make a huge map like a large team. As for the old Baishizhou reform, the author has set up a project and made almost the same one. Some people have told him that he knows about the old change, which is not mentioned in the game at present.<br><br>Q: Is the game a part-time simulator?<br>A: There are simulation games in the game. Part-time work is only one part of them. There will be more simulation games in the future updates, such as disco (soon to be launched), such as hospitals (later versions). These places can also be consumed except for part-time work. Of course, the current version has no other consumption besides diet, but it will soon be launched. Free updates will have other consumption patterns<br><br>Q: Why not make a huge map of the game?<br>A: First of all, considering the cost of personal production, one cannot make a huge map, but this is not the most important reason.<br><br>The author himself spends much more time playing simulated life than playing open world games, so he prefers simulated play. Referring to the map of simulated life is actually compact, because the map simulation is not easy to develop, and more is based on the plot. Considering the cultural background, China's national conditions tend to be compact. This is not to say that China is small, but that most people actually work in a two-point, one-line mode. If you make a big map and drive freely everywhere, it is more like a sparsely populated country. In China, you may have to make a traffic jam simulation just like China, so even if I have a lot of money. It's a tendency to make compact maps.<br><br>Weibo: <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/weibo.com\/1429986584\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https:\/\/weibo.com\/1429986584<\/a><br>Official website: <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.hojeen.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http:\/\/www.hojeen.com<\/a>","about_the_game":"The past of Baishizhou is an independent game that I have been playing at home for more than one year.
