You can spend hours upon hours making one water ride looking magical. There are also great user created mods to remove some of the restrictions the game puts up.\nThe management aspect of the game is not what I come for, but it feels similar to the old Roller Coaster Tycoon games. It doesn't feel very balanced in terms of what you need to create in order to make money. But you can go sandbox mode without money or research to enable the creative flow.\nThey are lacking some basic things like undo button, copy and paste, which can be frustrating but you learn to live with out it.","timestamp_created":1610012988,"timestamp_updated":1610012988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwppKQ7vYCe+2dwQI="}
