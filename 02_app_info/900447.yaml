    review: 'Unfortunately very much mandatory dlc: [spoiler]The NPC in it is the
      only way to fill the most important position in your barony: treasurer. That
      is, if you happen to lose bartholomew (gets himself two-shot if you don''t rush
      to his aid) and miss the gnome (appears in a random area you''re never told
      about and vanishes forever after finishing a certain quest)[/spoiler]. Without
      this, you basically can''t win. Extremely frustrating. Do I recommend the DLC?
      Well, the content is good. I just wish it was part of the base game since the
      game is designed in such a way that it can become mandatory if you don''t follow
      a walkthrough.'
