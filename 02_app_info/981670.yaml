      \ you to learn it's ins and outs, enemy locations, and unique mechanics. Master\
      \ a level by aiming for it\u2019s platinum rating or take the time to find its\
      \ hidden secrets. Get your hands on a few weapons that will help you combat\
      \ enemies ranging from pesky drones to extremely angry looking goons. (wait\
      \ until you see their faces) Defeat powerful bosses, dodge a storm of bullets,\
      \ and pistol-flip your way to fame and badassery!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Stylized\
      \ World</strong></h2>The elusive Enigma Order threatens world stability and\
      \ it\u2019s up to Agent 9 to stop them in their tracks! Dive into the 1960's\
      \ vintage sci-fi world through hand-made and original levels. From underground\
      \ lairs to snowy mountain tops, Agent 9 offers a varied and beautiful array\
      \ of environments for you to explore. Grab your car keys, snuff out your cigarette,\
      \ and get to work!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Underdog Developer</strong></h2>Agent\
      \ 9 is the project of a single person under the name of Noodle Games. It's rough\
      \ around the edges and unintentionally silly at times! There's nothing that\
      \ will blow you away, but its a fun few hours where you can experience the end-result\
      \ of my 9-month long learning experience. So thanks for stopping by, and remember\
      \ to embrace the jankiness!"

    review: It's an indie game that I followed on Instagram and I really like the
      concept, but it's just "hardcore" in too many areas for the casual gamer. For
      those hardcore gamers who love unforgiving time-trial games, perhaps this is
      the game for you. For those gamers who want a casual experience, this isn't
      it. There are some frustrating mechanics. The game is labeled as hardcore and
      I understand that it's developed to be time-based gameplay. You will have to
      repeat levels dozens of times before you finally get the hang of it and then
      start to improve your speed. There are some key flaws that really hold this
      game back from being better. Some wonky fight mechanics that are incredibly
      unforgiving (boss battles), weird bugs, gun shooting mechanics feel wonky, hit
      detection is a MAJOR issue, and there's not enough content. If you go into this
      game thinking that it's a proof of concept for an indie project, then it's understandable
      and it's quite interesting. Unique art style that makes me want more if it was
      slightly more forgiving. I'd recommend it for those gamers who like a hardcore
      experience (even on casual).
