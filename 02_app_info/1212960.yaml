    review: "a nice concept game! \nLooking forward to future updates!\n\n---As of\
      \ 11/18/2020---\nHowever, enemy skills (reroll count reduction, dice eye removal)\
      \ greatly detract from the fun.\nIt's like having an enemy that reduces our\
      \ mana in Slay the Spire.\n\nIf you want to make your skills attractive, enemies\
      \ shouldn't be inhibited by affecting your dice, and if you want to make your\
      \ enemies attractive, you need to give your allies more inflation than that."
