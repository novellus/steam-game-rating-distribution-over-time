    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>DELVE INTO THE KEEP</strong></h2>The
      Forsaken Keep has been mysteriously activated after hundreds of silent years.
      No one knows what caused the incident, but Servants of Hell have been pouring
      out from the portal that sealed the entrance. The Order of the Watch has settled
      near the perimeter to keep an eye out. Delve deep into an everchanging Keep
      in this classic Diablo-esque first person dungeon crawler. Banish the evil within
      or be forsaken.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>THE SOULBOUND ONE</strong></h2>Assume
      the role as one of the Watch Apprentice that has been inflicted by the Keep
      infestation. Becoming a Deathless, your soul is now bound to the devil of the
      Keep, thus giving you a painful endless cycle of resurrection with no end. Break
      the curse and earn your peace to be buried within the Hall of the Heroes.<h2
      class="bb_tag"><strong>HACK AND SLASH UNTIL IT'S DONE</strong></h2>With varying
      degrees of an arsenal left by those that once inhabited the keep, use it to
      overcome the vile armies or sell them for gold. Slash through hordes of undead
      with any Swords, Maces, and Axes you found; or outsmart them with various devastating
      Staves that can obliterate them in a second.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>GAIN
      RESPECT FROM FELLOW WATCHERS</strong></h2>No one within the Watch cares if you're
      a deathless or not, since the oath bond of the Watch is unbreakable. Take various
      bounties and gain respect among the Watchers. Gain experience to level up and
      become stronger to break your curse!
