      \ battle, humanity is gone, and you may be the last living being in this part\
      \ of the Universe. Space stations and spaceships are still there, in the darkness,\
      \ unmanned and maintained by pre-programmed robots. And they have data: something\
      \ that may help you to find what you are looking for. Answers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >CREATORS</h2>The game has started to shape as a hobby project designed by Viktor\
      \ Bocan, design director at Warhorse Studios (Kindom Come: Deliverance), and\
      \ former design lead at Bohemia Interactive (Operation Flashpoint: Cold War\
      \ Crisis and more). It is now in the development by a small indie company called\
      \ \u201CAutomatica Corp\u201D under the direction of Lukas Macura, CEO of Cinemax,\
      \ Prague.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE TASK</h2>You cannot enter ships and you cannot\

      \ bring the requested amount of data back to the base and leave before the situation\
      \ gets out of hand. For that, you need to program up to four robots to enter,\

      \ able to run a game on Steam, you are able to program a battle droid. (Winning\
      \ the mission is not guaranteed.) Imagine you play a tactical strategy game,\
      \ but you need to make all your moves ahead. Then you start the mission and\
