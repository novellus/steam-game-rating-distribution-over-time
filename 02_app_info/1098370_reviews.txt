The artwork for CGs and character sprites was really nice, and most of the sweeping camera movements can be at least partially skipped if you mash the enter key. Unlocking all the CGs is a bit tedious for the outfit system where you chose one of three options closer to the start, and the corresponding image is unlocked at the very end depending on what elemental you chose...and are identical minus the akin colour/dress choice.\nIf you buy this full-price I would say it's a bit much for the amount of unique content.\n\nOverall pretty and decent game, with full voice acting which is well done.","timestamp_created":1609776591,"timestamp_updated":1609776591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ia6K5/YCc5K3wAI="}
