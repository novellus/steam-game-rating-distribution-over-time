You have to save and close each time you want to do something (like writing a guide, saving screenshots)\n[*]You can only run when holding the shift key, but the maps are huge. \n[*]You can only collect 99 of the same collectibles, all more vanish.\n[*]Even the trading is boring.[/list]\n\nJust finished Book 1.","timestamp_created":1580412904,"timestamp_updated":1580412904,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpOT8++8Cd/2R7wE="}
