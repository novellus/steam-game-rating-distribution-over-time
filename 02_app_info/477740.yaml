    review: '[h1] Kyokugen Dasshutsu 9-Jikan 9-Nin 9 no Tobira (The Nonary Games)
      [/h1]


      Having finished ~ [url=https://vndb.org/v3112] Kyokugen Dasshutsu 9-Jikan 9-Nin
      9 no Tobira [/url] ~ I must say that the game is really damn entertaining. A
      multiple-route escape room mystery with multiple endings that takes the idea
      of interactive gameplay to another level. All puzzles are well thought out and
      really fun - they rarely get confusing to the point where you''re lost, and
      even if that were to happen the dialogue of the characters helps you get the
      idea of what you''re supposed to do next. The story itself doesn''t seem that
      much at first but wait until you get to the true end; I genuinely missed having
      this many successive plot twists in a story, and they execute all of them quite
      well, with some notes of ambiguity here and there perhaps. The characters are
      great, each serving their purpose for the story - the way they bounce off one
      another is amusing and I adored the humor; all those small jokes sprinkled here
      and there with perfect comedic timing made for a really great time. I liked
      most of the voice acting, quite a lot - the VAs really did a good job conveying
      the right emotions with good timing and expressiveness. [b]Spike Chunsoft [/b]
      is known for their quality titles, and Kyokugen Dasshutsu 9-Jikan 9-Nin 9 no
      Tobira is no exception, they don''t miss and I wholeheartedly recommend this
      title if you are familiar with any of their other games or not.'
