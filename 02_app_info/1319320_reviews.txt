Add that to the turrets that shoot when they get activated by the bouncing balls or you shooting them by accident... And at the end of each world there is a boss that are somewhat unique. it gets interesting and physical FAST.\n\nSound is on-point, like the writing coupled with the voice acting was really enjoyable, very silly humor that honestly made me chuckle in real life... tacosphere... heh.\n\nThe only bad thing i can think of, is the frustrating Index Controllers mappings/sensitivity levels or something.\nBasically the game considers grip to change between pistol and hook, and... either its iffy, or im grabbing/tightening during gameplay or something because it swaps \"randomly\"... or at least not when i want it to swap, and because of this, sometimes the hook doesnt even shoot. This made me want to use the pistol for everything.\n\nAnd it would be ok if i could make a change, like disable grip swap (there are other more reliable ways to swap already in the game), but there are no control options that i could find, as i said, maybe its me, but it really hindered my play.\n\n\nRecommended because the price with the \"nostalgia bundle\" makes this easily worth it, the game is simple but feels polished, and in my opinion, quite fun and with a TON of levels.","timestamp_created":1608925655,"timestamp_updated":1608925655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4/aXczfYCc5uTvQI="}
