The concept is really cool. Fly a rocket and land it back on another pad. However it seems the developers never heard of physics. This rocket is incontrollable, they seem to be doing something very weird with the momentum of the rocket. It is easier to fly a rocket and land it on another planet in Kerbal than it is to just fly this rocket around the corner. \nIt is really sad because this game has so much potential. I really hope the developers fix it.","timestamp_created":1606126546,"timestamp_updated":1607295649,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zqiSnfYCev2EsAI="}
