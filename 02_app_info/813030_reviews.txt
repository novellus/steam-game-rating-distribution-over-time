Really allows you to customize your party and encourage additional playthroughs.\n\nThe sound track exceeded my expectations. Lots of bangers and always fits the area.\n\nThere is a lot to do in the game and it doesn't hold your hand. This is mostly a positive, but I did struggle quit a bit with where to go next, often stumbling into an area I had no hope of surviving.\n\nThe only negative is that a little more direction would be appreciated, but given the style of the game it is acceptable. (and the relic choice as it is basically air ship or warrior gets sweep and rolls the game)\n\nGraphics and intentional, but I do appreciate the variety of enemy types.","timestamp_created":1606514804,"timestamp_updated":1606514804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0tDvhfYCfsv8swI="}
