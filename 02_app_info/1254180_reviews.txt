Loved the art style and OST! There is clearly so much creativity and originality put in this game that makes me highly recommend it. Lots of Big Brain moments that make you really think logically. Looking forward to more games and updates from Sunburst Studios! And remember, laxatives work wonders!","timestamp_created":1592863934,"timestamp_updated":1606333941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502385377883911133","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40Ni9gPYCeujLjwI="}
