    review: 'This game has potential, but nix the murderous, running a-hole with the
      shovel, please.  I had to ditch him in the swingset several times and he was
      right on my ''a'', so it was difficult.  Also, make the batteries easier to
      pick up and the flashlight last longer.  An english-fluent editor would help.  I
      generally hate games that do not have the ability to save anywhere/anytime,
      but this one is short.  The video walkthrough is about 22 minutes to complete
      the game.


      It is a dark and rainy and has a few pop-out type scary moments.  If I did not
      have two walkthroughs to guide me, I would have hated this game because I would
      have had to restart it from the beginning many times due to the a-hole mentioned
      above.'
