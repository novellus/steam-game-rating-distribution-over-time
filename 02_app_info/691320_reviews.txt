Lets say you have a tommy gun, just 1 handing it and spraying is your best bet rather than grabbing it with your second hand. The reason behind this is that the way you hold your gun with your controllers is not what is being portrayed on screen. To line up your sights you will have to hold your left hand significantly farther left than the barrel of your gun is, making this super awkward system, which is very non linear and very immersion breaking.\n\nPistols and one handed weapons are ok. Most guns can be used one handed, but again its just silly and immersion breaking that you actually do better without having both hands on your weapon.\n\nOverall i give it a 6/10, it has fun enough gameplay and a good enough amount of content, but sadly most of it is just brought down by the one handed thing. I'm gonna have to say no i do not recommend.","timestamp_created":1609519693,"timestamp_updated":1609519693,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zK+23/YCfLy5vwI="}
