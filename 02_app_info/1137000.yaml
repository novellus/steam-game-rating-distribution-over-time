      of Adventure(1988) is a computer-game based Forgotten Realms adventure. It was
      published in August 1988.<br><br><strong>Origins (I): </strong>Early Computer
      Games. The origins of D&amp;D (1974) overlap with the origins of public computer,
      so young programmers created D&amp;D-based computer games from the earliest
      days of the hobby. These early computer games appeared at college campuses,
      most of them on PLATO time-sharing systems ... and they tended to be illicit.
      These forbidden releases include pedit5or The Dungeon(1975), dnd, or The Game
      of Dungeons(1975), Oubliette(1977), Moria(1978), Orthanc(1978)), and Avatar(1979).
      DND(1977) was an early release that appeared on another platform: the TOPS-10
      operating system. A few years later, another public game of particular note
      appeared on UNIX systems: Rogue(1980), which would create a whole new genre
      of &quot;roguelike&quot; games that continues to evolve to this day.<br><br>It
      took the advent of personal computers to really get computer roleplaying games
      (CRPGs) going. Akalabeth(1980) led the way, but it was soon overshadowed by
      two popular series: Ultima(1981-1999) and Wizardry(1981-2001). The Bard''s Tale(1985-1988)
      and Might and Magic(1986-2002, 2014) would eventually join the club of high
      powered fantasy CRPGs.<br><br>Some of the commercial computer RPGs were even
      obvious knocks-offs of D&amp;D. Daniel Lawwrence''s TOP-10 DNDeventually led
      to Telengard(1982), published by Avalon Hill. It also shared gameplay ideas
      with a DND game (1981) commercially produced for the Heathkit computer that
      claimed to be a &quot;version of the popular game ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''&quot;
      -- even boldly giving its name as &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; on its title
      page.<br><br>The problem with all of these computer games was that TSR wasn''t
      receiving any royalties for them. Though the games that incorrectly used the
      D&amp;D trademark probably weren''t big business, Ultima, Wizardry, Bard''s
      Tale, and Might &amp; Magicwere.<br><br>And TSR wanted in on that!<br><br><strong>Origins
      (II):</strong> Early Licenses. TSR began licensing D&amp;D to computer manufacturers
      almost as soon the computer roleplaying field appeared. Unfortunately, their
      first licenses didn''t take advantage of the personal computers that would make
      the early CRPGs so successfully.<br><br>In fact, TSR''s first computer license
      was for a handheld toy from Mattel: the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Computer Fantasy
      Game(1981), which was more hunt the wumpus than dungeons or dragons. TSR''s
      next deal was more thematically successful. Intellivision produced two games
      for their home video game console (1980-1984): Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons:
      Cloudy Mountain(1982) and Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Treasure of Tarmin(1983).<br><br>The
      Intellivision console did quite well for a few years, but ultimately couldn''t
      compete with the much more popular Atari 2600 (1977-1992), which literally sold
      ten times as many units as the Intellivision. But the plan was for Intellivision''s
      D&amp;D games to make the jump to the 2600 console: Treasure of Tarminwas to
      be converted to the Atari as would their third cartridge, &quot;Advanced Dungeons
      &amp; Dragons: Tower of Mystery&quot;.<br><br>Except that Intellivision went
      out of business in January 1984.<br><br>This left TSR without a publisher for
      their computer D&amp;D games, just when the newer games like The Bard''s Talewere
      making their successful debuts ...<br><br><strong>Origins (III):</strong> Enter
      SSI. Jimmy Maher has written extensively about computer game publisher SSI on
      his historian''s web site, The Digital Antiquarian. Its story starts with a
      wargamer named Joel Billings, who came into the hobby through a popular entry
      point, Avalon Hill''s Tactics II(1965). Following some computer experience at
      college, Billings decided to bring wargames to the nascent computer industry.
      The company he formed to do so was first called &quot;Computer Simulations&quot;,
      then &quot;Strategic Simulations&quot;, then to avoid an unfortunate abbreviation,
      &quot;Strategic Simulations, Incorporated&quot;, or SSI. Its first game was
      an unlicensed clone of a classic Avalon Hill game: Computer Bismarck(1980).
      Over the next four years, SSI proved themselves a serious (but minor) mover
      in the computer gaming industry, publishing about one wargame a month.<br><br>Billings
      wasn''t interested in roleplaying games, but it was hard to ignore the roleplaying
      boom of the early ''80s, so SSI eventually published a computer roleplaying
      game of their own, Questron(1984), after it arrived as an unsolicited submission.
      It was so similar to Richard Garriott''s popular Ultimagames, that Garriott
      threatened legal action -- causing SSI to actually publish it under license
      from him! The result did well; in fact, it quickly became one of SSI''s top
      releases.<br><br>Unfortunately, a whole new set of legal issues caused long
      delays in the release of Questron II(1988), but SSI published other RPGs in
      the interim, such as the Phantasietrilogy (1985, 1986, 1987). However SSI''s
      most significant games were probably Wizard''s Crown(1985) and its sequel The
      Eternal Dagger(1987), which were the first roleplaying games designed in-house
      by SSI, giving them the expertise (and codebase) for something more ...<br><br><strong>Origins
      (IV):</strong> Pitch Us Your Games! That brings the story back to TSR, who in
      1986 announced that they wanted to see a new Dungeons &amp; Dragons computer
      game, and that they were taking pitches from the industry. Though D&amp;D had
      previously only skirted the CRPG industry with its handheld toys and its console
      games, it had the potential to be the biggest license in the industry. SSI,
      whose growth was faltering at the time, was interested.<br><br>So was the rest
      of the CRPG industry, including Origin Systems and Electronic Arts, the publishers
      of Ultimaand The Bard''s Tale. In fact there were at least ten different publishers
      pitching to TSR, and it''s likely that most or all of them were larger than
      the relatively small-time SSI.<br><br>It was David SSI against Goliath. And
      his brothers.<br><br>SSI made their pitch on April 8, 1987. And somehow they
      won. Perhaps because they were a small company, who would give TSR all of their
      attention. Perhaps because they didn''t have a massive series like Ultimaor
      The Bard''s Talethat required continued focus. Perhaps because they had a vision
      for a whole series of products that went beyond a single computer game release.<br><br>TSR
      and SSI announced their new partnership at the Consumer Electronics Show in
      June, 1987. Their license went into effect on January 1, 1988.<br><br><strong>Origins
      (V):</strong> Show Us Your Vision. The original pitch for SSI''s D&amp;D line
      modeled it after TSR''s roleplaying books. Core game modules would focus on
      the rules, starting with an electronic Players Handbookand continuing on to
      expansions for more advanced gaming systems. Adventures would spin off of those
      core modules and would eventually be supplemented by setting editors, which
      would allow GMs to create their own adventures.<br><br>The idea of rulebook
      modules, required for play, was quickly discarded, but the adventures formed
      the core of SSI''s gold box adventure line, which was neatly arranged into series
      of connected adventures. The core line of gold box adventures was then supplemented
      by two other lines that are less well known today. The &quot;silver box&quot;
      modules were action-adventure games, while the &quot;Dungeon Master''s Assistant&quot;
      line supported game masters, but in coordination with the printed books (rather
      than replacing them entirely, as might have been the case with the setting editor
      that SSI originally conceived, and which ironically was a problem that D&amp;D''s
      publisher would face two decades down the line).<br><br>In August 1988, right
      on schedule, SSI had three products ready to go: Dungeon Masters Assistant Volume
      1: Encounters(1988), the silver box Heroes of the Lance... and the gold box
      Pool of Radiance(1988).<br><br><strong>Origins (VI): </strong>Enter the Gold
      Boxes. The beauty of the gold box adventures was that, for better or for worse,
      they were D&amp;D in computer form. Built in part on the functionality of SSI''s
      earlier Wizard''s Crown, they featured a tactical combat system that closely
      emulated the D&amp;D combat system. Of course, there were downsides to the close
      emulation, such as the cryptic spell memorization system, which carefully ticked
      off required minutes of study every night.<br><br>Still, as a whole, Pool of
      Radiancewas clearly a success, selling a quarter-million copies in the US and
      becoming the best-selling CRPG of its era. It was followed by sequels Curse
      of the Azure Bonds(1989), Secret of the Silver Blades(1990), and Pools of DarknessHillsfar(1989).
      Three other series of gold box adventures would appear over the next years:
      a Dragonlanceseries (1990-1992), The Savage Frontier(1990-1991), and a Buck
      Rogersseries (1990-1992). There were also two notable adjuncts, Neverwinter
      Nights(1991), a multiplayer game, and Spelljammer: Pirates of Realmspace(1992).
      An editor finally appeared years later as Forgotten Realms Unlimited Adventures(1993).<br><br><strong>Origins
      (VII):</strong> Converting the Gold Boxes. And that brings us at last to FRC1:
      Ruins of Adventure, an adventure module produced by TSR simultaneously with
      the publication of Pool of Radiance. It''s not quite an adaptation of the adventure;
      though it repeats many of the maps and neighborhoods from the gold box adventure,
      it also includes many blank spaces for GMs to fill in. And, it''s not in fact
      a conversion at all: TSR stated in Dragon #159(July 1990) that SSI had based
      their computer game on the module, not vice versa. In any case, Ruins of Adventuregives
      tabletop roleplayers the opportunity to engage in the same quests as their computer

    short_description: A great evil force descended on the town of Phlan years ago.
      The townspeople were all either killed or driven away, and Phlan became (literally)
      a ghost town. Fifty years later, the survivors are ready to reclaim their town.
      But they need a band of strong and brave adventurers to lead the fight-they
      need you.
