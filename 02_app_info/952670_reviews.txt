Considering this is one of the cheapest ones you can buy, I fully recommend it.\n\nEDIT: They just added more taskmasters, so this DLC might not be very useful to you anymore.","timestamp_created":1570980981,"timestamp_updated":1577581725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41NjMp+8Ceq2G1AE="}
