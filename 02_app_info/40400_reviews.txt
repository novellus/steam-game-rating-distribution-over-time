But this game has a bit more content due to the DLC list.\n\nIf I had to describe this game it'd be zerg rush the game. Keep an eye on your resources, take over planets the AI holds, simple enough premise. But if you aren't careful the game can turn into tug of war, as the AI will escalate its own forces as it sees fit, and it doesn't take much to escalate.\n\nAgain, simple enough premise, which leaves a lot for the gameplay. While it's not Sins of a Solar Empire level, it is similar, adjacent. I can't stress enough that AI War 2 improves on it a lot, but giving a thumbed down review would be very unfair if so, especially when there's not really any faults with this game. And again it is fun, their is a level of tension with the back and forth with the AI, as you struggle to gain and keep footholds that grow from there.\n\nThe only criticism I have is the UI is not very good, which, again and again, is improved in AI War 2.","timestamp_created":1609937977,"timestamp_updated":1609938079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40bHy6/YCfY//wAI="}
