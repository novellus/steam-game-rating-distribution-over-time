    short_description: Four suspicious persons with mysterious past are sitting around
      the table in the gloomy dark bar playing Russian Roulette. Beware of other players,
      because they don't look like someone who plan to play fair. Be tricky and become
      the last one standing!

    review: 'Roulette in Russian style. Four players, only one will leave the table
      A L I V E. You get a gun, and some cards that will determine your fate. Are
      you BRAVE enough for the challenge, varmint?


      If you can get this for pocket change, partner, don''t hesitate. Invite a few
      friends too, as the public might not be easily available for this game...'
