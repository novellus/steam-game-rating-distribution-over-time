Headlight along with a few more steam locomotives with shaders does not blend with loco very well and is often too bright however on the berks it isn't bright enough to ruin it\n\n2. Pulling Coal Hopper's up the 2% grade on coal country is a struggle for anything above 20 loaded coal cars or even trying to pull a decently long excursion consist at track speed in DCC Mode\n\nIMO unless you are a decently big fan of the berks i say go for them otherwise i'd say wait for a sale on steam tbh 25.00 even for a loco with shaders is a bit pricey a more appropriate price would be around 15.00 which is what you can find it at usually during a sale or even Lower.","timestamp_created":1608703020,"timestamp_updated":1608703020,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvoGLx/YCe/KuvAI="}
