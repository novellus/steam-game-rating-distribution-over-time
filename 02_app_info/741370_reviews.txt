(tileset related animation)\nso no animation for the attacks, no chest / doors animation (you have to make the sheets yourself the sprites are in the tilesets, it's lazy from the devs) there is also no buble emotion animation, but looking at the ds /ds+ packs page on steam there is the bubles?? couldn't they just add it here too ???\n\nthe icon set is also missing \n\nthe music is the music from the fantasy theme,but please note it's only the music ,sound effects are not included.\n\ni haven't bought the ds and ds+ packs (yet) i think ds+ might be a good add-on as it holds the missing themes of this pack and you will get the missing bubles that arent here, the ds pack tileset might be very similar but if you want different characters , they arent the same and might add some diversity\n\noverall , whats inside the pack itself is good,But i find it very lazy and disapointing from the dev to just leave out a lot of the sprites (all the icons , animations) out of the pack ,if the pack was updated with at least that it would be great.\n","timestamp_created":1608820314,"timestamp_updated":1608820314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+bnKyvYCfNjkvAI="}
