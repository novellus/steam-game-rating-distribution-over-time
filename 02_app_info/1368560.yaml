    review: First of all, as a player, I think the distribution of maps is OK. The
      beginning of the story can also arouse the curiosity of players. But I don't
      really like combat systems. I don't know the attack mechanism of different enemies,
      and the torch will fall down when rolling, increasing the difficulty. In the
      dark, it is difficult for players to see the enemy. These different enemies
      will come together to find the player. I don't think this is very good. If you
      want to go to each area and meet a certain type of enemy, I think it's good.
      Only after the cooling down of ordinary attack is completed, can we use the
      attack distance of player range. When you open the item bar, you need to click
      the mouse to use the item. Moreover, the map of land is diverse, but if many
      of the same room pattern will make players feel tired, and I think the key guidance
      is not clear. I don't know which door the key should open. That's how I feel
      about the game
