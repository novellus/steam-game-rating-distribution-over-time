    about_the_game: <strong>Storyline:</strong><br>You wake up and find you have no
      idea where you are. Worse, you barely remember anything about the recent past.
      The only thing you're holding on to is your son's voice, crying for you helplessly,
      and your wife screaming she loves you, but you can't recall what was happening
      during that time. Ahead of you is a dirt path, so you follow it. You walk right
      into a village. You look around and inquire if anyone can help you, but no one
      is interested in assisting unless you have copper to pay them in return. You
      go and talk to the ammunition dealer, and he makes you a deal. If you can complete
      a series of risky quests for him, he will pay you for them individually. Along
      with taking the time to collect copper, and maybe complete some daring quests,
      you set out on your journey to look for your wife and son.<br><br>How far are

      Info:</strong><br>Project RPG is mainly an open world role-playing game, but
      it also consists of many different genres; horror, action, storytelling and
      mystery. We wanted to ensure the game has a little something for a wide variety
      of players. The quests, depending on how you choose to play the game, will vary
      from being guided with help to find your family, to being left to find out where
      to go on your own, to how much of the game you view before completion. There
      are many sites for you to explore, for example the ghoul-infested asylum. Also,
      the bonuses (weapons, unlocked doors, etc.) you receive after the quest, will
      be determined by the choice of quest and which villager assigned it.
