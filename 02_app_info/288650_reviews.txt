But I found this very 3D and colourfully interesting and quite challenging to play given the variety of courses this game offers up. Many perceive slot car simulation to be just 'Press the ALT key and DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!' but I feel this offers up more because of it's colourful and inventive representation of this subject. You can set your experience level from easy to expert and the toughness will increase accordingly. Cars can and will 'spin' off the track but replace themselves within seconds at the point of excursion. I have also experienced 'HTR+ Slot Car Racing' and feel that this is more dynamic and colourful: Potentially more interesting but nothing is absolutely like the real thing ['Carrera Go'] when played on PC. A great effort though ... I liked this a lot :o)","timestamp_created":1587817400,"timestamp_updated":1587817400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7NjS2PECcbCvgwI="}
