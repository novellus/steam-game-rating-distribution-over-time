I finally found and tried this game\nIt is such a awesome FNAF like game. ITS NOT like FNAF at the same time, very unique and scary. I am not too into horror games but I love this one. \nMy two complaints:\nHopefully in the future there can be a sensitivity setting. For me the sensitivity started extremely high. I had to lower my DPI to compensate (no worries though)\nAlso I feel that the nights are a little bit too long. But either way awesome game","timestamp_created":1586226309,"timestamp_updated":1586226309,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511111080646514893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+JSdqfECdpHl/gE="}
