    about_the_game: "PLEASE NOTE<br />\r\nChristmas Crisis is currently in Early Access,\
      \ meaning we are still adding new features to the game and improving multiplayer\
      \ stability and performance. We are looking for players who want to play the\
      \ early version of the game, and hopefully also get involved in its development.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nAh, Christmas. Its all about happiness, presents, joy and\
      \ .. erm.. betrayal ? necromancy ? clones ? did I say Evil Santa ?<br />\r\n\
      Santa has been betrayed by his own damn elves and workers who, fed up by being\
      \ overworked, have secretly created Santa's own clone, a Evil Santa to take\
      \ over his winter domain and ruin Christmas for everyone.  <br />\r\nSanta has\
      \ summon you, souls of brave warriors, to his world to help him battle the traitors\
      \ and growing evil. Kill them and... erm, raise their dead bodies ? Santa and\
      \ Necromastery ?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a open-map (IO-style) multiplayer\
      \ and semi-RTS game with element of necromancy and themed to Winter/Christmas.<br\
      \ />\r\nBattle against neutral monsters (well, the evil) and other players in\
      \ this free-for-all world and raise the defeated foes as part of your own army,\
      \ everyone starts with a small army of their own to fight autonomous battles\
      \ against nearby foes and expand by raising the defeated foes. <br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nDefeat stronger enemies and world-even bosses to unlock unique playable\
      \ characters and army units.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFEATURES<br />\r\n\
      _______<br />\r\n-Open-map world, with massive multiplayer (upto 100 players\
      \ within a single map)<br />\r\n-Always online even without other players (random\
      \ NPC/monsters are controlled by total number of players on the map, if no players,\
      \ the world spawns even more units to let you play alone till more players join).\
      \ No waiting for room to fill or lobby, just hop in and start playing<br />\r\
      \n-Necromastery for your defeated foes. You can raise units defeated by you\
      \ as part of your own units. Your own defeated units cannot be raised again\
      \ by you (but other player who defeated them can raise them). Balance your living\
      \ army and keep expanding it by raising the dead.<br />\r\n-World bosses to\
      \ add a new level of challenge, try to defeat them alone or with other players\
      \ and their army to unlock unique playable characters, animations and more for\
      \ your army units<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nROADMAP<br />\r\nThe following\
      \ are features that we'd really like to add, but everything is subject to change\
      \ as development is still on-going.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n~~To be updated based\
      \ on Trello board"
