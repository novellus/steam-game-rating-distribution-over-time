I discover the game when students from neigbour institution invited us to play after conference.\nThe rules are easy so it is not necessary to look in the rulebook before every step.\n\"Classic\" board is the easiest even on the medium level. \"Osiris\" board is the hardest even on \"Anoobis\" level. \nI think that the strategy of computer on all levels is the same but on levels like \"anoobis\" the opponent does not attack afte some steps. So if I can predict the strategy of computer, I can win easily even on the hardest levels. \nThe game with beamsplitters is more interesting but not all of opponents can play with you.\nIt is difficult to find an opponent on cloud, but you can make a first step in game and expect for appearance of opponent.\nThe interesting plus of game is that you have 7 days for your step so if you and opponent play in different time, you can play together despite of this.\nThe offline version is great so I can find the opponent even if he has not his game.\nIt will be good if the android version of game will appear.\nAchievements are interesting, but it will be better if the number of achievements increases.  \nBut I can't understand why I did not receive an achievement when I killed a figure with two beams.","timestamp_created":1531871467,"timestamp_updated":1531871467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43/Kp1eQCddCmpgE="}
