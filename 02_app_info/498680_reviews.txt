I had to ditch him in the swingset several times and he was right on my 'a', so it was difficult.  Also, make the batteries easier to pick up and the flashlight last longer.  An english-fluent editor would help.  I generally hate games that do not have the ability to save anywhere/anytime, but this one is short.  The video walkthrough is about 22 minutes to complete the game.\n\nIt is a dark and rainy and has a few pop-out type scary moments.  If I did not have two walkthroughs to guide me, I would have hated this game because I would have had to restart it from the beginning many times due to the a-hole mentioned above.","timestamp_created":1594857027,"timestamp_updated":1594857027,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42964qvMCdvXGlQI="}
