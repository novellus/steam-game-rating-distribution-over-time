    review: 'I have been an aquarium hobbyist for about 5 years now, and I really
      enjoy what this game has to offer so far. Obviously its still in early access
      so it has a ways to go before it is fully fleshed out, but I think it currently
      serves the purpose of being a great, peaceful sandbox aquarium creator. It took
      me a minute to figure out how to use the plumbing function and the add-ons that
      come with it, but once I took the time to read the tabs on the help page it
      turned out to be very simple. That said, I think some work could be done on
      the controls to make them more intuitive, and providing a basic tutorial would
      be beneficial.


      As of now, the fish and hardscape selections are fairly bare-bones (particularly
      with saltwater, but freshwater too), but it appears as though the game is being
      updated regularly and I am excited to see what is added in the future. I would
      love to see snails, shrimp, and just a selection of cleanup crew included in
      general, as well as a greater variety of diseases, types of algae, and general
      types of unique aquarium issues like pest-snail population booms, incompatible
      fish not getting along, etc. Regardless, I''m excited to see where the game
      goes from here!'
