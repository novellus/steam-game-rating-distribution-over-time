    about_the_game: "In Defend your buttress, you stand behind a small wall with increasingly\
      \ more difficult waves of enemies coming towards you. If the enemy breaks your\
      \ wall they will then come after you. If they kill you, game over. You start\
      \ at round one again. As you level up, you gain new weapons to kill with. The\
      \ guns themselves can also level up. Every 5 player levels you unlock a new\
      \ weapon. So including the first weapon, there are 21 total weapons. With this\
      \ arsenal, you will kill stick-man, machine-gun soldiers, rocket soldiers, flamethrower\
      \ men, tanks, and even a few hot air balloons. But don't worry about a weak\
      \ wall. The separate wall sections each have their own health, repairman, fortifications\
      \ and upgrades. Behind you are purchasable turrets and rifleman. Both with separate\
      \ exp bars. All rifleman share exp, as well as the turrets. So, the more of\
      \ each you get, the faster they will level up. Most of the characters are voiced.\
      \ Sorry about the two not having voices. It's so hard to find good actors. :)\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI got the idea for this game from old flash games that\
      \ I use to play as a kid. And I wanted a first-person version. So, I set out\
      \ on that mission. And here it is. There are a few things that I would like\
      \ to add to it. Obviously, more levels. But also more modes. And I will gladly\
      \ continue to add to it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you have any bug reports, tips,\
      \ concerns, etc... Please send them to this email address: riseoftheclackn@yahoo.com.\
      \ I want to make this game the best that I can! Thank you!"

    short_description: Defend Your Buttress is a simple game. You defend your wall
      to your dying breath. Why? I don't know... Because the evil stick-man want to
      break your wall and kill you. For some reason.

    review: 'I saw this as an upcoming game a couple days ago, and with a name like
      "Defend Your Buttress," how could I refuse? XD


      After playing the game for a little bit, my only complaints would be that there
      is no tutorial or help screens to show what the controls are, and I''ve found
      a weird glitch where my weapons disappear on screen but are still able to be
      used. I would also say that $10 is a bit much, but considering this is a game
      made out of an Indie developer''s love for old flash games, I''m okay with it.


      If you''re looking for a game with a bit of nostalgia to those old flash games,
      this game does a good job of it without using fancy graphics, overly-smooth
      animations, or complex controls (although the voice acting is SPOT ON XD). It''s
      a great time waster, too. I can''t wait to see what the future holds for this
      game.
