    review: 'This is a great DLC and a relaxing prison.

      The prison is fun and has plenty of things to do in it. I''ve somehow spent
      3 irl hours in it without noticing.

      This prison is most likely as easy as Center Perks 2.0, if not easier than that.


      It''s definitely worth the cash.

      Truly Glorious.'
