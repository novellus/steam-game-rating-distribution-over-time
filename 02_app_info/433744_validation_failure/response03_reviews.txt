Hand comes on each item switchable but no Text on What it is like other Fighter Sims on Steam like DCS World.  Full Screen mode seems to not explain what a switch or control is while Windowed small or large mode tells you what the hand is one with a label and percentage.\n\nI got this mixed up with the other easy cheap Stuka on DLC I have.  You have to push in the Fuel pump Circuit breaker near your right rump edge then Start Engines. I fear prop pitch or something manually demanded must be done to do a power take off and stop stalling though. I like the detail complexity on the plane with all working switches etc. Very serious Sim.\n\nThe average SCHMOE like me buys it and trys to start plane. NO GO.  Coughs and Sputters and never climbs. Turns out there is a lower right on seat double push pull  Switch you must press first to enable FUEL PUMP ...lower to start pump and you hear it working. THEN CRTL + E to start or you ONLY get a constant coughing engine. Even after this the plane has no power and drops like a rock and stalls easy like overloaded if you have ONE little bomb. Play without bombs or may waste time.   \n\n\nAs a guy said:\n\n\"One of the aircrafts flies fairly stable, but it's tough to first lift off the ground. But maybe thats my bad piloting skills.\n\nHowever, I tested two of the bombers, and they dont work. Once the game loads them into the world, they immediately shut off. Once they get powered up and revved up for take off, the engine keeps coughing every two seconds. The aircraft gains speed and is barely able to lift off, but the sound of the coughing and choking is annoying and awful, and doesnt give you enough speed to do anything.\n\nAnd there is no Jericho Horn sound effect - which was pretty dissapointing\" \n\nThe Horn switch in unmarked on the left window sill. It adds more than diving sound and adds a screwball air raid siren to sound mix. This cannot be real. Seems like two sound tracks going instead of simple siren. \n\n\nvasya 54 RUS Feb 10 @ 9:57pm \nYou should read the manual: \"Should you wish to do\na quick start, merely push in the fuel pump circuit breaker (image #3) and then press ctrl E, advance the throttle and\nyou're off.\"\n\nI kept going to my CHEAP STEAM STUKA from FCS instead of the this Russian makers to look at the PDF.  Very different. \n\nI does fly with circuit breaker .but fly so heavy like an overload and drops to the ground over and over.","timestamp_created":1509329413,"timestamp_updated":1509414542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq8OHuN8CfqjpiQE="}
