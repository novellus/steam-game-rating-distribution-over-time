The strength of the franchise has always been the roll playing elements and they are frankly non existant here.  The briefing is inadequate to say the least.  The selection of merc and deployment thereof seems to have been done entirely at random.  While it's nice they gave you extra equipment in a paradrop, putting it on top of a building that only 2/3rds of your mercs can get to seems insane.  The number of op-force solders firing rocket launchers at you is beyond absurd.  If you are looking for a stupid difficult scenario with a pretty map, you may like this.  But if there is ANY additional background information on any of these mercs in the game, I haven't found it.  It's great that someone tried to do some DLC for JABIA.  It badly needs it.  But just handing out rocket launchers like they were candy to the bad guys is NOT the way to make a scenario interesting.","timestamp_created":1518033218,"timestamp_updated":1518033218,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486211895942687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnZX1uOECcoKimAE="}
