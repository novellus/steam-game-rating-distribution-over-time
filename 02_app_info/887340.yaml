    review: This is a VERY short Action-Adventure, in which you explore, and dash
      over gaps to make your way to crystals that will unlock the next stage.  Mechanically,
      there isn't much to it, and dashing is a bit imprecise, but this is an EXPERIENCE.  The
      world is very pretty, and beyond that, it's incredible to watch the world gradually
      going to Hell as the adventure progresses.  A lot of love was put into this,
      and I'd jump at the opportunity to play a longer game set in this world.
