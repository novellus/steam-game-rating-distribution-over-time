On one hand, every technical aspect works very well. It plays smoothly, and all the pieces preform what they are supposed to. It is meant to be a purely passive experience. As a free product, it delivers a properly working product.\nUnfortunately a Passive experience lives and dies on the contents of the story, and it is impossible to not compare this to Wall-E, a bar that this animation is in no way capable of living up to. The design is simple, yet uninspired and unexpressive, the character has only a single line, and yet nothing is done to use that line to convey an actual sense of dialog. Wall-E, Groot, and other characters with similarly limited vocabulary still use that minimalism to convey entire paragraphs of context.\nAs for the story itself, it is either too vague, and I am missing it entirely,(which rarely happens) or it is so over simplified as to not even be recognizable as a story. There was a head, there was a problem, he met another head and together they pressed a button, and the problem was solved. For some reason that is meaningful?\nPerhaps all of this could have been ignored if there was something added by making this a VR experience. If any of this somehow showcased how a regular experience can be made more impressive by using VR as the medium, I would at least be able to say it's worth trying, but I don't feel anything like this.\n\nThis feels like a school project where the student was busier checking to make sure they met all the stupid structural criteria to qualify for the grade, and then making sure they didn't write anything too difficult to animate, that making sure the story was actually enjoyable was never factored into the equation.\nI don't usually do this to a free product that has no actual technical issues, but I just can't recommend this one.","timestamp_created":1486438734,"timestamp_updated":1486438734,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497100234031677246","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi+Opi9oCfLnAcQ=="}
