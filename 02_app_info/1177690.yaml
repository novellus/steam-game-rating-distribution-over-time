    review: "A mi forma de verlo, no merece la pena ni mucho menos.\nQue carezca de\
      \ traduccion no es lo que mas me molesta.\n\nLa gracia del juego es que realmente,\
      \ quien tiene que hacer la invocaci\xF3n (The Summoning) eres tu, de verdad.\n\
      \nEl concepto es interesante pero desde luego esta mal realizado.\n\nSi eres\
      \ f\xE1cilmente susceptible o crees en estas cosas, te puede gustar. \n\nYo\
      \ por desgracia no he podido sentir terror ni absolutamente nada aparte de pena\
      \ por el desarrollador, que esta constantemente suplicandote que te creas que\
      \ esto es sobrenatural.\n\nNo lo juegues, va a ser como comprarte una caja de\
      \ cart\xF3n.\n\nNo lo recomendar\xEDa desde mi punto de vista."
