Don't roll in expect xcom.\n\nThink Xcom with less budget and less story and you have Galaxy Squad.  It is initially a wonky sotry driven tactical game, but after that you can unlock other playmodes that make it more interesting.  The story mode has some fun moments but it is, on the balance poorly written.\n\nCombat is fun and I would say on par with xcom overall.  \n\nDevelopment of your crew is more free form than Xcom but there are some abilities that open upon level.\n\nLastly, dying is not bad.  Ending the game gets glory points and the better you do the more you get.\n\nWorth picking up on a deep sale, not list.","timestamp_created":1609980728,"timestamp_updated":1609984261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uMei7fYCcM6TwQI="}
