    review: I have loved this game so much for the time that i have had it so far,
      and the puzzles have been very well crafted and fun to play. My only complaint
      that with the Queen Sudoku game mode, the first level is literally unsolvable.
      The link here https://imgur.com/sRpAf0V shows the first level with all of the
      spaces highlighted that restrict where a 6 can be placed. When looking in the
      middle box, you can see that there is no place for the 6 to go, making the board
      unsolvable. If you can fix this, that would be great, because this game mode
      has the potential to be the best game mode this game has.
