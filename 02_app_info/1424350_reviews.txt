Every time you do anything to gain speed it feels satisfying. Once you play for a bit you'll be able to go [b] really [/b] fast. All of the characters have their own play styles, adding to the variety of gameplay. Local multiplayer is easy to set up and adds to the game's replay value. Gupi's contributions to the soundtrack are really fitting and would be something I'd listen to when not playing. Came for the hyperpop and stayed for the engaging gameplay.","timestamp_created":1607737976,"timestamp_updated":1607737976,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzNSpqvYCc+mmuQI="}
