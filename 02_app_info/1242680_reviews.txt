There aren't many power ups like in Jason's or Copen's runs, but I can't say much about it 'cause even in DMFD she doesn't have anything more than her sword and dragon shot. Everything she has in the og game, she has here, and it works pretty well. (And yeah... I know that in DMFD she can change attribute and have different tipes of d.shots, but the fire one would be the best choice anyway, so I don't count it)","timestamp_created":1607108304,"timestamp_updated":1607108304,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyNPHl/YCf5eotwI="}
