    review: While I have not yet beaten the game, I have very much prepared the 11
      or so hours I've put into it so far. I was one of the people who actually really
      liked 1/2 Genie Hero's attempt to shake up the typical Shantae formula with
      stages instead of the more traditional metroidvania dungeons and regions, but
      this game returns to something a little more typical for Shantae's method of
      interacting with the world. It does reuse a lot of 1/2 Genie Hero assets which,
      honestly, I'm fine with, I don't need a new image of what a Crab looks like
      every new game. My one complaint, though, is that I want it to be just a pinch
      harder. I've faced down against three dungeon bosses so far without running
      into any real problems, and I have nearly every upgrade in the game's shops.
      Maybe I'm on the cusp of meeting some truly taxing bosses, and maybe there's
      more upgrades coming around the corner, but so far I feel like I'm running out
      of core mechanics to explore and am hitting that old adventure-game standby
      of going to every room in sequence and trying out every item and power to see
      if I can find new interactions (here's to the Metroidvania and Adventure Game
      formats!) All in all, though, the game's funny, the mystery's mysterious, and
      while all of the cutscenes keep breaking into crazy artifacts I'm still having
      a good time anyway.
