Its like flappy bird but in the orbit of a black hole. Other debris, planets, other black holes and other stuff comes flying into the center of the black hole at different speeds and in a flappy bird like mechanic, you have to dodge them. The skins are pretty cool too and dont take a lot of grinding to unlock!\n\nThe thing i like a lot is that they included custom controls (On keyboard, mouse and controller) for moving your planet, which is really nice. The music is pretty cool too :D\n\nOverall i love this game and am sad that i didnt get it earlier when i first saw it :D\n\nEdit : Just got all the achievements and skins. Pretty cool that plumbish has the rick and morty portal as a reference :)\n\nEdit 2 : The game is fairly short :( I hope more skins and achievements are added soon !","timestamp_created":1609623649,"timestamp_updated":1610137218,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvYXq8fYCeMLuvwI="}
