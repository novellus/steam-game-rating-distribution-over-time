    review: "SATAZIUS is a fantastic and fun game...everything about it...\n\nThe\
      \ progression and the pacing along with a awesome soundtrack and sound effects.\n\
      Explosions, weapon attacks and their sound effects are just awesome.\n\nThe\
      \ boss fights and the end Boss fight and the frenetic action in between.\n\n\
      A real sense of accomplishment and meaning when completing levels and defeating\
      \ the final Boss.\n\nThe enemies are all well done and I especially appreciate\
      \ their style...no goofy stuff...it all has a nice theme to it. \n\nThere is\
      \ a nice little story to the game.\n\nI finished it on EASY as my preference.\
      \ Plays in under an hour...perfect for the sorts of games I enjoy. Replay value\
      \ because of the impressive quality of the game is high.\n\nSo a big Thank You\
      \ to the Developers for this great game!"
