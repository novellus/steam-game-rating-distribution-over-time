Next, camping in the outside game map is particulary hard as you are constantly woken up to fight yet another horde of bad guys, fatigue quickly sets in so you have to keep reloading a save in the hope that the game gives you a break and lets you sleep so that you can move on.\n\nThe above is the worst parts of the game, in general it is fun earning money \"Through  Fighting Mainly\" to get better armour and equipment, and the inventory management is endless though satisfying.\n\nBotton line is you need to fight \"A Lot\" to make money to buy things like armour weapons and food ... Check your \"Charactor Screen\" after EVERY fight and save after every fight and even every action like before fights in Cities ... It is very randon and it's easy to get wiped out in a fight!\n\nDaemongate is old school, the fights are brutal ... Main thing to remember is check your fatigue after every fight and if it's a couple of points down eat some food and save, fatigue is your enemy if an an enemy flees on the battlefield, it will drain you very quickly ... You can control how many bad guys you want to fight if you are aware of exactly when a fight is going to happen by saving just before the battle and loading again if you are not happy with the number of enemys, it's pointless fighting one enemy as there is no profit in it, keep loading until you get  a larger number.\n\nAlways keep your armour to \"Good\" condition as just one piece that is in \"Bad\" or \"Terrible\" condition will get that party member killed!\n\nThe way to win is throught rigid and O.C.D inventory management.\n\nStill playing it now, though i can't remember how to do the hex editing, though i.m sure i will work it out\n\nThere is a walkthrough on the net, you can't miss it, it's the only one ... Follow it to the letter, as the game is event driven, as in B won't happen before you do A.","timestamp_created":1521019602,"timestamp_updated":1521627871,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":52,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.869402289390563965","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48daFpOICfK3UmwE="}
