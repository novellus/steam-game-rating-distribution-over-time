    review: I bought this on DLsite and played 99% of the way through it in the past,
      just rebought on steam on and wanted to review. Just a decent little material
      simulation puzzley action game, unfortunately something that's been done bigger
      and more popular since Agartha came out. Several wildly different characters
      although they may not be super well balanced (I found some characters could
      handle almost any situation while others could handle almost no situations).
      A cool game if you want to shoot dirt and freeze water.
