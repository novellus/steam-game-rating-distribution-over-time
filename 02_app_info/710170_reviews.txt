It was cool for a bit, but got so terribly repetitive with very little substance. \n\nWeapons are all the same per level, no variety. The same sword, hammer, etc, just with slightly incrementing stats per level. They go up through tiers. New tier, new look, but they're again, all the same. You've got an assortment of spells to choose from that you find new ones, but there's really not appearing to be a wide swath of them. No other skills.\n\nIt's just empty. Sure, it's hack and slash, kinda like Diablo if it was gutted and barebones. Not much else I can say about it.\n\nI get I didn't see all the boards in the time I played. I get that there's probably many things I didn't see. But after seeing the clear trend of the game, extremely limited content served in spoonfuls, I'm out and can't recommend.","timestamp_created":1609900483,"timestamp_updated":1609900483,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m/zi6vYCfrrxwAI="}
