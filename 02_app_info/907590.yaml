    review: "An interesting concept and gameplay...but too @#$%ing hard. Despite being\
      \ called a \"casual\" game, expect plenty of ragequits. And even if you CAN\
      \ complete this game, the Achievements won't count towards the \"Perfect Games\"\
      \ for your profile, so it feels as if I played and frustrated on this game for\
      \ nothing. Not cool. \U0001F620"
