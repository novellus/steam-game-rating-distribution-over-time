Though the physics do feel a bit heavy, little things like the super realistic metal ball, the level style, and the graphics are very nice and make this game very enjoyable.\n\nI would however like a key binding for quickly returning to the last checkpoint. I do not like waiting for the ball to fall out of bounds to finally respawn.","timestamp_created":1575434568,"timestamp_updated":1575434568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlPjN5+4CcP3m4QE="}
