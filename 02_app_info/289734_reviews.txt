DLC Review\n\nExplore all day and defend all night, how long will you last?\n\nPlease note that this Review may contain spoilers from the Base game \n\nSome key points that this game add on has to offer:\n\n1.\tNew game mode: Barricade!\n2.\tUnique crafting recipes.\n\nReplayability:\n\nHow to Survive Barricade! DLC is fun when played co-op with a buddy; chances are if you have one that enjoys this game as much as you do, the two of you will be taking this mode out to test your skills in the all new defensive game mode. \n\nIt has access to all the DLC content that the game has to offer, so you can truly put your skills to the test to see how long you can hold out against the undead.\n\nMGR Gaming’s Conclusions:\n\nHow to Survive Barricade! DLC is fun with a buddy, alone it kind of feels like a drag, it is boring and not very inspiring to play, but then again, this game mode isn’t really meant to be played alone.\n\nKeeping an already injured survivor from being attacked by hordes of Zombies while keeping yourself alive is a two Zombie slayer job. The game mode can be played at every difficulty level the game has, yeah even on Kovac’s Way. Once the game has started you will start in a small camp on Santa Barbara Island with Henry being on a stretcher; Your goal is to prevent him from being attacked and killed, if Henry dies it is game over.\n\nLooking at your screen; on the top you will see the timer running, counting the seconds of how long you’ve been holding out and at the bottom you can see Henry’s health bar.\n\nDuring the day you scavenge for food and materials; small sectors at a time grabbing everything you can carry back to home base; it is here that you will notice that certain new items can be found such as planks and steel plates. These items are used to construct barricades which can be built to funnel and redirect zombies to your play style or strategy, along with these barricades you can also build turrets that can help you keep the zombies off of Henry, provided you have ammunition for them to fire.\n\nMuch of the Island is closed down either by foliage that you have to chop down or burn. Other areas are blocked off by barricades that require explosives to destroy, as you scavenge by day picking up materials you craft and improve your arsenal to better protect your little camp. As you manage to open up more of the island, so the amount of materials you can scavenge increases.\n\nScavenge and explore by day, defend by night! That is when the horde attacks… As the days go by the Zombies start getting stronger and stronger, the number of Zombies that attack you also increases, and at the end of every fifth wave a boss attack as well.\n\nAs I mentioned, this game mode can be fun with a buddy, but solo I do not recommend it, it is a bore to go at it alone, a few things that could of made this a more fun and unique experience; instead of a static location we should of had a few randomized locations that are available to defend from, Henry cannot be healed, so every life point he has is precious. There is no completing this mode, there is only you holding out until you eventually die or until Henry dies.\n\nScore 6\nBy: MGRza\nDate: 22 October 2014 \n\nAdditional info:\n\nPlatforms: PC: Xbox 360: PlayStation 3: Xbox One: PlayStation 4: Wii U\nGenre: Zombies: Indie: Crafting: Tower Defense: Survival\nCensor Rating: Mature\nAge Rating: N/A\nDeveloper: Eko Software\nPublisher: 505 Games\nRelease Date:  20 October 2014\n\nMGR Gaming Steam Curator:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/32364038/\n\nMGR Gaming:\nhttps://www.mgrgaming.co.za","timestamp_created":1549114831,"timestamp_updated":1588512454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504843950271606445","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw146u7fECdvXouQE="}
