You could in theory create a wide range of things and really get a lot of content out of a game like this. I talked with the developer and hes working on features that I think will really improve this game.  \n\nPros - \n- Cool Idea\n- Great Examples\n- Decently Stable\n- And a very cool Developer\n\n\nCons - \n- Programming interface could be Better (3D object based language), This would help keep you in the game and help you   understand the basic logic of programming. Also having a simplified programming interface would help inexperienced people gain a foot hold into the world of programming. \n\n\tExample coding Language â€“ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language\n\n-  No social connections, it would be nice to have multiplayer or a way to share code easily.","timestamp_created":1479367545,"timestamp_updated":1569555639,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53465348482131958","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4rc2zuO0Cf5jQZQ=="}
