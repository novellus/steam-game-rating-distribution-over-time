    review: "This is an absolute party gem - get it, play it with some friends for\
      \ 30 minutes and move on to the next game, satisfied.\n\nFrantic one-hit-kill\
      \ game with neat crate physics, good with two but gets better the more people\
      \ participate. After a couple of matches, a surprising tactical depth unfolds.\
      \ Remote play together works well and is a good replacement for online multiplayer.\
      \ \n\nPlayed excessively in local multiplayer on my friend's account, hence\
      \ the short playtime."
