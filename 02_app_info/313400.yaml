      /><br>In this long awaited shooter from action masters Cross Eaglet, enemies
      are not just right in front of you; they're all around you! Using a unique perspective
      rotation mechanic, players can bring enemies and items into view, putting the
      odds in their favor in an otherwise impossible situation.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/313400/extras/aresenal.png?t=1592543719"
      /><br><br>In Revolver 360 RE:ACTOR, you don't only have your bullets to save
      you. You're also armed with a powerful laser that pierces through weaker enemies,
      and a screen-clearing EMP. It's the exact kind of weaponry you're going to need
      if you hope to survive this harsh and hostile environment.<br><br>Use your weapons
      in concert with each other to toy with your enemies and reap higher score rewards.
      Killing your foes quickly is not always the best course of action.<br><br><img

    review: '[h1]Loved the game! Can''t play it...[/h1]


      Great concept, packed with fast paced action, unique and clever "rotation" mechanic,
      nice soundtrack and... everything in blue... literally everything.

      I can''t keep track of the enemies due this, bullets are ease to dodge, but
      the enemies themselves and the hazards keep f@cking me.

      Also, for some unknow reason, the Xbox controller does not work (a minor inconvenience
      since the keyboard is Ok for this game).

      Still recommended, since it''s not the games fault my lack of concentration
      thanks to vitreous detachment in my eyeballs.'
