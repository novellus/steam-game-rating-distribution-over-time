    about_the_game: "&quot;I can't believe Yukinojo, who was deemed to be worthy of\
      \ the best group of firefighters, would just disappear so unceremoniously! &quot;<br\
      \ />\r\nFirefighters occupied a glamorous job during the Edo period and were\
      \ considered superheroes at the time. However, Yukinojo, who was admired and\
      \ greatly trusted by the citizens, fell off a roof and lost his life.  Then,\
      \ Yukinojo strangely and absentmindedly looks down on himself lying down from\
      \ above the ground. While looking down in amazement on his friends who sadly\
      \ surround his still body, Yukinojo states, &quot;It seems like I was a person\
      \ who was rather loved by others,&quot; as if he was speaking about somebody\
      \ else. He remembers that he was a firefighter, but has no idea why he is wandering\
      \ here as a ghost. At this moment, the town girl Oryo exclaims in surprise at\
      \ the sight of him as a ghost. She is the former lover of Yukinojo. They had\
      \ shared their feelings for each other, but ended up in this situation after\
      \ fighting and splitting up because of stubbornness. Surprised, Oryo asks, &quot;Do\
      \ you have any regrets? &quot; Yukinojo explains that he is absolutely troubled\
      \ by the fact that he has no memories other than people's faces and names. Although\
      \ her facial expression shows confusion, Oryo somewhat understands and becomes\
      \ sure that there is something in Yukinojo's house that he cannot leave, which\
      \ will cause him regret that will prevent him from leaving this realm.  Oryo\
      \ mentions that she will take care of it out of respect for their old acquaintance.\
      \ Seeing no alternative, Yukinojo reluctantly accepts this proposition and asks\
      \ Oryo, who is the only person who could see him and speak to him, to take care\
      \ of the thing he cannot leave. In this way, Yukinojo and Oryo head out to the\
      \ town of Edo together. Under these strange circumstances, Yukinojo gradually\
      \ remembers something while they exchange old, nostalgic stories. And the sorrowfully\
      \ warm, unexpected conclusion that Yukinojo and Oryo reach is --<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ultimate immersive animation experience that combines\
      \ VR, animation, and an Edo-style short story. This immersion into a worldview\
      \ that makes you feel like you entered the Edo period and are seeing and listening\
      \ to the story yourself is a sensation akin to playing the lead role in the\
      \ story. The story, which is fully voiced, of the firefighter Yukinojo and his\
      \ former lover Oryo will invite all of you into a distant world during the Edo\
      \ period.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe newly introduced Touch Advance System allows\
      \ you to enjoy a more interactive experience. Each player controls the progress\
      \ of the dialogue by touching the characters that appear in the VR space."
