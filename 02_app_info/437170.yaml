    review: '"The Amazing Adventures of Ash - Afterparty" is a game developed by Z3roram
      Studios and developed using the RPG Maker VX engine. The game is a horror-style
      one if you will, and is mostly puzzle-based but has a few RPG elements to it,
      such as the casual RPG fighting. The game stars a girl named Ashlee who gets
      invited to a party, but later needs to escape the house which the party took
      place, with everyone vanished and unable to help her. Only to discover the shocking
      truth behind who owns the house, and why souls are present within the house.


      I have just beaten the game as I''m writing this review. If you know about the
      other RPG Maker games "Witch''s House" and "Five Nights at F***Boy''s", you
      would say gameplay is like a mix between the two (Without the sexual themes
      of FNaFB, obviously). Most of the game is about solving puzzles within the house,
      and sometimes you''ll come across a monster which you must fight and defeat
      RPG-style. So this game involves leveling up and gaining new abilities. But
      it''s a bit cheezy how the minor combat feature mixes in with the major aspects.


      This game MIGHT also be a "Choices Matter" type as I have been given feedback
      from the game after doing a specific set of actions. Such as taking an item
      only to realize I was accused of stealing it later in the game. But I''m pretty
      sure these choices don''t matter as much as other games like Undertale.


      People were complaining that the game was poor for its puzzle solving, how it
      wasn''t as difficult and convolluted as other puzzle games, which kind of make
      you think logically. But overall, this game is a pass for me. It''s the kind
      of game you would expect from paying $2 for it, like something out of a dollar
      store.
