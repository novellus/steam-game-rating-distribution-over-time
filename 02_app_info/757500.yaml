    developer_response: "Thank you for your inputs. We apparently need to emphasise\
      \ the tutorial more!\n 1) Shields must be equipped on your arm, not held in\
      \ your hand. \u2018Held shields\u2019 is a game mechanic that will be available\
      \ later with cleaving and parry.\n 2) Shields are working for both player (when\
      \ equipped) and monsters.\n 3) How to perform item inspection is demonstrated\
      \ in the tutorial. The inspection system is very detailed providing many data\
      \ points on every item you can equip. (also see our Guide on 'Fade Lore')\n\
      \ 4) Equipment seen and used by a monster is directly usable once you defeat\
      \ it. These items just need to be picked up. This includes the magic weapons\
      \ they use!\n The games controls and interface are different, and can be complex.\
      \ For the best experience, we recommend players run through the tutorial before\
      \ attempting to explore!"

    review: 'edit: The game has not been updated since june, no offer to bugtest playest
      accepted, nobody is really buying this - this game is dead in the water. avoid.


      The game runs very choppy and the controls are unintuitive. items disappear
      sometimes when dropped, and despite having a gigantic kite shield and intersecting
      weapon, i cannot block damage. Also, not being able to see the stats on a weapon
      sort of makes it all seem irrelevent. I may reconsider purchasing this again
      once the bugs are gone and the game is optimized and the graphics are consistant
      and all sorts of stuff has been rethought and reworked.


      It''s not a terrible game, but it''s pretty unplayable right now. It''s sort
      of like a less creative version of kings field geared for VR. I love kingsfield,
      i do not like this game. I''ll be following this, but do not puchase this for
      $20 dollars unless you''re willing to take a gamble with a dev to overhaul the
      game entirely to be more or less comperable to titles such as vanishing realms
      or vr dungeon knight, which are FAR BETTER in my opinion... I am interested
      in the depth this game tries to bring, the statistics and such. ALSO, this game
      needs dropped loot, not just loot chests. A skeleton had a burning mace i would
      have liked.


      edit:


      Thank you for responding with some useful information. I''m not entirely against
      buying this game or playing it again, but the following issues:


      -No parrying or cleaving

      -Unintuitive controls and inventory

      -items disappearing/falling through map

      -unoptimized graphics and inconsistent texturing


      are all turn offs right now for me. I''d be willing to consider buying this
      again when these things are fixed, because the premise and the potential is
      quite good.


      I would happily play an evaluation copy and bugtest/critique the game to help
      out, and would be willing to replace my review with a positive one once things
      are addressed.'
