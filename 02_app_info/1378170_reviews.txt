If this is your kind of game the $2 price tag doesn't seem like very much. :)\n\nIs this game fun? It can be. The game mechanics are very similar to FNAF in that you have a room where you can watch several screens to see if the 'angry toys' are coming to kill you. \n\nDepending on how close they get, you will need to shut one or both doors to your room in order to keep them out. While this has potential to be really scary, the RNG kind of ruins it for me. I'm a gamer who prefers skill to luck and this game doesn't allow for that.","timestamp_created":1608901319,"timestamp_updated":1608901319,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572953760623931885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lbv/zPYCfuWFvQI="}
