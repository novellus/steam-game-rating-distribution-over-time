    review: "This game is awful. I can not overstate this fact. Give this trash a\
      \ wide berth. \n\nAfter me playing it once it doesn't even run anymore. Which\
      \ is a good thing. I am GLAD it no longer runs! This is easily one of the worst\
      \ games on Steam at the moment of writing this review.\n\nThe audio:\nThere\
      \ is a loud, constant, static hissing noise which which plays for the entire\
      \ duration of the game. It is much than anything in the game. You can barely\
      \ hear other \"sound effects\", but those are also nothing but crackling, distorted\
      \ static screeches that barely audible. I doubt they would have made much of\
      \ a difference in the audio fidelity though. The game has no volume settings.\
      \ I had to turn my system volume all the way down to 10% to make it bearable.\
      \ To sum it up, the audio is about as pleasant as a root canal without anaesthetics\
      \ while also getting your eardrums punctured.\n\nThe graphics:\nThey are...\
      \ not awful. But I would not describe them as good either. The 3D-effect is\
      \ okay but it is wasted on  the uninspired, unimaginative level design. The\
      \ ships are just rubbish. They look more like shiny dog turds with some lights\
      \ on than futuristic spacecraft. They made better-looking SHMUPs in 90's.\n\n\
      The Gameplay:\nThe controls are touchy and finicky. Also the default controls\
      \ are set up in an idiotic way. Z=up, F=up, S=Down... what? At least you can\
      \ remap them. But it doesn't really matter. There is almost no feeling of control.\
      \ You have one type of ship with 2 firing/flight modes, which are pointless.\
      \ The enemies come at you in predictable waves and have fixed flight patterns.\
      \ They also shoot at you from outside of the screen before they appear.\n\n\
      Stability/game engine:\nNone. The game stopped working after I played it once.\
      \ Now when I try to start it up it blanks the primary screen and then flickers\
      \ and flashes my secondary monitor like a jigsaw puzzle, flashing and flickering\
      \ for a few minutes and then closing and restarting the game executable as soon\
      \ as it manages to load the title screen on the primary monitor. Basically to\
      \ get tnough play-time for this review I had to sit there watching my monitors\
      \ flicker for several minutes, and listen to intermittent static noise.\n\n\
      As I looked at my task manager I could not help but have giggle at the irony\
      \ of the \"A Super Schmup (32-bit)\" entry flickering in and out of my task\
      \ list. \n\nYes. Schmup. Not a SHMUP. Try looking up \"Schmup\" on Urban Dictionary\
      \ (nsfw). It's priceless. But also a fitting description for this game."
