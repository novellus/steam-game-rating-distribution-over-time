    review: "It's the best Monster Trucks game on steam and probably on the Internet,\
      \ has:\n\n+ A handful of customizations that includes the: Body, Rims, Exhaust\
      \ and Top/Front/Rear Attachment.\n----------+ Not forgetting Liveries and stickers.\n\
      + Has a Career mode that's basically you racing in leagues and competing against\
      \ other AI drivers.\n+ Has a Quick Play mode where u can basically play any\
      \ event with custom options and custom tracks against AI.\n+ Other game modes\
      \ include: Destruction, Freestyle and Time trail. (Total of 5 game modes)\n\
      + You can play this either as an Arcade Game (Not recommended) Or as a Sim Game\
      \ (Recommended). Choice is up to you\n+ You can also change your Tuning for\
      \ certain Freestyle Events and Racing to suit your gamestyle.\n+ Easy is a bit\
      \ of a joke, but Hard Difficulty is challenging and will you keep on your toes!\n\
      + Graphics look stunning and very well done, even the detail when your Truck\
      \ gets all muddy and and your \n+ Sounds are amazing, especially the Monster\
      \ Truck Engine audio it's so F**** good! (Music however is poor)\n+ Has Wheel\
      \ Support which you can also customize to your liking.\n+ Works fine with a\
      \ keyboard and is not overly complicated. (How I played)\n+ It's well optimized\
      \ and I had no bugs or crashes or any issues, I played on an Intel i7 6700,\
      \ 16gb ram and GTX 1060 6gb and never noticed any killer frame drops.\n\nNow\
      \ on to the Negatives:\n\n- Online is dead, literally dead. I tried playing\
      \ some online on Day 2 and I could never find any matches. Trying to find an\
      \ online race as we speak so I can rate the online but I'm unable to find any.\
      \ Tried hosting but no one ever joined.\n---------.- You're also limited to\
      \ the game modes you play on online, basically you can either play a race or\
      \ a drag. You can have \ndifferent stages and set as many laps as you want but\
      \ then again online is dead.\n- After you finish the career mode you literally\
      \ have nothing to do.\n- For some reason Time Trail is not part of the events\
      \ you do in the Career Gamemode which is a shame. \n- You can set up a team\
      \ to help you give you boosts but they're just that. No real depth of managing\
      \ wages or interaction, just a passive boost.\n----------.- Sponsors also have\
      \ no visual effect except from giving you a bonus but it might just be me nit\
      \ picking really.\n- Game time is a bit small as I finished it after 7-8 hours\
      \ and I'm not really feeling like going back doing the career mode again.\n\
      - Menu Music (In my opinion) is awful and I wished we got some Heavy Rock type\
      \ music to up the Atmosphere. (Personally I just muted music)\n\nHonestly with\
      \ all the stuff I mentioned it's still a decent game for Monster Trucks enthusiasts\
      \ and it's worth a buy for \u20AC40. HOWEVER as a gamer who has no idea about\
      \ Monster Trucks (Me being a bit of both) it's not really worth the \u20AC40\
      \ BUT! It's still worth it if you can get it on sale, maybe \u20AC20-30.\n\n\
      Replay ability I'm also not really sure... I mean you can always jump back in\
      \ do some Quick Races but I'm not sure about how many times I'd do that.\n\n\
      OVERALL SCORE: 7.8\n\nGraphics: 9/10,... Gameplay: 8/10,... Career Mode: 5/10,...\
      \ Music: 2/10,... Sound: 9/10,... Online: ??/10"
