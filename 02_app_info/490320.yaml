    about_the_game: 'The robots from Steam Powered Giraffe are in a video game! <br><br>That''s
      right! Steam Powered Giraffe did music for SteamWorld Heist and Rabbit, The
      Spine, and Hatchworth make an appearance in the game, as themselves, entertaining
      their fellow robots in-game with their catchy tunes! <br><br>This album includes
      the SteamWorld Heist theme song created by the band, as well as 12 tracks, featuring
      6 completely original songs written for the game, and 6 classic Steam Powered
      Giraffe songs, re-recorded to fit into the SteamWorld Heist game universe. Ever
      wanted to hear what an acoustic version of Automatonic Electronic Harmonics
      would sound like? Well the game and this album have one! We even have a version
      of Brass Goggles, with backing vocals sung by the entire game development team
      at Image &amp; Form Games!<br><br>How to access the audio files:<br><br>The
      files can be found in your Steam directory: [...]\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamWorld
      Heist\SteamWorld Heist Soundtrack by Steam Powered Giraffe. <br><br>You can

      select the tab &quot;Local Files&quot;, and press the button &quot;Browse Local

    review: "Una delle pi\xF9 belle colonne sonore di sempre. Musiche in parte originali,\
      \ in parte gi\xE0 successi dei Steam Powered Giraffe, un gruppo di musicisti\
      \ robot che meriterebbe di essere conosciuto di pi\xF9. Fanno probabilmente\
      \ roba molto di nicchia ma davvero di fattura pregiata. Ho diverse colonne sonore\
      \ di Steam, ma tutte acquistate magari nelle edizioni complete dei giochi. Questa\
      \ \xE8 l'unica che abbia comprato appositamente. Ve la consiglio davvero!"
