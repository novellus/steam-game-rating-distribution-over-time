    review: I can't remember what floor I'm on(it is either in late 70's or early
      80's of floor level due to the battle room being completely pink color), and
      after I win the Crimson Paladin battle, the rock doesn't disappear from the
      exit  of that room, causing you to be stuck in the room with no way out. I can't
      find a way to get in touch with the developer of the game to inform him of this,
      and hope he will see this review of mine about his game and will respond back  very
      soon. No other floor did I encounter this incident on. I was  going to recommend
      this game after I beat the game, but I won't be able to beat the game until
      there is an update that causes this issue to get resolved. Until such time,
      I will have to skip playing the game since there's no way around the rock/boulder
      blocking the exit that I can see.
