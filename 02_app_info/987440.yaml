    review: Great a track editor I can start trying new track layouts. I would say
      though I did expect more gates and objects as theres not even 10, so hopefully
      the designer will see this and add more varied gates and objects as what you
      get doesn't justify the cost. I do like this sim as it's pretty close to how
      my 4s & 5s drones feel when I'm flying and feel this sim could be expanded with
      tracks and drones like rotor rush who have added xclass to their sim and created
      something beyond what you'd expect. I also think this sim could do with the
      addition of smaller dromes like 2 inch and 3 inch as they are getting more popular
      and the courses could be made tighter show them off.
