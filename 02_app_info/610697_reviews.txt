The workshop community seems to provide far better games than this for FREE.\nThe graphics are fine HOWEVER:-\n1. There are no AI players\n2. There seems to be no way to hot-seat over the network. By this I mean that every player needs their own PC and a copy of TTS (TableTop Simulator). This would be a perfect introduction to TTS, however, you cannot invite two people on the same PC/laptop/Mac to play as you can in some free mods like Carcassonne. For a game that is best played with at LEAST 3 (and up to 9) players, I find this VERY limiting\n3. The scripted setup is VERY limited and if you attempt to create a game in TTS hot-seat mode, it is very difficult to choose three of the starred event cards and add them to the event deck (So difficult in fact that I never figured out how!)","timestamp_created":1588346839,"timestamp_updated":1588346839,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.452941179275512695","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/au26PECdNfohAI="}
