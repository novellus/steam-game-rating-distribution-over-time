It's a standard hidden object game and follows the same hidden object game like plot structure. But that's from what I've seen and it's only about half of the game.\n\nThe reason I've rated this game as bad is because of the major game breaking bug. Yes. Major game breaking bug. The game will auto-quit on you once you get to a pottery shop in the game. Once you attempt to finish a pottery puzzle, the game will eject you and automatically shut down.\n\nI've attempted to find a fix for the problem. As far as I am aware, there isn't one. I've uninstalled and reinstalled; but nothing seems to fix it. Several other people have seemed to also run into the same problem.\n\nSo do yourself a favor and don't buy this game.","timestamp_created":1434689865,"timestamp_updated":1434689865,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586112797260284424","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40sCLhc4CdbaAPw=="}
