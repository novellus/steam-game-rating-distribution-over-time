    review: 'Lovely soundtrack, this was the first Monster Hunter game I''ve played.

      Being able to officially support this masterpiece that holds lots of nostalgia
      today is amazing too.

      I wish we could also purchase the tracks from the Ultimate rereleases, and eventually
      Freedom Unite too.'
