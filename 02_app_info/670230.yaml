    about_the_game: In our reality, &quot;Omega Centauri&quot; was a dwarf galaxy,
      consumed by the milky way, however a creature from another reality, with the
      power to bridge between dimensions known only as The Experiment has come to
      wreak destruction upon the galaxy. In his reality, the Milky Way was the dwarf
      galaxy and it was consumed by Omega Centauri. He seeks to exterminate all life
      on the Milky Way, and the humans aboard Station 13 must prevent him from carrying
      out his crusade.<br><br>In Omega Extinction you can play on two teams, The Experiment
      or The Humans. The Experiment is incredibly powerful, and can use his abilities
      to trick and deceive the humans. The humans use technology and strength in numbers
      to attempt to defeat The Experiment before they are picked off one-by-one. Omega
      Extinction is an asymmetrical multiplayer FPS, where one player plays as The
      Experiment and up to 4 other players play as The Humans.<br><br><strong>Hunt
      Down Your Enemies!</strong><br><br><i>Play as the fearsome experiment, and use
      your immense power to pick-off the humans one-by-one. </i><br><br><u>Bridging:</u>
      As he is from a different dimension, The Experiment can use his powers to &quot;phase
      out&quot; of our reality into his, upon doing this he appears as invisible to
      the humans, but he can now see them wherever they hide! However the experiment
      cannot attack whilst phased out, and must phase back into our reality to strike.<br><br><u>Disguising:</u>
      The Experiment can also use his powers to disguise himself to look identical
      to the other humans, whilst disguised he cannot change weapons or shoot, but
      he can communicate with the humans and get close enough to strike!<br><br><strong>Survive
      the onslaught!</strong><br><br><i>Play as a human and work together with your
      surviving allies to kill The Experiment before he kills you! But beware, for
      he might just be one of your allies in disguise!</i><br><br><u>Equipment:</u>
      The humans have various pieces of equipment to help them in their struggle against
      the Experiment, they include:<br><br><u>Psyshield:</u> A channeled shield that
      blocks the experiment's bridge vision from seeing any human inside, it also
      removes the disguise off a disguised Experiment! <br><br><u>Door Jammer:</u>
      A pack of 3 jammers designed to quickly shut and lock a door for a brief period
      of time, allowing for a quick escape or containment.<br><br><u>Target Spotter:</u>
      A special device designed to locate The Experiment. The spotter cannot see through
      walls, but it can see through a bridged Experiment! The spotter will highlight
      The Experiment (invisible or not) to reduce his effectiveness and stealth capabilities.<br><br><u>Proximity
      Mine:</u> When all else fails, why not blow him up? The mine is an explosive
      device that when it senses the experiment go near it, it will explode dealing
      serious damage, just be careful not to stand near it when it goes off...<br><br><u>Deployable
      Shield</u> On some maps, there just aren't enough doors, on those maps the Door
      Jammer is replaced with the deployable shield. The deployable shield will place
      an impassable wall between you and your foe, and will remain until it is destroyed.<br><br><u>Death
      is not the end!</u> Upon dying, your job is not yet over! Humans can take control
      of the facility's cameras upon death and if they spot the experiment, he is
      highlighted for all surviving humans!<br><br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br>-Online

    review: First I want to say that I was not sure what to expect with this game.
      I saw it in the recent releases category of steam and the game did not have
      any reviews yet or anything. However, the game seemed unique and intriging and
      I knew right away that it was the type of game I would enjoy. Since the game
      just came out there were not much people playing the game. However, the developer
      created an official discord server (Which I found in the announcements section
      for the game) and I managed to play a match for a few hours with him and a few
      others on the day of release. The developer is super chill and he told me about
      new maps that he wants to make for the game. If there was ever a small bug he
      took note of it and is devoted to making this game as perfect as possible. Just
      to be clear, for a brand new game there were hardly any bugs and the game felt
      like it had been out for much longer. In addition to the game not being buggy
      I got a high FPS and my PC is not even that good. I do not think you should
      have trouble running this game. Onto the gameplay the game itself is a lot of
      fun. It consists of 4 troopers working together against a monster type enemy.
      Each trooper has a different asset to use such as being able to lock doors or
      being able to tell if the monster is nearby. The monster has 2 main abilities
      which are being able to go invisible as well as being able to disguise itself
      as a human. When I was playing a match of this game I pooped my pants sometimes
      when I thought I was next to one of my teammates but then they started to attack
      me and I realized that what I thought was one of my teammates was actually the
      enemy. It is such a rush. The maps themselves are also very well made and one
      of them even has as a tram/train that can take you to another part of the map.
      Overall, despite the game not having very many players as of yet, I was able
      to find a match through the discord server, the game is a ton of fun, and it
      runs super well. Just purchase it. You will not regret it.
