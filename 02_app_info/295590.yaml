    review: "[h1]Here is the dealio[/h1]\n\n[i]This game has mixed reviews because\
      \ people were not happy about the release of Hero Generations: Regen. Which\
      \ is essentially the same game with some minor graphical and quality of life\
      \ improvements. In the original you have to play it in windows mode, there is\
      \ no choice. There is no graphics option, there is, no real options to speak\
      \ of. While I can somewhat understand why people are upset the developer released\
      \ a \"new\" game, I don't think its entirely fair.[/i] \n\nThere is enough improvement\
      \ in the new game over the old game that I can understand the developer wanting\
      \ paid for that work and not offering it as patches to the original game. The\
      \ developer even offered anyone that had copy of the original game a discount\
      \ on Regen. I didn't get to take advantage of that discount (they basically\
      \ sent out steam coupons that did expire, but at the time I wasn't really picking\
      \ up games or getting on steam much at all, so missed out on them. However,\
      \ they did send me several over the course of like a year or two) I will say\
      \ that Regen does open with a very similar launcher I've seen in some independent\
      \ demos and betas. That's kind of jank, but it's whatever, at the end of the\
      \ day it doesn't really matter or change anything. \n\nWhen I got the original\
      \ game it was regular retail of $14.99, instead of the regular retail of $5.99\
      \ it has today (and I paid full price). I was not upset back then, and felt\
      \ like original version of the game was worth what I paid. So obviously I think\
      \ it's worth the current $5.99, and if you can get it on discount then even\
      \ better. I would still recommend this game, in either it's original form, or\
      \ the newer Regen version. It's easy to pick up and play, but  deceptively challenging\
      \  and deep, for such a simple presentation and package. It's certainly not\
      \ a game for everyone, so I'd recommend watching some game play videos to see\
      \ if it's the kind of game you might enjoy. \n\n[u]So let's say you've decided\
      \ you do like this game and you want to know what version you should get. Well\
      \ here are some things to consider:[/u] \n\n[list]\n[*]Are you ok with playing\
      \ in a medium sized window you can't resize? \n[*]Do you want the soundtrack\
      \ but don't care about the art book? \n[*]Do you care about the art book, but\
      \ not the soundtrack? \n[*]Do you think slightly better graphics, full screen\
      \ mode, save slots, and upgraded options are worth $10?\n[/list]\n[i]And, here\
      \ is why those questions matter when making this decision[/i]\n\nThe only way\
      \ to get the soundtrack (here on Steam)  is to buy the original version of the\
      \ game with the collector's edition. There is no offering for the soundtrack\
      \ on it's own or with the Regen version of the game. If you get the collector's\
      \ edition of the original game (that must be played in windowed and lacks several\
      \ quality of life upgrades) you will get the art book and the soundtrack. \n\
      \nIf you get the Regen version of the game, then you automatically get the art\
      \ book (the exact same art book as is offered with the collector's edition of\
      \ the original version of the game) you will have a game that has slightly better\
      \ polished graphics, with lots of quality of life upgrades to the options, but\
      \ you will not be able to get the soundtrack, and you will pay $14.99 (assuming\
      \ you pay full retail price) as opposed to $5.99."
