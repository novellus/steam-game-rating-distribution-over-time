They feel too static.\n\nThe game had potential but towards the end it's not very good because of the problems. With more polish it could have been much much better.\n\nI also would have liked to see new unlockable weapons near the end of the game, because most weapons are weak to use against the last bosses.\n\nI give it a 5/10.\n\nBy the way, I've beaten the game twice.","timestamp_created":1553042716,"timestamp_updated":1586190229,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44MOTqPECfqe1vQE="}
