    review: 'LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I''VE COME TO HATE ZEBRUH SINCE PLAYING THIS
      STORY.

      THERE ARE 60 THOUSAND MILES OF NERVES RUNNING IN MICROSCOPICALLY THIN LAYERS
      THROUGHOUT THE HUMAN BODY, IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM
      OF THOSE TENS OF THOUSANDS  OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF
      THE HATE I FEEL FOR ZEBRUH AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT. HATE. HATE.

      HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATEEEEEEEEEEEEE.


      [spoiler] Polypa''s [/spoiler] really nice though, I liked their route.'
