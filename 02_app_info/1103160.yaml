    review: 'Every time a new rhythm-based VR game with the ability to add your own
      music comes out, I buy it in hopes of it being  Beat Saber for my own music.  This
      game has the potential to actually do it. It is the second best rhythm VR game
      I have played, and it is still in early release.  This game is already good,
      and has the potential of being great if they can make a few improvements.


      Pros

      - Visually appealing

      - The auto-generator does a good job of matching the music

      - The auto-generator works faster than in most other games


      Cons

      - Kindergarten level is quite challenging; superhuman is never going to happen.  They
      need to adjust their difficulty settings to a more reasonable range.

      - Every block coming at you from your right has to be punched y your left hand,
      and vice versa.  This means that, when they are coming close together, their
      is a lot of bumping of the controllers.  At some point, controllers are going
      to get broken.

      - The navigation menu is a pain to find your own library.  I hope they will
      make this more intuitive.

      - The blocks are not vivid colors.  It looks like there is an option at the
      main menu to customize the blocks, but when I clicked on it, it did not do anything.

      - This game provides a decent workout.  It could be taken to the next level
      if they added the option of adding items to dodge or duck under.


      While the cons list is longer than the pros list, the pros far outweigh the
      cons. Overall, I am very impressed by the game.  This is a solid game with tons
      of potential.'
