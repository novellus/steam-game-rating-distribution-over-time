    review: 'The base game is one of my favorite zombie themed games, but this....


      Okay, let me break it down. The DLC expands on the story, and you must do it
      before finishing the main quest, but you can delay it indefinitely. You are
      free to come and go from the DLC islands, so if you just wish to grab the stuff,
      you can.


      However, the mechanics....

      There are new zombie types. An electrified zombie, and a heavily armoured zombie.
      The electrified zombie is literally immortal. If you kill it, it will just get
      back up in the next storm. Ad infinitum. Isn''t it great when the enemy has
      literally god mode on? Moving on, the heavily armoured zombie on the other hand
      is a pretty good addition, don''t listen to the NPC and popup, you can kill
      it with conventional weaponry, but fair warning, it takes 3 direct headshots
      from a high powered weapon (read, golden sniper rifle, golden three prong boomerang,
      forget melee, you''ll be torn limb from limb).


      The new fog mechanic is just annoying. Realistic, yes, and fog does come at
      appropriate times, like dawn, but it is annoying. To be fair, the implementation
      of it is neat, it''s realistic, it doesn''t last forever, so you can just wait
      it out.


      The storm pylons, however, are infuriating. They keep alive the electrified
      zombies even outside of a storm, and you have to either lure the electrified
      zombies out of it''s range, or drain it''s charge by recharging your DLC weapon
      but it will be recharged on the next storm by a lightning strike. Oh, and did
      I mention that the electrified zombies can simply charge each other, meaning
      if you kill one, you have to kill the other fast enough, or you''ll end up in
      a perpetual resurrection cycle? I''m sure there is a parallel world where this
      is considered as fun.


      The rest are... just gimmicks for the new islands. Like the iguana is just a
      reskinned deer, the boots are only useful there and nowhere else, the blowgun
      is only useful there and in fog...


      Essentially, I found this to be more frustrating than rewarding.'
