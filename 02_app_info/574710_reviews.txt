They also included permadeath to your crew so not everyone will come out alive as you escape the island.  Unfortunately, there's not a lot of meat to it.  Finding food at the beginning nearly killed the enjoyment for me.  I spent an extremely long amount of time trying to find food and I didn't want to sleep too much and let days pass so plants could grow again because I thought I may run out of time and get a bad ending.  Gathering food is just a time sink (like other things in the game) to pad your gameplay.  Once I got past that it became enjoyable again.  After this though I ran into a bad bug as when you arrive at the bunker and appear to walk back to camp you fall in a landslide which caused my game to crash.  I ended up under the water of a pool of blood or something with a lot of plants floating around me.  It was pretty wild looking floating around and I had to unclip from 3 different areas before I got back to normal ground.  When I was finally safe to go back to camp the baddie got me and permadeath for my character.  Since I encountered this bug and I didn't want to lose anyone I went and watched a video of the rest of the gameplay.  The bunker was just a large maze with no answers to the storyline as to what is going on.  You will find about 9 or so notes around the island that give you the gist of what happened in the past but you'd think the bunker would have gave us much more.  It is just a long maze to arrive at the end to just leave the bunker making it just another time padded event to further the gameplay.  After this you are just tasked with gathering a few other items before you can get off the island. No other storyline is revealed.  From here on it is just time padded events to complete while avoiding the baddie on the island and once you have gotten the items you get off the island with a small progress page to let you know how many days you survived and who survived with you.  No additional story is added to the end.  Overall it just makes the game feel empty and boring because it was mostly just a time sink to pad your gameplay before you head off the island.","timestamp_created":1597038026,"timestamp_updated":1597038026,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0cu46/MCf/LEmgI="}
