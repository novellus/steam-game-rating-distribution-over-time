It is a game with potential but most of the potential isn't used. It has very unique combat which is fairly challenging but fun. It lacks though in movement where it is slightly floaty and lacks difficulty in the parkour aspect. The weapon combat is fun but not really balanced where some weapons will just knock yours out of your hand. The judo throw is also quite over powered since there is almost no defense but timing right click in time to counter it. The last problem is the quality of the game; it feels like an early alpha game. The story modes aren't really well made since the dialogue is lazily made which makes it less immersive. There are a lot of awkward transitions and stock assets which reduce the quality of the game. Lastly the UI isn't very well made either and is too simple. The price shouldn't be where it is now considering how incomplete the game feels and there aren't many game changing or improvement updates.","timestamp_created":1396823911,"timestamp_updated":1610036688,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyMbq7vYCcK6YJQ=="}
