Its' Explosive Action made it one of the most Popular games ever back in the day... Now, Prepare yourself to Relive its' New Experience on Steam Clients for Modern PCs via DOSBOX...\"\n\nDuke Nukem 2 back in action & here on Steam for a Second Round! \nNow with awsome Shades from Duke Nukem Forever! \nApogee Software Rules the MS-DOSBOX once again!\n\nAs for the Story of the game, it's pretty much twice as much cool. It's 1998 & Duke Nukem has risen to Superstardom after defeating the Evil Dr. Proton. While being interviewed on a TV show, Duke Nukem is abducted by an Alien Race known as the Rigelatins & plan to steal Duke's Brain so they can Invade the Earth. However, the Rigelatins are pretty much all Muscle and No Brains as they not only spared Duke's Explodo-Molar allowing him to escape but some Rigelatin Engineer thought it was a good idea to build a Weapons Locker next to the Holding Cells in the Detention Block. So it's up to Duke to make the Rigelatins pay for underestimating him.","timestamp_created":1416849067,"timestamp_updated":1471235529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.38671499490737915","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kpOextYCdbDtMQ=="}
