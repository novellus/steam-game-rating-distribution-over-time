Though him shedding like 10 pounds a week is pretty obviously a benefit.\n\nI'm glad they went to a nutritionost for health advice rather than a normal doctor. People rarely understand the huge difference between the two. The nutritionost explained it pretty well.\n\nI wish Max the best, hope he takes care of himself.","timestamp_created":1522687850,"timestamp_updated":1522687850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593589365482330322","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4ZbRw+ICet6knQE="}
