    short_description: "A sweet jRPG-style game about cats, brutal massacres, cuteness,\
      \ racism and social issues, friendship, sinister thoughts, hilarity and Nazi\
      \ furniture. It\u2019s an epic attempt to blow your mind with adult themes hidden\
      \ behind bright cartoon graphics."
