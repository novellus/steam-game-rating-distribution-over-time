    review: 'This is my first time buying this kind of games and actually, i dint
      expect so much excitement for reading a visual novel about a detective case.


      As the summary of steam says, the story is about a detective who has to uncover
      a serial killer...

      Good draws, good music, and a good narrative to chill and relax.


      [spoiler] 8.8 hrs ended up in game over, apparently you can lose the game...
      i dint expect that  from this type of games, seems like you have to replay it
      [/spoiler]
