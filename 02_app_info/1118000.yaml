    review: "The writing is excellent and there are several interesting twists that\
      \ really deepen the intrigue. It seems like they're setting up for a sequel\
      \ and I definitely intend to play it if/when it comes out.\n\nNote though that\
      \ this seems more like a single story than a choose-your-own-adventure style\
      \ visual novel. I only played through a couple sets of different choices, but\
      \ from what I saw, the story is kind of linear and there aren't many different\
      \ endings. There are a couple key choices that really only have one option.\
      \ However, the quality of the story makes up for it. \n\nOne playthrough seems\
      \ to take around 2.5 hours, but I could easily see myself spending another couple\
      \ hours playing through different choices, so I feel like $5 is worth it."
