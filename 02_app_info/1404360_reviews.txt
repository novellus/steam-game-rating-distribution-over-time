Discovering the responses of the world, like the bugs or the regrowing trees is very fun in an adventurous way. A little story guides you well through the game.\nThe game controls are smooth and not annoying, like seen in a lot of VR experiences and games. For example, the pointer for selecting menu points and stuff becomes visible only if youre pressing a button (A / X on Oculus). How many youtube videos did I accidentally klick just because the controls of the video player were crappy! But this way, youre more in control what you select.\n\nThis was a nice, calm and fun experience, and Im really curious about Juniper Sky!","timestamp_created":1610008934,"timestamp_updated":1610008934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw59aA7vYCdsKcwQI="}
