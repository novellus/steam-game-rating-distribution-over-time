The sketches are a nice inclusion, but it's a mere glimpse into the creative process; no notes from the artist, or any other in-between images (like adjusting character poses or flat colours without shading). The art itself is good, and being able to look at it without the User Interface of the game is nice! But...well, you can't buy this Art Pack separately; you have to get the game. And if you care more about content than quality, then this add-on isn't really adding much you haven't already seen.\n\nWith all that said, why am I recommending this? Because I want to support Kidakash, the artist. I don't know how much of the sales goes to them, but the game plus art pack is less than five CDN dollars (and that's excluding sales); that's an incredibly cheap price for ten pictures that I assume must have taken quite a bit of effort to make, and I hope they get their fair share.","timestamp_created":1597520975,"timestamp_updated":1597523468,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540069699287414551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7rP0+fMCcMzXmwI="}
