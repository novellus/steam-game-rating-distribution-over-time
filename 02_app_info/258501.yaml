      \ Dinosaur Class.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n\u201CCrimson Crested\u201D Tupandactylus<br\
      \ />\nThe Tupandactylus, or more commonly referred to as \u201CTupa\u201D as\
      \ nobody outside of the science labs could pronounce it correctly, was never\
      \ actually intended to be cloned at all. There was in fact a mix-up with the\
      \ deliveries and a specimen marked as \u201CTapejara\u201D turned out not to\
      \ be so.  The situation was not helped when the lab boys tried to educate management\
      \ by showing them the difference between the two species to the reception of\
      \ blank stares and silent confusion.  Regardless of its origins however it has\
      \ been interesting to note that the \u201CTupa\u201D has a rather unique ability\
      \ compared to other previously cloned Pterosaurs, as its crest can in fact change\
      \ color depending on its current mood.  It\u2019s important to note then that\
      \ it turns red when angered.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n\u201CTropical\u201D Tupandactylus<br\
      \ />\n<br />\nThe \u201CTropical Tupa\u201D was designed as an attempt to create\
      \ an arboreal inclined variant of Pterosaur, so in regions far from coastal\
      \ cliffs and mountainous areas the species would be able to survive by roosting\
      \ in forest and jungle canopies without the natural instinctive tendencies to\
      \ roost on cliff sides.  This new behaviour and jungle camouflage was a huge\
      \ success, however roosting in trees is not a natural lifestyle for any large\
      \ pterosaur and it is common to see this particular breed of Tupandactylus scarred\
      \ and covered in wounds.  This has the unfortunate result of making these otherwise\
      \ aesthetically pleasing, beautiful and graceful animals rather irritable. \
      \ They are especially annoyed by loud noises as they don\u2019t ever actually\
      \ get a full or comfortable nights\u2019 sleep."
