If that appeals to you, you're in luck. If that doesn't appeal to you, why not?\n\nKnockout League does exactly what the screenshots tell you it's trying to do. It recreates the reactive, puzzle-like boxing action of Punch Out in VR, and it does it exceptionally well. You'll start out with the easy guys (and gals - the game is refreshingly gender inclusive), and work your way up to the heavy hitters. Each fighter has a unique style, and as you learn their tells, you'll figure out the best way to avoid their blows and attack in response. Get it right and you'll get a chance to lang a few hits before going back on the defensive. Mix up your swings for better results, and pay attention to direction.\n\nThe characters are great, the production value is high, and your trainer definitely feels like a throwback to Doc Louis. You'll work up a sweat and have fun doing it (the game will even count calories burned if you want it to).\n\nSummary:\nGraphics: 4/5\nImmersion: 4/5\nFun: 4/5\nComfort: 4/5\nFitness: 5/5\nBlack Eyes: 53","timestamp_created":1609609524,"timestamp_updated":1609609524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsoaN4vYCdYbmvwI="}
