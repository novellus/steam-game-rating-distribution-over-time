    review: Sensa Peso is similar to a Disney "It's a small world" in terms of concept.
      It's rather well put together but I feel it's let down by the hardware limitations
      (vive). The vistas it aims to offer all fall short due to the screen door effect,
      but really what killed the immersion for me was how 'flat' the backgrounds looked
      - I just couldn't shake of the sense that the sky, mountains, etc were all 10
      yards away, painted on a sphere. Disapointing, although probably not so much
      the fault of the developer rather than limiting hardware.
