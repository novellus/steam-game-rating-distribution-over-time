The music and sound effects were on point for each level! The degree of difficulty was challenging but attainable in order to unlock new levels.  I especially liked the level Take 2, I probably played it 15 times to get a perfect score.  I really enjoyed discovering different strategies on how to get better scores on each level.  If you are competetive like me, this game will not dissapoint!","timestamp_created":1463887105,"timestamp_updated":1463887105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.400828123092651367","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vpGe69QCdNSdWA=="}
