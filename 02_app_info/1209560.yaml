    review: 'as good as the main game, but with 10 new levels a bit short for the
      price imho. game quality is worth the price easily, but you get more fun for
      your money with the base game. I hope other dlcs will follow anyway.

      my review to the full game: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030604947/recommended/621010?snr=1_5_9__402

      and I still don''t like soccer :)'
