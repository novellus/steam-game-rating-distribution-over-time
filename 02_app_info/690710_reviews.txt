It's a very tricky game, especially at first as you are trying to learn the controls and how to play.\nThis compilation includes that original but also includes a psychedelic-style remake that includes a special version containing a high-scoring-enabling bug that was originally removed, and an \"idol version\" that has to be somehow unlocked.\nWhile the original is hard at first, the alternate version, which is a timed game, is a great addition and an ideal place to start. There are several graphics tweaks available to make it less or more funky, a couple of different control options and more, plus powerups and hidden items to add to the fun. This is also where you find an option for fullscreen play so go here first.\nWhile it seems a little pricey for a 1980 game, the fact that it's actually a compilation adds additional value and makes it more worth it. If you're a retro/arcade game collector this is a must-buy because this was one of the first arcade hits in Japan and remains a unique challenge to this day. The more-accessible alternate versions still make this worth a try as they are a lot of fun.","timestamp_created":1572309132,"timestamp_updated":1572309132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrqy7iu4CecGP1QE="}
