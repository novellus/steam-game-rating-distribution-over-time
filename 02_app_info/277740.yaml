    about_the_game: "The final steam locomotive built for Union Pacific, the FEF-3,\
      \ comes to Train Simulator from Smokebox with an extensive array of detailing\
      \ and features.<br><br>The FEF was a class of three steam locomotives built\
      \ by the American Locomotive Company (Alco) and operated by Union Pacific Railroad.\
      \ \u2018FEF\u2019 was an acronym of the locomotive\u2019s wheel arrangement\
      \ \u2013 4-8-4 \u2013 although they were also called \u2018800s\u2019, after\
      \ the running numbers they carried.<br><br>The first 20 FEF locomotives - named\
      \ FEF-1 - were delivered by Alco in 1937 with a second batch of 15 locomotives\
      \ \u2013 FEF-2 - delivered two years later. The remaining 10 locomotives in\
      \ the Class \u2013 FEF-3 - arrived in the early 1940s, and except from the use\
      \ of some substitute materials, were almost identical to the FEF-2 locomotives.<br><br>The\
      \ FEF-3 were the last steam locomotives delivered for Union Pacific and survived\
      \ well beyond World War II, with many of the locomotives being converted to\
      \ oil burning due to the short supply of coal following the War.<br><br>Locomotive\
      \ 844, the last of the FEF-3 Class, holds the honour of being the longest continuously\
      \ operating 4-8-4 locomotive in the World, and the only one never to be retired\
      \ by a Class I Railroad, continuing on regular services to this day. Three other\
      \ locomotives in the Class have survived, two of which are on permanent display\
      \ in the USA.<br><br>The FEF-3 for Train Simulator, developed by Smokebox, is\
      \ available in two all-black Union Pacific liveries, one of which includes white-walled\
      \ driving tyres, chrome finish on some parts, silver grey striping along the\
      \ edge of runboards, and gold painted cab front windows frames. The FEF-3 is\
      \ also fitted with diesel multiple unit (MU) controls, meaning it can run in\
      \ tandem with a diesel locomotive, and features functioning in-cab signalling\
      \ equipment.<br><br>You can drive the locomotive in both simple and advanced\
      \ modes, and it also includes a wealth of detailing and animated features, such\
      \ as animated valve gear and running gear, animated brake rigging and brake\
      \ pistons, opening cab doors, side windows, ventilator doors, roof hatch, front\
      \ storm windows, and side windshields, animated water level in tender, and realistic\
      \ wheelslip/wheelskid.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible,\
      \ giving you the freedom to drive the Union Pacific FEF-3 on any Quick Drive\
      \ enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.\
      \ Also included are scenarios specifically for the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/208286\"\

    review: "I highly reccommend this addon\n\nPros: highly detailed ( can lower FPS)\
      \ version, non HD versin ( ideal for if you want better FPS), TS Pro, can remove\
      \ smoke deflectors, change number, and remove Mars light. Great cab interior\n\
      \ncons: chuffing sound could be better , bell does not really sound like the\
      \ real 844, SD70ace that comes has the same recycled sounds, whistle could be\
      \ a bit better, rolling stock included could have been way better for excursions.\
      \ \n\nIdeal time to buy on a sale!"
