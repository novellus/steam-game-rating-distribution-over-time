    review: 'This music mixes well in a dark yet upbeat setting. I''d go as far as
      to say, even more movies, like "It Follows," is a good mix to get you in a spooky
      or pumped up mood, and I like this. Highly Reccomended.


      [h1] The songs [/h1]

      1.) A Smile Beneath Your Skin: A great start to the soundtrack, cute at first,
      industrial at the halfway mark

      2.) Amputated_Marshmallow: Again tones that sound like they should be in a SNES
      game, with a throbbing heartbeat in it.

      3.) Barophobia (demo): A slow intro to one of our first monsters, it''s a mysterious
      sound track which leads into the next song.

      4.) Barophobia (Float Away): Long string instrument and wind instrument pulls,
      with a piano attempting to represent the sound of water dropping from the ceiling,
      or stars twinkling in the sky

      5.) Blood_stained_giggle: Not so much a song, more like the game over sound.

      6.) Breakfast Was Too Early: A prominent piano plays a somewhat lullaby song
      in the first of 3 songs that are titled like they should be in a goldilocks
      childrens song.

      7.) Breakfast Was Too Late: The song previously becomes distorted in this remake,
      with more computer effects, some higher highs, lower lows, and a bit more chiptune
      than actual piano.

      8.) Breakfast Was Too Water Damaged: The previous song becomes a distorted mess,
      of songs played so they sound like they are in reverse, and breathing deeply
      through a filter on top.

      9.)Down the Habbit Role: Tones fall in and out, light breathign can be heard,
      and a Kalediscope of sounds, feels like you''re on a boat with Willie Wonka.

      10.) Dum Loopy Thing: Although it comes off like a nice market song for a video
      game, there is a low almost tibetan sounding tone that follows the entire song.
