The characters are likeable, relatable and believable, the story is engaging and the game is exactly long enough; it neither overstays its welcome nor leaves unanswered questions.\n\nWorth the purchase price and the fifteen or so hours of your time it will take to get through it.","timestamp_created":1608484742,"timestamp_updated":1608484742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt6zKwPYCc8XguwI="}
