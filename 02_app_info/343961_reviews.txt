With a few simple changes, it could have been so much better. It is not bad enough not to play, but I wished for more.\n\nI agree with ravenshammer that the best way to play this is to do the navigation as manually as possible (as the manual recommends) - getting into the spirit of navigation in the 1930s when there was no GPS. If you just follow the mission compass, this is a pretty boring mission series.\n\nPROS:\nThe best thing about this series is it gives me a purpose for flying. Otherwise I have to stare at the FREE FLIGHT page trying to think up my own interesting flights.\nThe missions all have rewards.\nLots of flight time in the Grumman Goose which is a really cool aeroplane.\nI like Rick's music that he plays on the flights.\nThe Custom Grumman's paintwork.\n\nCONS:\nThere isn't much swashbuckling adventure. Apart from missions 1, 12 and 19 it is just flying from one large airport (i.e. long, boring taxis) to another. In the rest of the missions, the most adventure we see is occasional bad weather. Where are the water landings / takeoffs in remote places which would use the capabilities of the iconic Grumman Goose?\nThe voice acting is desperately wooden.\nThere are almost no additional scenery objects. For all but 2 missions it's just stock FSX terrain and traffic.\nThe missions are linear - there are no user choices or alternative outcomes.\nThere is very little interaction with the treasure hunting team.\nThe overall narrative is almost non-existent: the first plot development happens about 10 mission in.\nIt's buggy: mission 4 crashes FSX and mission 5 does not give its reward. (See below for fixes.)\nThe missions are disjointed, jumping from one part of the world to another with no explanation of what happened in the gap.\n\nImportant notes / fixes:\n\nMission 1: This is easy to complete if you use the rudder to compensate for the asymmetric thrust generated by a single engine. However a huge caveat is that you simply cannot do it if Autorudder is switched on. So switch it off. Then be quick on the rudder and you'll be fine.\n\nMission 4: FSX usually crashes for me and others in this mission. Here's the solution: delete the file DLC\\343961\\Missions\\Treasure Hunt\\Treasure Hunt 4\\sound\\_recorded_b9b66705-3e41-4973-8d33-76010c0e3130.wav under the FSX install directory. Don't worry, you just lose one unnecessary line of dialogue saying \"Lets get underway on our next clue!\"\n\nMission 5: You don't get the reward because of a bug in the mission file. Use notepad to edit file DLC\\343961\\Missions\\Treasure Hunt\\Treasure Hunt 5\\TreasureHunt5.xml and find the line that starts with \"<RewardRef>\". Replace the text in the braces with \"C3891027-9D3B-468C-A7F1-D927EAAD9601\".","timestamp_created":1581888534,"timestamp_updated":1582279496,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlKLNs/ACf5Dg8gE="}
