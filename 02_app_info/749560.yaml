    review: 'What does this need to draw me in?

      A different control scheme. More specifically, one that is good.


      From what I''ve seen, there is two basic control types for games like this.
      Use buttons/stick to turn from side to side and press a button to move forward,
      OR press the arrow/stick in the direction that you want to go and you turn to
      face that direction automatically.


      The second option is by far superior. Unfortunately, the control method here
      is so poor and outdated that I honestly cannot play for more than half an hour
      before the painful gameplay pushes me to refund the game.


      Maybe there is a good story there, but I won''t see it because of the nigh unplayable
      controls that suck all the fun out of the experience. No brake. Bad turning.
      Guns that screw with your momentum. Lack of mouse support. It feels like an
      unintentional rage game, and I feel that it loses out for it.'
