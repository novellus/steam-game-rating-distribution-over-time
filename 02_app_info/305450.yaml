    reviews: "\u201CThere\u2019s a great deal of angst, possibilities for romance\
      \ and plenty of conspiracies and crimes, some of which I\u2019ve been committing\
      \ myself. Adam Apple, also known as Fantabulous, creates energy shields with\
      \ ease, has punched thugs into submission, soars through the air with ease and\
      \ attempts to seduce everyone he meets. The little tinker would seduce a death\
      \ ray into submission if he thought it would respond to his dubious charms.\u201D\

      Sometimes, gamebooks offer blind choices, force illogical decisions, or allow\
      \ for strategic decision making but not moral conundrums. Heroes Rise does a\
      \ great job with the design and writing of its decision points. Some are pure\
      \ action and strategy, but most are focused on who you are as a hero (or, potentially,\
      \ a villain) and how you will relate to those around you.\u201D<br>4/5 \u2013\

    review: This was really fun to read and imagine how everything looks to the readers
      point of View I absolutly adore this and Now I know I will be buying the rest
      soon if not now so I can continue the story :3 10 out of 10 for me. It also
      has replay quality as well to start as a new hero :P omg I am going to buy this.
      Anyone who reads this or thinks about this game needs to play the first 5 chapters
      :3 turst me its worth it that is if you have a great imgination for things like
      this it is creative fun and I know I wasn't Disapointed at all.
