They're stupid and you're smacked in the face immediately with political crap. I'm not here for that.\nThe presentation is not particularly enticing and the couple minutes of gameplay is pathetic.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game, it just needs a lot more polish.\nRe-do the mechs so that they can walk over stuff like cars and smaller stuff, add more variety to the gameplay other than just running around shooting llamas, and take out the stupid jokes, all of 'em. Matter of fact, take out the entire expository intro and just say, \"You'll be killing llamas.\"\nAlso decrease the price by more than half. Fourteen dollars for this is quite excessive for what it is.","timestamp_created":1580015146,"timestamp_updated":1580015146,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534591197967529297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwbqP8O8CeL+R7gE="}
