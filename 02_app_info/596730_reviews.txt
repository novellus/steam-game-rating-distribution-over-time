FIRST VIDEO REVIEW BELOW:\n(..I only wish I could say that this game was worth my time playing and reviewing it)\n\nNO.  Don't Do it!  This game, while good enough looking in the trailer is nothing but an utter super buggy mess and virtually unplayable.  It feels and looks like yet another developer who's muddled around in the Unity engine enough to slap together some assets purchased on the Unity store but who knows nothing about actually making the game \"work\" as intended.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5nIVBZWVFk&feature=youtu.be\n\nThe only thing that works in this game is the movie cut scenes.  When you are able to take control of the player, you walk through trees, and deer attack you on sight which is ridiculous.  So you mindless hit your M1 button to take out the deer only to see your character suddenly fall through the ground to a \"You Died\" screen.\n\nTerrible.  Not recommended.  This game was fortunate to get a 7% (out of 100) score from me.","timestamp_created":1531346727,"timestamp_updated":1531353740,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.73687058687210083","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1531420556,"developer_response":"We're extremely sorry that you have had to face problems with our game.
