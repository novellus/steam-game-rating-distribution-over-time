    developer_response: 'Hi Ardyn, thanks for your honest and detailed review and
      I''m sorry about the issues you''ve encountered.


      If you have the time I''d ask you to please make a zip file with your savegames
      and game log files so that I can look into the issues you had. You''ll find
      them by navigating to the Steam\SteamApps\common\Elium - Prison Escape folder.
      Just pack the contents of the Saves folder and also the contents of the UDKGame\Logs
      folder, Then send the zip file to support@eliumgame.com


      Normally an enemy with inferior gear shouldn''t take that many hits to kill.
      It''s possible that you''re only hitting them with the tip of the blade due
      to not being close enough, or just hitting non vulnerable body parts. However
      it might be possible that some of the balancing might not be working correctly,
      or some of the gear not working correctly. With your save file I probably can
      pinpoint the issue.


      The lost gear after a level transition is definitely a bug, and one that was
      supposedly fixed in a previous patch. Seems there''s traces of it unfortunately.
      Getting your save file would be crucial here as well, especially if you could
      indicate the save name where it showed up.


      Lastly about the steep geometry, none of the hallways are designed to prevent
      the AI from climbing so it''s again a bug. It might either be the pathfinding
      being unable to climb (if the stairs were in the middle of a hallway) or the
      dungeon generator incorrectly stitching the room and the hallway (if the stairs
      were near a door). If it''s the former case a screenshot would be of great help,
      if the latter the log files would help me find the faulty stitched room hallway.


      I hope you can find the time to provide the files to lend a hand into fixing
      these problems, and sorry again for these faults that prevent from enjoying
      the game.'

    review: 'I bought this game In baited anticipation in hopes of finding another
      good semi-roguelike game. Needless to say, I was disappointed by my purchase
      of this game.


      For starters "Is the game fun?" Yes, it can be. Would I recommend buying it?
      Based on my experience, no, you shouldn''t. At least not until some of the game''s
      quirks are ironed out.


      Graphically speaking, it''s okay, I''ve seen better by Unity''s standard, it
      runs good enough on most rigs. The combat does have it''s moments (but I will
      talk about that in a bit). Level design is about on par with what I expect from
      Indie developers, but there are a couple questionable choices.


      Story wise, there really isn''t any. Your a prisoner, and you need to escape
      and can pretty much be beaten in under 4 hours, hell even 2. There are a couple
      of different modes to try out, and cheats that you can play with in the game
      after you unlock them.


      But truthfully speaking, there''s not a lot in here, and what little there is
      definitely needs some polish.


      One of my biggest cons with this game is it''s combat system. The combat system,
      does require a tad bit of skill to learn. The gist of it is you can swing your
      weapon in 4 different directions, left, right, thrust, and down (Overhead),
      kick, and blunt strike. For defensive options you have block, and dodge (pretty
      standard), however there is a limited amount of physics in the game, so there
      will be times when your weapon collides with another''s and can cause an attack
      to bounce.


      That being said, the amount of times I''ve died due to some bullsh*t reason
      is part of why I can''t reccomend this game. It''s not my lack of skill, but
      rather the inconsistent damage output by the game. For example I could swing
      my sword at a guard who has inferior weapons and gear to me, and it takes me
      4-5 hits, but he can swing his sword, and 1 shot me when I have full health,
      better weapons, and gear to boot. Or the times when the enemy stun locks me,
      or hits me 2 times and all my health is gone, but for some reason, I''m essentially
      tickling him with my weapon.


      Enemy variety is extremely lacking. there are guards wearing different color
      tabbards, but you''ll only be facing 1 or 2 enemies at any given time, and 3
      at the end of the game. They usually carry the same or weaker type of weapons
      than you do, but it won''t matter because they can still 1-shot you, while your
      stabbing them with a butter knife.


      The AI, is completely brain dead, at least for the companions you can recruit
      across the levels. When you kill one of the enemies, the AI will stop whatever
      it''s doing, run over to the body, steal all the gear before you can even grab
      it, and then stand there like nothing. Or in other instances, they will walk
      right in front of your sword swing and you''ll end up killing them instead of
      the guy your trying to fight. In multiple instances, I could have my companions
      tricked out with the best gear I can find, and then they run over to the body
      of a dead guard, take and equip the shield for some god da*n reason, and then
      I have to change it back.


      the "Stealth" mechanics in this game are laughable at best, and never worked
      in my experience. There will have been times when I''m trying to sneak and the
      enemy spots me almost immediately even when I''m making no noise whatsoever,
      and there have also been times when I''ve ran right up to an enemy and they
      didn''t notice me until I smacked them with my sword.


      The money you find in the prison, can''t even be used for anything, except for
      an achievement, so really don''t bother. Or there will be times when Items are
      straight up removed from your inventory for no reason. I had 4 health potions,
      a long sword, and a short sword, I start the second level, all my health potions
      gone, my swords, gone and even some of my equipment, gone. In my first playthrough
      as I was trying to get all of Jarren''s equipment, most of the stuff I had just
      disappeared at the start of next level, making it impossible to get.


      Then the "Rogue-like" elements are more or less just a couple of pre-rendered
      hallways and such, copy pasted through out the 2-3 hour treck you have to endure.
      Not to mention, there is one type of hallway that you just simply can''t walk
      up, because of how steep the geometry is. That means you have to jump it, and
      since any AI is basically retarded, they don''t know how to jump up, or even
      navigate the steps themselves.


      Overall, don''t buy this game as is, wait until it''s on sale, or if more content
      is added.'
