Honestly I have no idea why this game isn't popular. It's fun to play singleplayer against the AI, which can be put on levels 1-5. Level 1 is pretty easy, and level 5 is nearly impossible. This game has tons of troops, and infinite replayability with the map creator. Which can make maps that are from 5x5 to 32x5 to 32x32. Get this game, it is 100% worth the $1.99","timestamp_created":1577598528,"timestamp_updated":1577598528,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538891494274139404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoOWMqO8CfpT85wE="}
