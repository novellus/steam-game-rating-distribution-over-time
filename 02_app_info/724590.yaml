    review: "I\u2019ve played the free version in the past and just bought this one\
      \ because I really liked the free version and wanted to know what\u2019s new\
      \ and all the improvements. So far, I really liked my experience. It might not\
      \ look like it when you look at the text below, but these are little bugs mostly.\
      \ Overall, it\u2019s clearly worth it. There is so much information but well\
      \ presented in this, it\u2019s awesome.\n\n[b]What I liked the most:[/b]\n-The\
      \ graphics are really good\n-There are more and better animations (sometimes\
      \ a bit disgusting but that is really how the body works! lol) I really liked\
      \ the intestine movement and the eye\n-Lots of information about each parts\n\
      -It is very instructive\n\n[b]What I didn\u2019t like:[/b]\n-I wish you could\
      \ zoom in as much as you want, even if it means going through the 3D. Right\
      \ now you are blocked after zooming a bit in and you can pull the object toward\
      \ you but it is also blocked at some point.\n-The main menu bar right in front\
      \ of you is locked in. It\u2019d be nice to be able to grab and move it on the\
      \ side to have a full clear view in front of you\n-All menus are always rendered\
      \ on top of what you look at. Which means sometimes if you are very close to\
      \ an object, the menu will not render the same way on each eye making it very\
      \ confusing for your brain to interpret the position of the menu. I think it\
      \ should simply be based on distance, and maybe if something goes through, just\
      \ make it transparent ?\n-The interior view of the lung is removed compared\
      \ to the free version, why? It was very nice to be inside the lung and see the\
      \ air flow and restrictions with diseases\n-The blood flow within the heart\
      \ seems to be removed too, it\u2019d be nice to have it back.\n-The loading\
      \ screen when transitioning part was the thing that makes the most motion sickness\
      \ because you pass from being able to move your head around as much as you want\
      \ to a still image which is really looking bad. At the very least, it should\
      \ allow your head to still move around while loading and not have a still image.\n\
      -There are some pointing priority bugs between menus. For example, you can pull\
      \ toward you the description menu with text, while behind there is the menu\
      \ to pick individual parts and when you scroll it sometimes gets buggy with\
      \ the pointer going through the menu.\n-There is also a little bug on some menus\
      \ where when you point at the edge of the menu, it oscillates fast between getting\
      \ bigger (because you \u201Cmoved your pointer inside\u201D) and smaller (because\
      \ some parts are transparent and you point outside the menu). This could be\
      \ fixed if there were no holes in the menu.\n-The circle you move in the menus\
      \ to pick the divisions you want to see seems to be irresponsive. You can click\
      \ it to move, but only when moving it enough does it starts to move and quite\
      \ often becomes offset from the pointer. In general, whatever part of the menu\
      \ you click-and-hold like sliders or that picking circle, you should be able\
      \ to move it even when your cursor moves out of the menu or the slider. (Imagine\
      \ your internet scrollbar if you click-and-hold and move your mouse outside\
      \ the scrollbar you can still scroll, same thing would apply here)\n-The menus\
      \ kept resetting its position to default when changing object which was a bit\
      \ annoying because the description menu is a bit too far if you want to read,\
      \ so you have to grab it and get it close to your face. I wish I could just\
      \ move it where I want and make it stay there between scenes.\n-You also removed\
      \ the polyps in the intestines disease?\n-It also happened that some tooltips\
      \ when you wait pointing at a button appeared behind another menu making it\
      \ impossible to read.\n-It also happened that when trying to point something\
      \ at the bottom of a menu the other menu under it would pop up and I couldn\u2019\
      t click on what I wanted. I had to move the menu away. (Even when trying to\
      \ point from a top-down direction instead of bottom-up.\n\n[b]Suggestions:[/b]\n\
      -More free camera movement on zooming and moving up/down\n-Remove menu\u2019\
      s rendering priority and add transparency to what is in front of the menu\n\
      -There are quite a couple typos with mostly apostrophes in text that renders\
      \ as a big square\n-Add back the lungs interior view\n-Add blood flow in the\
      \ heart\n-Change the still image from transition\u2019s loading to something\
      \ you can look at\n-It\u2019d be nice to be able to visually point at parts\
      \ of what you see and have the name of it appears and if you click it, it would\
      \ open the description. Right now your pointer just goes through the visuals.\n\
      -Add some background light music, it gets a bit boring when reading text that\
      \ has no voice over (and whoever doesn\u2019t want music you already have the\
      \ sound menu for that)\n\n[b]What I look forward:[/b]\n-More interior views,\
      \ these are awesome, really miss the lungs one\n-Skeleton view\n-More or Less\
      \ interesting parts like hands, feet, legs, etc.\n-More animations like the\
      \ eye\n-Visuals of what happen when you get fattier, where you accumulate fat,\
      \ etc.\n"
