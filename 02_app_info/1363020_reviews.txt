I can't find a way to get in touch with the developer of the game to inform him of this, and hope he will see this review of mine about his game and will respond back  very soon. No other floor did I encounter this incident on. I was  going to recommend this game after I beat the game, but I won't be able to beat the game until there is an update that causes this issue to get resolved. Until such time, I will have to skip playing the game since there's no way around the rock/boulder blocking the exit that I can see.","timestamp_created":1598975179,"timestamp_updated":1598975179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548668026924133301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1599366702,"developer_response":"Thank you for reporting the problem.\nI apologize for any mistakes made.\nNow I have solves that problem.\nThank you for playing my game.\n\nJonathan.S"}],"cursor":"AoJ4j5+WpfQCeKWVnwI="}
