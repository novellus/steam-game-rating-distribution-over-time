With a lot of help from engineers and compression specialists at <strong>Pixvana's SPIN Studio<\/strong>, we were able to push the quality of stereoscopic (3D) 360° streaming video beyond what was previously believed possible. <br><br>With the January 2018 update, we're happy to introduce new encodings of <i>Prismatic<\/i>, featuring brand new <strong>highest bitrate settings<\/strong> and optimizations to all streaming quality tiers. <br><br>Enjoy!<\/p><br><h1>About the Video<\/h1><i>Experience human-size kaleidoscope,<br>infinite reflections, strobes, colors and music.<\/i><br><br>Prismatic was Quba Michalski's first independent project after leaving his position as Creative Director at Autofuss and Google in 2015. It has begun as a proof‑of‑concept animatic for a larger, practical set. Soon though it took life on its own as a self-standing animation I am happy to share with you here.<br><br>The space was designed to create an illusion of never-ending stage while using a set only a few paces across. Drawing inspiration from children’s kaleidoscopes, I created a system of large mirrors and lights, infinitely illuminating and reflecting one another. The lights themselves were then carefully sequenced and choreographed to the sound of EDM glitch-hop track composed by acclaimed demoscene musician, h0ffman.<br><br>Rendered using a custom-built QubaVR stereoscopic capture and stitching rig, Prismatic is an audio-visual treat, that will make you feel present in its colorful, abstract, virtual environment.<br><br><strong>Note:<\/strong><br>For the sake of full disclosure - yes, you can find this film legally and for free elsewhere on the Internet. Purchasing it on Steam will help show your appreciation of QubaVR's work on this funded-out-of-pocket art project.","about_the_game":"<i>Experience human-size kaleidoscope,<br>infinite reflections, strobes, colors and music.<\/i><br><br>Prismatic was Quba Michalski's first independent project after leaving his position as Creative Director at Autofuss and Google in 2015.
