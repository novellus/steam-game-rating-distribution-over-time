Tried out all of the models/paints at Castle Rock, in the rain, starting at Monument to challenge the 2.3% grade with the default strings of 3 x locos + 70 bnsf hoppers. It was mixed at best. The V2 package gives you M, M-2, Aces and MAC.\n\nSD70M + SD70M-2 + BNSF Aces + BNSF MAC:\n   No weather effects at all\n   Supreme traction at low speeds\n   Climbs 2.3% grade in rain with ease\n   Weak top speed, seemed to slow even downhill\n   Nice model and sounds\n\nSD70MAC CSX Livery Add-on:\n   Weather effects in full\n   Wheel spin at greater than 11% throttle\n   Had to use sander to get out of 0% grade yard\n   Made no attempt at climbing 2.3% grade\n   Didn't reach 9 mph before aborting the Quick Drive\n\nCONCLUSION:\n   What is there to say except that the CSX add-on livery somehow includes weather effects despite using this very same package in which no other locos have weather effects at all? Also, the tractive effort of the V2 locos, even in wet, was monstrous while the CSX add-on was spinning wheels at every speed and even spins wheels at 22% (notch 2) throttle while using sander but, if given time, will slowly pick up speed. VERY SLOWLY.\n\n   Meanwhile, ALL locos, including add-on, and the included string of 70 hoppers on default consist packages, all suffered clipping and colliding with each other during dynamic braking and/or train braking. If you brake hard enough it derails the train every time. Just using low amounts of dynamic braking (below 30%) was enough to make the cars and locos touch each other. Dynamic strongly, going above 50% you'll see the cars/locos going into each other and, with a little more dynamic braking, apparently go so far into each others model that it eventually results in a derailment. Dynamic combined with train braking results in a derailment literally as soon as the pressure gauge on train brakes shows an increase. And speaking of the V2 packages supreme amounts of tractive effort... you put those into dynamic braking and the camera moves so wildly that it looks like you're being thrown out the windshield! And when you release the dynamic breaking, you literally gain 5 mph increase in speed immediately while looking like you're being thrown out the back door. It's crazy! How the train doesn't derail outright during that is something that I'm sure has the ghost of Einstein equally baffled as I am.\n\nUNACCEPTABLE. The package shouldn't even be out of BETA stage. That the package is allowed to be sold in such a state on Steam is baffling. Known, game-breaking (braking?) issues that should be fixed at the very least. And why the add-on loco has full weather effects but the V2 package locos have no effects at all is a real head scratcher. It's literally like a team of employees all worked in separate rooms with no communication or coordination between them and you end up with a hodge-podge of wildly varying results from one loco to the next.\n\nI will update this review as I further explore the mysteries of this odd package. I plan on running these locos as helpers or pushers and mixed in with scores of other locos, maybe do a mass power move and see how the locos behave with others. My guess, the same results. We'll see.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nTried a lot of experimentation. It's cons of the rubber banding couplers is a liability no matter if a single train or part of a large power move. You can get from Point A to Point B but it will require a lot of patience and attention to speed management. Due to the coupler stretch and possibility of derailment from too heavy braking, this will require you to both plan ahead and be patient in doing so. Don't just take off at 100% throttle. Just use up to 2 notches to get it rolling and let the coupler stretch some, after a few mph increase a notch and i'd say above 10 mph you can probably go up to 50% throttle without too much coupler stretch. From 20-22 mph onward then you can feel more at ease running the power on up to full if needed.\n\nNow, the opposite will be required for braking and not derailing. Don't just fly into the yard like you can do with some of the basic locos and lock down the dynamic and train brakes together. You need to coordinate and gradually increase the braking much like above in terms of throttling up. Apply a bit at a time and as the train settles into braking posture then you can start increasing and keep an eye on exterior view of cars/couplers if you need. I'd probably say to practice on exterior view so you can get an idea, a feel as it were, of what the train/couplers are doing as you are braking. Once you see how it settles in, then you can better judge what you can get away with from just the cab view. HOWEVER: Be careful with the dynamic engine/trans braking as applying too much, too quickly, will literally throw you out and destabilize the train and possibly lead to a derailment. Again, only one or two notches when first applying the dynamic, then as the train settles into braking posture you can slowly increase as needed. Same with the train's brake, slowly increase over time and let the train settle and increase as needed to bring it to a stop. \n\nI'm still not sure whether to recommend. For the casual gamer or novice? NO. For an experienced player who has patience to work with the flaws, maybe. I can overlook lack of weather effects, or poor sounds, minor quirks, etc. But it's frustrating dealing with rubber-banding couplers that make you feel unsafe at any speed.\n\nOne last note, the Academy SD70M in the game can be used in both Quick Drive and scenarios. It has all the weather effects visible, it's a great driving unit, cab is flush with interactive controls, everything works, and most of all the couplers are reliable and don't rubber-band all over the place. It's a solid work of art. So why doesn't DTG base these other SD70 packages off of that model?? Also, the Sherman Hill has a UP SD70M that is a great driving package too. If you can't bring this SD70 V2 package up to those standards, then why not just release these liveries for the SD70M in the game that works perfectly?","timestamp_created":1606902910,"timestamp_updated":1606983848,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhPLsk/YCeqbctgI="}
