      and psychology. Descriptions of every kind of elf abound. Rounding out this

      what you thought you knew about elves - The Complete Book of Elves sheds new
      light on this mysterious race!<h2 class="bb_tag">Product History</h2><br>Colin
      McComb, author of The Complete Book of Elves (1992), recently gave a somewhat
      unconvincing apology as part of a Kickstarter reward: Book of Elves has a reputation
      of being the most over-powered 2e Complete book. McComb states that, for his
      first professional RPG project, he chose to balance fantastic, creative ideas
      with roleplaying checks and balances instead of mechanical constraints. He''s
      clearly still proud of his work, as he has a right to be, and while he''s apologizing
      on film you can still see that he loves this book.<br><br>]The Complete Book
      of Elves is much like The Complete Bard''s Handbook in that it''s filled with
      really clever, fun, creative ideas that happen to shove game balance out the
      window and wave it goodbye as it plummets, laughing and singing all the way,
      to the stony ground below.<br><br>Individually, each small rule doesn''t cause
      too much fuss. If they are taken collectively, though, a DM needs to be strict
      in order to prevent elven PCs from quickly overshadowing other characters.<br><br>What
      I like about this title, though, is that, even with the problems outlined above,
      it''s a rich collection of imaginative ideas and clever design. The non-crunchy
      flavor text is a superb description of how to play an elf. As a testament to
      its place in the D&amp;D oeuvre, a few of the kits first introduced here (such
      as the spellfilcher and bladesinger) have made it into every edition of the
      game since.<br><br><strong>An Elf by Any Other Name. </strong>The book starts
      by delving into elven history and mythology. Not a lot had been written about
      this previously, and McComb expounds on the creation myth, the shooting of the
      chief orcish god Gruumsh, and the split that created the drow elves. Elven sub-races
      are explained for every campaign setting, with rules, history, philosophy and
      culture discussed. The elven tree of evolution, showing a unified approach to
      elves in different campaigns, is particularly interesting.<br><br>It''s in the
      third chapter, &quot;Physical Attributes,&quot; where power inflation starts
      to appear. McComb gives elves the ability to empathically share their feelings
      in exchange for combat bonuses, gives them resistance to heat and cold, suggests
      that they are largely resistant to diseases, and provides them with the ability
      to &quot;manifest.&quot; Best described as the ability to suddenly loom large
      and become imposing, manifestation admittedly has little game mechanical impact
      outside of roleplaying.<br><br>Elven society, mental attributes, elven holy
      days, elven myths, death, dwellings, all are discussed with respect and reverence
      for the race. I think it''s this reverence - clearly inspired by Tolkien''s
      beatific elves - that rubs some people the wrong way: Despite the remarkable
      creativity, it''s not uncommon for someone reading these chapters to intone,
      &quot;Who''s the prettiest? Elves are the prettiest!&quot; It''s perhaps hard
      to relate to a race that often lives in such an ethereal, gentle state of grace.<br><br><strong>One
      Bow to Rule Them All. </strong>Optional rules expand an elven PC''s power. Level
      limits are extended. Bonus proficiencies are granted. Special fighting styles
      such as bladesinging are explained, and seven new archery techniques are explained.
      These allow an elf to shoot out mounts beneath riders, shoot two arrows on one
      bow, shoot bows with their feet, hang upside from trees by their feet to shoot
      bows, shoot up to 5 arrows in one round at an accuracy penalty, staple people
      to trees with arrows, and use a trick shot for special effects. All are cool,
      creative techniques... but they''re techniques that give elves extra combat
      power without allowing the techniques to non-elven archers as well.<br><br><strong>Elven
      kits share the same flaw. </strong>They make elves tremendously fun to play,
      at the expense of possibly unbalancing play. Special hindrances are often roleplaying-based,
      while special benefits are usually mechanical in nature. In the hands of a player
      who is willing to let roleplaying slip a bit, this is undeniably problematic.<br><br>All
      that said, this book is a still a trove of good ideas, especially when it comes
      to rounding out elven society and understanding where your elven PC comes from.
      Its reputation for power inflation may be justified, but the vast majority of
      the book is filled with superb roleplaying advice and racial background.<br><br>And
      hey, any rules supplement that triggers an apology when the Kickstarter hits
      $2.5 million has to be worth reading for that reason alone.<br><br><strong>About
