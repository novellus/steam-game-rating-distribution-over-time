DLC should be added value.\nI'm actually enjoying WRC 5 more than Dirt Rally 2.0, Dirt 4 and Dirt Rally. \nIt will take a little bit of practice to get used to the mechanics. Once you do, you'll enjoy these rally stages a lot.\nThe game has some issues and no game is perfect. This is a good buy on sale.","timestamp_created":1609323601,"timestamp_updated":1609459993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mtHS3fYCfYXevgI="}
