    review: "First, please see my hours played and, if you like, achievements for\
      \ this game. Unlike most reviewers, I have actually played it long enough to\
      \ figure it out.\n\nThis is a small, relatively simple (but still surprisingly\
      \ deep) turn-based hex-grid strategy game with somewhat generic characters,\
      \ simple graphics, and simple animations. It'll likely run on half of a potato.\
      \ It's also $3 USD. \n\nIt's not hard, but it's not too easy, and you definitely\
      \ need to invest the time to learn the game's quirks before you're going to\
      \ \"get it,\" as evidenced by many of the other reviews. \n\nIt has some bugs.\
      \ The Grim Reaper will crash the game, as will hovering over skills for angels.\
      \ As long as you leave those two units out of the mix, which is easily done,\
      \ the game is completely stable. Considering this under $5 game is nearly four\
      \ years, its time may have come and gone, but who knows, the developer might\
      \ come back and patch it up for those two units. More than likely, they worked\
      \ fine four years ago, but since the forum community here on Steam went completely\
      \ dead back in 2016, I can understand why the developer might just decide not\
      \ to mess with it. Four years can introduce a lot of goofy bugs from various\
      \ hardware, drivers, and Windows itself. \n\nBYO music as the music in-game\
      \ is the one really nice metal track, one less nice track that fits the game's\
      \ graphics significantly better and...that's it for music. \n\nAside from those\
      \ minor bugs, the game is very playable and fun, so long as you like turn-based\
