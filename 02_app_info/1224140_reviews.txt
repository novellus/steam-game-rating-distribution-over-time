It does tend to fit in well with game you want to relax in)\n------\n\nSongs in this collection I especially enjoyed were \"Sereng!\" (a fiesty beat, good for a battle theme); \"Terlahir Dari Lautan ~ Night\" (that singing was so relaxing and soothing); and \"Nyanian Pulau\" (the sounds of water crashing make that tune work so well).\n\n(Some of the songs are named in English, and some are named in Indonesian. \n(The three I named above translate as \"Attack!\", \"Born from the ocean\", and \"Island Song\", respectively)","timestamp_created":1603517364,"timestamp_updated":1603517364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8qbFrPUCd+PgqQI="}
