    review: A nice little variety DLC adding a new campaign and challenge mode to
      fill your tug-of-war needs. The humor and writing is still great but this DLC
      does nothing to alleviate the negatives of the main game unfortunately. A good
      example of a DLC to get on sale if tug-of-war is a game style you simply cannot
      get enough of but otherwise well worth skipping, much like the main game.
