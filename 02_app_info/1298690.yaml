    about_the_game: "Nigel is a former French special forces soldier. When he returned\
      \ home after combats, he decided to leave the army and find an ordinary job\
      \ in an office. One day, an army of terrorists invaded his workplace. Nigel\
      \ had therefore to resume service to teach these bastards a lesson and find\
      \ a way out.<br><br><i>\u201CI won\u2019t let any of these parasites survive.\u201D\
      </i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Old fashioned FPS.</strong></h2><br>The episode\
      \ 1 upholds the fundamentals of an old school FPS. Lots of action, lots of blood,\
      \ lots of villains and no unnecessary stuff. There is no \u201Ctimeout\u201D\
      \ when you play this game. Exaggerated and brutal violence that we like. But\
      \ you won\u2019t be able to rush if you want to avoid premature death. Be smart.\
      \ Be lethal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Don\u2019t forget to use your brain.</strong></h2><br>Office\
      \ buildings are a lot like labyrinths. Nigel will probably not be able to use\
      \ his usual route to get out. Sometimes, the way out won\u2019t be obvious,\
      \ so you\u2019ll have to find the exit door that will get you out of this nightmare.\
      \ These doors will either bring you closer to the exit or closer to imminent\
      \ death. One thing is certain, it won\u2019t be easy \u201Cto navigate\u201D\
      \ your way through a complex network of rooms, filled in with enemies, and remain\
      \ alive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The strong points:</strong></h2><br><ul\

      \ you are one of those gamers that enjoy shooting anything that moves without\
      \ thinking and hiding behind a wall, the easy mode will suit you well. If you\
      \ want to play as a Special Force soldier, the impossible mode will be the right\

      \ you. The villains will never appear twice in the same place. You will have\
