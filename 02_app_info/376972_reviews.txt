Anyone looking for a realistic railsim experience will be sorely disappointed. \n\nSome major issues are as follows:\n-Locomotive audio comes from 5 feet infront of every engine for some reason???\n-Terrible TERRIBLE physics, I have to drive these engines on very low power with all the consist handbrakes on just to nerf the insane acceleration and power these engines have for some reason. \n-Outdated models that look the part from a far but on inspection are sorely lacking. \n\nAll that said however, there is nothing else like this in Train Simulator, and I commend the developers if for nothing else, for representing this era of logging motive power.  Theres also some great assets for route building, and some very nice looking logging rolling stock to pull. Its hard to deny the attractiveness of diminutive engines like these!\n\nMy recommendation for the devs (who should message me if they read this and I'll provide the full list of ways to improve these engines) Is to update the pack to fix two glaring issues, which should be rather simple to amend:\n\n1. Place the audio source for each engine in the correct location, so that it doesn't sound as if there's a ghost engine 5 ft in front of the actual one\n2. Tweak the physics so that acceleration is harder, friction effects the engines more, pulling power reduced with heavy loads (no amount of weight will slow this engine down)\n\n\nTLDR, if you love mining and logging engines, its worth picking this up on sale. I will certainly get 10 bucks of fun out of route building and playing with these little guys.","timestamp_created":1608775267,"timestamp_updated":1608775267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4q86eyfYCfcfSvAI="}
