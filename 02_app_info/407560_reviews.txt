Killing room is a cruel, sick, and downright disturbing of a reality show where you participate thinking that have nothing to lose. It is just demonic when there is a bunch of enemies that will instantly kill you when you enter a room. The giggle you give off when knowing what is about to happen when they give you an easy room on purpose. Enemies go faster than light or attack you with Mach 5 speed. This is a game that makes you die over and over and over again where each try you have a different power up from the start with a new person going through the obstacle. Is it worth it?....Yes? if you want a challenge like no other. Try playing it if you want to test your limits.","timestamp_created":1610018612,"timestamp_updated":1610018612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwssyl7vYCc+yfwQI="}
