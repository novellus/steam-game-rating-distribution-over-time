Game seems more balanced now. Overall this is one of the most underated shoot em up game on steam right now. The gameplay is fast-paced and challenging. Developers have done a great job in making the missions engaging and creative. You are avoiding bullets, enemies and hazards all the time while doing missions so your awareness matters at all time.The difficulty curve is also pretty fair while maintaining intensity of the game. The game has good content for price. We can get from different guns, sidekicks and planes while levelling up which helps the feel of progression. Lastly I laughed out loudly on some of the bosses’s names. Overall a job well done.","timestamp_created":1559430768,"timestamp_updated":1559430768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw2KTUiusCe8zHwgE="}
