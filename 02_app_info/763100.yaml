    review: "Wow, after looking at this game for a long time and on the fence about\
      \ buying it......I waited till it was on sale a purchased it. I have to say\
      \ this game is very good and heading in the right direction. I knew this after\
      \ 5 minutes of playing and truck got stuck in the mud and wouldn't move....I\
      \ have been waiting for the longest time for sim games to get this right....make\
      \ it hard and difficult and risky to just drive off anywhere. Winches now have\
      \ a purpose and so many other game could learn from this. \n\nChallenging equals\
      \ not only fun and a sense of accomplishment, but as well longevity. I am truly\
      \ hoping for continued support and development of this game. \n\nThe devs are\
      \ very quick to respond as well and very supportive. \n\nIf you like actual\
      \ simulation more than just the word this is the game for you!"
