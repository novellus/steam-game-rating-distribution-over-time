The puzzles, themselves, were quite good. I did not like the fact that I had to go all the way back to the beginning of a chapter when I began to play again. Also, the perspective would sometimes go from ground level to above ground level, and trying to pick something up from the ground was problematic. I could have used some hints, but luckily, there was some help in the discussions, and I was able to get some help by asking a couple of questions in the discussions. If you like mystery puzzle apps, and are willing to put up with the couple of things I mentioned here, then you should play this app.","timestamp_created":1598738005,"timestamp_updated":1598738005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wL+NnvQCcNzNngI="}
