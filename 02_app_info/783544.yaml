    review: Great collection of character sprites in the Time Fantasy style if you
      want to add some diverse character or NPC options to your game. I was able to
      pick out a unique dwarf and elf sprite for each one of the 12 modern D&D classes,
      each one of them fitting the class well, so there's definitely good variety
      here. Can't wait for some faces for these too!
