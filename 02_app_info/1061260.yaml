    review: 'You have to buy coins, which are worthless, and buying packs give you
      achievements. So you pay $$$ just to get 4 achievements.


      Then you need to buy the deluxe edition to access a large portion of the achievements.


      The game crashes after 10-15 minutes, fatal error. Every time. You lose all
      progress.


      The developer is rude.


      Stay away.
