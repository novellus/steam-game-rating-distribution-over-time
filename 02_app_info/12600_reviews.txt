Now both games have issues working proper on modern day windows/systems (beware people) and mind the other reviews on here about this one because whatever issues it has with newer operating systems (as mentioned) they are very true. However I did get the game to work with no problems but you must jump thru hoops in order to do so, skipping the video intro sequence by pushing the \"return key\" on the keyboard is a essential action to do so then the game won't crash (most times) and setting compatibility modes are necessary. Now the biggest issue as far as running this game on the current hardware that I have \"when actually playing it\" is the maps graphics walls/structures/scenery seem to disappear at will, almost seems like the game is drawing the stuff on the map on the go? But again that alone is a sign of a very old game the way it was created. The way this is fixed as a quick solution is by hitting the cars nitro, as this lights up the screen and somehow that triggers the drawing of the game's graphics to render faster then the track and everything around you comes into full view again (for a couple of seconds) and then you must hit nitro again over and over each and everytime the graphics/track disappears just to rectify that problem. Aside from those issues mentioned above here is some good things about this game, surprisingly for how old this game really is it did recognize my Logitech wireless controller which I thought it would never be able to do. Also this is a fun street racing game to play, for its generation and considering back in the day it might have been impressive to look at at one point. If you see the screenshots and videos of this and you think it looks cool - Your not mistaken. Infact to be honest I actually played it (quick race mode) for a couple of hours (despite all the problems mentioned above) and it did keep me entertained for the most part. Underneath all the huge unplayability factors is a nice little street racing game \"that needs to updated majorly to fit today's standards\" with lots of cool features to have fun with. Valusoft prob won't do any updates anytime soon with this game anymore since the company might have went belly up out of business a long time ago, and if someone had the time to fix it (as a personal project) they would have already done it by now a long time ago. But the problem is no one really cared about this game when it was abandoned so a lot of time would be put in to rectify all the above and I guess no one feels it is important enough to follow up on. Some of the creators that are still around are prob very aware of the universal issues with the different hardware and the game's compatibility issues with newer windows and such, but they do not feel its something they must do to try to make a competitor out of this with the current market of \"newer\" racing games with nicer graphics and gameplay that are relevant and available these days - I honestly don't blame them.      \n\nWhat else is there to say?\n\nThe cars handle well with good comfortable arcade like style physics/controls. The maps are nice but a little bland for my taste. The music being played per race is catchy and pretty standard dance tracks (not sure if they are real dance tacks or just composed by a random person). Then there is the other cars you see your opponents driving that look powerful and fast enough to win by a landslide but the AI in this game proves that theory wrong. The amount of cars available in this game to drive are not a vast whole lot to choose from so its really up to you how you wanna tune them and that part I found really innovative though as there a are at least 3 or 4 different upgrades for each tier of car parts. Like I said there is a hidden gem here but only if someone has the time to find it and remodel this gem.\n\nBTW: I do have RPM Tuning as well and yes if you been hearing that that game is in Russian - You are correct! It is on Abandonware site for download. I have made adjustments to the game's original exe overwriting it with the one from a demo version and it fixed that problem now the only thing is the graphics glitches (mentioned above earlier) which I will try and see if I can tinker with that. With that all being said I really hope that one day someone can update this game to be working on newer hardware as intended but that day won't come. Leaving this game as it is with the graphics glitchy - it looks like the whole city got hit by an atomic bomb.\n\nI won't recommend this to anyone to download just because the fact it has not been updated/formatted to work on modern systems and the price tag of this should be a lot lower if not, even free dare I say. Its a nice fun street racer game but really old and games that are this old should not have a heavy price tag on them just because of the universal compatibility issues alone.","timestamp_created":1600838388,"timestamp_updated":1600838388,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkunZ3PQCeYW/owI="}
