    review: The story and storytelling is incredibly engaging and amazing, the artwork
      is truly fantastic and the atmosphere created some of the best and most haunting
      of any game i've played. Kudos to the developer and team. If you're a fan of
      macabre tech-dystopianism, weirdness, nailbiting gameplay and amazing visuals
      and audio- this game is for you!
