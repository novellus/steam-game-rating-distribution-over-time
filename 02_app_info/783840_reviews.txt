Yes, people certainly die, or at least one person does at the beginning unless you choose to add to that body count depending on your play style, but it never really feels like a \"mystery\" that can actually investigate and explore.\n\nYour character cannot talk. When interacting with other NPCs, you are only given the predetermined lines that they speak, you have no dialogue options of your own nor do you have a way of interacting with any of the characters other than intended. This means when your bus runs over a woman on Day 1 (not a spoiler because it happens within the first minute of the game), you cannot actually warn anyone of the event.\n\nMy first instinct was to warn someone in town or the sheriff of what happened in the intro, but talking to any of them yielding no results. Next thing I tried was going to the infirmary, taking a med kit, and then tried to use it on her. You can only use items on yourself, not other people, so that didn't work. Finally, I tried dragging the woman's body into town for help, and was immediately attacked and killed by the Sheriff, because his coding was clearing reacting as if I had murdered the woman.\n\nHonestly, I felt disappointed by this. It felt a little weird trying to do a \"pacifist\" run where the bus I was on runs over a woman and I was encouraged by the game and its residents to essentially just... ignore it... so I tried playing again as a murderer.\n\nThis time, I killed the Bus driver, disposed of the evidence, and then just explored and talked to the townsfolk the rest of the game. I never killed another NPC again because I wanted to take my time to learn their behaviors and learn a bit about their backstories and characters, so I took things slow and methodical, dedicating my time to playing the game more like Stardew Valley by improving my home, doing favors, romancing some citizens, and earning popularity... at least long enough until I could start huntning each of the NPCs down one by one.\n\n... but this didn't work out for me either, because as it turns out, the game week does not repeat, you only have 7 days before an ending event is forced upon you, and I wound up dying in the end of the game not for killing someone, but for \"stealing\" various objects from people's homes.\n\nI had already spent 5 or so hours at that point and was somewhat frustrated by the outcome. I could tell the game wanted me to go places or do something, but there was a terrible lack of direction to tell me what I should or shouldn't be doing at any one time.\n\nThis is also a personal preference, but the story and setting, with what little I understand of it, is very dark, bizarre, and hard to understand.\n\nAfter close to 6 hours of playing, I have come out of the experience neither feeling like a clue solving hero OR a formidable danger to the world around me... I just felt confused, creeped out, and bored.\n\nIts a fun concept, but its not at all what I expected and it perhaps could have been executed differently and more effectively.\n\nEDIT:\nDid another run thru as murderer, I hadn't discovered Morgo or his upgrades in my first serious play through, which certainly helped with some of the more frustrating elements of the game (stamina, dragging speed, inventory, ect.), but there's currently too many bugs with the evidence system to be enjoyed in the way it should be.\n\nThere were a number of occasions where I had killed a villager, made sure I was never attacked back/took damage, and was always very careful I didn't leave any of my items or murder weapon behind at the crime scene... yet the recap by the sheriff that night would often claim \"There are multiple pieces of evidence at the scene, but no fingerprints\" or \"There was blood at the scene not belonging to the victim\" or \"Found a murder weapon from a previous crime\"... yet none of these were actually true, and because of it I, once again, felt cheated out of the ending I expected/desired.\n\nI killed 4 people on my very first night, and despite leaving no evidence except in one case where I took damage from one villager, the Sheriff said \"all signs point to [Protagonist]\"\n\nIts a fun concept but in its current state the game is too buggy to be enjoyed as intended.","timestamp_created":1609806216,"timestamp_updated":1609886830,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2/Gu6vYCdvXGwAI="}
