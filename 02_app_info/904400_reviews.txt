The gameplay is very smooth and reminiscent of other games like Hearthstone.  The characters are entertaining and the sidequests are interesting and offer multiple completion options.\n\nHowever, there are a number of flaws.  There is no ability to run, you can't skip cutscenes and there is no new game plus.  So when they say you can't collect them all, they're not kidding.  There's a good chance you'll never get to play with a good portion of the cards, unless you fool around in gauntlet mode or restart the story fresh.  But I enjoyed it enough to play it all the way through and give it a good rating here, so if those flaws don't bother you, then I absolutely recommend you pick it up.","timestamp_created":1609657383,"timestamp_updated":1609657383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hc/D4/YCebP+vwI="}
