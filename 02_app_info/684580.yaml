      selling armour, food, clothes, potions and weapons to warriors and rogues.<br>
      <br>Shoppe Keep 2 is an open-world fantasy business management game, inspired

      /><br><br>Jumpstart your business escapade by designing your store and stocking
      it with goods of your choice. Order items through suppliers, or take on lucrative
      and dangerous missions in the wilderness to secure high quality stock that will
      fetch higher prices and profits.<br> <br>Expand your Shoppe from a single room
      to a multi-storey bonanza! Watch customers flood into your store looking to
      buy new clothes, weapons and food. However, keep an eye out and defend your
      store from tricky thieves ready to snag your valuable items and make a dash
      for the door!<br> <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/684580/extras/Build-heading.gif?t=1603284522"

      /><br><br>Clean, repair, renovate and upgrade your store as you race to become
      the most successful Shoppe Keeper in Customerania. Sweep the floors, maintain
      displays and impress customers to boost your customer satisfaction and store
      reputation. Indulge in shoppe customisation with a range of flooring, wall and
      interior designs available.<br><br>Colourful wildlife, mobs of six foot spiders,
      wolves, farmland goats and bandits roam the lands beyond the gates of Customerania.
      Make sure to arm yourself with a trusty sword, bow or staff, and venture out
      to see what discoveries await you! Collect fur, equipment and more to sell in
      your Shoppe.<br> <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/684580/extras/Archive-heading.gif?t=1603284522"

      /><br><br>As your Shoppe grows and evolves, so will the town around you. Customerania
      is home to various characters and services - work with cooks and blacksmiths
      to secure a steady supply of stock.<br><br>A successful shoppe means a richer
      town. Upgrade the town to unlock new stock to sell, bring more customers into
      your store and more.<br> <br>As powerful new citizens arrive, decide who to
      work with - but be aware that your decisions will reap specific benefits and
      drawbacks from competing families.<br> <br>Can you rise from zero to well-coined
      hero? Have you got what it takes to run a profitable business amidst the chaos
      of thieves, spiders and bandits?
