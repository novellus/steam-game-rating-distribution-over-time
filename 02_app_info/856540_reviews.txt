As you progress further into the game the stages will become more elaborate and tricky.\n\n[h1][u]Difficulty[/u][/h1]\nThe difficulty of the game falls upon timing jumps, learning the maps, when to move, and controlling the strength of your jumps. Basic things for a platformer.\n\nThe first two sections, grass and water, are simplistic enough for anyone to get through. Fire will start to push people who don't normally do platformers a little harder. Gold is where it gets difficult for those who don't play platformers and annoying, for some, for those who do. The final stage which unlocks after getting all gems was just annoying from the screen shaking and scrolling screen which kills the character if it scrolls over you. That was one of my most hated things from old games back in the day (scrolling screen). In the character's world what kills them? The screen on your monitor/tv?\n\nThe two extra chapters are Sand and Ice. Sand is relatively simple enough though some of the stages are annoying. Ice was just terrible in a few stages. One of them as about jumping over spikes by the very tip of the platform to make jumps. Anything less and it would kill your character. On the same stage you had to rely on an ice block for each section of it. Multiple times it became heavy like a big block and wouldn't slide like ice should which forced deaths. A pretty bad bug to be honest especially for a time run attempt.\n\nSince the game has unlimited lives you have endless attempts. I'd say the difficulty doesn't really show until you go for the \"Complete the X Dungeon with X or less deaths\". Otherwise everyone should be able to finish all dungeons if you're playing just to beat everything.\n\n[h1][u]Graphics[/u][/h1]\nThe graphics are great and really do remind me of SNES titles. Probably one of my favorite things about this game is the graphics and colors hands down.\n\n[h1][u]Sound/Music[/u][/h1]\nBoth the sounds and music match the game's theme and are enjoyable to hear.\n\n[h1][u]Performance[/u][/h1]\nNever had any issues with the game myself and I'd wager it would run just fine on about any type of computer so long as they are not ancient bricks.\n\n[h1][u]Summary[/u][/h1]\nThe game is very reminiscent of older platformers in not just the gameplay but the overall design. It's a smooth experience in controls but very unforgiving in how you need to land jumps which is understandable in a platformer. The game ramps up in difficulty as is expected but certain stages relied more on annoying gimmicks over actual challenge. A great game in general but won't be for everyone especially if they don't love platformers. This is one of the games I would give a neutral rating to if I could but Steam's rating system won't let me. As it personally wasn't that enjoyable in the later sections I'm going to have to give it a negative review instead.\n\nI should state that playing with a controller will make the experience far easier and enjoyable compared to using a keyboard like I did all the way up to Gold.\n\nIf you enjoy platformers I'd say pick it up and see for yourself if you will love it or not.\n\n\n[h1][u]Notice[/u][/h1]\nThis review, as with all my reviews, are my own personal thoughts and opinions on the game it is for. Whether I like it or dislike it / recommend it or not recommend it: it does not make it any more valid than someone else's view on the title. I also will not review a game based on a score system as those review designs are flawed. Mainly because a perfect score reflects perfection and no game is perfect.\n\nIf I happen to like/recommend a game it doesn't mean I'm blind to any potential flaws it may have nor does it mean I'm going to defend the company/devs who made it. If I happen to dislike/not recommend a game it doesn't mean I hate the devs or the players who like the game. My reviews are solely about the game in question not the devs who made it or the players who like/dislike it. Not every game is going to appeal towards each person of which applies to me as well and in no way is there anything wrong someone liking/not liking a game.\n\nIf the game I'm reviewing is a online game, be it PvP or PvE, please use [url=https://steamcharts.com/]Steam Charts[/url] to see how populated the game is. You don't want to waste money on a title with no players in it. Just be sure to also take into account games that have crossplay like Microsoft titles. They generally have smaller player bases on PC but if it has crossplay you generally don't need to worry about small PC player bases.\n\nMy reviews might be changed down the line if something gets altered in the game that would warrant an update to said reviews. I may update my reviews as well if I feel they can be done better.","timestamp_created":1577623267,"timestamp_updated":1606725516,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541198551654815674","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrreTjPYCdMiG6AE="}
