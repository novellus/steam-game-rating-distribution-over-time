    about_the_game: This pack contains the following items:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Thunder<br></li><li>Viking<br></li><li>Thunder
      XT<br></li><li>Viking XT<br></li><li>Storm Paint</li></ul><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/639532/extras/4_gif.PNG?t=1570494457"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Thunder</h2>The Thunder turret was invented to eliminate
      the tank armies of the most modern Asian states, when Antaeus was ready to announce
      that it had completely taken over the world. &quot;X&quot; Tanks underwent a
      baptism of fire at a time when there were still far fewer of them than the previous
      generation of tanks. Under these conditions, the Thunder turret provided some
      assurance that the new tanks would be able to survive. The Thunder turret can
      be used to strike a group of enemies at once using explosive shells. The quick
      recharge rate ensures that you will achieve a quick and decisive victory.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Viking</h2>This hull was created during a war that was reaching
      a stalemate. A tank was needed that could break through the stagnating situation
      on the front, where winning tactics were needed. This hull is the &quot;universal
      tactical unit&quot;,  representing the second generation of &quot;X&quot; Tanks.
      It is tool that can be used to successfully achieve all tasks on the battlefield.
      For a long time the Viking formed the basis for bonds between elite professional
      tank operators.<h2 class="bb_tag">Note!</h2>You can purchase only 1 Pack per
      1 Tanki X account. Refund is not available if you purchase 2 different packs,
      which include the same weapons, hulls, and skins or you already have the items
      from the pack! The items will be granted to the account that you use to log
      into the game through Steam.
