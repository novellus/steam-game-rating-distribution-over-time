The level design and art is absolutely breathtaking, it's lots of fun for people of any skill level, whether you're looking for a casual game to play or want the nostalgia of playing Icycle like it's 2013. Super fun, give it a go.","timestamp_created":1608356351,"timestamp_updated":1608356351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wcngvPYCfdqtuwI="}
