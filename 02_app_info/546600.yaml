    about_the_game: "In this fast-paced 3 vs. 3 MOBA-styled battle, hero knights use\
      \ elemental powers to gain control over a ghost that can be placed on enemy\
      \ bases to lower these bases' shields and drain them of their energy. <br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nTo win, the player must destroy both enemy bases before their own\
      \ are destroyed. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMOBAs generally take around a half hour\
      \ or more. Vanguards introduces a fun, 8-12 minute MOBA experience, great for\
      \ a quick after-dinner game with family or friends before rushing on with life.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe novelty of this MOBA comes from the draining mechanic\
      \ of the ghost, because it guarantees short gameplay. Once placed on a base,\
      \ it is always draining the base it was most recently placed on, even when removed.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game focuses on map objectives and team fights more\
      \ than difficult to learn mechanics or complex item systems. <br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nCreated by college students as part of the BYU Animation program. <br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nPlay with friends or play against our Bots! <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\n<br />\r\nADDITIONAL DETAILS <br />\r\n------------------ <br />\r\
      \n- While on a base, the ghost drains energy out of the base and leaves it vulnerable\
      \ to additional attack by the opposing team. <br />\r\n- If a base is under\
      \ attack by the enemy, defending players must stand in the base area to remove\
      \ the ghost. The shield goes back up immediately when the ghost is released\
      \ and the base can no longer be directly attacked. The defending team, however,\
      \ must place the ghost on an enemy base before the ghost will stop draining\
      \ power from their own base."
