      /><br><br>Rushdown Revolt is the most electric, combo-centric and expressive
      fighting game ever made. Master eight unique characters to team up to take back
      what''s yours or squash The Revolt! Rushdown Revolt supports up to 6 players
      online (up to 4 players locally) with Vortex Rollback Netcode for a flawless
      online experience!<br><br>Rushdown Revolt  explores making it FUN for you to
      introduce uninitiated friends into the fighting game genre.  Until now, the
      most common way to learn fighting games was to get your @$$-whooped. <i>Rushdown
      Revolt</i>''s Tag Team and Gauntlet modes explores an exhilarating and collaborative
      experience for hardcore and new fighting game players to enjoy this beautiful
      genre together. <br> <br><strong><u>Core Mechanics</u></strong><br>We''ve spent
      the last few years focused on making the most electric, combo-centric and expressive
      fighting game we can imagine.  <br>Sparks are the defining mechanic of Rushdown
      Revolt. It''s embedded into every attack and move in the game and - once understood
      - Sparks will push you faster and further than you''ve ever gone in a fighting
      game before. <br><br>At odds with their skill potential, Sparks are as natural
      to harness as dribbling a Basketball or Soccer ball (once you''ve gotten a bit
      of practice of course).  At the earliest levels of play, even modest use of
      Sparks will dramatically improve your speed and skill in Rushdown Revolt.  <br><br>Sparks
      directly support our primary goal for Rushdown Revolt''s 1v1 gameplay: to create
      a skill ceiling so high and with so much potential for expression that Revolt
      will never cease to push our players to increasingly-inspiring feats of skill.

      /><br>Gauntlets turn our core 1v1 gameplay into a never-ending round robin hangout
      where you can come and go as you please. Gauntlets are the go-to destination
      for players to congregate online whether you''re hosting a custom lobby or hitting
      quick play from the start screen.   Each player rotates through a never-ending
      cycle of players to defeat the reigning Ruler of the Gauntlet. <br><br>Armed
      with only one life, you''ll have to give it your best shot. The Ruler, meanwhile,
      never replenishes their health after each successive victory until they are
      usurped.  No matter how skilled you are, as Ruler you will eventually be taken
      out by the never-end hoard of Revolters. <br> <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1376070/extras/tagteam2.png?t=1605815074"
      /><br>Tag Team pits a team of Revolters and Rulers into a 2v2 or 3v3 Tag-Battle.
      Each player on each team rotates through several lives. While your team is rotating
      through another team member, all &quot;non-active&quot; Assisters have access
      to their Characters'' Four Special Abilities in order to directly contribute
      to the battle.<br>After you''re knocked out for the first time, you''ll be armed
      with a PowerPlay!<br><br>Even though you will have more lives coming, you will
      unlock a new ability. Think of this as your &quot;Ultimate&quot; attack: You
      will jump into the action and have full control of your character to set up
      any number of exhilarating team combos with your active team member. <br><br><img

      /> <br>West Coast to Europe? No problem. Vortex Rollback supports controller-to-screen
      time of a blistering 2 frames with no additional delay necessary up to 150ms
      latency. *<br><br>Vortex Rollback been in development for four years to fully
      embed it into every aspect of our game engine in order to minimize delay and
      rollback impacts.  Additionally, Vortex Rollback supports Dynamic Save States
      so not just 2 Players - but up to Six Players - can come and go in our Gauntlet-style
      play. <br><br>(*) Note: We will not be responsible for your reckless decision
      to rely on McDoofus''s Wifi or a Mobile Hotspot for your online play. Friends
      don''t let friends do WiFi.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1376070/extras/characters2.png?t=1605815074"

      the enemy. Choose your character - and your side of The Revolt - wisely.'
