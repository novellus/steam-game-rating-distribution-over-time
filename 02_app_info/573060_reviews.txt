The base game comes with some tutorial modules and one main module which covers Australia and is huge in size.  The Australia module took me about 100hrs to finish on its own so considering this game can be bought for just a few quid in a sale you can't grumble about poor value for money.\n\nFor new players there is a bit of a steep learning curve at first and navigating the UI is a puzzle in itself for the first few hours but once it all clicks you'll be flying.  If you do get stuck then there's a very active and helpful Discord channel dedicated to the game too. \n\nFill yer boots.","timestamp_created":1609770704,"timestamp_updated":1609770704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyPPz5vYCcOizwAI="}
