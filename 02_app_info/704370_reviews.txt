Something awfully basic. So basic that it wouldn't be the thing to win you over to say it was the best thing to ever happen in your day. But still something that's enough, something just there in the background of your attention, just trying its best to keep you tuned in this morning, but with the little it has to offer.\n\nNow, water you waiting for? Earn those big bucks, and rotate as many crooked, rusty, floating, pointless pipes as you can!\nHey, if you think about it, it's even watering that tree in the background. So, this game is even pretty good for the environment.
