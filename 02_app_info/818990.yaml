    review: 'Sure, I like the game. Its alright.


      BUT I HAVE TROUBLE WITH FIGURING IT OUT.


      In the first room I can''t find the key, once I did it was like inside the bed,
      and in the second room there is literally no explanation of what to do.


      Not saying its bad its just difficult.


      Also, don''t play when you''re in a bad mood.'
