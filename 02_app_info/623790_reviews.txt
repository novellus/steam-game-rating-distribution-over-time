Sure they looked great. However when I played them I got bored with them very quickly. I went back to the original tables. However this remix table is different right from the first ball. Its multiball right from the start!! So its exciting right from the start. The table has  a very clean look to it. You can see everything very clearly. Nothing is hidden from sight. The game tells you what to do when a special event in the game comes up. Its great fun. No more just guessing what next to hit when a special event happens. \n\nI have nothing but good things to say about this table. Its so much better then the other remix tables. Its head and shoulders above them. My only nit pick would be the music is not to my taste. I urge anyone who is interested in another table to give this one a play in the game. Your allowed to play it until a certain score is reached. I played this one time and I bought this after just one play. I am hooked. Great job to all who worked on this table.","timestamp_created":1492118770,"timestamp_updated":1492118770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.606042623519897461","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlbLNtNsCdrXddg=="}
