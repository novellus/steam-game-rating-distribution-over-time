And added on top of all that, the grip to reduce recoil is broken for almost all of the guns. They're impossible to grab and your hands just detach from the lower rails from the slightest movement. An absolute waste of fucking money.","timestamp_created":1598035560,"timestamp_updated":1598035987,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o8GXifQCeafxnAI="}
