    review: 'I would recommend this game under the impression that future updates
      will bring more. Overall I did enjoy the 15-30 minutes I did play it and I think
      it would fun as a first game, VR demostration, for new VR players. Although
      for return play value I believe there should be something like more waves, different
      game modes, different scenarios, etc.  An issue I had was I could not get the
      smash with the grip buttons to work. I think a better tutorial with images or
      video than just text would help with that. Overall for 99 cents this not a bad
      deal and I hope there will be future improvements to this game. To watch my
      gameplay visit the link below:
