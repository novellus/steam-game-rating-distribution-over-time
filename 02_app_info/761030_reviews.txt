I had to guess where I am in the main menu to get to graphic config, before I could change it to full screen.\n- This game feels kinda slow, especially during the battle.\n- The entrance/exit from location to location is rather rude. The game would just think that I wanted to travel to another room, when I'm just happened to move along the entrance.  I was like about 1 character height away from the entrance...\n- The controls for overworld and battle seems to be trying to be different just for the sake of being different.\n-- To get an advantage for the battle from the overworld, you have press \"V\", which is fine, but its not keyboard friendly. You have to used \"AWSD\" for movement, its hard to switch between D and V accurately. Although you can re-config the AWSD to other keys, I'm not sure about the \"V\".\n-- During the battle, actions has to be selected by number key 1-4. And you have to press the same number to make sure you are using it. I have been playing classic style RPGs for decades, its really confusing for my muscle memory. A usual RPG would just requires you to press Accept or Cancel button after you have picked an action. This game is like trying to be different, just for the sake of different.\n-- The mouse is rather useless, even though I managed to map the mouse buttons as Accept and Cancel, with respect to Left and Right mouse buttons. You can't select the actions by mouse. And you are forced to move back to keyboard when you try to press the \"V\"\n-- After about 2 hour, I gave up using keyboard, and plug in a controller, which make things easier. But the re-pressing the same button for the action, still annoys me. \n- I would appreciate for an overworld save feature, but there seems to be no such feature in this game.\n\nI would still try to continue the game, as I don't like stopping halfway, unless its really so bad that I have to give up...\n\nEDIT:\nAfter a 2-week break from the game, I tried to play the game again.\nAnd found that my save file is gone. \nI do not want to force myself to play this game anymore.\nAlready requested a refund, hopefully I can get it...","timestamp_created":1607863064,"timestamp_updated":1609207440,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.385221332311630249","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqJyP1vYCf8TouQI="}
