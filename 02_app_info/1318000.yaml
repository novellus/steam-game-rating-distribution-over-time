    about_the_game: HTD is a mix of classic party-based RPG and fast-paced, real-time
      action. Take control of a party consisting of a healer, tank, and damage dealer,
      each of whom excel to an extreme level in their specific role, but fall short
      in others.<h2 class="bb_tag">UNIQUE PARTY-BASED ACTION</h2>The burly <strong>DPS</strong>,
      with a big sword and a lack of armor, is capable of dishing out extreme damage
      - enough to defeat most bosses in a few blows, under the right conditions. However,
      they can only stand a few hits, and require sufficient openings to deal maximum
      damage.<br><br>The steel-clad <strong>Tank</strong>, a heavily-armored juggernaut
      with a heavier shield, is able to safely nullify damage and has an extreme health
      pool. However, they have no form of attack whatsoever.<br><br>And the mysterious
      <strong>Healer</strong>, with staff and tunic, can rapidly restore the party's
      HP, mend their equipment, and revive fallen allies. However, they are sorely
      lacking in both defense and offense.<h2 class="bb_tag">BRUTAL &amp; SATISFYING
      FAST-PACED COMBAT</h2>Each party member must be mastered and utilized to their
      full potential in order to overcome the myriad brutal foes in HTD. Rapidly cycle
      through party members, parry and interrupt enemy attacks, weave in healing and
      repairs, and stun your enemy long enough for the DPS to charge a fatal blow,
      all while weathering the onslaught of your hellish adversary.<h2 class="bb_tag">NIGHTMARISH
      BOSSES AND BIZARRE HORROR</h2>Do battle with over 15 fully animated and unique
      adversaries, each with their own quirks, strategies, surprises, and horrific
      design. Delve into horror by discovering secret levels that take you into the
      dark, forgotten recesses of the land, where eldritch nightmares push your party's
      skills - and sanity - to their limits.<h2 class="bb_tag">IMPACTFUL, GAME-CHANGING
      LOOT</h2>Each adversary you defeat grants you the choice of multiple pieces
      of loot to boost your party, each with interesting effects and drawbacks, and
      some unlocking powerful new abilities. Choose your items to support your play-style,
      complementing your strengths and alleviating your weaknesses.<h2 class="bb_tag">DARK,
      COMPELLING STORY</h2>Uncover the secrets of the land, the apocalyptic Great
      Contortion, and your very own party members as you venture through a story rife
      with mystery. Meet with various strangers along your quest, some helpful, some
      hindering, and learn what truly motivates your party as you guide them toward
      their final fate at the Northern Cliffs.

    review: '[h1] Good game, replay value is a bit meh [/h1]


      The game offers some interesting gameplay: standard rpg team but in a fast paced
      boss fight format. I have played this game for 4 hours, and i enjoyed all of
      it. However the game doesn''t have much more to offer me i believe. As of writing
      this i have beaten 14 bosses, with 2 unlocked after the big bad guy. I don''t
      know where the presumably last boss is as i can''t reread the story. So now
      i have to replay the game again.


      Is it a fun game? Yes. Is it worth the 10 Euro''s i spend on? maybe.'
