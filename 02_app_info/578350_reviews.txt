Not bad. If you're used to playing this in Warcraft 3 you might be a little disappointed, though. There are some minor, quality of life kind of things missing from this engine that WC3 had by default. Also, some of the towers are a little different here.\n\nBut, hey! There's new maps and game modes along with all the ones from before. All my strategies that I used to use with great success still seem to work just fine. It's seriously worth every penny.  :)","timestamp_created":1599312654,"timestamp_updated":1599312654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw682dr/QCe/v5nwI="}
