I had to redo entire portions of the game twice because I forgot to save.\n\nThe other thing is, the puzzles are obnoxious. Like, the game tells you what to do and then sticks its tongue out at you when you try it, like \"how could you be so stupid as to think that would actually work?\", and then you have to combine objects in unintuitive ways to complete the game. Like, I played Myst before playing this, and Myst was [i]easier[/i].\n\nThat said, I adored it. Cute and fun. (Still, the sequel is better)","timestamp_created":1609982787,"timestamp_updated":1609982787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42/ec7fYCeqiUwQI="}
