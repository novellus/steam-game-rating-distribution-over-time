It's also a no-brainer game, more than less.. with a simple mechanic of basically hopping around like one of those old school 'spring / suction' toys. You hold the jump button down to attach to the surface of the game's various difficult (and Q-Bert esque geometrically-shaped) platforms, as you approach the level's exit. \n\nOutside of that, there are not many gameplay elements. Precision jumps and intentional 'bellyflops' to orient the tripping balls main character on each platform bring about some complexity I wasn't expecting.\n\nThe game looks great and its smooth, funny animation was something I wasn't expecting booting the game up at all. The player character's design is animated great, with funny results when he rams his head too hard into various surfaces. Unfortunately, the game's backgrounds are quite bland by comparison. Funny-looking pillars smiling at you are cool, but their lack of variety (as well as the for lack of a better expression \"shit-shaped floating things\") in the background not leading to a different set of background objects to space out staring at are unfortunate.\n\n\nAll in all I enjoyed most all of my time spent with this game. I was streaming it at the time so my enjoyment might have been skewed to feel rushed to progress rather than having it booted up at a more chill pace.\n\nGreat, funny, simple game with good animation on the main character. I hope the developers are able to put their animation and zany character design into other titles.","timestamp_created":1608099498,"timestamp_updated":1608099498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562557339668273926","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgeGMtfYCcqzQugI="}
