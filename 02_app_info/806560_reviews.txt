But my verdict? It's alright. However, it's not worth the unchanging price. It had some ups and downs. Plus, another factor was that I played the mobile version first, Rem version to be specific, and both flavors on mobile is much cheaper. I had slightly higher expectations for the PC version because I thought it will be more featured and all those bells and whistles. No, I was wrong. It's literally the same as the mobile version but less poly and better resolution regardless of what version you get. Added that you see your own controllers, not virtual hands, meaning you can only headpat with controllers. -1 immersion point. And that's it, pretty much you get to see your waifu in better quality if that's what you're looking for. I suggest you to just buy the mobile version and take your waifu with you, anywhere.","timestamp_created":1606009138,"timestamp_updated":1606009138,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtdXm9vUCdNHkrwI="}
