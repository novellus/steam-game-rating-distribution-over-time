      target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  >Shrouded in Sanity</a>, as it is part of
      the <i>Skautfold</i> series. However, knowledge of the previous games is not
      necessary to enjoy the game.<br><br><strong><i>Into the Fray</i></strong> is
      an oblique top-down action shooter.<br>The focus is on fast, bloody combat with
      satisfying feedback and environmental reactivity; all under the heavy presence
      of a dark Lovecraftian story of civil strife.<h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>The
      story is set in 1899, based on an alternate history of the island of Portland,
      off the south coast of England. You take control of <i>Hito</i>, one of the
      Knights of the Empire, and head to the Island to investigate reports of a missing
      royal, and the presence of a rebellious faction called the <i>Sons of Washington</i>.
      Soon, the Fog descends, leaving you and the islanders to fend off the would-be
      rebels who have made a pact with entities from the Cosmos.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2><i>Into
      the Fray</i> is framed around an overview map of the island; where you can pick
      from a range of missions to undertake as the story progresses. These missions
      will have you visit the streets of the island, dank cave systems, and even secret
      underground tunnel networks. But all is not as it might appear; the streets
      are filled with corpses and infested with eldritch entities, whilst the tunnel
      networks are home to a series of horrific rituals that are aimed at growing
      the Fogs' influence... and as you search for a way to stop the ongoing destruction,
      you're sure to stumble upon some of the deepest <i>darkest</i> secrets of the
      island.<br><br>The tools of your trade will include an arsenal of devastating
      top-of-the-line firearms; from hand-cannons, to triple-barrel shotguns, as well
      as prototype weaponry from the great <i>Nikola</i> himself. These weapons will
      be your best friends and only hope of survival if you want to put an end to
      both the bloodthirsty rebels, and eldritch abominations alike.<br><br>To aid
      your enjoyment of the carnage that will unfold, gore and environmental reactivity
      are top priority; break just about anything, kick around barrels of oil and
      then set them on fire as traps, or just straight up give the boot to your enemies
      and watch them trigger traps. Why open a door when you can break it down?! Persistent
      gore and debris will help immerse you in the world as you rip, tear and explode
      your way to victory.

    short_description: Into the Fray is a fast action-shooter in the vein of Doom
      and Dark Messiah; using fast combat, reactive environments, and traps. Blast,
      kick, and dash your way through Rebels and Eldritch creatures to liberate the
      Isle of Portland; as it becomes consumed by Fog and the horrors therein.

    review: 'Exciting moment to moment game-play is a must for any kind of twin stick
      shooter, and this game has it in spades.


      Aesthetically it obviously draws from Bloodborne, Lovecraft and Anime


      an Interesting world built up between multiple games made by like 2 ppl with
      multiple endings, fun easter egg references and ever increasing roster of powerful
      and fun to use weapons.


      highly recommend it.'
