It would be quite good in an underground cavern setting (earth-themed monsters and some dark critters with some underground lakes.)\n\n-Some of the 50 monsters are (as you can see in the first screenshot) repositioned variants. This is convinient artisticaly when trying to make a troop look good but means that you are not getting 50 unique monsters per se. (there are about 11 repositioned variants.)\n\n-I prefer event-driven battles to random encounters and should have considered that when buying it. Any character sprites or faces for these battlers would have to be made custom by the buyer. I would like to stress that this is not a fault on the part of the artist providing this pack, and I was not expecting character sprites or faces to be provided.\n\n(note: 0 hours on record is deceptive. Hours are not recorded on this as it is a DLC and not a program or even a patch for a program. It's artwork.)","timestamp_created":1444444515,"timestamp_updated":1444445117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569773852825164795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pOvop9ACftaaRg=="}
