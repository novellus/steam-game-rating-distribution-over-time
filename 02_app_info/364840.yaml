    about_the_game: 'N2O: Nitrous Oxide''s gameplay is pure shooter, reminiscent of
      the arcade classic TEMPEST. You''re stuck on the perimeter of a tube and you
      job is to shoot at everything in your way. If things get too hectic, you can
      slam on the brakes, which stops your forward movement for a few seconds and
      gives you time to change your direction or clear a path. Once you''ve destroyed
      all the level''s eggs, your next task is to take on the game''s huge bosses.
      Graphically, the game is very bright and colorful and definitely exhibits a
      techno influence. The soundtrack is done by the techno group Crystal Method,
      who supply some remixes as well as older tracks, which helps put you in the
      groove.'
