The quick battles, the areas to explore, the quests, the challenge, all the characters in the party with useful skills, the huge amount of creatures and bosses, so many things to do and find, it never ends.  The use of scrolls to teleport where you have have already been and ships and boats to aid in travel adds fun and speed to the vast world to explore. Searching everywhere will yield important items that are used to get better weapons/armor/items.  There are also interesting puzzles to solve and rewards for finding many secret locations. An arena to get better equipment and a house you buy to build up with property that also adds goodies. This game has it all,. Highly recommended to all rpgers!","timestamp_created":1590980126,"timestamp_updated":1590980126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565525412559509277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw08TztvICe7XBiwI="}
