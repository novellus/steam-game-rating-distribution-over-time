    about_the_game: <strong>About Death World</strong><br>Death World is an immersive
      single and multiplayer experience that puts you to an atmospheric post-apocalyptic
      world where you must fight alone or with your friends for survival. Not only
      hunger and thirst will gradually afflict you, but also zombies infected by an
      unknown pathogen will become more and more of a problem for you.<br>To ensure
      your survival you have to build simple and advanced weapons, build shelter,
      kill zombies and make sure you have enough food and drink at all times.<br>Meanwhile,
      you can explore an epic atmospheric world and find new places again and again.<br><br><br><strong>Key
      Features</strong><br>Our key features will gradually develop in line with our
      roadmap. The features listed here represent only a small part of our incredible
      experience.<br><br>Open World<br>In Death World you can discover an atmospheric
      open world. Here you will discover different places whether in the abandoned
      modern age or in the overgrown nature.<br><br>Zombie System<br>On your way of
      survival you will gradually encounter zombies of different strengths. But you
      can also get good equipment from them and improve yourself with it!<br><br>Day
      / Night System<br>Not only the atmosphere and immersion are improved by the
      day-night system. Also at night more and stronger zombies will come, which want
      to get at your flesh.<br><br>Weather System<br>Fight your way through the beautiful
      sunshine at sunset as well as the pouring rain during a thunderstorm.<br><br>Resource
      System<br>Cut down trees, mine rocks and use them to build new weapons, items
      etc.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>About the Story</strong><br>Imagine a world
      at war. For many years the Corrupt Government has promised better days and an
      end to suffering. But modern warfare no longer consists of simple nuclear weapons.
      Bio-weapons are the new trend and they have already been used successfully.
      The pressure on the security bunkers is increasing, both by the threat of the
      still unknown pathogen, which resurrects corpses of starved and thirsty people.
