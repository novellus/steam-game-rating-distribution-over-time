It's been 10 years since the tragedy in Barrow Hill involving the ancient stones that took the lives of the Emmett family, Ben Kendell, and Whincy the dog. Once again, it's up to you to save the day and put to rest an angry witch who has been resurrected due to the fact that her tomb has been robbed.\n\nPros:\nA mystery unfolds as you play\nDecent graphics\nAlmost all of the puzzles are good logic puzzles\nClues are scattered about forcing you to find and put them together\nSimplest of controls (Except for one time, you use the mouse and that's it)\nVoice acting is decent (Females only)\n\nCons:\nToo much reading (there is a lot of filler in the journals, information you don't need)\nVoice acting for the males is not good.\n\nMuch like the first game, there are several puzzles to solve, each one them (except one or possibly two) are well thought out and completely logical. Also, the game gives you a good reason for going back to the scene where you almost bought it ten years before.\n\nAs far as I know, you can't die, unlike the first game. The witch seems hell bent on inflicting misery on our friends, not you. Almost as if the witch sees you as a curiosity and not a threat. With that said, if you're looking for a game with a sense of danger and suspense, then I'm sorry to say, this game has none of that. It felt more casual play and suspense. The witch does crop up from time to time and she does speak to you, but nothing really threatening.\n\nI don't really have any complaints about this game. If I had to pick one thing I didn't like (besides all of the reading), I would have to say the voice acting for Gus and Ollie. Almost like finger nails on a blackboard, especially Ollie. What a whiny little sh!t he is. At one point I was kind of hoping that he would die.\n\nAt the time of this review, Barrow Hill: The Dark Path was selling for $14.99. I really like this game but I think that price is a bit too high. However, if you don't care about price and you liked the first game, then you won't be disappointed.","timestamp_created":1608920871,"timestamp_updated":1608920871,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56031566858291626","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hYbKzfYCdLuQvQI="}
