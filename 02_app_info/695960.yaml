    review: 'Awakening: The Goblin Kingdom continues the story of Princess Sophia
      on her quest to discover what happened to her parents and all of the humans.
      It continues from where Awakening: Moonfell Wood left off with Sophia on her
      way to the Goblin Kingdom.


      As usual, the artwork is lovely with well done, beautiful backdrops. The music
      is relaxing and complements the gameplay without getting in your way. The gameplay
      is the standard point-and-click hidden object puzzles with other various types
      mixed in and keeps things mostly interesting without being too frustrating or
      difficult. There are some puzzles that are irksome due to the mechanics, but
      overall, they''re fairly fun to play.


      Story-wise, it''s mostly generic high fantasy characters, creatures, and magics,
      although this game finally reveals the series'' main villains.


      I''ve enjoyed this series a good amount, however, this game was painful to play
      due to the technical issues. On my system, there was constant stuttering and
      lag for all of the 2D animations. The very few 3D animations, which were mainly
      relegated to the swaying banners in a few scenes, were fine. Transitions from
      one scene to another, moving objects, picking up items, etc. were all choppy,
      stuttering, and quite slow. Despite following tips found on the Boom Zap forums
      and attempting to adjust compatibility options, I wasn''t able to resolve this
      issue.


      The game was frustratingly playable, however, and I was able to slog through
      it and complete the main story and the bonus chapter.


      Overall, I cautiously recommend this game as it''s part of the main Awakening
      series'' story and it''s a relaxing hidden object game at its core. However,
      if you do decide to purchase it, I recommend running it right away to see if
      the stuttering/lag issues occur so you can make the decision to keep or return
      it.'
