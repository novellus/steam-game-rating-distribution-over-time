      \ GO.\nCOOL MUSIC AND GRAPHICS.\nSTREAMLINES FTL GAMEPLAY BUT ADDS SOME NEW\
      \ FLAVORS TO THE GENRE.\nSO FAR. SO GOOD. AND MY SCORE COULD GO EVEN HIGHER\

      \ PROGRESSIVELY BETTER THE MORE I PLAY.\nEASILY ADDICTING ONCE YOU FIGURE OUT\
      \ EVERYTHING.\nVERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE OF THIS.. I THINK YOU WILL BE TOO.\n\
      updated*\nSTORY IS COMING INTO FOCUS....STARTING TO SEE SOME LOVECRAFTIAN HORROR\
