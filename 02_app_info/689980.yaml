      /><h2 class="bb_tag">ABOUT THIS GAME</h2><strong><i>Welcome to the Car Trader
      Simulator! It's here where you'll be able to play the role of the American car
      dealer who is going to make his business famous in the whole city. You yourself
      will be able to decide how are you going to do it through a complex campaign.
      This game will let you achieve this goal in 27 different ways and all of them
      will depend solely on your choices! </i></strong><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/689980/extras/menu_3.gif?t=1608752375"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Game difficulty - how to rely on your intuition during
      your car trading adventure?</h2>You can choose one of 3 difficulty levels in
      game. The easy and medium ones are the best choice for people starting their
      adventure with games of this type and preferring a peaceful gameplay while enjoying
      the plot and campaign, and the highest level has been designed for economic
      simulators veterans meaning that even a simple mission during the adventure
      might turn out to be quite demanding. The latter is distinguished by a complete
      lack of hints during your play session, which leaves the player to depend on
      his instinct and experience alone.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/689980/extras/gif_difficulty_3.gif?t=1608752375"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">The dream employee - how do you find one?</h2>While your
      company grows and the story progress you will also need new people to work for
      you. An extensive system of employment and staffing will facilitate your work
      and accelerate the company's growth. Employees that we will be able to hire
      throughout the game will differ based on their experience, specialization and
      employment cost.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/689980/extras/employees_4.gif?t=1608752375"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Complex storyline with the possibility to make your own
      choices</h2>The story of the game is very extensive and allows you to go through
      the campaign in 27 different ways resulting in game bringing you many hours
      of great fun. You can be a law-abiding and responsible dealer who, using the
      experience gained while working with his uncle in his youth, will dynamically
      expand the business and ensure the satisfaction of his customers. The opposite
      choice will allow you to take a &quot;mafia&quot; route where you will use the
      cheapest solutions when repairing and selling cars to deceive your customers
      and earn large amounts of cash as soon as possible. There will also be the possibility
      of stealing a vehicle at the request of shady customers.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/689980/extras/story_3.gif?t=1608752375"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Game economy - is it better to invest in advertisement
      or repairs? </h2>There are many economic choices ahead of you. Invest in new
      employees, repair some cars for additional profit or maybe advertise? This system
      will allow you to feel like a real business owner, one that in many situations
      has difficult choices to make on how to invest his earned fortune to double
      it in the future. A random event system has been implemented in the game that
      will from time to time impact your business - positively or negatively - and
      you will be able to experience it during the campaign.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/689980/extras/gif_ads_3.gif?t=1608752375"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Map handling system and personnel management.</h2>Car Trader
      Simulator has a map management and employee management systems. You can specify
      exactly which streets can be traveled by our employees who will transport and
      repair purchased (or stolen) cars. In addition, the events system will allow
      you to diversify the game with unexpected events or activities taking place
      in the city. To make it easier to navigate the map, it has been divided into
      mechanically distinctive sections (and that refer to the names of widely known
      districts of the USA).<h2 class="bb_tag">Real cars</h2>The game has a gigantic
      (purchased) library of real car photos (over 1000 cars in many different variants).
      Each set of photos is a complete set with vintages and models of a given car,
      additionally available in any color combination. By playing through the main
      campaign plotline we will also be able to spot some of the very unique model
      of cars. <br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/689980/extras/browsers3.gif?t=1608752375"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Auctions - key to success when developing a business</h2>There
      are many cars available in the game that you will be able to negotiate for or
      buy directly on the internet auctions. Every few minutes new cars will appear
      on auction alongside a group of people willing to pay for the best models. Not
      only will you need to have cash, but you will also have to bid wisely to get
      the most from the auctioned vehicle.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/689980/extras/sell.gif?t=1608752375"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Direct sales - contacting the customer</h2>Having a good
      car for sale is only half the battle, the other half is dealing with the customer
      and meeting his expectations. With each conversation, you will get guidelines
      on what the customer expects from you and your task is not only to sell the
      car but also to make the buyer happy and ensure our reputation to not fall.
      Coupled with our progress in the campaign customers will appear more often at
      our doors and our decisions regarding the appropriate car selection will have
      to become more accurate. <br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/689980/extras/Follow.gif?t=1608752375"
