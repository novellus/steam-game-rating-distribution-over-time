    review: 'Sooo I bought it as it was 75% discounted, after having read the very
      mixed reviews.


      At some point, with a game this old, I think the true value of this pack is
      in adding a new faction and play a couple of games. I wouldn''t have played
      Endless Legend in December 2020 had I not had the curiosity to see how the Myakara
      play (and had it not been discounted). I played my three games with them, maybe
      I''ll take one of my favourite faction and play against them once, and that''s
      going to be it.


      The faction is ok. The Urkans are brokenly strong and at the end they are as
      fun as a sledgehammer, but some people are known to like sledgehammers.


      Buy if it is discounted and you are feeling nostalgic for EL but have otherwise
      played every faction to death.'
