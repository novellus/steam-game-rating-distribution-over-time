We are a small team with 2 people and it is really easy to miss issues by ourselves even though a lot of people have already played still there is much to be done.Yesterday we released a patch that combines UI elements together and now they can be accessed by Esc key. Also you can now see most of  the quest objectives on the screen.\n I believe we released a version accidentally that the default key was TAB.  I think you can fix it by resetting the default keys from the keyboard controls menu. \nMap of the Atrium is at the Spare Parts shop on first level. And I am going to add the Atrium map to the vending machine too. You can see where the hidden triggers are from the map.\nAlso we released a walkthrough of the game that you can access from the Steam guides. I have asked the publishers and  I hope they will translate it to Chinese soon.We are going to try to fix the other issues you mentioned. Sincerely\nNeon Castle"}],"cursor":"AoJwu/Dj2PUCfru+rQI="}
