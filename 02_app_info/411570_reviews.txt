I finished my game as a \"Soldier Survivor\" so I will base this review on that ending.\n\nRomance: One of my biggest complaints was the introduction into romances. I felt that I did not know the characters enough to romance them so soon but if I decide not to pursue the characters at that early point it means I am unable to romance them in a later part of the story. And its really long!\n\nDialogue: I kinda felt that I could not engage in deep conversation with characters especially characters I liked. Many times I want to help and get close with my sister but I am sent off to do some long ass mission to get food.\n\nPacing: The pacing was weird for me, I truly enjoyed the beginning a lot and it only became a chore during chapter 2 I think where I was basically doing mission work and It was very unfun, I just wanted to interact with everyone. I understand that we gotta survive. The final chapters got way better and more intense and while the ending part with the cathedral decision was really frustrating I felt content with the outcome of my decision.\n\nIn all honesty with the little grips I have with this game and sometimes feeling like I wanted to stop mid way, I still think this game deserves a positive rating, hell I know someone will enjoy this far more than me and I can promise that most people will find this game great!","timestamp_created":1609615428,"timestamp_updated":1609615428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmsmj4vYCddTpvwI="}
