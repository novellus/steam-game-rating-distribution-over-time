    review: 'Ninja Clash is the first naruto movie, taking place chronologically between
      episodes 101 and 102 of the first series.

      It is notable that there is no Japanese dub (which is what I was used to), but
      the english dub, while comparably worse, hardly makes the movie worse. I reccommend
      getting it if you are a naruto fan hoping to get it legally as most websites
      also only offer the english dub.'
