I really enjoy doing [i]Grand Campains[/i] and The Old Gods gave me around 200 years more of gameplay. If you like doing Grand Campains I'd recommend you Duchy of Connacht in Ireland. From mainland Europe I'll recommend you Croatia or Bosnia (you can do both in multiplayer ðŸ˜‰) and for extra chalenge you can play as german (or east francian if you feel so inclined) or lothringian king and experience some big game. From recommended starts I wouldn't recommend Byzantine Empire. It's not bad just boring.\nThe most attractive gameplay is surely Vikings. You can hold a blot, they have understandable Causus Beli system, that other DLCs like The Republic (https://store.steampowered.com/app/210906/Expansion__Crusader_Kings_II_The_Republic/) can only envy. If you are considering playing as Viking you'll want to play as king Halfdan. Invasion into England is pretty fun and it's cool to have to watch you threath. My favourite viking campaign is definetly King BjÃ¶rn of Sweden. You can pretty fastly reform paganism and adopt feudalism and become biggest empire in Europe.\nGreat Works are well made in this game. I didn't build every great work but in late game you can build many Great Works in short period of time. That's all I want to tell you about.\nThis DLC is amazing. It's cool and my only objection is that some recommended starts are boring and generally not fun. 9/10 best DLC in series i played.","timestamp_created":1608577071,"timestamp_updated":1608577071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+caqw/YCeLyAvAI="}
