      the speed of reaction and thinking. There is a myth that the reaction rate is
      the same for all, but it is not. You can easily verify this. It is enough to
      pass the test to determine the speed of reaction with friends or relatives.
      You will notice that it is different. Even one person during the day shows a
      different reaction rate. Another myth says that the reaction rate can not be
      improved. This is also not so. A lot of research confirms that the reaction
      is significantly increased due to exercise.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul
