Few shinobi have ever been able to prepare a dish so exquisite, but legendary shinobi and sushi chef Hanzo thinks that perhaps his students and their rivals are up to the task. He holds a contest to see which of the girls can hone her Ninja Arts best for cooking as opposed to combat. The competition is fierce; the one who presents the old shinobi master with the Super Dish will obtain a Secret Ninja Art Scroll that will make real her most fervent desire. Whosoever can prove her knife to be as suitable for cooking as for combat will emerge the victor, while all her friends and rivals wind up as mere dessert...\n\nA rhythm spin-off of the ninja busty brawler series, SENRAN KAGURA, Bon Appetit! features cooking battles rather than shinobi showdowns, with emphasis on outrageous humor, delicious food, and gratuitous images of the series lovely ladies. This culinary warfare is carried out through an array of rhythm battles, where tapping the correct buttons in time with the beat will rack up combos and determine the size and quality of the resulting dish.
