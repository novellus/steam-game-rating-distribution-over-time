Behind the cutesy graphics lurks a hardcore crawler, well imo at least. It is harder than it looks and in my relative short play time, I`ve already had many nail biting, edge of the seat moments where I had to concentrate like a zen master to not let my car flip over. It can be frustrating to have to start over but I can`t fault the game as it always seem to be my own mistakes, being me rushing it or not carefully choosing a better line across the terrain. It has the \"one more try\" addictive formula of a great physics based game. If you are even remotely interested I can easily recommend it as I get that this is probably a niche kinda game, but I do believe many more people would enjoy it if they gave it an honest try.","timestamp_created":1608979945,"timestamp_updated":1608979945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ44rKrz/YCf5+svQI="}
