    review: "good wee game once you get the hang of it, can be fairly frustrating\
      \ if you're not sure what you're doing so I definitely recommend doing the learn\
      \ to play tutorial part first. Cute game though.. got it in the sale and not\
      \ gonna lie it's gotten me through the covid anxiety that has been UK Lockdown\
      \ 3.0 \nDoesn't take much space, games don't take long and has a cool AI battle\
      \ mode with sweet wee story infos about your \"opponent\" \n\nDefinitely recommend\
      \ it. glad I found it tbh."
