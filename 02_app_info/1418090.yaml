    review: 'sad clare had no scenes later on. so while the artwork looks great i
      think the adult scenes can use work. i don''t know what type of resources they
      have. it just reminds me of the king of series and they were ok.


      no gallery. options should be in main menu as well. they can be also found when
      you start the game.'
