But what if they’re robots from a place called the Institute of Perfection? <br \/>\r\nIn UglyDolls: An Imperfect Adventure, a whole horde of robots are on the loose and taking over Uglyville trying to make it “perfect!”. What is wrong with that, you might ask? Uglyville is a sweet neighbourhood where everything is a little off. The townsfolk are all uniquely different and embrace each other for their differences.<br \/>\r\nOn the plus side, you get to be Moxy, the energetic UglyDoll who’s got a lot of “moxy”! You prefer Ox? That’s ok, pick him instead and play as the founder and mayor of Uglyville. As one of these characters, you’re about to team up with all your friends from the UglyDolls movie, explore the adorable quirkiness of Uglyville, and work together to send those uptight robots back to where they came from. <br \/>\r\nThis robot invasion is sounding more and more like a party. And we haven’t even mentioned how you’ll meet lots more UglyDolls, interact with them, and collect or craft useful things that will help you capture and return the robots to their home. You will encounter things like pogo sticks and hover hats. You’ve never owned a hover hat before? Then your UglyDoll friends really hope you come on this robot party adventure. But do you have the courage not to run away from the pesky robots? No? Don’t worry. Moxy (or Ox) will run away with you or help you craft the “perfect” item to transport them home. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n•\tCONTROL MOXY OR OX and team up with fellow UglyDolls: Babo, Ice Bat, Wage and Ugly Dog<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n•\tEXPLORE UGLYVILLE with procedurally generated streets that make every game different<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n•\tLURE AND TRAP a horde of relentless robots and send them out of Uglyville!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n•\tPLAY TOGETHER in 2-player local cooperative mode","about_the_game":"Robots are cool when they’re all blinking lights and zooming by with their sleek metallic finish.
