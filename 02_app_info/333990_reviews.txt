It's got its basics down but wasn't able to be fleshed out. \n\nPros/things done right\n-interesting variety in characters\n-Great multiplayer with friends with a vacation mode\n-Lots of story\n-Runs on just about anything\nCons/things id like to see fixed\n-Spelling mistakes and unnecessarily wordy descriptions\n-tropey off brand naming for things \n-No voice over for any dialog\n-No monster index after you've seen them\n-The ability to switch gear mid quest would be nice. \n\nOverall I think this game is worth the buy, and moreover would like to see a sequel that is more fleshed out. Id like to see new character with unique quests, more variety in gear, a lore compendium would be great, and voice overs. I think the developers did a great job and I very much enjoy playing. 6.5/10","timestamp_created":1593637253,"timestamp_updated":1593637253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+NWLhvMCd4WDkgI="}
