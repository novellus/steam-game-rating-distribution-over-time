      <br><br>Built inland from the coastal city of Lianyungang in an effort to transport\
      \ goods arriving by sea into the heart of China, each phase opened in sequence,\
      \ the line quickly becoming a major east-west link ideal for transporting freight\
      \ even as far as Europe; a Eurasian \u201CRail Bridge\u201D.<br><br>Included\

      \ Lingbao and Mianchi of the Henan province, where the line notably makes a\
      \ horseshoe curve through the district of Hubin en route. This section traverses\
      \ the beautiful Loess Plateau scenery, scattered with forests and farmlands\
      \ making for a hillside sea of lush greenery.<br><br>Unlike high speed lines\
      \ in China, which are fitted with CTCS signalling, slower routes such as the\
      \ Longhai Railway are equipped with LKJ signalling, providing a unique challenge\
      \ balancing in-cab and track-side information as you go about your duties.<br><br>For\
      \ passenger and freight traction, the HXD1 and HXD1C electric locomotives are\
      \ powerhouses in every right, capable of performing without hassle. The HXD1\
      \ stands out of the crowd, as it is designed as a double \u201Cback-to-back\u201D\
      \ locomotive, ensuring it can always deal with the heaviest of consists. For\
      \ haulage, 5 freight wagon types and 3 passenger coach types form important\
      \ trains which are always in need of motive power up front, and a driver to\
