It also has a lot of potential. I wouldn't say things are outright bad, more like meh.\n\nFirst of all, it's a lot of clicking. It's a match-1 and that makes it a lot easier than if it were a match-2 type game. Matching tile 2+ is not necessary to advance, but it eventually hinders you if you do not. The fighting is so unengaging that I end up clicking through tiles quickly and missing the details about my health, mind, and status effects. I think this is because they're so tiny and the clicking can be mesmerizing. It bothers me a LOT how time moves in game. I just made it to level 100 and it has supposedly been [b]26 years[/b] in game! That feels so disjointed from everything else in game. It bothers me. Time doesn't matter, beyond for bonuses.\n\nThe characters are that JRPG-side-side-character kind of shallow and sort of childish. They are't really fleshed out. It takes forever to get the story bits out of the game, and the character development is so minuscule to begin with. It leaves me feeling like I'm not getting much out of it.\n\nThe item mixing mechanic has so much potential, so many cool items with very useful effects, but the actual mechanics don't get explained very well if at all, and there are so many variables going on at once that it makes it hard to distinguish what exactly is going on with your results; it's hard to figure out what to mix so that I can achieve what I want. \n\nThe art is kind of different (in a good way), and the coloring gorgeous, but it seems like the artist(s) for the characters didn't fully understand angles. For example, the art is just funky underneath and around the torso and chest areas for several characters (like Monika). \n\nOverall, it's playable and enjoyable honestly. There's enough content and it's understandable enough to enjoy. The clicking is soothing and mesmerizing. While making it a match-1 rather than a match-2 makes it more easily playable, I wonder if they could've given us the option for that difficulty to give us some more fun.\n\nI like it enough to keep playing it. You might too. Maybe grab it on sale.","timestamp_created":1610146071,"timestamp_updated":1610146071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4neiL8vYCe5PUwQI="}
