While this is not a helpful tool for those starting out with Japanese, as it does not teach you the characters, it is wonderful for people who wish to sharpen their ability to identify and memorize said kana. This application allows you to choose between Hiragana, Katakana, Hiragana & Katakana, and lastly... [b]BUM BUM BUUUMMMM![/b] The bane of all Japanese learners; [b][i]Kanji[/i][/b] I personally do not know enough kanji for this to be helpful, but I will very likely use it eventually. However, for the Hiragana and Katakana, it is simply wonderful, I use this software very frequently to warm me up for the day's study session. I especially enjoy the \"Hiragana & Katakana\" option because it mixes the two together and it challenges you to both identify the correct kana, and then identify the letter system. I cannot recommend this enough to someone serious about teaching themselves Japanese, or learning Japanese as part of a course. I give this a very solid 10/10!","timestamp_created":1609794704,"timestamp_updated":1609794704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqLrP5/YCea/BwAI="}
