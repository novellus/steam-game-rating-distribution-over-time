You fly a plane and the scenery rotates around you.\n\nHowever... The mouse controlled map rotation is jerky at best, and it seems to love jumping around in 30 degree steps for some reason.\n\nThe enemy AI is braindead. The enemy planes fly straight at you and shoot slowly, and most of the time you are just reversing out of the way and turning in circles while trying to hit them with your guns while they follow you blindly. The tanks... They drive around predefined paths, lazily taking potshots at you with their wide spread shots.\n\nThere is no \"oomph\" in the sound effects, and the weapons feel pretty weak. The \"powerups\" are fairly rare, they feel meh and you only get 3 charges at a time. They also feel pretty pathetic.\n\nIMO this is not worth â‚¬10.","timestamp_created":1590352370,"timestamp_updated":1590352370,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwleuYpPICd7qHigI="}
