The game is good, has a very fascinating world war 2 story. Loved the strategic aspect of the gameplay, there is a lot of resource management and planning involved. I managed to 100% the game with all achievements in about 4 hours. I would love to see more content in the setting.","timestamp_created":1597926451,"timestamp_updated":1597926451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558062374591827393","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ489T1hfQCebzPnAI="}
