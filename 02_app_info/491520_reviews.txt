It is a horrible & outdated VR game. Don't buy it. Don't buy it at any price. There's no feeling of zero gravity. It's a gaze navigation racing through hoops in space with bad graphics that runs poorly. And they charge $5 bucks for this? I paid .49 cents for this on a Steam sale and I still feel robbed!\n\nBut you don't need to take my word for it. Just check out my video of the gameplay for this game that should be banished into Negative review status on Steam. Be kind, leave a negative review to warn others!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xbytp5vy-jk\n\n[b]Rate 3/10. If you want to stop feeling happy & start feeling frustrated & upset then this game is perfect for that.[/b]","timestamp_created":1550392988,"timestamp_updated":1550392988,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555375874042510986","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlvKn/egCdpWNuwE="}
