It's all 2D, you're a red cube, you can move left or right and everything is black and white. Obviously, the goal is to reach the end in each level.\nThere are lots of taglines and messages between the levels, it's up to you I think to judge if they're enough philosophical or not.. just keep in mind that many translation suck that much that you won't be able to enjoy anything.\nMost of the times you won't even know what you're doing and why some of the black figures are moving and why they're moving that way, but in the end the game looks like a simple minimalistic puzzle game which doesn't present some noticeable kind of uniqueness in my view.\nPlus.. it's slow.\nApart from the three endings, there are 55 levels and you'll have to move your cube through a mix of texts and abstract black figures which will constantly move - remind that you'll be able to go only left or right. \nAll in all, the graphics get better and better between the levels and I don't know, I agree with those who say that the game is pretentious since it's no philosopical masterpiece, but on the other side it has a nice mix of good music, nice graphics (not in the minimalistic levels themselves, but rather in the animations in-between) and somehow challenging but simple gameplay.\nIt's more a matter of timing and waiting rather than pure arcade ability, given the limited moves your cube has. But it's ok.\nI'd recommend the game, all in all. It can be enjoyed by lovers of relaxing puzzles or semi-philosophical matters. In a general way it's not a masterpiece, but it's a nice effort. New mechanics are added as you'll progress with the levels, making the game somehow more challenging.","timestamp_created":1589803628,"timestamp_updated":1589803628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.668380022048950195","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3sbrk/ICdZLMiAI="}
