Fact is, if you're looking for the best modern/futuristic/apocalyptic graphics asset pack, then this here is right up your alley. However...\n\nOne thing to note is that there's only the graphics, no readme or other instruction files (the readme that it comes with is just the milktoast RM EULA stuffs we likely have hundreds of by now), and there's no graphics notation files that state what each tile is (not common with asset packs though I've seen some). You're basically on your own with figuring out what each tile is, and then setting passability for each tile manually (at least for B-E since the editor tends to auto-assign passability for A tiles). There's also the layering and tiling with some of the tiles that doesn't completely work together without editing, and there's also the fact that both indoor and outdoor tiles are combined together. Whilst possibly convenient, it might be to the end user benefit to separate the indoor and outdoor tiles into separate map types.\n\nAll in all, this is an excellent asset pack, and for full price, it is worth getting, but if you don't get this when it is on sale, then you're an ignoramus. I did get it on sale, yes, and it was worth the purchase. Sweet Mercy.\n\nAddendum:\nIf you're going to use this, it does require editing.\n\nTileset B has it arranged so that the top-left part of the stairset is in a place that is designed to always be blank, and set above character, for that tile is tile zero. If one tries to set the tiles up in a way that would make sense with the graphic, you won't be able to move properly with it.\n\nI still recommend this, but the tileset absolutely must be edited from the get go, else it's partially unusable at best.\n\nIt's still great, and well-made, no question.","timestamp_created":1582088332,"timestamp_updated":1597952759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51327437162399292","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zYLahvQCfayb8wE="}
