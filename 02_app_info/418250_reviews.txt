I think the game itself has a lot to offer for select players.\nMy negative review centers around the fact the game simply isn't fun and does not have a lot of flexibility in terms of how you can play it. See the below notes.\n- I've played against the AI at \"Normal\" and \"Challenge\" settings. In both cases the gameplay is rather stagnant in the sense that there are only 1-2 optimal strategies. I.e. The first species to get the largest and fastest territory is always ahead. This includes rushing technology that allows you to colonize the most amount of planets first and then switching the combat tech once the sector becomes stagnant. (Obviously this is usually the case in most 4X games but this combined with below notes just compounds the problem). \n- Combat has only one optimal strat. Mass fighters, limited bombers, and maybe 1-2 cap ships to follow up. I spent several hours designing and testing fleet strats (primarily at the mid and late game) and every single strategy that did not utilize the above strategy simply failed. There is limited or no counter play built into the game to the above strat so you are forced into this every time. \n- Diplomacy (i.e. economic, trade, and science treaties) has limited usage other than being able to bargain for tech or resources. Espionage is actually kind of neat but in terms of effectiveness seems rather limited. (I'll be honest and say I haven't fully experimented with espionage beyond small scale sabotage but again this combination of limited game play just compounds each small issue into a cumulative poo pile). \n- The tech tree is cool. - However again there seems to be an easily defined min/max strat that is obvious from the start and deviating from that strat has no potential gains or alternative gameplay - again the obvious linearity of allowable gameplay limits the entire game experience. \n- Finally, in the multiple games sequences I ran, I noticed that the 1st species to gain a noticeable advantage always won (at least against other AI opponents). Not once did a less powerful AI come back from an even slight deficit. This was over the course of 6-7 games. Again, this indicates that there are very clearly defined optimal strategies that simply have no counterplay.\n\nFinal note - I realize this is not an AAA game and was not expecting an AAA experience but the simplicity and rigidness of game/gameplay (combined with a $39.99 price tag) amount to an exploration of the game mechanics and little more than that.","timestamp_created":1608628030,"timestamp_updated":1608628030,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.58183753490447998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo/nsxPYCePeQvAI="}
