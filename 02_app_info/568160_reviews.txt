The story is okay.  The voice acting is average.  The interactive map is handy.  You can play mahjong if you don't feel like HO fun (but then why are you playing a HOG? lol)  Non-Steam achievements are available for those so inclined.  \n\nI can't put my finger on it, but something kept compelling me to play this game to the end once I started it.  The main story took just under 4 hours, the bonus about an extra hour.  I wasn't in any hurry, mind you.  But whatever their secret ingredient is, the whole game is a really solid entry in the HOG genre.","timestamp_created":1609398027,"timestamp_updated":1609398027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545335769653320313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r6Dm2/YCeqmDvwI="}
