      /><br><i>Capital Profit</i> is a first person crafting tycoon game. It is based
      on the gathering of resources and creating them into various objects. Furthermore,
      you can sell these objects to NPCs in-game via your very own shop. The goal
      of the game is to either make the most amount of money possible or have the
      coolest/ rarest items!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1382260/extras/CoreExperience.png?t=1602113605"

      came up with the name &quot;Capital Profit&quot;. The game is very much based
      on the functions of capitalism, because of the buying/ selling of items and
      getting the most amount of money possible. Plus it was a word that my friend
      liked after I suggested to him (I''m all about that friendly teamwork). Now
      the word &quot;Profit&quot; is mostly based on profiting from the work/ play-time
      you put in the game. Therefore Capital Profit are two words that represent the
      game very well.'
