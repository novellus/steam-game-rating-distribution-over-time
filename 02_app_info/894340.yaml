    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You are the one playing</h2>Music at half\
      \ the volume is playing in the background with different missing instruments.\
      \ You are in charge of these. If you hit the falling icons at the right time\
      \ by pressing the right keys, the missing instrument will play. This way you\
      \ play the song and compose it to its original state.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You\
      \ are the one spoiling it</h2>If you skip some icons or play them too early\
      \ or too late, you will play these instruments at the wrong time or not at all\
      \ and the result will be a mess. Not to mention you probably won\u2019t get\
      \ to the end this way and will lose the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You are the\
      \ one who is god</h2>If you persist and take a while to learn the songs, you\
      \ will get better. You will find that the feeling from playing them is EPIC!\
      \ In a real band, you would usually play just one instrument and you would have\
      \ to spend years learning it. In Beat the Song you only have to learn for a\
      \ few hours (yes, it will seem difficult at first, if you\u2019ve never played\
      \ a similar game) and you will find that you can \u201Cplay\u201D any instrument\
      \ and a different one at any moment! It\u2019s an incredible feeling that you\
      \ have to experience yourself.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You are the one who will\
      \ discover the beauty of music</h2>Should you hear the songs from this game\
      \ on radio or play them on the internet, you would probably pass them without\
      \ noticing. As with 99% of the others. But now that you have the option to \u201C\
      play\u201D them, you will discover their spirit, uncover the sounds you would\
      \ otherwise miss and find that they are beautiful.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You are\
      \ the one who won\u2019t be understood</h2>When you show the game to somebody\
      \ or if they watch you playing, then in most cases they won\u2019t get what\
      \ is going on and what\u2019s so great about it. Maybe it can\u2019t even be\
      \ described. You have to learn it and play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Difficulty</h2>Does\
      \ the game seem too hard? Try different songs at easy difficulty. Even that\
      \ is sometimes a bit easier or harder. The right feeling comes with medium difficulty\
      \ and up.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Full length songs</h2>Most of the songs are unabridged.\
      \ You have heard it - \u201Cit should be shortened to not be boring, the right\
      \ song must have such and such length\u201D... No. Why shorten a great experience?\
      \ Yes, it would be a lot less work to just use shortened versions, but surprisingly\
      \ with full unabridged songs you won\u2019t get bored and won\u2019t even notice\
      \ that instead of 30 seconds you play 5 minutes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How to\
      \ play?</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/894340/extras/howToPlaySmall.png?t=1587406700\"\
