      \ epic amounts of your time, and come visit the colorful cartoony world of Snappy\
      \ Turtle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDive right in, and swim through four deceptively\
      \ dangerous waters... eating as many goldfish and dragonflies as you can while\
      \ avoiding or defeating hungry predators and obstacles along the way.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nTurtle acrobatics have never been so easy; a single tap on your\
      \ keyboard, mouse, touch screen, or control pad makes Snappy swim, and whenever\
      \ there's an obstacle or meanie you can't avoid, execute your indestructible\
      \ spin move.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThose still green around the gills can play\
      \ in the two casual environments. With their less hectec pace and with Snappy's\
      \ ability to spin for an unlimited amount of time, even turtle-like reflexes\
      \ can get  Snappy to the goal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce you've honed your turteling\
      \ skills you're ready to take on the two Marathon environments, and to replay\
      \ the casual environments more agressively... risking your shell for higher\
      \ scores and to unlock all the achievements Snappy Turtle Ultimate challenges\
      \ you with. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe faster Snappy eats consecutive snacks, the\
      \ higher the score multiplier becomes. This is not only the key to beating your\
      \ old best scores, but also the key to unlocking the Mega Turtle modes, which\
      \ are unique to each environment!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat are you waiting for?\
