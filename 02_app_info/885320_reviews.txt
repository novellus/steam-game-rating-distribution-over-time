Where to begin. \n\nFirstly, the game screenshots and trailer make the game look 100x more playable and enjoyable than it actually is. \n\nSo much could have been done with this game. It has so much potential. But when basic game play actions like zoom and scroll and point and click aren't even available and you can only play the game in eagle eye mode, so much is missing from this. As it stands currently, this is not a playable game. It's a panoramic view of something which has yet to be transformed into a game. It's not even worthy of being on early access. Come on guys. At least improve some key elements of this game before charging anything for this. \n\nInteresting idea. In a VERY early development phase. Released 2 years ago... come on. This can be so much better.","timestamp_created":1589500369,"timestamp_updated":1589500369,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4htvmivICfd/ihwI="}
