This also ties into the AI being absolute shit either just staring at you or sniping you from miles away.\n\nAnother thing to add onto the poor AI is the fact that they dont notice the dude fifty feet away getting sniped, and therefore are dumb AI because its not like you dont hear a bullet traveling over twice the speed of sound entering and exiting flesh and bone, not even mentioning the sound from the gun or the cries of pain from the npc.\n\nFor the above reasons, I do not reccomend this game, and I will fully stick with my opinion.\n\n(edit 2/8/2018) Still the only game I've refunded as of this date\n(edit 9/29/2019) Still the only game I have ever refunded. Also I probably update this review more than the devs update the game at this point","timestamp_created":1483577252,"timestamp_updated":1569744105,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":225,"votes_funny":14,"weighted_vote_score":"0.856434643268585205","comment_count":14,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ44sWCvu0Ceurabg=="}
