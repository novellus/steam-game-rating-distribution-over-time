    review: 'When running a game with mods from the workshop the mods dont load. Had
      issues with Kenshi and Genmod. Whats the point if its just going to cause more
      problems then it fixes!

      After unistalling this Kenshi now has a disk write error. I have restarted my
      PC, ran steam as admin, I could not verify integrity of game cache.


      THIS PRODUCT IS BAD NEWS!'
