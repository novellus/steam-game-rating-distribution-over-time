As a result, you are regularly left with multiple viable solutions and simply have to guess, fundamentally failing the most basic requirement of a logic puzzle.\n\nBeyond that, most of the puzzles inexplicably have to be unlocked, 1 by 1, with \"stars\". You can earn a maximum of 4 stars for a perfect solve, and the *minimum* price to unlock a puzzle is 5 stars... I'm sure you can see this is an inherently broken in-game economy, but the devs evidently could not - or, less charitably, they were planning this as a mobile game and intended to have in-app purchases, and wanted to make sure people were forced to pay in order to play.\n\nAs I said - terrible. Don't buy, at any price.","timestamp_created":1583013730,"timestamp_updated":1583013730,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7ZK+yfACeIav9QE="}
