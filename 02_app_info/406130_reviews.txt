The combat does a great job of providing a challenge for the player, and the gameplay is precise enough to reward smart and tactical movement by the player. The level design helps in providing wide open spaces when you need it (when facing enemies that charge you like bulls), but shrinks it down to small corridors to cause some claustrophobia as the traps and enemies surround you at every turn. The difficulty is high: and yet fair: not relying on tricks, but forces you to adapt to your environment. While some of the sound design needs a bit more impact and there's some goofy menu implementation, the game's weaknesses don't overshadow the core combat in any way. If you're looking for a 2D combat fix, you could do a LOT worse then Dark Maus, because it's got the combat down.\n\n[b]First Impressions Video: https://youtu.be/ZuON7xzHZaM[/b] \n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Combat is surprisingly precise and makes the combat difficult and yet satisfying on several levels. Timing, luring, and good reflexes all play a huge part in being successful, and button mashing won't work ever. Technically, was surprised on how accurate the hitboxes were. \n[*] Weapons and skills lead to variety in combat. Good enemy selection early on helps this along. Using skills wisely can help not only through combat, but in exploration sections as well.\n[*] Boss battles were memorable, forcing you to use what you had learn up to that point in new ways.\n[*] The aesthetic may be simple, but it captures the loneliness of the world and the dire circumstances the world is in. In particular, I love the lighting affects in the game, never knowing what's around the corner, and how it causes even more tension. \n[*] Level Design does a great job of complementing combat as well, making the situations a bit more tense with strategically placed traps and claustophobic conditions. \n[*] Ok, the name is appropriate for the game.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The menu implementation needs work, especially with the map. It became a huge chore to bring it up via the controller implementation. Maybe a mini map would have worked better.\n[*] The sound design could use some improvements. Turning off the sound entirely didn't seem to have any effect of the game's combat.\n[*] There seems to be a lore here....I just wish there was more story. \n[*] You'll get lost, and the map implementation doesn't help. It becomes a little bit more of a problem because enemies respawn.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.
