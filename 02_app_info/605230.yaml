      is the possibility of joining a group of hackers to carry out coordinated attacks,
      or creating your own group in which you will be able to recruit other players.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Single Player Mode</h2>Grey Hack is intended to be played in
      Online Mode, benefiting from the richer environment of an always-online universe,
      but the game also offers a single player mode for those so inclined.<br><br><br>In
      Single Player mode, you play in a world created on your computer. Unlike Online
      Mode, when you exit the game in Single Player, the in-game universe stops, and
      progress resumes only upon your return.<br><br>In Single Player mode, during
      the development, you may experience a worse performance than Online Mode. This
      is because in Single Player mode all the system load and background processes
      are performed on your computer, unlike the Online Mode where the same functions
      are performed by the official Grey Hack server.<h2 class="bb_tag">Feedback</h2>I
      am open for suggestions. If there is any feature you would like to see in the
