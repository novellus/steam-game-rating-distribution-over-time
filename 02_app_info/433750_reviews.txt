You live with your wife, who is a cold and bitter person, that never loved you and the story follows on her coldness towards her husband. \n\nThat is the basic gist of the story and it basically follows on the Old Mans feelings and how he deals with the situation. It's definitely some messed up stuff and honestly it was pretty depressing to play, but overall the story was pretty interesting and definitely was worth going through all of it.\n\nGraphics:\n\nMost of the game is hand drawn and I liked the art style, even though it's very rough. Some of it seven gross to look at, especially the main characters. I liked the hand drawn art style a lot, but I felt it suffered in places, especially the environments, which weren't that good, they look much lower quality than the characters.\n\nAudio:\n\nThe audio design is flat out the worst part of the game. The voice actor that narrates everything, her acting is decent, but the mixing makes it sound super quiet, where most of the time you can barely understand what she is saying, not to mention everything else is incredibly loud.\n\nThe music is not very good and the sound effects mix into are just an awful experience. There's a lot of echoing whenever something happens and it's just attack on the ears. \n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay is going to be really hard to explain. Basically you control the head of the old man and you fly around in a room of the house and you basically try to mess around with the items in those rooms to progress into another room.\n\nThe gameplay is not very good, for multiple reasons, first of all it's really cryptic on what you have to do. I had plenty of times where I had no idea what I was doing, all I did was flying around, interacting with items and just hoping I was going to progress. \n\nControlling the head is also not easy, as it feels incredibly slippery. It just sort of slides out of place and it becomes annoying when you're trying to interact with something specific. \n\nVerdict:\n\nThe Grandfather used to be a paid game and if this was still the case, I would have given this a negative review, however since it's free, I think it's worth it for horror fans, since it only takes roughly 20 minutes to finish, only worth it if you're a horror fan.\n\nFinal Rating:\n6/10\n\nPros:\n+ Decent plot\n+ Art style is pretty decent\n\nCons:\n- The audio design is terrible\n- Goals of each level are pretty cryptic \n- Controls are way too slippery \n\nIf you liked this review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews","timestamp_created":1604020915,"timestamp_updated":1604020915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.639862418174743652","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s5nGu/UCdrz7qgI="}
