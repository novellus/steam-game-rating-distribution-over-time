Instructions are non-existent.  Shows a circle to use to teleport but no way to actually teleport.  No hint of objectives or game play, they expect you to just figure it out as you go.  No guides.  No discussion of any kind.  Until now, no user reviews to let you know how bad it is.\n\nIf there is anyway to actually play this game there are no instructions to let you know how to do so.","timestamp_created":1595607712,"timestamp_updated":1595607712,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518750011920928955","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1596197605,"developer_response":"What is your headset model?\nYou have to use axis joystick controller to move reference point and press button where you want to teleport.\nI think it is easy and intuitive. But I will include some instructions. You can see video promotion where you can see the different options.\nThere are another kind of movements: with joystick, moving controllers, you can try it.\nI hope you can enjoy better it in your next game play."}],"cursor":"AoJwkLDowPMCdLmmlwI="}
