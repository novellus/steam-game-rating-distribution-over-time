    review: 'Copy of Dota 2 for the map, copy of LoL for the heroes, laggy, buggy
      and P2W. Played when it was not on steam, and nothing as change. This game will
      going down pretty quickly, play LoL or Dota 2 instead, don''t waste your time
      here.


      The only good thing in this game is that you can uninstall it as quickly as
      you have installed it.'
