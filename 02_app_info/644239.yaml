    short_description: Tokio and Calen travel back to the Bakumatsu Era of Japan to
      find out the True History about the Shinsengumi. When they get there, rather
      than seeing a group of brave samurai ready to cut down those who oppose the
      shogunate, they find a bunch of guys wearing masks, running away from girls.
