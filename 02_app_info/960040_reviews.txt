Pizza is espically fun to make.\n- It's graphically pleasing to the eye and with the colour pallet I didn't get much glare through the lenses\n- The Devs are currently active. They released the Italian and Japanese Kitchen's since release\n\nCon's:\n- The tracking can be a bit iffy. I can't tell you how many times I've reached into the bin to get a burger bun bottom and ended with a top. Also trying to remove a piece of food that's attached itself to an order is especially frustrating not to mention making fries. Trying to get the fries to fall in to the fry compartment without rubber-banding back into the fry was like an exercise in futility.\n- The Difficulty can spike in later levels. To the people who get perfect scores, Can i borrow a pair of your 6 extra pairs of hands you're using. However, I don't believe there is a failure state for missing orders. If it's completely fudged. Throw the plate at the server and move to the next order.\n- The Signposting in the Italian levels are hard to make out for Pizza. I've missed ingredients because I couldn't make out what i needed which forced me to add them and re bake the pizza, breaking my flow and I can't quiet tell that the Pasta is done when it's done.\n\nNeutral:\n- Multiplayer I haven't played it yet\n- According to the other reviews. People have encountered bugs. I haven't found many bugs in my play through but yours might differ.","timestamp_created":1609881362,"timestamp_updated":1609881362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw5YOa6vYCeJbpwAI="}
