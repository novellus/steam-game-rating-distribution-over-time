I hate it when they add things like this to a point & click clearly made for a different kind of audience. [b]no progress is lost if you die[/b], you can keep trying, it's just incredibly annoying. and of course, there's a maze, but it's very binary and over fast.\n\nthe presentation is like a comic book, but somehow weirder, still fine, and while it's fully voiced, [b]I wasn't a fan of the main guy's voice and the performance of some of the others[/b]. beating the game unlocks a codex with character infos and stuff, it's online-only, not part of the game, but covers all the developer's games, as they're part of the same universe. and getting all the achievements reveals a bonus post-ending scene in the main menu, but I obviously didn't bother with that, just looked at the relevant files in the game's folder.\n\nit was a really enjoyable adventure despite the few issues I had, [b]took about 7 hours and it's definitely recommended[/b].","timestamp_created":1599086004,"timestamp_updated":1599086004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.62031710147857666","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8oC9qPQCcoy3nwI="}
