My Contrast Enkidu skin is topnotch and easy to pick out in netplay. I mean it's only $3 and I feel like an adult it's an acceptable purchase. That's 1 soda at a really nice restaurant, I just pretended to do that. It's not like my finances look like \"$600 for rent, $9000 for UNICLR skins, $200 for food\" ya know\n\nBut it's still only like 3 colors, French Bread is just lucky I am ass at the game and am only good with 1 character.","timestamp_created":1597014494,"timestamp_updated":1597014494,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws+ne6vMCefO+mgI="}
