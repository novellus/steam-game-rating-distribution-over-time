This version however is far outdated and has issues. It does not recognize modern GPUs and tends to have output issues. There is no online play like the 360 version and the KB&M controls are pretty bad. However, for $2.49, it's nostalgic for sure.","timestamp_created":1609812973,"timestamp_updated":1609812973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43JKV6PYCeN7JwAI="}
