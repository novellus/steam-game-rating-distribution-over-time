I love the ability to expand the league as time goes on (started with a small 8 team league and have expanded to 12 teams).\n\nI hate that I can't accept or decline penalties, sacked a QB for a 13 yard loss but they were holding so it was down over with only a 10 yard loss.  But that's the only problem I have with this game.\n\nOverall, spectacular game and a blast to play.","timestamp_created":1604260186,"timestamp_updated":1604260186,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+fjWwvUCfuDRqwI="}
