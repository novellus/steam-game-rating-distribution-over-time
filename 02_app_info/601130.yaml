    review: "I'll start off by saying that Spark is a good game. It is an arcade style\
      \ shoot 'em up with 3 different modes. Arcade-style means that your goal is\
      \ to get to the highest score possible, and when you die... you have to restart.\
      \ This means there is no real progression, the only progression is in your skills\
      \ and how far you can get and how high a score you can achieve. I personally\
      \ enjoy this type of game, but people searching for a compelling story and level\
      \ progression should probably search elsewhere.\n\nGameplay wise. Spark IS fantastic.\
      \ The combo system is what makes this game stand out from other shmups. You\
      \ have access to four different bullets, if you shoot the slower more powerful\
      \ ones... you get exhausted fast. That means that you have to balance getting\
      \ the big bullets out there for big combos, and shooting smaller bullets to\
      \ keep the mobs cleared. When you combine the big bullets with the small bullets,\
      \ you get COMBOS. Combos are what make Spark great, there are so many different\
      \ combos, every time I play I feel like i am discovering new and better ways\
      \ to destroy enemies. Also, it seeing the colorful explosions of bullets all\
      \ across the screen is great and reminds me of fire works. \n\nThe game is very\
      \ difficult if you are not a shmup player. It seems to be balanced around knowledge\
      \ of the combo system, so if you are not using combos it is likely you will\
      \ get overwhelmed very fast. This can lead to a frustrating learning curve.\
      \ After you get some combos/super combos down, the game feels more like a traditional\
      \ shmup and is more about dodging and hitting big combos than anything. When\
      \ you get to that point, it is super satisfying... but the road leading to that\
      \ can be VERY hard for new players.\n\nPROS:\n\n[list]\n    [*] Awesome and\
      \ unique concept with the combo system.\n\n    [*] Good enemy variety\n\n  \
      \  [*] High skill ceiling\n\n    [*] AMAZING SOUNDTRACK (seriously I love it)\n\
      \n[/list]\n\nCONS:\n\n[list]\n    [*] Long tutorial\n\n    [*] Difficult learning\
      \ curve\n\n    [*] No story or level/character progression\n\n[/list]\n\n\n\
      Overall, I recommend this game. If you don't think its worth the price, just\
      \ catch it on sale!"
