However, the devs haven't fixed the issue yet. This is a warning to not buy this game if you just want it for split screen! Secondly, the ram requirements are wrong. They should be in GB rather than MB. Keep that in mind!\n\n[i]My review down below:[/i]\nGas Guzzlers: Combat Carnage is in a weird place with the release of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/243800/Gas_Guzzlers_Extreme/]Gas Guzzlers Extreme[/url]. Who would want a older version of the Extreme, especially when I've seen Extreme discounted to as low as the price this game is listed for. Yet, I picked it up because I was curious, and to my surprise, the game is actually different in many ways.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[b]Different Artstyle[/b]\nI love the orange UI, with the menu, and HUD just looking better, and cleaner. It kinda has like a 70s or early 80s type of vibe with the orange color, and bubbly letters, compared to the edgy, fire, and burnt look of Extreme.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nRight away when I played Combat Carnage, everything looked... better. I did a video to compare both games, and I found that Combat Carnage looks a lot better than Extreme, with better lighting, particle effects, the color grading, and atmosphere. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scl67kcdLDQ\nMost likely this was done because people complained about the effects making it hard to see, rather than just an artstyle change like I thought so before. It doesn't explain away all of the changes done with the graphics, but that could be a factor in why the lighting, and particle effects were toned down.\n\n[b]Powerups[/b]\nPowerups in this game last for 3 times, compared to Extreme where they only last 1 time. Sure, this means that there is less skill, as you can just spam powerups. However, this means that the tracks are way more hazardous, with oil spills, and mines littered all over the track. Rounding a bend to see 3 or more mines right infront of you is a butt clenching experience you don't get in Extreme. *Side note: In multiplayer, powerups only last for 1 use like in Extreme.\n\n[b]No Sponsors[/b]\nIn Extreme, you could get companies to sponsor you. This would mean you were have to wear their sticker, and go to sponsored events, in turn gaining extra cash. \nWhy do I see this as a bad thing? Well, because it makes it way easier to get money, making it less of a challenge to manage, and save money. In Combat Carnage, I was a little stressed for money, and I had to sell my old cars just to purchase upgrades on my new vehicle. This doesn't really happen in Extreme, unless you are a bad driver. So why would someone want to go with a basic color paint job if they are going to miss out on money, and sponsored events? \nSince there are no sponsors in Combat Carnage, you don't feel 'forced' into going with them, so you can customize your car with the paint job, and stickers of you liking. This also means that the AI drivers also have these paint jobs, which help them stand out, and look better compared to every single AI in Extreme having a worn out, tacky sponsored sticker.\n\n[b]Camera[/b]\nFirstly, the default 3rd person camera is way too close in Extreme, but this can be fixed by changing the FOV values in the GasGuzzlers.xml file. \nIn Combat Carnage, the default camera FOV values are bigger, causing the camera to be set back further. They also removed a camera view in Extreme, which is a more of a top down look. You can see it in my video [url=https://youtu.be/scl67kcdLDQ?t=280]here[/url].\n\n[b]Not Only Just on Steam[/b]\nYou aren't 'forced' to use Steam. You can still get the game on GamersGate (DRM free), however it is still listed there at $20. You can also get physical copies on places like eBay which are also DRM free. However, this means that this game does not have any Steam achievements or leaderboards compared to Extreme, so that is something to note.\n\n[b]Very Cheap[/b]\nAt $5 USD year around, this is a bargain. Extreme normally is $25 (not including DLC), though I've seen the base game, and the DLC on sale for around a few dollars more than Combat Carnage. So if you are looking to try out the Gas Guzzlers series without waiting for Extreme to go on sale, this is a perfect option!\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[b]Less Content[/b]\nLess maps, less gamemodes, less vehicles, less customization options, and no DLC. With the less content, career mode becomes a lot more boring quickly as you cycle through the same 3 modes on the same tracks, while in Extreme, there is a lot more variety, and the game doesn't get as boring as quickly.\n\n[b]Heavier Vehicle Handling[/b]\nVehicle handling is better in Extreme. With Combat Carnage, it feels heavier, making it much hard to control. I even matched up the same controller settings to Extreme, and still found the vehicle handling to be different. If you prefer the heavier handling, you maybe see this as a plus, but I struggle to drive with the heavier handling model in Combat Carnage.\n\n[b]Less Refined AI[/b]\nThe AI does seem less refined compared to Extreme. AI tends to not put up as much of a challenge compared to the same AI difficulty in Extreme. Even on the impossible difficulty, I tend to outpace the AI in Combat Carnage, while they are more on my tail in Extreme. If you are a hardcore vehicular combat player looking for challenging races, Extreme has much better, and more challenging AI.\n\n[b]Multiplayer[/b]\n[list]\n[*]There are no AI bots in online multiplayer, which there are in Extreme. \n[*]No one plays multiplayer. Extreme doesn't have many players on either, but you are better off trying to get people for Extreme rather than Combat Carnage's online multiplayer.\n[*]People can not be banned or made admins as the game doesn't have a way to track user IDs. Extreme can track this using Steam IDs, so you are able to ban people, and make them admins.\n[*]The arena maps, and gamemodes were only added for multiplayer. In Extreme, you can play them offline in singleplayer and career.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Old Code[/b]\n[list]\n[*]This version was last updated in 2013, while Extreme received its last update in 2016, so you might encounter glitches that were already patched in Extreme. \n[*]There are longer load times due to less optimized code. Extreme has the option of DirectX 9 or ll, in either 32bit or 64bit exes. Combat Carnage is limited to only DirectX 9 in 32bit.\n[*]The HUD seems to be designed for 720p and lower, so it can look small on larger resolutions.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Other[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Even though the William voice is credited in Combat Carnage, it is not a choice of one of the character voices.\n[*]You can't look to the left, and right like you can in Extreme\n[*]Less variety in the soundtrack.\n[/list]\n\nIn short, Gas Guzzlers: Combat Carnage is still a good buy, and a very fun game even with its short comings to its bigger brother.","timestamp_created":1563315076,"timestamp_updated":1608389936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":34,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.814336895942687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuNjgvfYCcdvBzgE="}
