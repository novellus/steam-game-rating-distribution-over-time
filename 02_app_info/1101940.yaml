    review: 'I didn''t get far enough into this game to review the story. Seemed like
      it might be interesting. but I couldn''t get through enough of it because of
      the extremely clunky interface:

      - The action buttons appear to the side of the cursor, which is offputting.
      Makes it seem like there''s an issue, but it''s actually designed that way.

      - The mouse sensitivity is extremely high, and there is no way to change it.

      - Every action has the same sound effect. It gets really annoying really fast.

      - Volume issues in cutscenes - music is super loud, can barely hear speech.

      - There''s no way to skip the startup cutscene, and it''s pretty long. If you
      do play this, do it in one sitting.


      I''m an avid fan of HOGs and have played and enjoyed a lot that had mediocre
      interfaces. This one is pretty bad. I''ll just go read the book it''s based
      on instead for the story.'
