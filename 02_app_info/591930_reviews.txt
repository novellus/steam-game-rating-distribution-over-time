I played the original Ultimate Domain so much when I was a kid that I have all 5 maps memorized.  But if you're expecting to wage war with old Karnak and Sun Tzu, think again.  After 15 minutes, I got in a loop of collecting unlimited resources without ever being allowed to capture standards to expand my empire, or ever given new settlers to fill my empty houses.  I never caught a glimpse of any other civilization and was blocked from making multiple workshops or inventors, so inventing crawled along at a snail's pace.  There wasn't anything to do but watch animals move back and forth as my villagers continued stockpiling huge amounts of gold and resources to no purpose.  The only thing to break up the tedium was random attacks by brigands.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the graphics and gameplay feel like just a cheapo Chinese mobile strategy game, and the game inserts all sorts of juvenile sound effects and dialogue such as burping, farting, sex noises, diarrhea noises, etc.","timestamp_created":1587521015,"timestamp_updated":1587521015,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4zYnoz/ECeObMggI="}
