      \ of New York</strong></h2><br>You act as a newly-fledged vampire in New York.\
      \ You have to learn what it means to be one of the Kindred in a huge, vibrant,\
      \ contemporary metropolis. On your way you\u2019ll meet different NPCs \u2013\
      \ other vampires, thin-bloods, ghouls, humans... and more. You will perform\
      \ tasks that will put test your humanity and take part in a complex and often\

    review: "A friend is soon to run a VTM game for myself and some friends. Curious,\
      \ I purchased the game in the hopes to learn more about the setting and the\
      \ core gameplay of the TTRPG. I've had time to dabble in the three pathways\
      \ and explore the story. \n\nThe good: \n- Every character is complex and believable.\
      \ Even the minor characters you only see in passing will eventually have a moment\
      \ to shine somewhere or another.\n- The writing balances its wit and sobriety\
      \ well, and delivers both  comedy and horror with equal grace\n\nThe bad:\n\
      - gameplay can be a little monotonous. \n- There's /some/ variation between\
      \ the three characters in the story, but looking into all three runs I found\
      \ to be tiresome after trying out one in earnest. \n- The PCs have character,\
      \ but there's little variation in dialogue options or story beats\n- Save points\
      \ are more like a bookmark; there's no going back after you make a choice. I've\
      \ found going back through the entire game to change /one/ choice to dampen\
      \ my enthusiasm in playing. \n\nIn all, I've found my experience to be fun and\
      \ exciting with some unfortunate lulls. VTM: Coteries of NY relies heavily on\
      \ the theatre of the mind. If you don't like \"choose your own adventure\" style\
      \ games, this isn't a game for you. However, if you enjoy a complex world of\
      \ both supernatural intrigue and inter-political conspiracy, you'll enjoy the\
      \ game as much as I have."
