Zaccaria is probably the most impressive pinball simulation right now. And the customisation options are through the roof.\n\nThis is a good table, but the designers still have a bit of a problem making tables with great flow, you know, that thing that makes Medieval Madness or Monster Bash being so amazing. I think the issue is that ramps and lanes are generally a bit narrow and that makes the table overly technical.\n\nIt's still loads of fun, and i love the look and theme of this table.","timestamp_created":1540986405,"timestamp_updated":1540986405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.599352777004241943","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iND85OYCeI3brQE="}
