With deep, engaging gameplay, outstanding music, lovely art, a unique world and a really interesting story, it has pretty much everything you'd want from a game. The pacing is tight too, with no filler whatsoever. Though slightly (and understandably) rough around the edges, this game was obviously a labour of love and certainly gets things right where it counts. I eagerly await future titles from XenoHorizon, and encourage anyone who is interested in fun action RPGs to give this a shot.","timestamp_created":1606669656,"timestamp_updated":1606669656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/Ku+ivYCeq+rtQI="}
