Fairly good sound design, lighting, and overall story makes for a fairly immersive experience if you can avoid dying often.\n\n- Textures are poor, character models are horrific, inventory management is annoying. \n\nOverall, a pretty good experience, especially considering the age of the game. I would recommend this game if you're a fan of Bioshock. It's easy to see how bioshock's gameplay and dystopian survival/horror atmosphere was heavily influenced by System Shock 2.","timestamp_created":1609809015,"timestamp_updated":1609809015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jYaG6PYCcI3IwAI="}
