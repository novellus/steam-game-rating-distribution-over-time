    review: 'So this is kind of like a much less polished version of Piloteer, but
      with procedurally generated stages. The basic concept is challenging and enjoyable.


      Yet this might be the most critical I''ll ever be toward a game that I still
      really like and would recommend.


      1. The main criticism is that there''s no real sense of progression. The game
      does keep track of how many levels you''ve completed, and after a certain number,
      new concepts are introduced (like the grey areas in which your boosters don''t
      work anymore), but every level is procedurally generated, so you never feel
      like you''ve completed a task to be checked off. You just move on to another
      procedurally-generated level. It kind of leaves you empty. There''s also no
      time-trials or anything either.


      [UPDATE (12/23): After completing 100+ levels, I''m not really bothered anymore
      by the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph. There''s some thrill in
      never knowing what you''re going to get next, and I enjoy seeing the number
      of completed stages keep going up and up (presumably infinitely, lol).]


      2. The procedural generation often doesn''t make a lot of sense. I regularly
      experienced stages where it was a straight shot from platform to platform, and
      the "obstacles" were nowhere near being in my way.


      [UPDATE (12/23): This is still true, but I also periodically get stages that
      truly do feel impossible at first. I even start to wonder if the game accidentally
      created an unbeatable stage. And it''s satisfying when I figure out a way to
      beat them after all.]


      3. The sound is pretty bad. The only sound you hear is the jet-boosting of the
      ship, which literally sounds like television static.


      But other than these things, great little game! :)'
