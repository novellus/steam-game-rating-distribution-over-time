This game is WORSE than terrible. First of all.....thats some deceptive crap in the video making it look like you have hold of the handlebars, because you DON'T. Its touchpad controls.....and poor one at that. Oh....and this 'ATV' is SLOW.....and I mean boringly slow. The audio is pathetic, fake, does not match the atv. Seriously....the original Excitebike had better audio. The trees........how can you have square trunks on trees in 2018? this dev is clearly lazy not bothering to find or create a tree file that looks real.\n*\nSo, in summary....if you want to awkwardly move around at a slow pace and look at square trees while a headache inducing fake motor sound replays over and over in your ears.....then this game might be for you. Otherwise.....don't waste your disk space.\n*\nGenX gamer....signing out....","timestamp_created":1526390472,"timestamp_updated":1526390472,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1Mf9seMCd8G0oAE="}
