    review: "Relesed in 2014, and made by DTM (Digital Train Model). This one of the\
      \ more highly detailed DLCs in the game and thats because it was made by DTM.\
      \ There is a lot details and sounds with this DLC. \n\nPros:\nOperable windows,\
      \ doors and mirrors\nFunctioning lighting inside the cab.\nFunctioning step\
      \ lights and numberboard lights.\nThe horn sounds great, very realistic.\n2\
      \  different units.\nAccurate and good bell sounds\nVery realistic engine sounds\n\
      When you release or apply the brakes, the brakes acctually move when you look\
      \ outside\n\nCons:\nPrice, you only 2 models, there is no rolling stock\nHorn\
      \ cuts out a lit bit.\nHeadlights are ok (It should have the same headlight\
      \ effect as the UP SD60M, F59PH, F59PHI, P42DC, Dash 8-BWH where you can see\
      \ the headlight from a far distance) \n\nOverral Opinion:\nNot worth its price\
      \ so only by when there is a sale but I can definately recommend it because\
      \ of how detailed it is and because its from DTM which means it will be really\
      \ good.\nScore 9/10\n"
