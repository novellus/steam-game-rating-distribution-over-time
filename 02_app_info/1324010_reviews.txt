It's definitely horror, and with slightly different handling would have felt self-consciously edgy in an obnoxious way, but as it is I'm impressed by the tone, which ends up being more melancholic, and even hopeful at times, than exactly scary.\n\nI will say, some of the puzzles were very difficult, especially the ones that break the hidden objects pattern. (I think I ended up finding a walkthrough for the flower puzzle, for example, because I had no idea what to do) and the game seems to expect you to commit everything to memory, even minor details not highlighted as having future importance. Your mileage may vary on whether that's annoying or not.\n\nAll in all, I found this a more nuanced game than I generally expect from hospital horror. It's treatment of mental illness is... kind of weird, but not offensive, at least to me. There was a period early on where I thought about giving up on it, mostly because the aesthetic and slightly clunky translation (I think. I did come to appreciate the language by the end, too, but it definitely reads like it's translated from another language) were close to being Too Edgy For Me, but in the end I'm glad I stuck it out. Short but satisfying experience.","timestamp_created":1605810065,"timestamp_updated":1605810065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45qHv8PUCfcKrrwI="}
