    about_the_game: "When is chess the most enjoyable? When you win! When Fritz entered\
      \ his first tournaments some 25 years ago, humans still had a real chance of\
      \ taking the engine down. Only a few years down the line, Fritz was already\
      \ beating grandmasters left, right and center, but ever since his 4:2 victory\
      \ over Kramnik in 2006, Fritz has been considered unbeatable. Who would want\
      \ to play against him? In the case of Fritz 16, however, playing against an\
      \ engine is now once again the very definition of fun! A host of features, including\
      \ &quot;Assisted Analysis&quot;, which gives you discreet visual hints as you\
      \ move, and emoticons, which show Fritz\u2019s mood, are there to help you.\
      \ Even with little knowledge of chess, you can enjoy many an exciting game,\
      \ and more importantly, victory, against Fritz. If things don\u2019t work out,\
      \ Fritz 16 shows you the combinations you might have missed directly after the\
      \ game with the handy \u201CTactical Analysis\u201D function, or you can dive\
      \ right into &quot;Easy Play&quot; calculation training to hone your skills.\
      \ Fritz doesn\u2019t come up short when it comes to playing strength either:\
      \ the new multiprocessor engine was developed by star programmer Vas Rajlich\
      \ (&quot;Rybka&quot;) and is up there with the global elite.<br>No other chess\
      \ program offers you more, with the online manual alone spanning a whopping\
      \ 457 pages! But you won\u2019t need it - Fritz 16 is intuitive and easy to\
      \ use, and whether you want to play against the engine, analyze or enjoy some\
      \ online blitz, Fritz 16 will open just the functions you need at the click\
      \ of a mouse.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/763270/extras/F16SEStarterE.jpg?t=1523613545\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">&quot;Easy Play&quot;: Play, Train, Win!</h2>It is\
      \ indeed as simple as it sounds. You now only need one click to start a new\
      \ game and you can immediately play out any position against Fritz 16. Even\
      \ more important: earlier versions of Fritz offered various sparring functions\
      \ (Handicap, Friend, etc.) to emulate \u201Cnormal\u201D human play. In Fritz\
      \ 16 all these playing modes are combined in one function: &quot;Easy Play&quot;.\
      \ Just choose a level from Beginner \u2013 Occasional Player \u2013 Club Player\
      \ \u2013 Strong Club Player \u2013 Master \u2013 Grandmaster and the program\
      \ acts accordingly. Fritz 16 plays according to the chosen level but intentionally\
      \ commits hidden errors, tactical errors in particular! So, don\u2019t shy away\
      \ from lively attacking games! You will definitely crush the program occasionally!\
      \ Funny: during the game Fritz 16 shows your ELO-performance but also uses FritzEmoticons\
      \ to show how he feels!<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/763270/extras/F16Emo1ENGT.jpg?t=1523613545\"\
      \ /><br>But of course Fritz 16 is not always easy to beat. Here a new training\
      \ function comes into play which you should try if you are not certain about\
      \ your move: hold the piece you want to move a bit longer with the mouse. This\
      \ activates the new function &quot;Assisted Analysis\u201C, and shows you how\
      \ good each possible move of this piece is. This tactical safety net increases\
      \ your playing strength! <br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/763270/extras/F16AssistedENG.jpg?t=1523613545\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New training methods to calculate: improve core competence!</h2>&quot;Calculating\
      \ variations correctly is the core component of playing strength&quot;, as ChessBase\
      \ head programmer Matthias W\xFCllenweber put it with nice distinction. If you\
      \ play regularly you know how true this is! Fritz 16 offers you the opportunity\
      \ to test your calculating skills during your games. The focus is on calculating\
      \ and visualising positions correctly. Fritz helps to check whether the moves\
      \ are legal and tactically correct which helps to calculate meaningful variations.\
      \ The highlight: a right click with the mouse always allows you to compare the\
      \ real and the visualised position.<br>Additional improvements in Fritz 16:\
      \ optional action sounds in blitz games give advice about mistakes by you or\
      \ your opponent \u2013 kibitzing live-games with asymmetrical multiboard \u2013\
      \ 3D-multiboard \u2013 a program that helps to enter games when the scoresheets\
      \ are unreadable \u2013 New set of pieces in 2D, and much more!"
