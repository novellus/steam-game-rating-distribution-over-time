      \ the infamous Parthia campaign where a whole Roman army perished in the desert\
      \ and the Pontic campaign against Mithridates the Great. These later campaigns\
      \ add fully armoured cataphracts, light and scythed chariots, light cavalry\
      \ archers and the Greek Pike Phalanx to the game system."
