    review: 'Great selection of five new tracks to enjoy.

      These tracks have increased difficulty even on Easy-, which makes it a bit awkward
      at times.

      New Magma world, which looks great just like the others.

      Fair price for the additional content.

      Makes me crave for more packs!'
