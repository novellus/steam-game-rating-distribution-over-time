Congratulations you have now seen 100% of the game. This is not a joke.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat you are buying is not a game that you can \"play\" it's a digital book with ciphers and puzzles that require you to go do research on the internet. There's not even a way to input what you discover into the game. Your \"game play\" is quite literally to view the book (as shown in the trailer) and then alt-tab out of the game and go read about the puzzles that you are trying to solve. \n\nIf you finish them it will be outside the game on whatever piece of note paper you are using to keep notes. There's nothing else to interact with in the game, there's no way to input your solutions to even find out if you are correct. You just look in the game, see the puzzle and then google the information it's trying to talk about and read more there.\n\nEven the achievement isn't for playing or accomplishing anything, you just flip the pages a certain way and it pops up.\n\nI'm at a loss for explaining how this has 100% positive reviews up until now. Well congratulations, here's the first thumbs down.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd before anyone says I should have read the store page, let me quote the store page:\n\n\"Alchemia is a cryptic puzzle game which is solved through research outside of the game.\"\n\nYes I fully understood that this was going to be a cryptic puzzle game and that it required research outside of the game. I expected this to have ARG elements and require abstract thinking. However, I also expected it to be longer than 2 minutes of content. You are given 10 pages to read in-game, they might as well have just been screenshots posted somewhere on the internet. And you have no way to input your solutions in game.\n\nThis is quite literally a collection of screenshots that lead to a puzzle that requires you to read Wikipedia and guess whether you solved it or not since you get no feedback from in the game at all.\n\nThis entire game is less content than the main menu page of most other games.\n\nThis review is longer than the contents of this game.\n\nThis could have been a clever marketing toy for another game if it was given away for free and led you to information about the game it was advertising, too bad it's just a list of things for you to google after reading a few pages.\n\nSeriously, watch the trailer, that's the entire thing. You just flip the pages and then go google for the information that's on them.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]","timestamp_created":1598777461,"timestamp_updated":1608677427,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570142447948455811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ487CpxvYCftLYngI="}
