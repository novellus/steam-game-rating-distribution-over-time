I can only give my recommendation.\n\n(Tip for VR users: when starting cold, the wheel chocks and the ropes have to be removed. This only worked for me via the co-pilot position via checklist.) \n\nBut overall this is a very good aircraft for beginners and as I said in detail and design very well done. \n\nThumbs up","timestamp_created":1581290436,"timestamp_updated":1581290436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2qaQlvACc42i8QE="}
