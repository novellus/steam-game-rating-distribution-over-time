      /><br>Caveblazers is an action focused platformer roguelike set in a fantasy
      world. Each game is unique with procedurally generated levels to explore and
      a massive amount of items, weapons and equipment to discover.<br>The game takes
      place in a recently discovered cave, said to hold &quot;unimaginable power&quot;.
      You play as an adventurer setting out to explore the cave and find out what
      riches it holds. However, you are not the only one...<br><br>As you delve deeper
      in to the cave, you'll discover new areas to explore, new weapons and new monsters
      to try them out on.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Smart Characters!</strong></h2>Throughout
      your journey you will encounter AI characters. Some friendly, some hostile.
      We're using an <strong>advanced pathfinding system</strong> which means friendly
      characters will be able to follow you wherever you go, and hostile characters
      will be able to track you down wherever you hide. There is no escape. Be afraid!<h2
      class="bb_tag"><strong>Platformer Roguelike!</strong></h2> Caveblazers is a
      modern platformer which incorporates some Roguelike and RPG elements such as
      permanent death, randomized potion identities, an RPG-style inventory system
      and tons of items, equipment and upgrades!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Daily Challenge
      Runs!</strong></h2><strong>Each day a new adventure will be generated!</strong>
      It will be the same for everyone and you'll only get one chance at it! These
      challenge runs give you a starting loadout, and feature a set of different traits.<h2
      class="bb_tag"><strong>Epic Boss Battles!</strong></h2>Between each area you'll
      encounter a boss. <strong>Each boss is very unique, requiring a different strategy
      to defeat.</strong> Bosses are generally gigantic monstrosities with life bars
      stretching across the entire screen. Good luck!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Character
      Customization!</strong></h2>A whole load of unlockable hats, tunics, trousers,
      robes, and more! Or perhaps you fancy stripping off and heading in to the caves
      in the nude? Go for it!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Compelling Combat!</strong></h2>Largely
      overlooked in other modern Roguelike games, Caveblazers attempts to move away
      from the simplistic combat systems we've seen in other games in the genre, and
      incorporates <strong>fun, fluid and fast-paced combat</strong> which is accentuated
      by the game's brutal and persistent blood effects.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Challenges!</strong></h2>In
      case that isn't enough content, Caveblazers features a bunch of challenges for
      the well seasoned players to take a punt at. These challenges reward players
      with new items, weapons &amp; perks!
