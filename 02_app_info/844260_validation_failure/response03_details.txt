Play as The Guy, whose parents apparently were too lazy to give him a proper name. Experience feudal injustice, inquisition, witch-hunting, and join The Grand Tournament. Meet valiant, yet incredibly stupid knights. Complete a wide variety of twisted missions and quests, or don’t give a damn about the plot and bring mayhem in the villages and cities. Choose to go on foot, or by a stolen horse. Fight with a sword or pick a fancy automatic crossbow. All that, spiced up with an inappropriate Monty Python inspired sense of humor.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/844260\/extras\/benis2.gif?t=1610111003\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Be a bold, bald thug in a medieval sandbox<\/h2><br>Rustler’s world is filled with humor, anachronisms, and pop culture references.
