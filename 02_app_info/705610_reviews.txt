This is fine, except that the engine runs very well with turn-based combat and does not facilitate a beat-em-up style approach. It doesn't work very well in RPG Maker.\nI don't mind the moon logic of how to progress-that's part of the charm, even if I have to view a walkthrough once or twice to find NPCs who have wandered behind some set dressing.\nI'll struggle through a bit more, but it feels like a better funded step down. Maybe I'm not an esoteric enough thinker, but it feels like the word salad which is so iconic of Takamo is less focused, so it feels like he's just filling out text boxes to make the world feel less empty. It feels like I'm reading my middle school essays, trying to satiate a word count when I've got nothing else to say. I'm not even having a good time.\n\n I'd suggest you save your money. Stop at Gingiva, and you'll end on a high note.","timestamp_created":1602287416,"timestamp_updated":1602288291,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482320308685302734","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y+H0h/UCfeL0pgI="}
