I restarted...\n...only to find out the poison didn't wear off when they died.\nSo all my games from that point on would lose before the 20th tile I stepped on.\nI tried to drink the health potion you spawn with to fix it.\nIt removed the poison from my defender.\nEveryone else died. I suicided into a battle.\nI restarted the game.\nEveryone except the defender has poison. I did not spawn with a potion.\n\nThis is why I stopped playing.","timestamp_created":1603711152,"timestamp_updated":1603711152,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1603729083,"developer_response":"Hello!
