      \ train their muscle memory and reaction time for hand to hand combat situations\
      \ through virtual aggressor assault scenarios. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMartial arts\
      \ and self-defense practitioners aren't always able to practice their skills\
      \ whether it's due to not having a sparring partner, not having a suitable space,\
      \ or not being able to find the time to train. Not training can lead to lowered\
      \ Muscle Memory and Reaction Time which, in a combat scenario could lead to\
      \ undesired outcomes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith SETVR users can practice their\
      \ martial arts and self-defense skills at any location, any time, with or without\
      \ anyone. Users can improve their reaction time and muscle memory through virtual\
      \ reality aggressor assault simulations. This allows for continual improvement\
      \ of self-defense ability through dedicated practice of movements and neutralizations\
      \ on a virtual combatant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeep Track of your progress\
