    review: I liked the 3d feel to this game. It is really a unique game the way pieces
      can be picked up, overlapping, and even upside  down.  Sometime pieces will
      fall on the floor instead of the table and you will need to navigate to pick
      them up.  Strangely enough I enjoy the challenges of placing pieces.  However,
      the update in the spring kind of broke the enjoyment because the graphics look
      like you are putting together a quilt instead of a puzzle.  The borders are
      too distracting so it is difficult to know which piece goes where.  If development
      can provide the option so the graphics clearly transition to the next piece
      as before I would make this my favorite puzzle game.  Right now it is borderline
      to recommend the game because of the quilt appearance, but do like the developers
      ingenuity.
