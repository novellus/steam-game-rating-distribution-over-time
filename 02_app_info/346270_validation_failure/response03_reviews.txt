What I could see of it at all looked promising but between the game chugging along at about 2 frames per second when it still worked and being flat out BROKEN (as in it can't even launch) by the most recent \"patch\", it would appear that the promise is an empty one.  If they ever get their game together and... well, get this game together -- and the game is as good as it looks like it could be -- then I'll happily reverse my position.  As of now, however, I wouldn't even recommend downloading this game if it were [i]free[/i].\n\nEDIT Nov.5,2015: Refund request was denied.  Guess I'm stuck with this piece of crap.\n\nEDIT Nov.28,2019: Apparently we were all supposed to receive a new, functional version of the game as a separate product.  I never received anything of the sort.  Double-screwed!
