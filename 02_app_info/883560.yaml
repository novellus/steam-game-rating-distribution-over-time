    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift[/h1]\n\nYou can view my review & gameplay\
      \ here: https://youtu.be/YaMNsbdMOtE\n\nThis game is now free to play. It originally\
      \ retailed for $24.99 USD and I myself paid $6 bucks during a Steam sale. This\
      \ is a VR supported dungeon crawler with multiplayer coop. Unfortunately, it's\
      \ a rather simplistic dungeon crawler with limited content. You do have full\
      \ locomotion with snap turning. \n\nSo you can level up and face higher difficulty\
      \ enemies. But during each run you'll be going down the same corridors. The\
      \ gameplay really doesn't change at all. It's a matter of kiting enemies stronger\
      \ than you and slowly bringing down their health in the higher difficulties.\
      \ You can choose 1 of 4 different wands with different types of spells from\
      \ fire, ice, shock?/ arcane? and a mixture of all of them I think. I can't really\
      \ tell since the graphics aren't all that good.\n\nThere are 3 boss fights.\
      \ The boss fights are interesting ... the first time around. The cool thing\
      \ is that you can easily restart where you left off if you die. However, the\
      \ game is just too monotonous after the novelty wears off ... after about 30\
      \ minutes of playtime. There are just much better dungeon crawlers in VR like\
      \ Karnage Chronicles, VR Dungeon Knight, or Trickster VR. It's hard to believe\
      \ this game ever charged $24.99 USD when it feels like an alpha still with little\
      \ content. I would have rated this game negatively, even at the $6 USD sale\
      \ price.\n\n[b]Rate 6/10. However, it's free. You can play with your buddies\
      \ online with or without VR. Worth the download if you don't have a better option\
      \ I guess. This game doesn't even make my top 100 list of FREE Steam VR games.\
      \ Should it be there?[/b]\n\n[i]P.S. You can join my Steam curated group here:\
      \ https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Oculus_WMR\n\nHere is my list of the 100\
      \ Free Steam VR games: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32244664-Oculus-Rift-Reviews/list/29492\n\
