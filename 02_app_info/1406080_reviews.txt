The gameplay is good, but a lack of storyline hurts it.\n\nSTORY:\nThere isn't a plot.  You play a female wizard.  You kill monsters.  That's it.  There's no explanation as to why you're fighting baddies.  Even when the game ends, there is no, \"Congratulations!  You saved our land!  Thank you, girl wizard!\"\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nYou walk forward and kill monsters.  You'll eventually fight bosses.  Beat the boss and go to the next stage.  You have a staff that shoots unlimited fireballs.  You can collect stars to make your weapon more powerful.  Getting hit will make it lose power.  And you'll find capsules to replenish health.\n\nPROS:\nArc Wizards is a fairly easy game to play.  You can get through it in about 40 minutes.  This is good, if you want a simple game to pass the time for awhile.  Playing with a controller is great!\n\nCONS:\nI've already mentioned the lack of story.  Losing staff power after being hit will make the game more challenging till you find more stars.  The worse thing is no pause button.  If there are no enemies on screen, you can stand still and not be attacked.  But I would feel safer to push a button and see everything froze.\n\nOVERALL:\nI'm giving Arc Wizards a thumbs up recommendation.  It's a great game to spend an hour playing and beating.  If you prefer games with a lot more depth, Arc Wizards is not for you. \n\nSPECIAL NOTE\nI tried Arc Wizards before.  I gave the game a bad review because of a bug that messed up the gameplay.  I would like to thank the developers for fixing this problem, and making Arc Wizards worth playing.","timestamp_created":1605440899,"timestamp_updated":1608685236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1607699566,"developer_response":"Thank you for reporting the bug.\nFixed a bug in player movement.\nFixed energy pills disappearance."}],"cursor":"AoJw8pXHxvYCeoTCrgI="}
