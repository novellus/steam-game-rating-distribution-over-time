    about_the_game: Connect-X is a 3D puzzle game for the mathematically inclined.
      Solve 50 mathematical brainteasers of increasing complexity and difficulty.
      Each level contains several bubbles that must be filled with whole numbers,
      along with arrows in a variety of colors determining relationships between the
      numbers. Your goal is to fill all of the bubbles in a way that follows all of
      these relationships perfectly. Earn stars by completing levels, and use these
      stars to unlock new conundrums to challenge your understanding of numbers even
      more. This game will make anyone with an interest in mathematics think twice
      about how well they know such basic ideas as divisibility and addition.

    review: 'big brain math puzzles


      in all seriousness i''ve enjoyed what i''ve played of this game so far, i''m
      not the best at math though so i got stuck on set 3

      would recommend if you like math puzzlers or just puzzles in general, this game
      aint that expensive give it a go
