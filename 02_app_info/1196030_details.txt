You have awakened a fivesome of forgotten ancient gods worshipped by the first humans in times long gone. Together with them, you embark on a war campaign against the High King and his declining empire. Your task is to defeat the High King's troops, gain followers from the ranks of the people and persuade the gods to repay you generously. However, it will not be easy, the gods are too much like humans. You will become entangled in the web of politicking and old wrongs you have awakened along with the gods. Each of the deities has its advantages and drawbacks. Which of their goals are the closest to yours?
