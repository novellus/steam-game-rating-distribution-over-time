I highly recommend this game if you like simple to understand but deep and rewarding puzzle mechanics! Unfotunately it lacks online, addition of which would make it my multiplayer game of choice.\nP.S. If you launch the game in Japanese language, you can play Story mode which was cut from the English version, also the characters will have voices and additional descriptions (all in Japanese of course)!!!","timestamp_created":1606932592,"timestamp_updated":1607010291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40+HRlPYCdYfotgI="}
