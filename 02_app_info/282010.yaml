    short_description: "Carmageddon is the original freeform driving sensation, where\
      \ pedestrians (and cows!) equal points, and your opponents are a bunch of crazies\
      \ in a twisted mix of automotive killing machines. The game features anarchic\
      \ drive-wherever-you-like gameplay and over-the-top surreal comedy violence.\
      \ It\u2019s the racing game where racing is for wimps."

    review: "Good game. \nTerrible f**king port, it's a lazy cash grab.\nAnd yeah\
      \ I won't bother fixing it, not my job, don't sell sh*t if you don't know how\
      \ to make it work cu*t.\n"
