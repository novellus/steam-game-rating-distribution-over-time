Completing achievements is kind of difficult that way.\nOn the other hand, the game is really fun and quirky in a unique way. It has great soundtrack and pretty hand drawn graphics.\nHowever, the creativity and interesting objectives each stage are not enough for the original price due to how short it is. The levels are also not really randomised so it feels the same each time. Buy it on sale for sure.\n\n\n[b]Overall, I think I'll keep an eye on this developer. So far, most of his games were amazing. GEESE vs CTHULHU is no exception.[/b]","timestamp_created":1609293063,"timestamp_updated":1609293346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzfbW2PYCdbTRvgI="}
