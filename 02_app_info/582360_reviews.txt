On the plus side, my hook shot is looking a lot better nowadays.\n- Menu system could do with a bit of work, quit and continue buttons are close together which means I have mistakenly quit games halfway through.\n\nOverall, worth picking up for the price if you're into the sport.","timestamp_created":1511379201,"timestamp_updated":1514598494,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540389955043792725","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw893G0uACeOSbjAE="}
