    review: "Here is my first time gameplay video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/gIYyYbtu7hY\n\
      \nI also review other VR games on my channel: www.youtube.com/user/rpatenaude\n\
      \nI really had high hopes for this game but it just has so many problems and\
      \ features shown in the trailer that are not actually there. It's almost like\
      \ the people who made 69 Ways to Kill a Zombie abandoned that project to do\
      \ this one. IT DEFINITELY HAS POTENTIAL! But seriously finish the game before\
      \ you release it. The trailer shows people riding around in trucks together\
      \ running through Zombies shooting but that is not actually in teh game right\
      \ now. \nI hope there are improvements coming because I would like to give this\
      \ game another shot; here are the things that bothered me:\n\nDraw distance\
      \ is horrible. Thats the single thing that really kept sticking out to me throughout\
      \ the entire time playing the game.\n\nMelee weapons do not work (I only tried\
      \ the baseball bat)\n\nThere is a single generic zombie noise that all the Zombies\
      \ make. Would be nice to see more varieties.  \n\nVehicles? I see them in the\
      \ trailer but not in the game (at least not usable ones)\n\nKilling zombies\
      \ is way too hard. I had to unload 10 rounds into the face of one just to take\
      \ it down; after that I was out of ammo. Head shot single kill damage would\
      \ be something I'd like to see."
