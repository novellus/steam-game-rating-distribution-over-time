Everything was proportionate and worked well with each other.\n\n♬ Music / Ambience ♬\n☐ None\n☐ Random sounds\n☑ Alright\n☑ Spoooks\n☐ Good \n☐ Beautiful\n- The spooky sound effects leading up to triggers were a nice touch and did not feel over-used. The ambience worked well, but some parts did not have a seamless loop.\n\n☠ Difficulty ☠\n☑ Easy \n☐ Average\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Hard\n☐ Smh\n- Brain power can be set to CRUISE for this game.\n\n§ Bugs §\n☐ Rip power cord out of wall\n☐ Consider calling Pest Control\n☑ A bug or 2\n☐ Nothing encountered\n- Only bug encountered was after the blue-lit hallway, when the soccer game was on the TV. A noticeable drop in frames was present until the end of this segment of the game.\n\n☯ Story ☯\n☐ There is none\n☐ Back to the drawing board\n☑ Decent, but surfacey\n☐ Captivating\n- There is a functional story, but since the game is short, the story stays on the surface and doesn't really get intimate with/for the player. Voice-over could've enhanced this.\n\n⚔ Gameplay ⚔\n☐ RAGE\n☐ Boring\n☐ Confusing\n☑ Terrifying\n☑ Fun\n☐ Challenging\n- A straightforward experience that had smooth mechanics and progression. The jump-scares/triggers complimented the gameplay, and did not feel over-saturated and random.\n\n۞ Game time / Length ۞\n☑ Short (0 - 3 hours)\n☐ Few hours (4 - 8 hours)\n☐ Long-form (10 - 20 hours)\n☐ Completionism (40-60 hours)\n\n$ Price / Quality $\n☑ Full price \n☑ Wait for Sale \n☐ Don't buy\n- The game is only $2.99, so paying full price shouldn't be an issue. But, it seems like it is not fully fleshed out, so waiting for a sale wouldn't hurt.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZmFaxexV1Tw","timestamp_created":1605377933,"timestamp_updated":1605377933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ47Of+4/UCesGvrgI="}
