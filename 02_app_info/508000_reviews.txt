That tutorial doesn't exist. You need to see a bunch of different ones by different tutors to fill out your skills, and each tutor will add a new aspect to your knowledge.\n\nRobotpencil's plus here is that he's teaching the student not to waste time being fussy, or sweating details to the point that the soul of the created face is lost. What's important is that you come out of your work with a picture of a fictional person who seems real because he/she is looking back at you, and drawing every pore in that face doesn't really add to that sense. So, he's not going into facial proportion, texture or colour. In fact, he's teaching you a valuable lesson to just forget about that and trust your eyes, and to use the major advantage of digital painting to put the facial features into a layer system at first so that you can grab, move, rotate and transform these things as you go. \n\nSome of what he's doing is only possible to recognise when you've seen someone else explain principles in much greater detail. On the other hand, I've watched videos with exhaustive detail before, to the point where the lesson loses flow and I want to go to sleep! Ultimately, you learn more from a demonstration that focuses on a limited number of concepts than one that tries to dump everything into your head at once. Each approach has its value, of course, and you'll need both sides to form a good foundation for your understanding.\n\nOverall, a good video at a decent price. I certainly took something new away from it, and I've sunk quite a lot of money into other tutorial videos over the years.","timestamp_created":1472399228,"timestamp_updated":1472402329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":55,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.816985130310058594","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42pGB6dYCc4GVYA=="}
