    review: 'This whole product  is  actually 2 products in one... #1 The music is
      nearly twice the volume of the movie  speech,  so you can actually enjoy playing
      it as a  music  CD  while you  work on  programming or  while you play other
      games...   #2  The  Movie is the full documentary of  Commodore to Amiga up
      till 2018.    It is  a wonderful behind the scenes look at the very founders
      of the  home computing and technological  revolution that  changed the world  from
      1970 to 1990... an still today.

      What is still AMAZING about  C>64,  Amiga, and the  Atari  400/800/800XL/ST   computers
      = is  YOU.   YOU  create the software,  you become a full programmer - from  machine
      code, assembly,  BASIC,  etc.    8 bit computing is at a  level  most  human
      brains  easily relate to and understand.   16 bit computing  takes your code
      to the next level,  and developer tools help you write and create.   Once you
      move on to the new   smart phone and  windows platforms of today - now you need
      a team of  engineers to write a new product...

      But back in 1980s -  a  few guys could  put a game together,  or a business
      program,   they could make up the boxes and make copies of the disks and label
      them  and  sell them by  mail -   advertised  in computing magazines,  long
      before the internet...   These are not only the Golden Age of computing -  they
      are obtainable to anyone wanting to become creative... and the  newest version
      of the CPUs  are used in thousands of products today -  low cost,  industrial
      strength and durable,  the computing power of  the 1980s   is even cheaper now,  and
      running countless systems, devices, and applications with  room to spare...  embedded
      code with 64K of  RAM,  and not even using all that memory -  orders of  magnitude  more
      cost  effective than the  Gigabytes used to keep bloatware running.     Tiny
      tight 8-bit code is  near bullet proof,  very  dependable.   Thank you for a
      wonderful   double product  !  :-)'
