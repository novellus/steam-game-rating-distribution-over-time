They look similar to the city buildings that are really in Chicago. That is the extent of the good in this DLC. The models are horrible. It adds nothing to the realism. Imagine having a less than appealing photograph of London and they didn't include the London Eye. Yes, that's a modern landmark. Why did I bring that up? Well, for some reason they chose to NOT include the Chicago's Centennial Wheel on Navy Pier. The Centennial Wheel replaced the aging Navy Pier Ferris Wheel in 2016. There have been Ferris wheels on Navy Pier continuously since 1995 and intermittently since the 1893 World's Fair. Why's something that is so obvious along the city's waterfront and that old not in a sim about Chicago? Who knows. For me, though, it is not worth the $11.24 I paid. The omission of the Centennial Wheel was just an added aggravation that I spent my money on this DLC.","timestamp_created":1586843546,"timestamp_updated":1586843546,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmd7Pu/ECfvnQgAI="}
