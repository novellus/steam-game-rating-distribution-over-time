The first type have puzzles that are so easy that a lobotomized gibbon could do them.  The next type are the ones that have puzzles so confusing, undefined, and/or difficult that you end up going to the hospital after putting your fist throught the wall (and when you return just go on you tube and find a solution).  The third is a haphazzard combination of the two making you wonder if the lobotomized gibbon is now developing games.  The fourth are the gems.\n\nThese are the games that are difficult enough that you ALMOST have to go on you tube for a solution but still solvable so that when you perservere you feell like you've accomplished something.  Joyfully, this is one of them.\n\nAs of this writing, I have finished all of the puzzles.  Several took quite a few whacks at it to slowly eliminate incorrect pathways.  And each time I would solve a difficult one, it truly felt like I conquered something!!\n\nThe premise is simple.  You need 1 complete rotation of all of the spheres on the screen.  The catch?  They are on multiple pathways (sometimes multiple speeds) and they cannot touch each other.  No special effects.  No open world.  No gimmicks.  Just your brain vs a game!!!!!\n\nAnd if the game isn't great enough on it's own merit, the developer actually supports the game!!!!  Having been burned a couple times on this one (as we all have) it was refreshing for this developer to fix all 3 issues on sepereate occasions that were impeding the game/achievements.  And I will always support developers that care about the gamers that play their games.  (and for those of you that are achievement hunters, how does 161 achievements grab you!!!!!)\n\nThis is now one of my favorite straight puzzlers I have ever played.  To the developers, cheers!  To those who love a puzzler that will challenge you DO NOT MISS THIS ONE.","timestamp_created":1458352794,"timestamp_updated":1458352794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.657763659954071045","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmbWmxtMCdrXMUw=="}
