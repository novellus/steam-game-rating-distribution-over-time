The cultist chants the Omnia Infernum, and as the last syllable is spoken, is levitated several feet into the air and begins to scream uncontrollably.

It turns its attentions to its immediate surroundings and begins to put into action a diabolical plan... There will be blood!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn Archons of Doom, you will take on the role of a powerful and evil being that seeks to conquer all of the many realms of the universe. You have a host of creatures you can summon from your dark court, all of which serve you until death - and sometimes beyond it as well. You are up against another Archon of Doom in each of these realms that wishes to also rule it. Both Archons will have to fight any independent creatures - the denizens and defenders of the realms - that will seek to stop either of you.

Creatures can fly, return to life when slain, drain the lifeforce from others, charm foes onto your side and even steal the very weapons right from the hands of your foes! Some creatures can be ridden by others, some are amphibious, some may walk through walls and other solid objects, some divide in two and slowly take over the realm...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nArchons are powerful magic users that can use spells to influence the battle field and destroy their enemies. They can also draw powerful magical circles on the ground and bask units in them to boost their normal powers to greater levels. However, you must always protect your Archon - lose it and all the creatures controlled are similarly, and instantly, Doomed... costing you the realm.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe game features a campaign to conquer every realm with a specially designed Archon of your own making, a single realm battle mode where the Archon you play is randomly generated and a multiplayer mode to take on up to three other Archons at once. There are also single player only realms in the campaign mode to test your Archon to the limit. Only the strong will survive.
