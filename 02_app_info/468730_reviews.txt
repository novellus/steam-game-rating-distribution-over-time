The premise of the game is that you are clueless wizardry students trying to defend your magical academy while your teacher's are away. Many a threat or problem will arise that you will have to use your spells to tackle - spells of which you have no idea what they will do. Unfortunately the cluelessness doesn't end there as the rulebook is just as clueless in telling you how the play the game and the rest of the board isn't all that helpful!\n\nDirection is key in any boardgame and like many of the failures of Tabletop Simulator's DLC, it comes from their rulebooks....\n\nI won't say it is the worst DLC I've played, I did have fun playing it. But it isn't one I recommend either.","timestamp_created":1605117110,"timestamp_updated":1605117276,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9r2c3PUCeurkrQI="}
