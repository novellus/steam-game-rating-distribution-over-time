    review: 'Like many others, the included scenarios do not work for me. That is
      literally the only reason I buy DLC, so I can play more scenarios. I have no
      interest in quick drive, with one exception (See my bubble car review).


      Do not buy this. I can only hope that someday Dovetail fixes this. I''m sure
      they wont, but I''ll change my review if they do.


      Update April 2020


      I have been able to successfully complete the scenarios. When tracks.bin or
      whatever fails to load, I hit F2 to save and it as per someone''s advice, and
      somehow sorted it out for me.


      I don''t care if the horn doesn''t sound right or all the lights don''t work,
      I''m really not overly concerned. But I can do the scenarios now.


      Buy it on sale if you''re going to buy it at all.


      Also, since as far as I can tell this fix doesn''t come from Dovetail, i''m
      not going to change the positivity of the review.'
