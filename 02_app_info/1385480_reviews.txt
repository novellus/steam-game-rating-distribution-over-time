At the moment, it's a fun turn-based game with great flavor that is right up this humble reviewer's alley. I love crime games and there is not enough gritty, tactical, management based games steeped in realism. The game's mechanics are similar to a game I really enjoy on my phone called \"Respect\" and its sequel. Yet, Gangster Empire: Vendetta has quite a few more options for expanding your criminal empire.\n\nAs of now, the title is a little rough around the edges, but the game's heart is there and can provide any aspiring crime kingpin a healthy distraction. I am happy to support a developer that is thinking outside of the box and offering a different spin on the turn-based genre and cannot wait to see what blossoms.","timestamp_created":1609875425,"timestamp_updated":1609875425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47rCD6vYCeYDmwAI="}
