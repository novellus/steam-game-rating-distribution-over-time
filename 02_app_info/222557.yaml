      \ from the stunning London St Pancras station into the heart of Kent.<br><br>Departing\
      \ London St Pancras, the route for Train Simulator passes under the City with\
      \ Class 395s reaching speeds of 140mph before stopping at Stratford International\
      \ on the edge of the London 2012 Olympic Park. Speeding through the Essex countryside\
      \ and under the River Thames, high speed services stop at Ebbsfleet International\
      \ Station, where power switches from overhead electrification to third rail\
      \ pick-up. From here, Class 395s cross onto the \u2018classic\u2019 Kent lines,\
      \ pausing at stations including Gravesend, Rochester and Sittingbourne, before\

      \ famous for their Japanese bullet trains and on which the Class 395 was based.\
      \ The model is capable of fast acceleration and deceleration to minimise travelling\
      \ time, a feature of the bullet trains, and run on dual voltage systems for\
      \ overhead and third rail pick up. The Class 395 is also unique in being able\
      \ to run under TVM430 track-to-train signalling on the high speed section of\
      \ the route and traditional aspect signalling on the \u2018classic\u2019 section.<br><br>The\

      \ view, roof detailing with working fans, driver vigilance system, accurate\
      \ overheard catenary, trackside detailing including AWS boxes and ramps, and\
      \ up to the minute signalling on the \u2018classic\u2019 route.<br><br>London-Faversham\

    review: "I bought this addon just because I like the Class 395 and wanted to drive\
      \ it on some other high speed of third rail routes I already own. I figured\
      \ the London-Faversham route itself would be a nice bonus, but boy, was I wrong.\
      \ \n\nFirst of all: the speed on the high speed part isn't that high. 225 km/h\
      \ is quite ridiculous, when you're used to the German en French standards. But\
      \ no matter: it could still have been fun to drive. \n\nBut it's not (there's\
      \ bummer number 2), as about 95% of the high speed track is in a poorly lit\
      \ tunnel, which is extremely boring.\n\nThird: the overhead wires vary in height,\
      \ but the pantographs do not. No need to explain how weird that looks......\n\
      \nFourth: the platforms vary in both height and width, so you can either see\
      \ your train crashing the platform, or see the doors way up or down the platform.\n\
      \nThe third rail part is way longer than the high speed part, but it's dull\
      \ as [you can fill that it in yourselves]. The scenery is mediocre to say the\
      \ least. The branch to Sheerness at Sea even has no scenery at all.\n\nIf you\
      \ consider buying this because of the route itself: don't. Even on sale it's\
      \ a complete waste of money.\nIf you like the Class 395 -which has two of the\
      \ gayest repaints ever: completely pink or with a cute rainbow (just search\
      \ for #trainbow)- then the \u20AC11,95 I spent on it on sale are worth it. \n\
      It's a cool train with nice sounds. AndI if you push Q on your keyboard every\
      \ minute, it takes you where ever you want at a speed up to 240 km/h, without\
      \ emergency braking all of the time.\n\nEnjoy the ride with pride, yet not the\
      \ utterly bad route!"
