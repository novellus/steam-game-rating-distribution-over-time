      waving the weapon to kill the enemy, or you may read the spell to release the

    review: '"Arena," I have yet to see anyone else play the game and the game-integrated
      opponents are the same enemies from the original game.  There are virtually
      only two new spells to the Arena version vs. the original game which is overwhelmingly
      disappointing.  The weapons are all the same--nothing original.  Truly, the
      developers should have focused their time on improving the original game and
      not even wasted the time creating the "Arena" version.  It is not worth even
      the mere $5 dollar price tag.'
