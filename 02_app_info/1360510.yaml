    review: 'If you are reading the reviews and thinking about buying it, you probably
      already know you are going to love it. Likely you saw and it stopped because
      you like anything to do with outer space. The list of awesome starts with, "Driving
      around on the moon." The game is certainly peaceful, serene, and relaxing. Driving
      without racing, or shooting anything - very well done. You may learn a few things
      along the way, too. Oh, and you get to drive around on the moon!


      Artwork and environment are beautiful, physics are seemingly reasonable (not
      sure, never been there!). The game doesn''t punish us for bad driving, even
      when we intentionally do so. This is a hassle-free simulation experience.


      Very easy to control, tried with a keyboard and with a gamepad. no trouble.
      With just a little effort and was able to make an old Logitech steering wheel
      play nicely. Fun for anyone, and especially if you have a wheel and pedals,
      don''t pass this up.


      Awesome game! Looking forward to future releases. Until then, I''ll be on the
      moon, driving around.'
