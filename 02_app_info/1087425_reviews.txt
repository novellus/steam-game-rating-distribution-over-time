There are many jutsu that people want in this Season Pass. In Season Pass 2, there is also a new Title that makes the Title in Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker increasingly diverse. My advice may be to multiply more characters, Jutsu, weapons, titles, and costumes. So that in this game more and more players with characters are made from their creativity. I also hope that there will be characters who don't exist in this game to become VR Masters. Hopefully there will be Konohamaru Sarutobi, Mirai Sarutobi, or Asuma Sarutobi to become VR Masters so they can get the \"Sarutobi Clan\" Title. And also I hope that there will be Kaguya Otsutsuki, Hagoromo Otsutsuki, Hamura Otsutsuki, Indra Otsutsuki, Asura Osutsuki, Toneri Otsutsuki so that I can use Jutsu from the Otsutsuki Clan and can get the \"Otsutsuki Clan\" title. \n\n\nI will wait for DLC Season Pass 3. I hope there will be Shisui Uchiha in Season Pass 3, we need more jutsu from the Uchiha Clan in \"Attack Type\" for our character. And also please add missions in VR Missions, so that players can enjoy playing \"single player\" mode","timestamp_created":1585656269,"timestamp_updated":1585656269,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jNGemPECeOPb/AE="}
