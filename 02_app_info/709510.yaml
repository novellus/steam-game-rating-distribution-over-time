      /><h2 class="bb_tag">The Story</h2>A group known as <strong>The Sworn Light</strong>
      have been gaining power throughout the world through divide and conquer tactics.
      While the humans, felines, electropunks, and ghosts argue amongst themselves,
      <strong>The Sworn Light</strong> are taking advantage of each situation in order
      to take ultimate control. One day Keltoi village chief <strong>Wuotan</strong>
      summons his strongest warrior <strong>Freyja</strong> to embark on a long and
      dangerous journey. Her mission is to trek towards The Pantheon to defeat the
      source of <strong>The Sworn Light</strong> before the world falls into chaos.
      Along the way <strong>Freyja</strong> and her party will battle deadly enemies,
      make new friends, and encountered long forgotten horrors!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/709510/extras/bn2b.png?t=1526482594"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">The Game</h2><strong>Towards The Pantheon</strong> is a
      turn based 2D RPG with unique twists on the classic formula. Gone are genre
      standards of elemental types, elixirs, elves, inns, and generic love stories.
      Instead players of <strong>Towards The Pantheon</strong> will ride hamsters,
      journey through a survival horror inspired mansion, collect dead memories, eat
      copious amounts of sushi, and partake in regular chats around the campfire.

      began in 2016 when lead developer <strong>Connor O.R.T. Linning</strong> set
      out to create an RPG that incorporated elements of adventure and horror genres.
      Soon afterwards <strong>Leandro Tokarevski</strong> joined in to create the
      pixel art using a palette of only 16 colors resulting in a vibrant and distinct
      world full of charm. <strong>Towards The Pantheon</strong> is the result of
      big dreams and two grueling years of hard work. In October of 2017 the prequel
      game <strong>Towards The Pantheon: Escaping Eternity</strong> was released for
      free on Steam to great reception.<br>  <br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/709510/extras/bn4b.png?t=1526482594"

    review: Very cute RPG game, enjoyed the characters and plenty to do. I enjoyed
      the plot and the style, but the only downside is that my game glitches at the
      final battle and won't let me continue past the fight so I have no conclusion.
      Good game otherwise
