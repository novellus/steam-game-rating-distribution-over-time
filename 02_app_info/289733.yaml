    review: "How to Survive One Shot Escape DLC Review\n\nSurvival just got more brutal\u2026\
      \n\nPlease note that this Review may contain spoilers from the Base game \n\n\
      Some key points that this game add on has to offer:\n\n1.\tNew Game mode: One\
      \ Shot Escape!\n2.\tPermadeath.\n3.\tIncreased difficulty.\n\nReplayability:\n\
      \nHow to Survive One Shot Escape DLC brings a new game mode to the game itself\
      \ which can be played solo or co-op. The new game mode offers heavy randomizations\
      \ so no two playthroughs are ever the same, it will offer a new height of challenges\
      \ to complete. \n\nThe perfect test to see how good your survival skills are,\
      \ replaying this new mode solo or with a buddy will be something you will enjoy\
      \ to test not only your skills but the limit at which difficulty this can be\
      \ done.\n\nMGR Gaming\u2019s Conclusions:\n\nHow to Survive One Shot Escape\
      \ DLC has you tasked with getting Off this archipelago.\n You start this new\
      \ mode with your chosen character, in a random spot at a random time on one\
      \ island with nothing but the clothes on your back. \n\nYour goal is to scavenge\
      \ for resources and materials to keep yourself alive whilst finding parts for\
      \ the boat to make it to the next island. Making matters more fun; Resources\
      \ are much scarcer than you need them to be, enemies are tougher and hit harder,\
      \ and last but not least if you die it is game over, no checkpoint, no nothing.\n\
      \nDon\u2019t look so down, there is hope yet, you being here means you have\
      \ survived these islands already so you have some experience on what is required\
      \ to stay alive. It is doable and it is tons of fun and if my words aren\u2019\
      t comfort enough, invite a co-op buddy and go at it the buddy system way, two\
      \ heads are better than one\u2026\n\nAll in all, this new game mode offers a\
      \ new level of challenges and fun to any survival game fan, it is a brilliant\
      \ add on to an already brilliant game.\n\nScore 7\nBy: MGRza \nDate: 23 October\
      \ 2014\n\nAdditional info:\n\nPlatforms: PC: Xbox 360: PlayStation 3: Xbox One:\
      \ PlayStation 4: Wii U\nGenre: Survival: Indie: Zombies: Crafting\nCensor Rating:\
      \ mature\nAge Rating: N/A\nDeveloper: Eko Software\nPublisher: 505 Games \n\
