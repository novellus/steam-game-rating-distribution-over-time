I can't say that the A36 is the most polished, but I love the flight model and EFD1000.  The EFD is a bit quirky, especially its relationship with the primary 430,  but the amount of information shoved onto that little screen is great!  You can get DME from two VORs at once, ground speed, relative wind direction, outside temp, and list goes on.. .  This plane is a two thumbs up.  I would love to hear the specifics of why other reviewers have given this plane a negative review....","timestamp_created":1438778203,"timestamp_updated":1438778203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.669375717639923096","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t6P3/s4Cc6qvQg=="}
