      \ right order to get a gradient. By default, if you place a block correctly,\
      \ it will be automatically locked and you will hear the sound. You can disable\
      \ one or both of these features in the settings. You are also able to lock and\
      \ unlock blocks manually. It is possible to do that for multiple blocks by holding\
      \ down right mouse button. When you press \xABPlay\xBB button, a level is selected\
      \ randomly from those you haven't completed yet, but you are also free to choose\
      \ any level at any time. Pretty simple, right?"
