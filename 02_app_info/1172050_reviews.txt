Pausing the game will make you restart the level. Most of the game relies on being funny because penis. I only got it because it seemed like a silly concept with good gameplay, but the gameplay is mediocre at best. I really did think i would enjoy this but it felt difficult to continue, especially because the game is not rewarding at all.\nThis review is based mostly off of first impressions, but I honestly don't feel much of a reason to continue playing. If I ever do play this game again, which is kind of unlikely at this point, I may add to this review.\nThe only really good part so far is the soundtrack.\nETA: I decided to just refund the game. I feel like I'd get more enjoyment out of a bag of chips and a soda than I would from this game. I'm fairly upset, because I really did want to enjoy it, and I really wish it was good, but it just isn't.","timestamp_created":1609525263,"timestamp_updated":1609824321,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43rfA6PYCd8u8vwI="}
