    review: I like the art and I think that it has potential to be pretty good. I
      am unsure how to accomplish it but the mouse being the indicator of where you
      swing your sword isn't that good when you're constantly moving around. A different
      control scheme would certainly help. A little more content would be nice but
      for the price it was a pretty decent framework for a game. I would also recommend
      more sounds for when enemies are hit and different ways to attack. Great start
      for a game but definitely needs work.
