I did a let's play of this game last year and I was enormously impressed with the story line. aside from the bugs and kinks to work out (I found a few in my recordings, and the developer immediately addressed them) The game was pretty smooth. The battles get a little repetative as time goes on, but I belive that this only adds to the subtext. The repetition and the grinding out of menial tasks fit in perfectly with the story, and I thought it was an elegant solution to the limitations of the software used to develop the game(my roommate has the same software, great stuff, gets the job done) I wont include any spoilers, but HOLY SMOKES, THAT ENDING. As someone who has lived in the darkness of depression, every part of the storyline really connected with me. It took me to a dark place just playing the game, so I can only imagine how drained you felt after creating it! I can't wait for your next work and you have my full support! I finished this game in about two and a half hours. This game in my opinion is wonderful. It's not only a game but it's also a lesson for people battling depression or for those who know others with depression. My dad always tells me, \"The Sun Will Rise tomorrow.\" So this game really hit home on the name alone. You start off as a Captain who struggles to protect his town from bandits and through a rise of horrible events your character starts battling depression. Continuing the story you begin to wonder if life is even worth while if you are incapable to protect those you love. I won't spoil the game but overall I suggest anyone who wishes to play a rpg pixel game with a bit of real life advice, this is the game for you. It's much deeper than I thought it would be and it really hit home. Thank you to the Devs for reminding me that the sun will rise tomorrow :). You guys made my day. \n\nP.S: The combat is a little rough first off but as soon as you wear the cape, everything is MUCH easier. Just work though the first couple of battles. Anyone who has played rpg pixel games that were a little more on the unforgiving side shouldn't have any issues with it. I was surprised by the number of people complaining about the combat being too hard. Just play smart and you'll finish the game.","timestamp_created":1486692139,"timestamp_updated":1486692139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/7fwktoCduTdcQ=="}
