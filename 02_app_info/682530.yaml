      \ Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\nMy\
      \ main issue is that some levels can have some bugs which need a restart if\
      \ you want 100% success in the level.\nTesla Tower makes somehow no sense using\
      \ the teleport function. I had one enemy left on the map and the tesla tower\
      \ was the first tower in line. So the enemy was teleported away all the time.\
      \ Had to sell the building.\n\nYou will find fast a general shema to beat each\
      \ level. This is not really bad but somehow the challenge is missing.\nStill\
      \ good story (not really open end like others write). I see forward to see the\
      \ next part."
