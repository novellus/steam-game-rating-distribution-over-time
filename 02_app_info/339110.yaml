    reviews: "\u201CThe elements are simple to understand while you play, yet the\
      \ complicated ways they work together are difficult to explain in writing. That\u2019\

      \ to pick up quickly, but deep enough to allow for many puzzle possibilities.\
      \ [\u2026] the central mechanic is strong enough to keep things interesting.\
