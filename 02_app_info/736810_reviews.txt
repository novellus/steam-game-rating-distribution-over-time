If you're thinking about buying this game, let me tell you...throw it in your cart. It is AMAZING! \n\nShort version; amazing graphics even if you need to put it on low, puzzles not too difficult but makes you think, storyline thrilling and just keeps progressing, can be replayed over and over, some historical and Agatha Christie vibes all throughout and plays like most point and click games so easy to follow. \n\nLong version; It's been on my wishlist for forever, but for some reason it kept saying coming soon or something like that so I didn't buy it until recently on the winter sale. I LOVED IT! \nIt's like most point and click mystery games, basic controls with inventory and a notebook, gives a lot of Agatha Christie vibes; you literally start on the Orient Express and the Constable looks pretty darn close to Poriot so that's nice. \nPuzzles: Are they hard? Not really, sometimes a little frustrating but not impossible, a lot of walking back and forth at times, and sometimes the puzzles don't make a lot of sense so I write down a lot of things so I can do it right the first time. And if I missed anything, because you can miss stuff. Save a lot because there are some glitches but nothing that worried me.  \nStory: AMAZING. Like I said, Agatha Christie in a lot of ways, and just a good mystery. Keeps you guessing the entire time. And the little subplots are just nice to follow along. Characters are cool, especially as you learn more and more about them, and you will be surprised about some when you get to them.\n\nOnly downsides were it can be a bit glitchy; sometimes a little loop of a person doing something, or a cutscene freezing but people keep talking. I never had anything that was too bad, saved a bunch so that way if I had to go back to a save file I don't have to repeat too much. It's a bit laggy on my computer but I did the remastered first, so I might try the old version to see if that helps. I just did low graphics and about half way did it in windowed mode; worked great and the graphics still beautiful. I don't really care for their hot spots; they disappear kinda of quick and so I can easily spend 50 points just making sure I clicked on everything. Their hints are good, found them out late in the game-check your journal-but cost points.\n\nI don't really know what else to say. I HIGHLY recommend. I believe I got it on sale but it's worth it, and you get both the original and remastered, but I think the only difference is graphics so play whichever one. I hope this review helped anybody interested. Happy playing! :D \n","timestamp_created":1610147788,"timestamp_updated":1610147788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzq6S8vYCeu7UwQI="}
