The dialogue is tremendously ignorant and super cheesy! It does control well and my toddler granddaughter likes ducks, so I'll keep it for her. I really want to refund it, but she quack quacks at the duck and loves it. NOT recommended, unless you're a toddler or like ducks lol.","timestamp_created":1594434701,"timestamp_updated":1594434701,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558737039566040039","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47NjtnfMCdYi7lAI="}
