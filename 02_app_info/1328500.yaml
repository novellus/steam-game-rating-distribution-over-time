    about_the_game: '<i><strong>The Adventures of Crackhead Jack: Overdose Edition</strong></i>
      finds you controlling the titular character on a journey to reclaim a bag of
      coke. On such a journey, you might meet strange characters, and possibly do
      excessive amounts of other drugs to defeat anyone who stands in your way. Look
      no further, because this is the definitive version.<h2 class="bb_tag">Paid The
      Cost To Be The Boss</h2>Jack is no chosen one. There is no world to save. Only
      things we crave. His eccentric actions might inevitably cement him as a saviour.
      Invade and investigate into the depths of the black market. Make chump change
      in the form of the region''s &quot;sheks&quot; off bums on the street. Fetch
      sketchy items for plenty of weird people. Witness Jack fail to reason with the
      evil of the real world.<h2 class="bb_tag">Really Basic Turn Based Combat</h2>Everyone''s
      agreed to take turns when you fight. Enemies walk around in red coats, waiting
      for their chance to strike. There are dozens of &quot;unique&quot; enemies with
      stupid names and childish graphics. Skills are of course special attacks that
      may have exclusive effects and statuses. Equip protection kits and grab your
      favourite weapon from the nearest Equips shop to give you attack boosts and
      basic side effects in battle.<h2 class="bb_tag">Consumables Galore...</h2>There
      are plenty of vendors just minutes away from you who aren''t afraid to give
      you a good deal on exquisite product. Consume to your heart''s content. You
      might experience some otherworldly visions.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Luxury of
      Time</h2>Overdose Edition includes all-new side quests and story adjustments
      that shamelessly extend the game''s playtime. Who am I kidding? You can skip
      it if you really wanted.<h2 class="bb_tag">Trying To Be Funny</h2>Speaking of
      comedy experience, the world tries to convince you that it''s got what it takes
      to get a laugh out of you. The game specializes in trying to capitalize on any
      stupid moment to try and be funny, and it''s up to the player whether or not
      to decide it actually is.'
