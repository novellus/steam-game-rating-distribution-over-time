It isnt a full soundtrack, its more of a mini soundtrack. Amazing still, but not what the title suggests. Though if you look at the about this content section of the dlc it does say its an ost bonus. So all in all, I like this, feels like a little bonus for people who got the game early. Why am I posting this review months after the game is released and the ost is unavailable to people as it was a limited thing? I have no idea tbh, I just kinda wanted to type you know.","timestamp_created":1460693823,"timestamp_updated":1460693823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44d2IjNQCffvDVQ=="}
