    review: If your looking for a steam engine that gives you a challenge then this
      seems perfect for you as it is quite the challenge. If your looking for a new
      and tough challenge then the Britannia is quite possibly your best bet. I will
      tell you a little story of how I came to buy this engine. First of all I had
      Just Trains' BR 6MT Clan Class my first engine I got from Just Trains as I had
      had standard steam locomotives with easy to get round controls. I should state
      I drove with automatic fireman on as I was more concerned with the driving aspect
      rather than the stoking and watering part of driving a steam locomotive. When
      I had the Clan Class out for the first time I struggled and started losing pressure
      once I got a few miles out of Dumfries on the WLOS. I eventually came to a stop
      and I struggled for days on end trying to figure it out. I then saw how to do
      it properly and I had to do the firing myself which was a new challenge and
      in doing so I fell in love with that engine. When I heard another Just Trains
      steam locomotive came out and it was the Britannia I was excited for it and
      I put it in my basket and started driving. With my experience from the Clan
      Class I thought I knew what I was doing but no it was a different challenge
      and I loved it. My firing of the engine was fine. my issue was injecting water
      into the boiler. I struggled for days trying to inject water into the boiler.
      I thought I wasn't using the right controls at first, but as it was of very
      similar design to the Clan Class I knew that wasn't what was wrong. The valves
      you need to inject water into the boiler I found needed to be put into a certain
      position to work and this changes when your picking up or losing speed, once
      I got round that I was running my Britannia like a dream and has quite quickly
      become one of my favourite along with the Clan Class. I can put on 13 coaches
      and I feel I can do everything and anything with it, pulled heavy freight work
      you'd expect with the 9F and it handled it pretty good may not be going at express
      speed but it does the job surprisingly well. I usually play on steam engine
      routes like the WLOS or Riviera Line in the 50's etc. So the Britannia's weathering
      comes in handy if you want to simulate those times. If your a steam locomotive
      fan, especially BR Standards then this one I would seriously consider for your
      collection.
