It had potential, I can see what they wanted to do but it falls much too short to be worth buying. \n\nPros: \n- If you really like history and can tolerate monotone narrators then you may have some enjoyment.\n\nCons: \n- Mind numbing, monotone narrator…\n- Environment rendering is so low rez, you can’t really see much. It’s just a badly done CG rendering onto a sphere. \n- The small number of interactable items are so useless and not engaging at all.\n- There isn’t even a tower beneath you, you’re just floating on this platform that appears miles above the ground.\n","timestamp_created":1528710143,"timestamp_updated":1528710143,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.460526347160339355","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wbOO9+MCfIrZogE="}
