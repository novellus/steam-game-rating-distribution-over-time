    review: 'There is not really enough here to form any kind of recommendation, positive
      or negative. Anyone buying should be well aware of what it is, and that what
      they are actually doing is supporting the developer in the (probably vain, given
      the months of no updates) hope for continued development.


      Start with the positives: this general type of thing is something I''m always
      glad to see (and surprised at the lack of) in VR. Abstract ''adventure game''
      experiences piling on interactive vignettes with more regard to conveying tone
      and mood than any actual narrative. Some particular little bits were cool, and
      I''d like to see more of them - I''d like to see more in general.


      Negatives: lack of clarity in what is happening. I understand 100% that is ''the
      point'', but eg. unlabelled generic buttons with unclear effects, random props
      of no apparent purpose in otherwise relatively spartan scenes. There were multiple
      later scenes which I ''solved'' by some total mystery, with the seemingly-intuitive
      interactions not actually working.


      There is not really enough here to form any kind of recommendation, positive
      or negative, and so I will default to ''positive'' . Anyone buying should be
      well aware of what it is, and that what they are actually doing is supporting
      the developer.


      Constructive criticism for the developer: disable locomotion altogether if adequate
      space is detected, to prevent the player messing up the alignment, and give
      some constant subtle indication of the play area bounds in the virtual space.
      Drop the weird proprietary chaperone (unless there was some point to it I missed).'
