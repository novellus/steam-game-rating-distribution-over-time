If this game was released in the glory days of 16-bit gaming, this soundtrack would be as much of a beloved classic as FSSX would be.","timestamp_created":1577656503,"timestamp_updated":1577656503,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rfnpqe8Cc7+Y6AE="}
