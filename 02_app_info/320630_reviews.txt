This is not a match 3 game. This is a click to remove puzzle game, it's so simple it could easily be on mobile but it doesn't appear it was made for mobile. This feels like one of those games that came on a CD you picked up from the discount bins at Big Lots or Walmart because it was only a few bucks and \"500 Amazing Games!\" written on the cover. It's okay for what it is I guess but don't be fooled into getting it thinking it's a match 3.","timestamp_created":1605057444,"timestamp_updated":1605057444,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwip+42vUCfbnUrQI="}
