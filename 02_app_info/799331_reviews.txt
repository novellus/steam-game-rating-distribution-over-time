Instrumentals and choruses do an oustanding job at delivering the ancient battle ire energy or giving the mood of anxious \"calm before the storm\" suspense. \n\n   The music is prosaic, which is a definite plus given the game's context. It does not try to portray epic battles with neck breaking acrobatics and war elephants. Instead, it creates a musical embodiment of ruthless competition between forceful men, which turn the paradox of \"an unstoppable force meets an immovable object\" into  \"an unstoppable force meets an unstoppable force head-on \". This \"paradox\", however, has an answer. And it's not pretty. \n   \n   If you are searching for a dose of brutal masculinity without fantasy makeup, you've found the right product.","timestamp_created":1527356955,"timestamp_updated":1606154593,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.699719727039337158","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rsSR+/UCeOanoQE="}
