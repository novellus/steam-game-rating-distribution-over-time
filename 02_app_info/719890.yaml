      /><br><br>Beasts of Bermuda is a multiplayer game hosting large servers in which
      the player is a dinosaur or other prehistoric creature. A player can take the
      role of flyers, swimmers, herbivores, carnivores, and semi-aquatic creatures
      that fulfill different niches in the ecosystem. No matter what the player chooses
      to be, the objective of the game is to survive and grow up on the islands of
      Bermuda by using their particular creature's abilities. Predation from other
      players as well as intense environmental events are the antagonistic forces
      in the game the player must survive against.<br><br>There are currently three
      game modes in Beasts of Bermuda.  <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/719890/extras/Storebanners_Discover_S.png?t=1600495292"
      /><br><br>The first is our Life Cycle mode of gameplay.  The player selects
      a creature of choice and spawns into the world as a juvenile of that species.  They
      must survive and gradually grow larger over time.  As growth accumulates, they
      also earn talents, which can be spent to enhance different aspects of your creature's
      capabilities.  <br><br>The second is Free Roam, which allows the player to instantly
      spawn as an adult with a fixed number of talent points.  Death has little consequence,
      as there are no growth mechanics, or other mechanics that reward the player
      for staying alive.<br><br>The third game mode is Combat.  This mode pits players
      against one another with small maps, close spawns, and mechanics designed to
      reward conflict.  The player can accrue more talent points by killing other
      players and stealing their points.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/719890/extras/Storebanners_Survive_S.png?t=1600495292"
