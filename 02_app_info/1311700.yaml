      \ stories such as the struggle of King's court, resistance to foreign enemies\
      \ and expansion of territory in the Western Han Dynasty (during the reign of\
      \ Emperor Hanwu). In the game, you can control famous military generals such\
      \ as Huo Qubing, Wei Qing and Li Guang to gallop across the battlefield and\
      \ expel Xiongnu. The vicissitudes of life make us show our heroism. Let's go\

      \ At the same time, you can also get resources and props in the level. The difficulty\
      \ of the game will gradually increase with the level. Currently, there are 30\
      \ levels on-line, and there will be another 20 new levels in the way of DLC\

      \ strategy to win. The play method design of each level is different, including\
      \ land, sea, night, surprise / ambush, We have to say that we have spent a lot\

      \ The culture of the two Han Dynasties is splendid, and there are many talents.\
      \ Why didn't we introduce the game of historical themes of the Western Han Dynasty?\
      \ So we chose the theme of Hanwu emperor, who is the representative of the Western\
      \ Han Dynasty, for production. The team pursues simple and pure play experience\
      \ in design concept. At present, there are five small partners in full-time\
      \ development of Emperor Hanwu biography, which has been produced for one year.\
      \ Of course, there are still shortcomings in the game. If there are some places\
