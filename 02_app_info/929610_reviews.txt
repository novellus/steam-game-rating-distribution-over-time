Also bought their other game, which was a mess. You see the stuff in the trailer? That happens sometimes. See the reloading? There's no reason to move your hand like that, it just reloads like a pump shotgun. You get 11 rounds and there are no other apparent weapons, but some upgrades, and two missiles which I never found ammo for anyway. All the enemies are the same except some have a shield and some have an axe. There seem to be some hazards as well, but they are trivial. The armswinging is done poorly and there is no option to change the direction of movement (I would rather move where I'm looking that in a controller direction, since I can't shoot backwards). \n\nThis game is a scam at this price. At $2 it was a scam too. At least I can be the one review for it so no one will buy it. Please don't buy things from this developer until they stop releasing shovelware and actually try.","timestamp_created":1595978309,"timestamp_updated":1595978309,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541641712188720703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42Ivuy/MCftGSmAI="}
