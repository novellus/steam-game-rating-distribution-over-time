    about_the_game: "Introduced to handle commuter traffic right up until the turn\
      \ of the century, and beyond, the \xD6BB 4020 reigned supreme throughout Austria\u2019\
      s key passenger routes \u2013 from the bustling cities to the rural mountain\
      \ passes. Experience life in the cab of this classic unit as the \xD6BB 4020\
      \ is ready for Train Simulator service!<br><br>By the 1970s, the \xD6BB 4030\
      \ fleet was in its second decade of service, and with only limited units available,\
      \ was struggling to cope with the ever-increasing demand that is the Austrian\
      \ commuter network. A new electric multiple unit was required to take the strain,\
      \ a unit capable of providing a suitable level of comfort \u2013 and faster\
      \ journey times \u2013 for the many passengers that would be travelling on them.<br><br>The\
      \ new units were classified as the \xD6BB 4020 and began construction in the\
      \ mid-1970s; Simmering-Graz-Pauker, BES, ELIN, Siemens and Brown, Boveri &amp;\
      \ Cie were all responsible for the building of the new units. Austrian Federal\
      \ Railways began delivery of their 120 new \xD6BB 4020 EMUs by 1978, and quickly\
      \ pressed them into service on 4 major lines throughout the country; the Vienna\
      \ S-Bahn, the Lower Inn Valley Railway, the Semmeringbahn and the Mittenwaldbahn.<br><br>The\
      \ \xD6BB 4020 fleet represented the latest standard for Austria\u2019s railways,\
      \ improving on previous units in many ways. A top speed of 120 km/h was a welcome\
      \ introduction, as were the stronger brakes which allowed for faster journey\
      \ times \u2013 even on the steeper routes. The spacious interior could comfortably\
      \ sit 184 passengers plus stand even more, and this was easily doubled by coupling\
      \ units together on peak-hour services.<br><br>Austrian Federal Railways took\
      \ in their final \xD6BB 4020 in 1987, by which point some of the previous \xD6\
      BB 4030\u2019s had already been withdrawn. The reliable build of the 4020s secured\
      \ their spot as prominent traction for the latter quarter of the 20th Century,\
      \ and even when the brand new \xD6BB 4023 &amp; 4024 EMUs arrived on scene,\
      \ the 4020s continued to operate on routes such as the Semmeringbahn, and riding\
      \ on them across the mountains is still possible to this day.<br><br>The \xD6\
      BB 4020 for Train Simulator includes the 3-car EMU in both \xD6BB\u2019s classic\
      \ blue &amp; white, and the modern red &amp; grey liveries with old and new\
