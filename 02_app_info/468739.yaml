    review: 'This is the best automated board game I''ve found in TTS, even though
      it looks and plays simple it''s a more advanced version of go fish and it feels
      really charming and intuitive.


      The rules are only 4 pages long, so it''s really quick to learn, and during
      gameplay you can automate a lot of draw/replenish/hidden/blindfolding mechanics
      by clicking buttons (scrolls in the game) to mediate the responsibility of the
      dealer.


      Instead of picking cards/tomes out of your own hand you have to guess what tomes
      you have based on what you can visibly see, everyone else''s hands, and what
      you cannot see, your own hand. If you guess wrong, you lose a life. But if you
      guess right, you either gain a life or someone else loses a life. The trick
      is, you can never ever see your own hand. The round goes on until one player
      has died or your hand is empty. There''s also 4/36 cards always faced down,
      and that''s never revealed unless you chance it and guess/cast a 2/36 spell
      to reveal them only to your own hand.


      I play tested this with my friend Goury and can imagine having more fun with
      more people.


      Although this game doesn''t use cards, the same principles applies to gameplay
      and holding tomes is part of the charm of guessing wrongly and calling BS to
      statistics.


      Caveats:


      The automatic deal button doesn''t seem to account for rotation of tomes which
      leaves it clearly visible if the player''s camera is orientated the right way.
      If everytime you get dealt cards you can see your own hand, it defeats the core
      gameplay mechanic. Host should find and download a blindfold mod and blindfold
      the player manually, then deal a person their hand.


      Caveat Fix: I edited the original lua script to add the blindfold automatically
      to trigger for whoever clicks it for 2 seconds when you deal your own hands
      to avoid seeing the tome slippage. New Round triggers a 5 second blindfold that
      will prevent all players from seeing their own hands from tome slippage. Go
      in game save a copy of Abraca... What?! into your save game then go to Modding
      => Scripting => Global => Lua => Global and paste [url=https://pastebin.com/xL3Vfp53]This
      pastebin link[/url] and after overwriting original script. Load that save to
      play the fixed version.'
