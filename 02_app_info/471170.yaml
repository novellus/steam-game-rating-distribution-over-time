    review: 'First impression: small casual time management game

      This is not a city builder!


      I''ve seen 8 of 24 levels. This game has workers that you need to assign to
      tasks that then take time to complete; and there''s a reward for finishing on
      time. Gameplay is using these workers to build houses that generate income and
      infrastructure that adds bonuses to this income, wasting as little time as possible
      while following an efficient building strategy. The staple of time management
      games, clearing obstacles for resources, is also present, but mostly you can
      simply buy resources from your income.


      Romopolis differs from typical city builders in several ways:

      a) small maps (5x5 max.)

      b) no running expenses, the city is always profitable

      c) population figures don''t depend on how well the city does; if you build
      a house, it''s populated, and its income depends only on the bonuses applying
      to that house

      d) no street building, no utility lines, no traffic


      I believe this is a nice change from typical time management game in that it
      has less micromangement: you don''t need to send workers to clear roads, you
      don''t need to send workers to repeatedly harvest stuff, you can focus on managing
      the buildings to achieve your goals, which means the levels are less cumbersome
      and faster to complete.


      If you''re looking for a casual city builder, you''re going to be disappointed;
      and that''s the reason for most negative user reviews.

      But if you like to play casual time management games, and are looking for something
      different, you could give this a try! The developer has also published two similar
      games, [i]Townopolis[/i] and [i]Megapolis[/i], so there''s more material if
      you find this game too short.


      Recommended as a casual time management game. Not recommended as a city builder.'
