Should you choose the latter, you will rebuild a failing school of gladiators to forge your path to glory. You begin with managing a school on the edge of bankruptcy and slowly expand it by adding and upgrading buildings. Providing the best staff and facilities for gladiators fighting in your name will quickly pay off. To succeed in arenas you need to prepare suitable equipment and teach your gladiators skills that allow them to survive. Test your might on less prestigious arenas before you take on the mightiest warriors of the known world in the Roman Colosseum. Further in the game you will be facing diverse challenges. Your best gladiators might die or retire as you pursue significant goals, such as earning the patronage of the local governor. You might also be forced to relocate your school to avoid local conspiracies and seek fame in more wealthy regions.<br><br>If you remember that fortune favors the bold we will soon meet among the Roman elite.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1318190\/extras\/Gladiator_Label_Steam__Manage.png?t=1606893691\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1318190\/extras\/gladiator_szkoa.gif?t=1606893691\" \/><br>Expand your ludus (gladiator school) to unlock new weapons and training options for your future champions.
