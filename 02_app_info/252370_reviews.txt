I could've easily bought this game, finished it, maybe even completed all achievements and refunded it. Short games are not bad on it's face but there clearly is more to this story that could be explored. This is what I woudl've expected from a demo of a full fledged Shivah game. It still has some nice puzzles but ultimately I am disappointed. I instead recommend Blackwell games or charnel house trilogy or Kathy rain. It's just sadly a disappointment for me.","timestamp_created":1609787476,"timestamp_updated":1609787649,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vsW05/YCca29wAI="}
