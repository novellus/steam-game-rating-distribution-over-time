However, the English version of the game (can't say anything about the other languages) is rather badly written and often hard to grasp and understand, having you read through the text multiple times, and even then sometimes doubting yourself, if you understood what the writer meant. I do hope the developer of the game would hire someone who has a good grasp of the English language to translate the game, as this was the defining factor for me in not recommending this game as opposed to recommending it, especially since this is a visual novel.\n\nRegarding the mechanics, I find myself wishing for a skip option for when I've already read a portion of the text and would like to see what happens after making a different decision. Right now, it's quite a chore going through the same dialogue every time, especially so with the unskippable cutscenes. \n\nI haven't gotten far into the game yet, but these are my thoughts so far.","timestamp_created":1604597284,"timestamp_updated":1604597284,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529182910919189453","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1604912422,"developer_response":"The English text is fixed now.\n\nSkip option will be available if you play the game on version 0.0.11 or higher at least once.\nYou can skip long scenes, such as the beginning of an episode and the Mozart's part"}],"cursor":"AoJwyu/czPUCdrrArAI="}
