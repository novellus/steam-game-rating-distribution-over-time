    about_the_game: 'Forking Hell (do you like the pun?) is a 3D casual arcade-simulation
      game where the player guides a forklift vehicle around a virtual warehouse and
      completes customer orders over the working days. <br><br><strong><u>Welcome
      to your new job</u></strong><br>You work in the Amazing Logistics warehouse,
      the robot powered e-commerce service of the future. Start by learning to drive
      a personalised forklift to get your driving licence. You will then begin your
      job as a forklift driver, collecting packages and delivering them to the truck
      through the working day. Be careful, the RUMBA-BOTS will zoom around the warehouse
      stocking up shelves and crashing into you, and could cause you to damage or
      break customer packages! You will work in different sections of the Amazing
      warehouse through multiple levels of gameplay, retrieving all sorts of products
      including office supplies, home furniture and decorations. Some items can easily
      be explode and be lost forever, while some items can just fall out of their
      crate. The game includes physics elements to add a challenge to the levels,
      and add to the simulation experience!<br><br><strong><u>Additional gamemodes
      and experiences</u></strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Racing minigame: Race
      against the RUMBA-BOTS and ensure they cannot beat your powerful and speedy
      forklift throughout different warehouse courses!<br></li><li>Live internet radios:
      Listen to your favourite internet stations live during the game to help get
      some fresh music live while progressing through your forklift career, including
      Bounce, Hive365, Simulator Hits, Simulator Radio and Truck Stop Radio.<br></li><li>Oculus
      VR coming soon: We are developing an Oculus VR experience where players can
      literally sit in the driver''s seat and become immersed in the experience!<br></li><li>Twitch
      streaming minigame: We have implemented a cool minigame where streamers can
      play the game with their viewers and get them to influence gameplay by collecting
      the boxes with an easy setup!<br><br><br><strong><u>Single player experience</u></strong><br>Forking
      Hell is a wonderful little game to play solo as a way to escape reality and
      just chill out. The chaos of the RUMBA-BOTS combined with the semi-realistic
      physics helps give an arcade style to the simulation genre. The game is built
      with controller or keyboard/mouse input to support various play-styles and preferences.<br><br><br><strong><u>Based
      on a university prototype</u></strong><br>This product was originally planned
      and built as part of a university class by Louis Byers in 2020.</li></ul>'
