      \ lot of puzzle fans \u2013 it\u2019s just important they know what they\u2019\
      re getting into. It\u2019s more of a slow burn than other match-3 games, requiring\
      \ cold, calculated actions on behalf of the player. That threw me off at first,\
      \ but \u2013 flawed though it is \u2013 I found myself having a lot of fun with\
      \ it.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamezebo.com/2012/07/18/paint-universe-review/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gamezebo</a><br><br>\u201CThere seems\
      \ to be a movement in the indie scene towards these very peaceful, gentle, Zen-like\
      \ puzzle games. It\u2019s like developers are deconstructing what a game is,\
      \ reinventing what has traditionally been a very challenge-driven, competitive,\
      \ high-pressure medium. Within that context, But to Paint a Universe succeeds\
      \ admirably, and casual gamers could certainly do worse than pick it up\u201D\
