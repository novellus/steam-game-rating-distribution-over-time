It's really out there. First of all, it's dealing with immigration and the stories of immigrants from Afghanistan on their journey to Sweden. Secondly, it features rap from Emilia Carapic aka Bac Nini (you can find her stuff here): https://youtu.be/ffYnctd01jY  Lastly, it has some of the weirdest visuals I have seen in VR and even though it says English language is not supported on the Steam store page, it is, in fact, supported.\n\nUnfortunately, the visuals while experimental, are still pretty bad. I mean I don't mind experimental stuff and seeing trippy stuff. I consider myself a very open-minded individual who is open to new experiences. However, these visuals are so bad that they detract from the immigrant stories. It's not just the poor visuals, there's just some odd design choices like a giant chocolate bunny statue just standing in the middle of the Afghanistan environment. There's also just some poor textures, along with poor placement of objects (some are just hovering in in the air and others are like clipped off or run into other objects). The interactions are also rather poor. You can only teleport in some select scenes. There is no smooth or snap turning. You're supposed to grab some items and then put them in a backpack to start the specified mostly cinematic experience. \n\nSo there are many different immigrant stories here through each of those objects you collect & put in your backpack. Unfortunately, you really have to be interested in the subject matter to be able to look past the poor visuals and bad interactions. Getting to the stories is a lot more difficult than it should be. Honestly, the best thing about this game / app is the rapping from Emilia Carapic (Bac Nini).\n\nThis is a pass for everyone but those strongly interested in the subject matter. Although, IMO, they would have been better off just filming the telling of these immigrant stories on YouTube. Unfortunately, experimental in this case just meant they weren't very experienced in making a good VR experience. Still, it was amazing they got 80 people to show up for the Night of Culture in Lund ... the free punch and pie must have been part of the advertisement.\n\n[b]Rate 5/10. I got this on sale for .89 cents, it really is free to play quality though. The stories may be compelling though ... if you're strongly interested in the subject matter and willing to look past all the game's faults.[/b]","timestamp_created":1578722296,"timestamp_updated":1578723135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44enOye8CcLmd6wE="}
