That doesn't happen, at least not \n  for the first 3 races, which was enough to turn me off from continuing playing.\n- Background visuals are a bit cheesy but I can't complain for a 6$ game\n- No purpose other than collecting coins and getting to the finish, \"racing\" is a very loose way to describe this. At least \n   needs AI to race against.\n \nVideo of gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjZx09aBqqc\n\nOverall I wouldn't keep playing unless there were AI vehicles in each race. \n\nFor $6 it's whatever but don't expect to keep playing it for a long time!\n","timestamp_created":1571078220,"timestamp_updated":1571078220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597315430641174316","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjuXj5e0Ccf6O1AE="}
