    review: '[i]Edit: Online leaderboards have been added since I wrote this review,
      so that''s one problem fixed. There are still several other changes that would
      need to be made before I would recommend this game to anybody.[/i]



      Good sound and music, but that''s pretty much the only aspect I liked about
      Necromonads. A list of things I didn''t like:


      - Scanlines cannot be removed. The screen curvature [i]can[/i] be removed, but
      only by darkening the overall image, which makes it look even worse.


      - No d-pad support on dual-analogue gamepads. Also, the game does not have "Full
      controller support" as it claims. You can pause the game using the start button,
      but the only way to unpause it is using the keyboard.


      - The game is locked at 60 FPS, which is fine, but there are frame-pacing issues
      that cause stutter when flying across the map. How much this bothers you will
      depend on how sensitive you are to stuttering (a fair amount, in my case).


      All those problems could be overlooked, but Necromonad''s biggest problem is
      that it is way, way too easy. Compared to [url=https://youtu.be/GdUlS_cSMoE?t=39]Defender[/url],
      this game is baby food. The enemies are never any threat to you, unless you
      accidentally collide with them. There''s only one enemy that even fires bullets
      at your ship, but those bullets move so slowly you can literally fly circles
      around them.


      There is no challenge whatsoever until at least level 15. And even after that,
      it becomes more tedious rather than difficult. You''ll need to tap the fire
      button more and the stages will take longer to complete, but there is still
      no danger of actually losing.


      I reached level 20 on my first playthrough (which took about 40 minutes). By
      that point I had gathered 7 extra lives (up from 3 at the start), received a
      perfect score (no captures or infections) in all but one stage, and was so bored
      I ended up killing myself 8 times.'
