    about_the_game: All the publicly released build from before Station Generator
      even became a thing! These go back as far as my original project Quantum Wing
      which has since been put on hiatus to complete Station Generator. <br><br>Early
      builds are just that, early builds. The package contains the 3 Betas and 5 Alphas
      (With one hot fix) exactly as they were released within the early access program.
      <br><br>What to expect:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Bad graphics<br></li><li>
      Lack of sound effects<br></li><li> Terrible UI choices<br></li><li> A look at

      sound improve over time</li></ul><br>This is a history of Station Generator's
      development, and it wasn't a perfect, or smooth road to get here!<br><br>Once
      downloaded the DLC will be located in the game's main folder in a folder labeled
      DLC. This can be found by right clicking the Station Generator, selecting 'Properties',
