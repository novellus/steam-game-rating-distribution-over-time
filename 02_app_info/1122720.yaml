    review: 'Ahhhh, what a beautiful game. It''s so stylish and wonderful to look
      at, and all the levels are clever and creative. It''s deceptively simple - you
      move, and occasionally hit one button - but getting a good score in each stage
      is truly difficult. But you don''t *need* to get a good score to have a good
      time, and if you have a lot of difficulty in any segment, the game gives you
      an option to skip it.


      The story is pretty sparse and really just a long metaphor about pulling yourself
      together after your world falls apart, but this works in the game''s favor,
      in my option. It''s all about emotion and style, which grants it more substance
      than most games with drawn out, detail heavy narratives. I teared up at the
      end.


      And oh goodness, that music. SO good, and it accentuates every part of the gameplay
      and story. It''s all just so seamless.


      Really, the only two issues with the game are the very short length (though
      I can''t really imagine it being much longer and still having the same impact,
      plus you can always go back and try to get higher scores), and the difficulty
      and weirdness of the achievements (this is a nitpick since Steam achievements
      are mostly meaningless, but I do like getting as many as I can and after playing
      through the whole game, I only got one, lol).


      Even so, I highly recommend this, even at full price!'
