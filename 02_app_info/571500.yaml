    review: "I really like the idea of having a DSLR simulator especially in VR. \n\
      \nAt the current price, especially with the 33% sale, this is worth enough purchase\
      \ if you want to tinker and test out photography a bit. If you have experience\
      \ with dabbling with manual mode, this is also worth picking up since it's quite\
      \ curious to see how this game emulates the settings and see how this develop\
      \ and as well give feedback on how this game differs in real life so the dev\
      \ can improve this. \n\nI could see this being very useful to be as a teaching\
      \ aid to encourage beginners to dabble with manual/shutter priority/aperture\
      \ mode to expand their flexibility on taking shots.\n\nWhat you get for now\
      \ (I'll constantly update this part as the game progresses):\n- 1 world/scene\n\
      - Around a dozen of objects in the scene\n- Dusk time only\n- 1 Camera with\
      \ the following features:\n    * Aperture control from f/1.4 to f/22\n    *\
      \ Shutter controls from 1/125 to 1\n    * Screen emulates final photo you will\
      \ capture (motion due to shutter will be emulated)\n    * Lens focal length\
      \ from 6mm-150mm\n    * Aperture/Shutter/Manual modes\n- Only 1000x700 photo\
      \ capture resolution\n\nCurrent issues I see:\n- Ugly bokeh on larger apertures\n\
      - 1s exposure emulation is broken\n- Ground elevation not smooth so you get\
      \ those weird sensation that the floor changes.\n- Distortion on wide lens feels\
      \ wrong"
