    review: I LOVE fractals! Really wanted this to be awesome, but it is not. I dive
      in and get lost in a good fractal on my VR often, but have yet to find a better
      option than youtube on my virtual desktop, with the screen stretched as big
      as I can see. This "game" is just a small collection of still shots, a couple
      animated fractals, and a odd view of the mandelbrot set that dose not zoom in
      or do this piece of mathematical art justice at all. I would not buy this even
      if the fractals are updated regularly, it just lacks the trippiness I'm looking
      for.
