    review: "Taking on the role of a young, female pirate captain in this text-only\
      \ interactive novel sees the player leading the way in a multi-threaded adventure\
      \ set in and around the Caribbean during the latter stages of the Golden Age\
      \ Of Piracy.\n\nI admit that pirates of the high seas is something of a personal\
      \ weakness, so when this game appeared in the listings of \u201CPlayers Like\
      \ You Love\u201D on the Steam store page, I was immediately intrigued.. and\
      \ yet, having looked into it and discovered that it was a story in exclusively\
      \ text; I still wavered and needed some encouragement from the lovely people\
      \ in the Otome Lovers' discord (you know who you are ladies, thank you) before\
      \ making a purchase.\n\nThe game display defaults to a rather harsh black typeface\
      \ on a white background, and thankfully has a menu including an option to change\
      \ it to a much more comfortable white on black.  You can also adjust the text\
      \ size as many times as needs be until you are happy with it.  This was a good\
      \ start.  From here on in, the story begins and it is quickly clear that you\
      \ have a great deal of say in the personality of the lead character, and that\
      \ the choices you make are going to significantly impact how the adventure develops.\n\
      \nText blocks are never a full screen, so you are not faced with too much information\
      \ all at once.  Many pages end with a choice to be made, which is usually from\
      \ 3 or 4 possible options.  The base text is written in second character, as\
      \ in \u201CYou returned to the deck\u201D, while choices switch to first person\
      \ mode, eg. \u201CI knocked back the rum and called for more\u201D.  I would\
      \ have expected the differential between these styles to be distracting, and\
      \ yet it works remarkably well, giving a feeling of having the activity relayed\
      \ to you, and then being thrust into it personally to decide what must happen\
      \ next.\n\nThere is a statistics page to view where you discover just how many\
      \ personality traits your choices affect \u2013 will you be adored or feared\
      \ by your crew?  Are you brutal and unforgiving or a soft-hearted scoundrel?\
      \  Brazen or shy?  A loner or party animal?  Romantically inclined?  And what\
      \ about your protege?  How will you shape her future?  Even your name and appearance\
      \ are optional, but accessed in such a way that they are chosen as part of the\
      \ natural flow of developments.\n\nAnd those are just your characteristics.\
      \  Delving further into the delights in store, you will engage in high seas\
      \ piracy, competition or co-operation with other pirates, potential mutiny,\
      \ treasure, betrayal, love, governance.. and more.  There are 10 deeply involved\
      \ and very well written chapters to work through before you reach the end of\
      \ your tale; and with 44 achievements on offer, replay value is high.  I found\
      \ it impossible to stick with my original intentions for my character, as the\
      \ actions of others and consequences of my own constantly changed my perspective\
      \ on what I wanted to do next.\n\nThere are three main love interest possibilities,\
      \ at time of writing I have seen two and they are both adorable in their own\
      \ [i]very different[/i] ways.  The narration is certainly romance heavy when\
      \ you want it to be, although there is an absence of any spiciness in the \u201C\
      alone together\u201D scenes.  It is not obligatory to pursue a love interest,\
      \ you can also play the \u201Cnot interested\u201D card if you prefer to remain\
      \ romantically unattached.\n\nThe game will require some dedication on your\
      \ part to read it through, and will reward you accordingly.  My first play \u2013\
      \ which I messed up with a bad decision at the end and denied myself the true\
      \ love ending I was hoping for \u2013 lasted for 14 hours and I loved every\
      \ minute.\n\nThe game autosaves at each page, and can only be closed via the\
      \ X in the top corner of the screen. When returning, it will reopen where you\
      \ left off.  This is done in lieu of any kind of manual save, which means that\
      \ any decision you make is final for that play through.  There is no making\
      \ a decision, seeing how it pans out, and then reloading to try something else.\
      \  This should not be a problem [b]at all[/b] during your initial experience,\
      \ but is quite likely to be a bit of a bane in subsequent reads or especially\
      \ if you are simply going achievement hunting.\n\nI want to come back to an\
      \ admission I made near the start of this review.  I almost did not buy the\
      \ game when I discovered that it was text-only.  After all, if all one wants\
      \ is to read a good story, then buy a book, right? Well, that would certainly\
      \ sate the desire.  But would a book also offer you the chance to shape the\
      \ protagonist in a myriad of different ways, and then allow you to go back and\
      \ do it again, but differently?  Would the story change each time you read through\
      \ \u2013 indeed, would you even bother reading a second time?  The interactivity\
      \ in this offering is what makes a thoroughly enjoyable read shine.  So many\
      \ fans of visual novels insist that it is the story itself which is the most\
      \ important aspect, and yet as I construct this review, I note that there are\
      \ only 3 others already published for a game that has been released for 6 months.\
      \  Something does not add up, and it is not the quality provided.  If you truly\
      \ believe that the story is the most important thing, and you are not averse\
      \ to 17th century pirate adventures, then I strongly suggest that you put your\
      \ money where your convictions lie, and show this game some love.\n\n[quote]\
