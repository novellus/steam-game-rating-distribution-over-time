      /><br><br>This game depicts the maiden adventure of a woman named Shelia in
      the year 2020.<br><br>The 1000-year-old relic swords known as &quot;Kanshou
      and Bakuya&quot;, discovered through SRO research, have been found to comprise
      a unique multilayered structure, containing a mysterious substance in their
      cores. This substance, known as the &quot;Soul of Jiu Xuan&quot;, possesses
      the ability to reanimate the dead. In an attempt to take possession of the substance,
      the &quot;SAI&quot; - a massive terrorist organization controlling its own army
      - has used a cutting-edge piece of technology known as a &quot;Quantum Transporter&quot;
      to infiltrate the SRO research facility and steal top-secret and incredibly
      dangerous data. To make matters worse, while attempting to calibrate coordinates
      on the Quantum Transporter, Shelia mistakenly activates the device, immediately
      transporting everyone in the vicinity to the Floating Island - an airborne continent
      near the North Pole, undisturbed in its slumber for over 1000 years. It is soon
      discovered that the various beasts and corpses of those who once populated the
      island have been reanimated by the &quot;Soul of Jiu Xuan&quot;, and they''re
      coming for Shelia...<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/955050/extras/BM4.gif?t=1603269869"
