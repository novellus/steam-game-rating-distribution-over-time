    review: 'Avoid this!

      The biggest issue with this game is that is has horrible level design and because
      level design is the core element of a walking simulator, i can''t recommend
      this game, What do I mean? First there is the problem with the keys, some small
      houses require a key and you have to find them but the problem is that they
      keys are nowhere to be found, I tried to find all of them but no luck, the most
      logical places where the key should be placed by the dev was empty but that''s
      the smallest issue.

      The other and bigger issue is the placement if invisible walls. First of all
      it''s a shame that a game in 2019 uses tons of invisible walls. Whatever game
      are we talking about, invisible walls are always sign of bad level design and
      this game has a LOT of invisible walls but that''s not the main problem.

      The main problem is that there are places where invislbe walls should not exist
      (stairs, ladders etc.) and places where invisible wall should exist. There was
      a forest area with a house and ther ewere multiple paths to explore. One of
      these paths has a gamebreaking trap: you can jump over a small rock but after
      it ther eis a bush which you can''t pass by, it behaves like a wall, so an invisible
      wall ront of you and another behind you = you can''t move in any direction,
      you''re stuck so it''s game breaking bug and this happened only because the
      dev forgot to place an invisible wall. Because of the game breaking bug I had
      to quit to main menu and restart from the last checkpoint.

      Here is the other big issue with this game: the save points are extremely rare,
      if you encounter a clipping issue or a game breaking bug like in my case, you
      will lose a LOT of progress and that''s extemely annoying. Why aren''t there
      much more save points? Checkpoint saves is one of the biggest cancer in the
      gaming industry and this game shows exactly why.

      So after I was placed back to the last save point which was more than 30 minutes
      before I encountered the game breaking bug, I just lost any interest to continue
      the game, such bullshit save system it''s just bad game design and if we combine
      this with bad level design, well, just avoid this crap!

      It''s interesting that this game runs very well on a GTX1060 with huge amount
      of vegetation so performacne is good, but that doesn''t save this game from
      a dislike, sorry.'
