    about_the_game: A classic Orbx destination developed by Jarrad Marshall, Palm
      Springs has been brought to life for IPACS Aerofly FS 2!<br><br>With one of
      the most dramatically scenic backdrops in the United States, Palm Springs is
      a resort city situated 100 miles east of Los Angeles in Southern California.
      Explore the resort cities of Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage, Cathedral City, Indian
      Wells, Thousand Palms, Palm Desert and Desert Hot Springs, the high-altitude
      alpine wonderland of San Jacinto Peak, the windswept wastelands of the San Gorgonio
      Pass and the harsh beauty of the Coachella Valley desert. Famous during the
      50's and 60's as the playground of Hollywood elite, Palm Springs is home to
      some of finest examples of mid-century Modernist architecture in the world;
      many examples of which can be found in this scenery. From the vast wind turbine
      farms, to the impressive 6000ft Aerial Tramway, from the modern skyscrapers
      of the Reservation Casinos to the retro chic of City Hall, there are literally
      dozens of interesting landmarks and features to explore. In preparation for
      the upcoming R22 helicopter, test your skills landing on the precarious helipads
      atop the Aerial Tramway, or keep your hand-flying skills up to date with low-level
      F-15 sorties along the western edges of Joshua Tree National Park.<br><br>As
      for airport itself; this field is genuinely suited for all types of flyers -
      from the heaviest jetliners, through corporate types and even low-and-slow GA
      flyers, Palm Springs is the perfect destination. Served by most US and Canadian
      mainline airlines to destinations across North America, the airport is famous
      for it's unique &quot;outdoor terminal&quot; - wander around the highly-detailed
      terminal grounds. If that is not enough, be sure to visit the Palm Springs Aviation
      Museum; many types operated by the US Navy are open for viewing. Optimised for
      performance, a huge coverage area, beautiful runway approaches for all types
      of aviators and extraordinary detail around the airport, Palm Springs is your
      perfect base of operations for Southern California. Far more than just an airport!<br><br><strong>Key

    review: "I purchased Palm Springs International (KPSP) primarily to have another\
      \ Orbx airport within GA flying range of Monterey - a comfortable two-hour flight\
      \ in my suspiciously fast Duchess. It is a large airport, with 10,000 ft and\
      \ 5,000 ft runways, a large terminal, and plenty of other buildings and aircraft.\
      \ The DLC includes a substantial mini-region covering the city of Palm Springs,\
      \ the surrounding mountains and desert, and a number of smaller towns. Unfortunately\
      \ it ends short of Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport (KTRM), which would have\
      \ made a brilliant second airport for training hops. \n\nAs I have come to expect\
      \ from Orbx, the airport, city and scenery are immaculate, and also include\
      \ numerous animations and points of interest, such as the moving cable cars\
      \ on the mountain cable-way. It is similar in size and complexity to Orbx Innsbruck,\
      \ although much of the scenery is rocky mountain and desert which, although\
      \ well depicted, is less beautiful (to me at least) than the Alps surrounding\
      \ LOWI. However, it does have the advantage of being in the middle of Aerofly's\
      \ default SW USA scenery area, so there is good en-route scenery for cross-country\
      \ flights in all directions. And at half the price of Innsbruck, it's excellent\
      \ value. \n\nPerformance is excellent, with 30+ fps with graphics quality set\
      \ to High on my low-end Nvidia MX-150_0 graphics card. \n\nPalm Springs would\
      \ make an excellent airport for someone who is learning to fly any size aircraft,\
      \ and looking to do so in more detailed scenery than the FS2 default airports.\
      \ It has plenty of unobstructed flying area over the desert, wide and long runways,\
      \ and is beautifully illuminated for night flying. There are a couple of VORs\
      \ in the mini-region, although Palm Springs is not ILS equipped."
