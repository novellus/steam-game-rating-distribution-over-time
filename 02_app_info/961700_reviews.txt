She finally got accepted into Police Academy as she proves herself and might get more than she bargained for. How will El do at this new academy? What situations will she get into? You can find out if you play this game. \n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n1. The character art isn't the best, but the devs put in the extra work to make them move. \n2. The music throughout the game is nice. However, I feel like I heard some of it in another game, but it might just be stock background music. \n3. The CGs, while basic as most are just a character model on a background, are nice. Even though there are mostly used as eyecandy for the players...\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n1. The little minigame can get tough at times but sometimes it is buggy and unfair. Why does it feel buggy? First of all, the bubbles can fall off when you shoot sometimes. Secondly, it is possible to shoot between two bubbles. The way it is unfair is when it gives you four bubbles of the same color in a row. And guess what? That color can't be reached because it is blocked by bubbles of another color. Overall, the minigame could've used more playtesting.\n2. I know it is just a minigame, but what does saving kittens in bubbles have to do with police work? Is that what the academy does? I doubt it considering how silly the fanservice is in this game. \n3. The story is quick and unnecessary. Some scenes are less than 5 sentences long, and are only there to show nudity. Characters randomly show up with no introduction, and before you ask questions, BAM! Another minigame level. And the cherry on top? [spoiler]CLIFFHANGER ENDING![/spoiler] Other games with a story and a minigame added into it gives more time for the characters. This game doesn't and just rush you to the minigame so you can hopefully pass the level and see more nudity. There is no way I can be invested in the story if almost every scene has less than 4 sentences. And the fanservice doesn't make going through this game again worth it from the frustrations the minigame gave me at times.\n4. There is NO description as to what the abilities do. That would've been helpful.\n\n[h1]Nitpick[/h1]\nThere might be a couple of spelling errors in this game. One that I found was they spelled \"proximity\" like \"priximity\".\n\n[h1]Overall Thoughts[/h1]\nIF you want to play a bubble shooter with fanservice that is a pretty short game, then try it out. Additionally, if you want to throw $3 at something, then buy this. Otherwise, I don't recommend this. The story is rushed and doesn't go deeper into things, and the minigame can be troubling and buggy at times. While the animated characters are a nice touch, that alone isn't enough to save this game.","timestamp_created":1604977929,"timestamp_updated":1604978190,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6/SJ2PUCdqi8rQI="}
