At least you can pick your own images to make puzzles out of, but sadly the mechanics aren't as polished as they should be to make it worth the time. The UI is very low quality, lots of pixelation. It's often difficult to pick a piece.\n\nFor some reason they decided to add a grey effect to non-selected pieces. Which in my opinion is the worst thing and why I would never recommend it beyond any other reason. It's hard to go over all the pieces on larger puzzles when they're not even the proper colors they should be. I couldn't see any real options other than to mute/change the background music.","timestamp_created":1608194836,"timestamp_updated":1608194836,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4rj4t/YCca3yugI="}
