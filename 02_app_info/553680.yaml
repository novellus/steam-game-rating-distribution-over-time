    review: "err? what? what is going on. place cube here... hmm dunno let's do that...\
      \ nope nothing ... hmm click click click nothing nope. lets look around then.\
      \ Wow this really looks like somebody threw this together in five minutes in\
      \ unity. well it's an experience so graphics need not be good. so hmm is it\
      \ really broken... hmm. one more try with the cubes.. they turn a colour. ah.\
      \ I gotta line them up perfecly on the squaires. oh no this is not looking good.\
      \ \nstart game bring cubey home. ah. lets do that. Hmm if i turn i can't see\
      \ cubey so lets keep standing still and look on cubey from so far away that\
      \ I need to turn up antialiasing to be able to spot him moving in the distance.\
      \ \nah. so I  can't really see where cubey is going before he is landing in\
      \ the fire pit. LETS  BURN HIM a few times.. hahaha.\ndamn. a remote control\
      \ helicopter game would be fun though. This just sucks.\nI saw an advertisement\
      \ on reddit \"an experience for the price of a bag of peanuts\" damn expensive\
      \ peanuts then. \nDo not waste your time or money on this one. this one is broken\
      \ by design."
