    review: 'So this game is far more fun than it has any right to be. It is ROUGH
      like crazy around the edges (note to dev...the high scores overlayed in the
      menu screen could use some polish...) but I DO recommend this game. To me this
      is a game developed for someone that HAS experience in VR and for those who
      don''t. Wireless controllers not needed, but you need lots of room to move around.
      It will kick your butt quickly so it also feels like a game to load up when
      your friends are over...and in case you need more details - check out our FULL
      review here https://youtu.be/9kOQZaEUDvY


      Also...not getting hit in the face is a good lesson to use in life as well as
      VR. Just putting that out there.'
