It's the only game I've played where you can stay securely standing inside of a moving vehicle without glitching out of it. 250 player slot servers, (thats right 250) and never ending maps. If you are curious about Novalogic games and you're okay with having a mulitplayer only game, Joint Operations is a great choice. I first played the game in 2004 and even today I still find myself getting excited when rusing into a rebel base with fifty of my teammates. Has great coop as well!","timestamp_created":1336802650,"timestamp_updated":1436215437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.679962396621704102","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47IzHss4Cd/K0BA=="}
