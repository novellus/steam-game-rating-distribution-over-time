Each character's 'story' is just a tooltip on the upgrade page.\n\nThis game is basically just a deathmatch arena vs bots of random ship classes. So theres a chance that if you spawn in with your D class ship, a couple A class bots may also spawn to just instantly destroy you on sight. Likewise You may spawn in as an S class ship and all the bots are B class or lower, making for zero challenge.\n\nI purchased this on sale so I wasn't extremely disappointed, but I also felt like there was plenty of room for improvement.\n\nFor achievement hunters: this game is probably going to take around 5-6 hours, and some of the achievements are impossible to get unless you use a modified config file from the games single guide.","timestamp_created":1594445288,"timestamp_updated":1594445350,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532312929630279541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx6iWnvMCeMi+lAI="}
