So this is more or less an early access review.\n\nHard Rock Pinball as the name implies is a pinball game with a hard rock music theme.  Each of the present 3 tables are themed accordingly and the developer is actively working on this title.  The game itself plays okay and some of the recent additions make the game more palatable as his work continues, however, at this point the game is playable and may be enjoyable to some, but without rule sheets and achievements (which don't appear to be working), it may be a little hard for some to take. The music in the game can get a little grating for long game players. Color scheme is still feels to old school for me, but everyone has a preference. I personally say give it a try, for the current price it is very reasonable, but who knows if you will like it, maybe you wont.","timestamp_created":1593262356,"timestamp_updated":1596958573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.455407947301864624","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1593281907,"developer_response":"Hello, thanks to review and I'm sorry if the game didn't meet your expectations.\n\nI'm working, even at this moment when I write the review to make some improvements to the game, such as:\n- New complete songs for the player to choose.\n- Option for the player to change the controllers.\n- Different types of balls, with different physics.\n- Improvements to existing tables.\n- New tables.\n\nIf you have something you find interesting to add or change, feel free to suggest."}],"cursor":"AoJ4nMCJ6fMCc8nZkAI="}
