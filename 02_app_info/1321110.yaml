    review: "Final updated review.\nThis game is a fun little challenge good for a\
      \ few hours.  Well worth the money in my opinion.  There were several bugs on\
      \ release but the dev worked directly with me over email and fixed them within\
      \ a day or two.  Super responsive and willing to help a gamer he had never met\
      \ to get his game working as it should.  More devs should be like that.\nThat\
      \ said, be aware that this is the same game as SquaresStory just with graphics\
      \ and a couple QOL changes.  It is a reskin and rerelease by the developer.\
      \  Don't buy both and expect different games like I did.  \nIf you like simple\
      \ games that make you think about your next move this is definitely for you.\
      \  It rewards thinking ahead and planning.  Be warned it might take a few tries\
      \ to win if you don't do the math as you go.  \nTotal play time is probably\
      \ around 5 hours the first full playthrough.  Your mileage may vary.  \nReplayability\
      \ is pretty low but a few hours of entertainment for less than the price to\
      \ rent a movie is well worth it IMO."
