    review: This game was a quick cheap buy, because well it looked fun and reminded
      me of the old games of Phoenix and Asteroid. The game is basically of the spaceship
      joystick/mouse fly around and shoot other spaceships game. The graphics are
      just ok and the music kind of a scifi-trip theme, but nothing really really
      to blow you away. You get to choose a spaceship based on what you like, speed,
      fire power, health with names like Rio, Volga, Potomac and Euphrates and protect
      the Blue Shield Alliance's power generators on colonized planets. Such and Mars,
      Pluto and the Moon. The character roster is short with Admiral Herman, engineer
      Dana, a robot named B-177e  and a frigate pilot named Valgard. The bad guys
      are just easily named Cons and well that's about it. There is a single / co
      op story mode and you have a survival mode. Go back and beat top scores with
      free play mode also. The game is fun and you can kill a hour or so but, with-out
      a team or co op friends you get stuck/can't really progress in story mode. This
      game is almost  like you do need the team/friends to beat it. It'll be lots
      of fun with them, but it puts a damper on beating the actual story mode and
      playing as a single player.  Buy if you have lined up friends to get it too
      or its on sale like when I did and have a few hours to kill.
