      [h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers[/h1]


      This is a good, but short atmospheric Horror experience for VR. It''s almost
      like a walking simulator with light puzzles, except with very little actual
      walking. You basically just teleport from scene to scene. I found most of the
      puzzles to be pretty easy to solve, except for the last room. You can finish
      the game in anywhere from 15-25 minutes.


      Despite the mostly easy puzzles, I did enjoy the game. You''re basically confused
      the whole time wondering where you are and what''s going on. Except a lot of
      creepy stuff happens around you. Unfortunately, the game ends suddenly and on
      the worst puzzle element. You have to guide this square tool around some wire
      setup with balls for corners. It took me several tries before I was finally
      able to execute it properly ... then it just ends with no explanation.


      Teleportation is the only locomotion and there is no smooth or snap turning.
      A room-scale setup is also recommended. I actually got this game on sale for
      $1.19 USD and think it''s a good deal for the content at that price.
