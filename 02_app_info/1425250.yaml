      /><br><br>Gravity Field is a space-logic puzzle with time-inverted objects (cubes),
      in which there is no top or bottom.<br>The game is made in a minimalist style
      - the levels are cubic rooms, which contain only the necessary items that perform
      a specific function. You will have to run along the walls and ceiling, although
      there is no clear definition of where is the top and where is the bottom. In
      this case, it will be necessary to solve various kinds of puzzles, sometimes
      resorting to time inversion.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1425250/extras/gif2.gif?t=1607406855"
      /><br><br>In the game you will see gravitational fields, each of which has its
      own direction of gravity, entering into which, the gravitational force of this
      field will act on you. Outside the field, weightlessness will affect you. On
      the levels you will come across closed doors, the opening of which will not
      be obvious. Use cubes, buttons, connectors to open them! In some puzzles you
      will see the time inversion icon - this means that the time for some items will
      go backwards! Use this to solve another problem! You have no plot in the game
      - because it is not needed here. This game is for real puzzle lovers. You have
      a list of levels, tasks in which you have to solve. And after that, new levels
      will open for you!<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1425250/extras/11123.png?t=1607406855"
