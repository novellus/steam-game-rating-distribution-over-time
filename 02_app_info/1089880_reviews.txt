There are no in-game options to change anything about the game.  This includes hints, showing errors, pencil marks, volume and music controls and much more.\n2. The UI is unintuitive at best.  No explanation for the UI is given.\n3. The major issue I have with this game is that there are NO PENCIL MARKS AVAILABLE.  This is a huge detriment and the main reason why I am not recommending this game at this point in time.\n\nBuy it if you want, but I will not recommend it.","timestamp_created":1598403514,"timestamp_updated":1598403514,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6cGRlPQCdczknQI="}
