However, the winter textures on the trucks are a bit wonky, like theyâ€™ve been run through a monochrome negative filter or something.\n\nI would rate textures a 4/5.\n\nDetails/Special features:\n\nThe locomotive contains a few special features that have been carried over from the D&RGW base model:\n\nThe clapper on the bell moves when the bell is activated, the doors and windows can be opened and closed (the rear door also changes the engine sounds in the cab), and toggle-able number board, class, and platform lights (the class lights appear to only shine white though).\n\nI would rate details/special features a 3/5.\n\nSounds:\n\nThe engine sounds are quite good, except that they are from the wrong model of engine (the included sounds appear to have been recorded from an EMD 645E3, which is found in locomotive models such as the SD40-2.  The real SD50s used EMD 645F  engines, which sound closer to the MP36PH-3C engine sounds from the Peninsula Corridor route).\n\nThe horn sounds are pretty bad, it sounds like the microphone had water in it during the recording process.  The bell is the standard bell sound the DTM products have, which unfortunately can't be heard inside the cab.\n\nI would rate sounds a 3/5.\n\nPhysics:\n\nPhysics are alright, the locomotive has a decent amount of pulling power, and the dynamic brakes don't cause the train to jump the tracks like in some other locomotives.  Air brakes feel a bit too strong though.\n\nI would rate physics 4/5.\n\nScenarios:\n\nUnfortunately, the locomotive doesn't appear to feature any scenarios, I would have liked to see at least one scenario for the Miami - WPB route or the Clinchfield Railroad route.\n\nWould rate scenarios 1/5.\n\nTotal score for this DLC is a D-.\n\nI would recommend waiting for a sale to pick up this DLC.","timestamp_created":1609288553,"timestamp_updated":1609292570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2fvT2PYCcKXPvgI="}
