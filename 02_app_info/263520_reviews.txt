Because sexual violence against women should never be shown in any way other than as a terrible act of crime, especially in games.\nThe voice acting here is absolutely terrific: innocent happiness in the girl's tone change drastically into raw pain and uncontrollable anger, creating the living believable character.\nThe game, however, is far from being perfect on its technical and design sides and deserves more polishing and more visual quality in general.","timestamp_created":1427282634,"timestamp_updated":1608314265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498749196529388428","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42oPAu/YCcMKyOQ=="}
