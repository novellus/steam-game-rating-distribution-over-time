It's bad but in an endearing way. [spoiler]Like there's a part where the monster is chasing you and it's supposed to be growling-but honest to god it just sounds like a grown man meowing at you.[/spoiler]\n-Art is good\n-backgrounds are intersting enough\n-The plot is interesting enough to keep you entertained\n-I actually liked the characters well enough \n\nCons:\n-the end?? Like i have no idea if i got the wrong end or something but its [spoiler]pretty much just a cliff hanger that never gets resolved.[/spoiler] Who knows. Maybe he's planning a sequel or something\n-So. Much. Walking. Abdulla, my guy, you do not need to use that many paths. Especially if you're going to have the player use the entire map the whole game\n-Some of the puzzles were infuriating \n-I know everyone has mentioned this before but the writing on the ground is corny as hell\n\nIn conclusion: For a first game its pretty good. if you have four bucks to spare and enough energy to slog through the tedious parts (*coughcough* walking *coughcough*), then go for it.","timestamp_created":1527494710,"timestamp_updated":1527494710,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477357417345046997","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr/Lx0uMCc/m9oQE="}
