I just finished this game and although it definitely has some small issues, it was enjoyable enough that I felt a good review was warranted. \n\nSo, let's get the bad out of the way first. The bad also happens to sort of be good as well (yeah I know, it's complicated lol). It's the visual style. Honestly it's very disorienting and it made my head hurt while playing. However, it also adds something really unique to the experience. there are going to be people that hate it. There will be people who love it and those that see it both ways. I'm in the middle. I think it was necessary to make the kind of game they wanted to make but unfortunately, my head was not appreciative of the style they chose. \n\nOther than that, there wasn't very much combat and I thought originally that combat might have been more of a focus in the game. In fact, it's such a very small portion of the game you may as well say the game doesn't have combat at all. For the most part, you're going to be  looking for keys and solving some small puzzles. Along the way, you can discover some secrets and get 1 of (what I believe to be) 2 endings: Good and Bad. I received the bad ending on my first playthrough while finding all documents and 1 out of 2 secrets in 39 minutes. \n\nThat allows me to touch on something else that's slightly disappointing - the length. But, reaching back to the art style, if it was much longer I probably wouldn't have been able to finish it. So, considering it's roughly $5 for around 40 minutes of game time (possibly longer if you explore more and go for both endings) I think it's not too bad. To me, price to length is worth it. \n\nI do wish you could move this game into full screen. I'm not sure if there's a way to go fullscreen or not but I couldn't figure it out. And the mouse kept coming out of the game so I had a hard time with the 4 digit keycode puzzle because the mouse kept moving out of the screen when I'd try to change the digits and confirm. Small issue but it was a little frustrating. \n\nOverall, it's a decent game. Price to length ratio is good, the artstyle is weird/unique and really works even if it's a bit disorienting, there's plenty of exploration. There's a few puzzles and the story is good. I don't want to spoil anything but you find notes (20 of them) that explain a little bit about what's going on and that helps fill you in on the things you've seen and heard around the school. \n\nThis game isn't going to completely blow you away. It's not about fighting tons of monsters and lots of blood and gore but it is a neat little indie game with a good enough story and a great amount of exploration. If any of that sounds good to you, go ahead and give it a shot. If not, maybe wait for a sale or pass. \n\nIf you want to see some gameplay (featuring the bad ending) check out my video over on Youtube. Just keep in mind that you'll probably be spoiling a good portion of the game for yourselves. If it looks good shortly after you start watching, I'd recommend not finishing the video so that you can enjoy it for yourselves:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_8eBOXKwTc","timestamp_created":1602308296,"timestamp_updated":1602308309,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1602314235,"developer_response":"Just wanted to thank you for being one of the first players and reviewers!  I watched your playthrough video and took notes.  I really appreciate your review because you are very gracious when your playthrough was definitely frustrated.  I'm fixing the bugs right now, I wasn't aware the game wouldn't be in full screen, it probably is because you minimized and went back to the game, and I didn't accommodate for that.  I'm adding the option to switch between full screen in the menu.  Also, I'll work on making the player handle better on corners so it's not as easy to get stuck.  \n\nI had a friend of mine play the game before release and he told me of the issue with the camera \"turning\" to the left, and I never had the issue myself with my mouse.  This is the first time I've actually seen it myself, I'll have to test the game with a different mouse and make sure I have the bug fixed.\n\nAgain, thanks a ton for your playthrough and thorough review!  I'm in the works on a sequel, and I'm doing all the code all from scratch.  The new one will be much more combat oriented with a variety of enemies and hopefully less confusing areas.  This is my first game I've finished and released on Steam, so this whole process has been a huge learning experience.  I'm grateful for your input (:"}],"cursor":"AoJ4gJDBiPUCepX6pgI="}
