    about_the_game: The SD40-2 High Nose is a classic US diesel locomotive for Train
      Simulator, and a great add-on for fans of the Norfolk Southern Railroad. <br><br><br>The
      SD40-2 first rolled on the rails in 1972 and its 3,000 horsepower engine and
      hauling ability soon made it a popular choice for railroads across the US. The
      High Nose is one of many variations based on the original design which were
      created to suit the requirements of different operators, such as Norfolk Southern.
      The Norfolk Southern Railroad is a major Class 1 railroad in the United States,
      with 21,500 route miles in 22 eastern states, the District of Columbia and the
      province of Ontario, Canada. The most common commodity hauled on the railroad
      is coal from mines across several states. The railroad also offers an extensive
      intermodal network in eastern North America.<br><br><br>The &quot;high nosed&quot;
      variant of the SD40-2 is so called due to the full-height hood in front of the
      cab area, whereas other SD40-2s usually have a low hood with windshields above.<h2

    review: '- No notch labels on throttle and dynbrake.

      - Only two settings for lights: off and on. On lights up both the front and
      back sets, including ditches.

      - Horn and sander stick on if you use the in-cab controls instead of hotkeys.

      - Couplers are very stretchy. Hard braking can make multiple locos in a row
      clip into each other.


      + Fairly nice models despite age, for both the loco and cars. Good as AI and
      helper engines.

      + 90% off on sales. I would''ve refunded this but for $1 it''s pretty okay for
      the cars.'
