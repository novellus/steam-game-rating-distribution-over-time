      \ herself in charge of an item shop built into her house, in order to pay back\
      \ a loan her father took and then skipped out on - and Tear, her newfound fairy\
      \ \"companion\", won't take no for an answer! As Recette, you have to decide\
      \ how you'll get your stock - either through playing the markets in town or\
      \ going out into the wild with an adventuring friend and thrashing beasts until\
      \ they give up the goodies - how much to sell things for, what the shop should\
      \ look like, and how to best go about getting the money Tear needs to pay off\
      \ the loan. If you can't come up with the money... well, hope you like living\
