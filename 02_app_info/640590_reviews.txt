Whenever a single controller is used, the second player is enabled by force. I tried various things like disabling Steam input or setting the second player on keyboard, then dropping from keyboard, nothing worked. The screen gets split whenever input from the controller is detected.","timestamp_created":1609867580,"timestamp_updated":1609867580,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwprrl6fYCeL3hwAI="}
