The difficulty curve is good, and most levels allow for some degree of creativity or abuse; very few levels feel locked in to one specific solution. The primary focus is building the \"bridges\" and occasionally there are silly or challenging maps. Bridge Constructor is still my favorite, but I like it a hack of a lot more than PolyBridge (which I dislike for many reasons.)\n\nThere are a few things I think could have been better. The structures seem a little weak compared to other bridge builders, often I found myself mystified by a stress point and brute forcing slightly tweaked supports. The physics can be a little chaotic sometimes - change a piece and suddenly a completely disconnected structure fails. The money cap (aka point over which you won't get a trophy) is a bit tight so as to limit creative or novel solutions possible.","timestamp_created":1609749960,"timestamp_updated":1609749960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1OKk5vYCcb2qwAI="}
