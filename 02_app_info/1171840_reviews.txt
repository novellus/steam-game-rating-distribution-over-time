The attitude of your character also change depending on your choices and I find this very well made. The universe does'nt seem shallow, key events are very well written and absorbing and there are also some surprise here and there. A lot of choice and stats are just there to give you the feeling of CYOA games and you can feel the author affinity with the genre.\n\nThe negatives can be found in straightforward \"choose the right move\" battle that only requires you to read the text attentively to find the good answer. Sometimes I found the story unconvincing or a little rushed but there are only few of those moments. Some other times I found the characters a little blank or useless. That's not always the case and most of the times they're well depicted. The story also seem it could have been longer and/or more focused and intense. Some stats hardly have any use as well.\n\nOverall, although it is a good story it sometimes felt like a highly refined testing field with a little bit of everything and some things added here and there to the patchwork. This feeling of uncompleted draft keeps me from classifying Ironheart as a must-read but I think it's nonetheless a hotly recommend title for me.","timestamp_created":1609907846,"timestamp_updated":1609907846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt4f/6vYCcJD0wAI="}
