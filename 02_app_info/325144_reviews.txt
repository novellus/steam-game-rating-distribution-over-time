Handles crisply and makes my GA flights \"just long enough\" so I don't feel like I'm poking around in a super slow airplane.\n\nThere are a lot of nice little details about it, from the 70s decor to the fact that you can open the doors and compartments.  It just helps the whole thing feel all the more real.  It's the little things that make it feel so nice, at least to my eyes.  In the end, this is essentially the only GA plane I'll fly on X-Plane now (well, except the Piper Sport, another great aircraft sold by Corenado that sadly isn't in Steam.)\n\nIf you have the money, and you want a high quality GA plane, I'd grab this one :).","timestamp_created":1454568769,"timestamp_updated":1454568769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43sDD1dICfZ3zTw=="}
