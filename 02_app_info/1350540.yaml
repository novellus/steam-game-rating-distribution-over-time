    review: while it is very rough it has obvious potential the idea of being a soldier
      in a civil war battle is a interesting and entertaining the game right now is
      functional but has some problems. Like getting stuck in the aiming pose when
      your trying to get to the shoulder arms position or how a side will randomly
      stop spawning soldiers. But if they keep working on it it would be a entertaining
      game to play.
