    short_description: The game fills the color with a digital cue, all the numbers
      are interlocked, and each step must be patiently calculated to finally break
      the maze. If you like puzzle games, want to challenge difficult, and have a
      lot of time, come play!

    review: 'There''s an absolutely massive amount of content for $1. If you''re a
      fan of minesweeper/nonograms or similar logic-based puzzles then this is a great
      title to pick up.


      There seems to be a save bug where if you save a puzzle, close the game, open
      it, and load the puzzle, then you won''t be able to save the puzzle again properly.
      So you either finish it in the second session or lose your progress. The other
      reviews here seem to see that as a deal-breaker, but it''s really not that hard
      to just finish a puzzle within two play sessions...It would be really nice if
      the developer had fixed it some time over the past year though.


      I''ve almost finished the game and have yet to see any other bugs related to
      the saves or anything else. The UI is smooth and responsive, and I haven''t
      had any issues with it either.'
