Takes me back to the days of building WC3 TD maps.\n\nSome of the worst voice acting ever, but somehow the terrible voice is campy enough to be entertaining.\n\nDefinitely a 5/10 the game itself is okay, however the lack of save points is painful. The wiggle room in getting a perfect run is very tight so it gets very frustrating to have to redo a level from the start several times.","timestamp_created":1604129098,"timestamp_updated":1604129098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkfHivvUCfqOfqwI="}
