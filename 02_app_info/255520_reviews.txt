I may be slightly biased because I love the VCD series, but VCD Shadow Warrior is a fun game. It's only one map and can give you around 1-2 hours of gameplay, depending on how fast you can clean up dead ninja bodies.\n\nOverall 9/10, would play again if I had friends.","timestamp_created":1610125372,"timestamp_updated":1610125372,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpu288fYCedvKwQI="}
