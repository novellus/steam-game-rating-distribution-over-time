    review: Really useful in-game pet for auto-farming since you can use this pet
      on auto-roam and it will fight monsters around the map helping out your towers,
      so for overall id say its quite useful at the start of the game. But towards
      wave 200 and so it becomes apparant that this needs to be buffed slightly, since
      the clicking damage you have is not really high anyway but at the start of the
      game. Overall id say its currently not worth the price-tag because of how useless
      it is end game, but for supporting the company who create the game id say this
      is the best fit for this right now.
