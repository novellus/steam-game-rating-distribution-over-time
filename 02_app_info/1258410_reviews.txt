Talk about unusual. In any event, I posted a video with a full overview here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ngbt4xtck\n\nTo summarize, this game is one part history lesson, one part advertisement (on why to visit Japan) and one part mediocre \"Qix\" clone, and is incredibly Indie/Doujin in just about every way. If you're not familiar with 1981's \"Qix\", the basic idea is that you move around a perimeter (most often a square or rectangle) and \"draw or cut\" a portion of it out to reveal an image until you've revealed the majority of it while utilizing power-ups and avoiding enemies / obstacles. There are subtle differences between the various Qix-esque games, but they are mostly the same at their core and most of them are better offerings than this (some examples include \"Battle Qix\", \"Dancing Eyes\", \"Cacoma Knight\", \"Gals Panic\", the Doujin \"Gal Pani X\", etc.). \n\nWith that in mind, the game is a hard \"maybe\" as Steam does not have a neutral rating and is recommended purely for its price point and its attempt to promote various Japanese locales.","timestamp_created":1605238051,"timestamp_updated":1605238181,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yNnp3/UCdv2FrgI="}
