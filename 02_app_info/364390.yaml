    review: "Another great game by Harvester Games. After playing one of my favourite\
      \ games, The Cat Lady, I had to try Downfall out. I was not disappointed. \n\
      \n A good old point & click game, with gore and psychological horror to it.\
      \ I loved seeing references to The Cat Lady, as Joe himself, the protagonist\
      \ of Downfall, is one of the parasites Susan deals with in The Cat Lady. It\
      \ was very interesting to see his own story and problems in the crazy world\
      \ these characters live in. What started as a relationship problem quickly develops\
      \ into horror and choices; to get the one he loves back, Ivy, he must kill the\
      \ 4 Sophies, but it's not that simple. Sacrifices will have to be made. And,\
      \ in the end, it doesn't always pay off. \n\n(Spoilers) The game does a good\
      \ job in deceiving you; I didn't realise Agnes was who she was, a most likely\
      \ form of expression of the good sides of Ivy that Joe (and I) didn't realise\
      \ until the very end, as can be seen when she walks through the hallway full\
      \ of mirrors, in which her reflection is Ivy. But that is just another great\
      \ aspect of the game. Mystery and uncertainty, millions of problems to solve,\
      \ and morals. Morality does affect Harvester Games creations a lot. But I myself\
      \ find it very enjoyable. \n\n(Spoilers) What I didn't see was the most obvious\
      \ point of the story. The game shows you several corrupted creatures and beings,\
      \ but the utmost parasite being Joe himself. You get so involved in the role\
      \ of being Ivy's saviour that you don't realise, in reality, you've become just\
      \ like everyone else: a monster. I think that's because of the ending I got,\
      \ but, in the end, Joe is the psychopath (that I've failed to recognise). \n\
      \nI was very excited to see Susan and Mitzi at the end. This game will most\
      \ likely affect you emotionally, with great story telling and deep involvement\
      \ with characters. It did make me quite emotional, and I can't wait to play\
      \ the next Harvester Games."
