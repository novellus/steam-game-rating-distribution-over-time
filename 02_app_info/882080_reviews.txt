If you have XPadder you will be fine.\n\nOriginal concept of \"temporary upgrades\" made permanent by blowing up your ship and picking up pieces. Gotta do this at the right time. Adds depth to the gameplay\n\nA bit grindy because you have to buy permanent upgrades with credits which you have to farm. Not a huge deal.\n\nIf you like shoot em ups, it's a good choice.","timestamp_created":1566205635,"timestamp_updated":1566205665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47rvI1OwCcvvS0AE="}
