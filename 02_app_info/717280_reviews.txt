But if you like games of this genere then please do pick up this game and give it a try!\n\nThe game could use some mild tutorial explaining, such as how selection works, what caves do, etc. After the creatures leave your care they should wander off/despawn. A real breeding tree could be implimented, maybe wild creatures with random trates come up to breed, and then only after selecting them as a mate, can you go to the cave to get babies. Little to interact with, but the tornado seems to chace you which adds an element of difficulty to your efforts, but what the cubs are trying to tell you is massivly unclear, and hard to fix.\n\nI enjoyed my time with it in its current state, and I'll update my review every time the game updates!","timestamp_created":1510461541,"timestamp_updated":1510602744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.759476959705352783","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwjJS8298CdvOKiwE="}
