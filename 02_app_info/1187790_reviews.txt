For the most part, i'm very impressed! I used to shoot trap (D.T.L, A.B.T) and English skeet for my county, and have had trials for England, although I have not shot competition for a number of years, mainly due to the cost. \n\nThis game feels very close to real life clay shooting! I make similar mistakes that i make in real life, miss when I expect to miss, and hit what i expect to hit. I like the online leaderboards, and I am aiming to top them all. I feel a few tweaks are needed though. American trap feels just a little to easy. After a little practice shooting rounds of 25, i attempted shooting a round of 100, and hit 100 straight on my first attempt. Though i have shot 100 straight in D.T.L before (similar to american trap), I doubt i could do it with such ease now. I'd likely only hit 90-95 IRL with my current ability. The Olympic skeet however, feels far to hard. I'd usually average about 80-90/100, but the game only allows for rounds of 25, of which i'm lucky to hit just 10. Stand 8 in particular feels impossible to hit anything. I can't pinpoint what exactly is so hard about the mode, but its clear i'm not the only one that finds it unrealistically challenging, as the best ever score (according to the leaderboard) is a measly 20/25. Maybe due in part to the resolution making the targets hard to see, but otherwise i'm not sure what else is causing the low scores.\n\nI love the gun customisation options, i use a Ceasar Guerini high rib trap gun IRL and the gun i use in game shoots exactly the same. Although, to play the game with any success, a VR gunstock is a necessity. I have been playing with a cardboard stock i made myself, but have ordered a proper one to use in this game and others. \n\nOverall, excellent game, would like to see more features such as new disciplines, online competitions, and a practice mode where you can practice shooting a specific target, for example high house from 3rd skeet stand. I feel practice in game will translate well IRL, and i'm looking forward to shooting again IRL to see if my scores have improved with the practice i've gained in game. \n","timestamp_created":1609875542,"timestamp_updated":1609875542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/+mD6vYCeojmwAI="}
