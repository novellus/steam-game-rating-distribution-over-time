I'd prefer them rotated by 90 degrees, but ideally both would be available to choose. all things considered, even at 75% off I regret my purchase after playing about a dozen levels.","timestamp_created":1541372316,"timestamp_updated":1556993878,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544616341590881348","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/6SEwuoCcPOIrgE="}
