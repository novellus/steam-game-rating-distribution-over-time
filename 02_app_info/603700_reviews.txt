Its also pretty short and sweet with a little room for replayability if you've got the appetite for it. Aside from the usual staples found in most point and click games, there are a multiple little fun mini games that appear frequently. Dialogue is written well and delivered enjoyably by a varied cast. Coupled with a charming art style and you've got a wonderful game that is worth the buy!","timestamp_created":1606540459,"timestamp_updated":1606540459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476594716310501099","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v7/RhvYCdfuWtAI="}
