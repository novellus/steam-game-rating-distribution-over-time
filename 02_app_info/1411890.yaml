      /><br>C.L.A.Y. The Last Redemption is a story-driven role playing game set in
      a post-post-apocalyptic city. You are the Scion of your tribe, and soon you
      will be chieftain. Prove yourself to the Elders; lead your crew; build your
      character and uncover the secret stories of the living city you call home.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Create your Scion</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1411890/extras/banner2.png?t=1605691838"
      /><br>Create your own Scion by balancing the three attributes of a future chieftain:
      Warchief, Pactmaker and Trickster. What kind of leader will you be?<h2 class="bb_tag">Form
      a Crew</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1411890/extras/banner3.png?t=1605691838"
      /><br>No-one goes into the City alone: form a crew consisting of Tribesmen,
      Warriors, Clayworkers and Shamans, as well as your own permanent Companions,
      each with their own stories and destinies.<h2 class="bb_tag">Explore a unique
      post-apocalyptic city</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1411890/extras/banner4.png?t=1605691838"
      /><br>The City you call home is unlike any other city in the world, but you
      wouldn''t know: your tribe has been trapped inside it since the world came to
      an end. Controlled by some unknown, often malevolent force, the City is ever-changing,
      demolishing and rebuilding itself following logic only the Shamans can follow.
      To survive, you will need to learn to interpret its secrets.<h2 class="bb_tag">Scavenging
      and Crafting</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1411890/extras/banner5.png?t=1605691838"
      /><br>Scavenge for food and clay, avoid danger or meet it head-on, and use every
      resource you can to give yourself an advantage against the mounting threat of
      the City and its army of Hunter-Killer drones.<h2 class="bb_tag">A branching
      narrative</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1411890/extras/banner6.png?t=1605691838"
      /><br>The story spans the whole City, and every decision you make can change
      the fate of your people, and yourself.'
