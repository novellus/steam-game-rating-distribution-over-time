      /><br>After years of developing a prototype we're finally ready to start showing
      the game. It's about bringing something fresh to football games genre. There
      are two big realistic football games on the market and many small unrealistic.
      We truly believe SFF can take place somewhere in the middle. Real physics? Yes.
      Realistic (enough) player movement? Yes. A lot of impactful player attributes?
      Yes. But these are just words. Soon we will release a Tech Demo so you can check
      how cool the gameplay feels. We hope you'll like it and spread a good word about
      the game!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1392560/extras/SteamBaner1.jpg?t=1603443212"

    short_description: Serious Fun Football game looks fun but has serious gameplay.
      You'll see real ball physics and semi-realistic player movement. You control
      one specific player or whole team of three players. Players have different attributes
      which greatly impact the game.
