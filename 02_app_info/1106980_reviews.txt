And you can program drones to do your bidding and expand your empire!  Unfortunately, this premise falls flat due to poor drone AI, rendering the game too tedious and difficult.  I had amassed an army of drones to capture the next base, but the AI is programmed to move in a straight line, and in a level design that has obstacles and bottlenecks, the AI is not savvy enough to \"go around\" so I was left with half my army trapped against the wall.  Redirecting them to a new target didn't do anything.  So I stood useless and overwhelmed by incoming enemy attacks.  Replayed the same level several times and kept running into some variation of the same problem.\n\nI'm not quite ready to hang it up, though.  I was having fun up until that point, and I'd like to eventually unlock the rest of the game's full potential.\n\nSome suggestions:\n\n- fix drone AI\n- allow a \"pause\" feature when in Q-map mode, as reprogramming all the drones and trying to secure a base can be overwhelmed faster than I can get into build mode\n- allow drones to have a \"patrol\" mode for defense or \"envoy\" mode for flanking so they're not uselessly splitting up and diving every enemy base\n\nGame has potential.  I'd love to see it through.\n\nIn the meantime, I'd suggest checking out Particle Fleet: Emergence for a more dynamic, chilled-out version of Bulletorium.\n\nedit: game deserves praise for a cheap, fun distraction and a responsive dev.","timestamp_created":1565716071,"timestamp_updated":1566503440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470588237047195435","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1565721639,"developer_response":"Thank you for feedback! I just checked project and noticed that one of the levels has broken piece of navigation, thats why AI trapped near the wall. My fault. In general, AI can move to any base, even if there is no direct line between bases. I'll fix this bug in next update and try to implement your suggestions"}],"cursor":"AoJw6LG43ewCc9Ok0AE="}
