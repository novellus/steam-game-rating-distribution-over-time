    review: This is going to be a hard one to write I will say that quite a bit of
      the original is reflected but feels a little bit lost i'm on my second play
      through well I like the beginning all the way to the end the level the change
      in a second is very minimal *cough *cough spoilers much further ahead        after
      the wish a lot more choices felt impactful it kind of scares me how much of
      that part of it was lost I remember when redoing my first playthrough where
      are leeko died and design not to spare brock I was horrified at how much the
      story changed and playing the second time through the first third to half the
      game had no impact one story no matter what I picked no different transformations
      no alternative cut off it felt much more railroaded my fix is that have all
      up to the point of the wish they just be a comic they keep a lot of the games
      integrity and maybe then benefited even a lack of voice acting kind of hurts
      on my second playthrough not to mention tam tam iconic line could have been
      reused in audio my tip anyone playing the DLC save before the wish you'll thank
      me a thousand get it on sale I do like where it went though it did cause me
      to rethink some things and has made me interested despite my negativity to see
      the other endings and I like what you did there for the Continuity of the prequel
      comic for my second ending spoilers ahead  that is really really short dull
      and missing purpose I can't believe I'm saying this BUT ONLY GET IT WHEN IT'S
      ON A SALE to have the only difference be maybe 5 minutes between a different
      ending and a couple sentences you should have just went with a comic option
      i've never felt this cheated in Forever maybe I'll try the other endings later
      maybe they'll cool my nerves some but being someone who was about to buy this
      as soon as it was released i'm at a loss of words I guess time can truly change
      anything  I know compare is it bad habit and could be an insult but the base
      game within how choices felt reminds me of undertale or BioShock in this DLC
      it felt more likes bioShock infinite with the choices you can make
