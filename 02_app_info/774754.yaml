    about_the_game: "Experience a unique taste of historic Frankfurt by diving into\
      \ two distinct lines of the network, the S5 and the S6.<br><br>The foundations\
      \ for a modern rapid transit system through the centre of Frankfurt am Main,\
      \ and beyond into the outer Rhine-Main region, were set in the late 1960s. Throughout\
      \ the decade, planners had devised a new tunnel to be burrowed under Frankfurt,\
      \ connecting the main station with a key commuter destination further into the\
      \ city.<br><br>The new tunnel was connected to various regional lines in the\
      \ area, giving them all an inner-city connection from 1978 onwards. This was\
      \ later extended, and the lines along with it, to make what is today a huge\
      \ network sprawling outwards in all directions.<br><br>Two lines in particular,\
      \ the S5 and S6 lines, serve as important interchange lines between the Taunus\
      \ Railway and the Main\u2013Weser Railway, bringing commuters closer to the\
      \ heart of the city than main lines ever could. It is these two lines which\
      \ are present in the Rhine-Main S-Bahn route for Train Simulator.<br><br>The\
      \ S5 and S6 lines are represented in full, covering their shared-track section\
      \ from Frankfurt S\xFCd to Frankfurt West, including 6 underground stations,\
      \ before each head for Friedrichsdorf and Friedberg respectively - covering\
      \ some 60 km of high frequency rail en route.<br><br>Both S5 and S6 lines are\
      \ today operated by the DB BR 423. 100 of these articulated EMUs serve Frankfurt\

    review: "Zdecydowanie jest to najlepszy dodatek do Train Simulatora. Sceneria\
      \ jak i zesp\xF3\u0142 trakcyjny BR 423 s\u0105 bardzo dobrze odwzorowane, a\
      \ scenariusze s\u0105 ciekawe oraz rozmaite. Co najwa\u017Cniejsze optymalizacja\
      \ na tej trasie jest wy\u015Bmienita, d\u0142ugi czas \u0142adowania i spadki\
      \ klatek na sekund\u0119 nie b\u0119d\u0105 nam odbiera\u0107 przyjemno\u015B\
      ci z jazdy. Na dodatek jest to jedno z niewielu DLC, kt\xF3re nie ma \u017C\
      adnych bug\xF3w! Mocno polecam, moja ocena: 10/10."
