You wear the flag of a country that was shelled out of existence nearly two kilo-years ago on Earth. The then CCCP won the space race. With the ability to control nearly all of space, it allowed them to influence economies and start conflicts. In a ten year period after the first landing on Mars, the CCCP declared war on its parent country, and then the world. Sides were taken, and bombs were dropped from outer space. CCCP and it’s allies were able to obliterate the majority of the opposition. This alliance of tyrannical world-killers was renamed the Federation a few hundred years later. Only after the first interstellar colonies were sent to a nearby solar system was the invention of sub-light speed travel. The Federation rules most of space in the current year. However, during the Great Evacuation of 2110 remaining freedom forces were able to commandeer a CCCP ship and plunge into outer space. You’ve inherited the responsibility of your ancestors to preserve the history of the United States. In the current year, the freedom fighters have but only a small planet with the technological advancement comparable to prewar. Up against the universe controlling giant, the US Freedom Fighters are unable to mount any offensives. The USFF has taken great care, and nearly insurmountable risk to put you in your current position. You are born American and belong to the USFF, but you are a member of the Federation.
