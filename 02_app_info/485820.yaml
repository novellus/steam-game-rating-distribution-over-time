      \ is interesting, but the way to accomplish this is pretty rough.\nAlthough\
      \ it is only English, it can be played with a dictionary.\nThere is a fast forward\
      \ mode to save our time. And it will give u some quota on fast forward every\
      \ day(real time). Of course u can only wait, when the quota is used up.\nIt\
      \ seems that the temperature in the game is the true temperature of Alaska.\n\
      So the easiest time to start playing this game is summer, and play it in winter\
      \ is also interesting.\nThe biggest problem is that it has many BUG which made\
      \ the game crash 3 times in 2 days(it made me feel bad :<, and i dont know how\
      \ to trigger the BUGs). PLZ fix them(actually i dont know whether the developers\
      \ are still updating the game :P).\nIn a word, i actually like this game very\
      \ much because of the hard-core.\nHappy Chinese New Year and wish everything\
      \ goes well with u"
