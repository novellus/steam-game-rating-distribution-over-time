Leviathan itself has quite a bit of variation.\n-Combat in general was very good too, as the enemies are usually too strong for a simple brute force attack, and you need to think (or aim) to take them down.\n-Story has some interesting twists that caught my players totally off guard and is fun to follow.\n-Almost all character builds will be useful in this adventure. \n\nThe bad:\n-Glitches with some images\n-The campaign is set on one planet only, so no space combat or visiting other planets.\n[Spoiler]-Side-story with Eco-terrorists that kind of just fizzled out[/spoiler]\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this Adventure.","timestamp_created":1569684739,"timestamp_updated":1569684796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpqagvO0CcPmD0wE="}
