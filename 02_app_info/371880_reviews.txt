Graphics and UX are a hard to understand, only four xbox controllers work at the same time (most likely because the game falls back to XInput instead of DINput for those) and I don't like the sound design at all. It's the little things like apprupt victory screens that don't have a direct rematch option, basic samey looking game elements and the sounds of all actions that just don't quite fit together.\n\nI can't recommend it for your next couch coop session","timestamp_created":1601315192,"timestamp_updated":1601315192,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526315808296203613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzNf06vQCdbvWpAI="}
