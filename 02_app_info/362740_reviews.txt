The story is straightforward and easily followed, and the graphics are decent, nothing taxing on your system. Yay for no HO scenes!! You receive a mysterious letter and with your trusty dog you set off on an adventure...\nIt's easy to see what the puzzles are after, but getting there requires a bit of brainwork. The memory puzzles are harder than it seems, and the dice (spatial orientation) puzzle was killer. Just enough to stretch the grey matter a bit and then on to the ending.\nThe only negative comment I have is the audio. Some of the VO (voiceover) work is not actually VO more like MO (mumblingover) in different timbres to reflect the different characters, like the LEGO games, but not anywhere near as good. Additionally, the music (esp. the ending) sounds very amateurish. But it wasn't enough to stop me from playing, though I will admit to taking my headphones off about halfway through and not missing it. A quick time waster and a good story. Would be nice to see Ashley and Isaac's further adventures.","timestamp_created":1608587969,"timestamp_updated":1608588022,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj6rUw/YCeO+EvAI="}
