I love the items that come with the pack.\nthe costume looks neet and the pet and the mount are really amazing.  If you like collecting decorations then this pack is great.\n\nI really wish it came with the God booster instead of the adventure booster.  It would be totally worth it if you could have\nthe God booster.\n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1511066590,"timestamp_updated":1511066590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540636062622070313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws8ul6d8CdPDViwE="}
