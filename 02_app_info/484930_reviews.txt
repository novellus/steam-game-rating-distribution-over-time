Definitely plays like an old 90s shmup and I mean that in the best way possible.\n\nPros:\n+Fun visual style\n+shoot LOTS of bugs, like scorpions and hornets (everyone hates those guys!)\n+Shot upgrade system where defeating a boss increases your \"max shot\" level capacity. When you die, you get knocked down two levels instead of all of them, meaning its easy to recover when you get killed. This game gets more Gradius like the further you get in regards to boss battles, so this is a good thing. It's hard to explain in text, but its apparent how it works when you play. In simpler terms, this game is made in a way that you don't get completely screwed when you die (you do lose all your bombs though)\n+ Fun bomb system. Tap the button once to get some invincibility frames and shoot a bee forward: you get a combo multiplier for how many enemies the bee kills, and it can be a great way to clear harder waves and rack up score! Holding down the button gives you a shield of bees that lasts longer and gives you more invincibility, but has less damage potential\n+Vertical \"wave\" stages break up the action nicely and give you a chance to score\n+Dying in a bonus stage doesn't actually cost you a life!! I love this\n\n\nCons:\n-Bullets are hard to see sometimes\n-In the vertical sections, there is an invisible line on the screen you can't cross, but there's no visual indicator of where it is, which can mess up your dodging\n-Your weapon completely changes as you upgrade. Not much of an issue since the shot you get is almost always better, but whatever the shot you get after waveshot is has a crappy spread and the spreadshot just seems better. A non issue when you get the next shot powerup and get a better weapon than both of those previous ones, but it's kind of a bummer when you do have it and think \"I would rather just have spreadshot\"\n-The parts of branches that are safe to pass through aren't clearly marked. Trial and error, I guess. There are some areas where you can pass through branches and other obstacles safely, which you'll need to because dodging gets very tight in later stages\n-Getting graded on accuracy for a bonus sucks, especially when pre-firing is such a good strategy in these types of games. Would have rather been grades on an enemies killed or \"no miss\" system\n\nOverall a really excellent game. I was going to play for like 10 minutes and played for 2 hours, if that tells you anything. \n","timestamp_created":1601751805,"timestamp_updated":1601751952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqOX29/QCe/zVpQI="}
