    review: "If you love Warhammer 40k I recommend trying this Spacehulk Deathwing\
      \ out. Its a little rough around the edges in some places and the AI teammates\
      \ aren't quite as smart as I want them to be sometimes but they're not impossible\
      \ to work around once you learn their quirks.\n\n-Game has amazing lighting\
      \ and atmosphere appropriate for the grimdark setting.\n-You really feel like\
      \ a Terminator. Some weapon feedback is wishy washy but they all do their job\n\
      -There are fun game mechanics that keep you on your toes such as locking doors\
      \ to prevent ambushes, hacking turrets and occasional weapon jams. \n-There\
      \ are 9 chapters in the game and each level is honestly pretty damn huge and\
      \ daunting\n-Outside of the campaign mode there's also a thing called \"Special\
      \ Missions\" which lets you revisit old areas and complete various mission objectives\
      \ that are different on every playthrough offering some replayability.\n\nMy\
      \ final verdict? Love the game but there's some things about it that could have\
      \ been better. I am thankful to have this title though and do enjoy it because\
      \ 40k is quite lacking in the First & Third Person Shooter department."
