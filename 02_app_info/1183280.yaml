    review: "I've played a number of CYOA games and this one was not it. It's short,\
      \ clunky, and it doesn't feel like a well written story. It feels like a decent\
      \ first draft/outline, but it's lacking in many aspects. I feel bad being so\
      \ harsh but after playing other games where I enjoyed the stats, writing, and/or\
      \ romance, this one didn't check any of the three. Try it out if this is THE\
      \ genre you're interested in, but if this is just a passing curiosity then I\
      \ recommend you keep on looking. \n\nStats: Didn't feel relevant to the game.\
      \ I'm sure they are, and this is honestly the least of my concern since I personally\
      \ would rather not worry about my stats being high enough to beat a stat check.\
      \ The problem was, it didn't feel like any of them were really reflected throughout\
      \ my play through. \n\nWriting: The plot was too fast paced for my liking. So\
      \ many things happened at once and it didn't feel like it was intentional. It\
      \ feels like something rushed that someone would later on be like 'huh? oh yeah!\
      \ I did that on purpose yeah!' when asked. It didn't feel like my character\
      \ was overwhelmed, it felt like /I/ was. The characters aren't memorable besides\
      \ how annoying the little sister is. And there's no/very little bonding happening\
      \ between anyone so it feels like I have no loyalties.  \n\nRomance: The character\
      \ genders are preset and there is only two R/Os. The two characters are on vastly\
      \ different sides and even though I'm bi it felt weird being stuck with one\
      \ option if you were straight. And again, the are on very two different teams\
      \ so your views/stances might not match up with the gender you want to romance.\
      \ Everything feels like when you pluck up two things and smoosh them together\
      \ to kiss. THIS is what disappointed me since it was advertised as a Heart's\
      \ Choice game, the romance oriented side of Choice Of Games. \n\nAll in all,\
      \ I was personally VERY disappointed. \n\nIf you want to try it out and see\
      \ for yourself, go right ahead. And if you like it more than I did then that's\
      \ great! But this was definitely not for me, and I hope the reasons I listed\
      \ helps anyone that has similar criteria."
