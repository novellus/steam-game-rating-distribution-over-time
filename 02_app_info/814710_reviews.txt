[8/10]\n\n[u]Orb Looting[/u]\n(Played in single player) I feel like this game is one of the few I dislike most, due to there being no replayability. Possibly fun with friends though. [3/10]\n\n[u]Go Farm IV[/u]\nI enjoyed this game to a certain extent, though gameplay was slow. [5/10]\n\n[u]Pooper[/u]\nA silly game with the first 4/5 tries being fun, while the rest seem tedious. [5/10]\n\n[u]Pooper Deluxe[/u]\nThe same as Pooper, though I liked the upgrades and multiplayer factor.[7/10]\n\n[u]Day Dream Adventure[/u]\nMy favourite of the 8 games due to its replayability and enjoyment in leveling up and customising your character with capes, shoes, hats, faces, swords and bows. [10/10]\n\n[u]Vermillion[/u]\nA fun game with a fair bit of replayability, and fun to experience the gradual increase of the difficulty. I liked that the character, over time, would get new special abilities when bosses were defeated. [8/10]\n\n[u]Sandwich VS Bagel[/u]\nAn okay game, with a bit of replayability. I did enjoy the boss fights and learning how to evade their certain attacks, and the eating away at the life total. [7/10]\n\nOverall personal score: 7/10","timestamp_created":1522754589,"timestamp_updated":1522754589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484907239675521851","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lOLPxeICd5qsnQE="}
