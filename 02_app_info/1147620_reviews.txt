It has simple controls and art but lacks interaction and polish. The graphical jittering makes it uncomfortable to play and the \"ending\" is frustrating. I can only recommend The Lost Dungeon of Knight as education for game design.","timestamp_created":1573232942,"timestamp_updated":1573232942,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653568267822265625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu7P/pe4Ce/TI2AE="}
