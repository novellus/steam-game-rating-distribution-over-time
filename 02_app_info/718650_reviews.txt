At the time of this review I have completed two of the four campaigns and I'm on the last mission on the third, and I don't know if I'll complete it.\n\nI'll start off by saying that there is a lot of content for a $30 game. Four campaigns with five missions each, four playable races, perfect soundtrack for the game, and in a unique world. That's more than some AAA games. There are multiple difficulties, but even on the second out of five difficulties (Brave Mage) I have to spend a minimum an hour to beat the A.I per mission. The A.I isn't hard to beat, it's just there is a very clear way to win and it takes time. For example, the reason I may not come back to complete the game is because the mission I'm on starts the player off with just a castle (home base) and very limited resources and you are expected to beat a well established enemy. It will probably take me an hour to an hour and a half to make an economy strong enough to start to beat the enemy and, then another forty minuets to an hour to actually beat the enemy. I ain't got time for that. Also, because I'm not completing the last mission I wont unlock the campaign for the last race. Four campaigns and four races, but you have to complete a campaign to move on or unlock the next one, like in Age of Mythology. So, to get to the point where you can unlock the last race you have to put in around the same amount of hours I have, maybe more.\n\nThe only reason to put in more hours than me is because you like the game play, you enjoy multiplayer, or you love the lore. I foresee the slapfest that a multiplayer game would be, so I have no interest and probably never will play one. For the lore, I have to compliment them and say they definitely put in the time to add the lore and make it more than just a few references to throughout the story, but I'm just not interested in it. Before the loading screen there is a short cutscene that will catch the player up on the current timeline, but everything else is in scripted dialogue except for a few voiced sections. So, I end up not really knowing why the campaign is taking place without having me go back and do extra research. \n\nI believe this game is still worth buying, though like everything wait for a sale. It offers unique game play, no useless microtransactions, no game breaking bugs, cool animations, and all for half the price of a AAA strategy game. Though the game does have its flaws, mostly with the A.I and missions sometimes being long and to much of a grind. I'll be interested in future games the studio makes.\n\n6.7/10","timestamp_created":1609798274,"timestamp_updated":1609798274,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvYnd5/YCcp7DwAI="}
