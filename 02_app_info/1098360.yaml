    review: "This review is for early access first release, I will update it as the\
      \ game evolves. I recommend this game to people who like to play early access\
      \ games.\n\nThe idea of the game is to find alien life forms and go kill them\
      \ with your tank. They're easy enough to find, with bright red indicators and\
      \ you shoot at them with your souped up tank and try to survive the onslaught.\
      \ Navigation works fine and the tank is fun to drive. Where the big problem\
      \ comes in is that all the shooting appears to be done automatically, my mouse\
      \ presses don't appear to have any effect. This made me think that it must be\
      \ about driving away from them while the tank autofires, so I worked to steer\
      \ clear of their pinchers and mandibles. What I figured out is that I don't\
      \ actually have to do anything at all and the tank will win the game. I just\
      \ drive into the alien area and let them attack. The guns and missiles just\
      \ kill  the bug while the tank hovers around 50% damage.\n\n\n[h1]What I like[/h1]\n\
      \n[b]Scenery & Graphics:[/b] I really like the look and feel of this universe.\
      \ Its a basic low-poly lunar style landscape that works well enough with the\
      \ game objectives.\n\n[b]Game tempo:[/b] This is a fast moving game with lost\
      \ of lights and sounds to match.\n\n[b]Heads Up Display[/b]  Overall, the HUD\
      \ is simple and easy to read, but the neat thing is the mini-map that  hovers\
      \ over your tank in the game's 3rd person view.\n\n[b]The Tank:[/b] The tank\
      \ is fun to drive. \n\n\n[h1]What I Like Less[/h1]\n\n[b]The Actual Music:[/b]\
      \ The music is a cross between techno and hard-rock with a sci-fi bend. The\
      \ tempo is good for the action that's happening on the screen,but I don't like\
      \ the metal sound as much as others may.\n\n[b]The Menu System[/b]: The main\
      \ menu works well enough, but the buttons aren't labeled, so I ended up clicking\
      \ all the buttons before I figured out how to play. \n\n[b]The Game Play[/b]:\
      \ Right now, the tank beats the aliens by itself. I'm not sure what my contribution\
      \ is, other than to drive the tank to the aliens."
