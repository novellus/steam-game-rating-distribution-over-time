It is REALLY freaking good.  The Skyrim one is very good.  The Fallout one is meh.  It's absolutely worth it's asking price and cannot reccomend.  If you see this on sale at all go ahead and pick this up.  I did not think Pinball could get intense or more fun until i played this pack!","timestamp_created":1503382019,"timestamp_updated":1503382019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u6OjhN4CfbihgwE="}
