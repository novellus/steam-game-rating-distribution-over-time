    short_description: Phaser presents a unique take on the 2D-platformer formula
      by allowing you to take control of each level. By learning the power of color-switching,
      you will be able to phase in and out challenging obstacles from your path, find
      new and creative ways to victory, and avoid otherwise certain death.
