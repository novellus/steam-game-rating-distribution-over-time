It's super simple, which i feel helps and hurts it. It's great in the way that it doesn't try to hide what it is, a simple defense game where you kill sharks with varying difficulty. But it looses points for having no menu (that i could find) and some things like the sharks being able to go through solid objects. Overall, I can recommend this game for what it is and what it costs. It definitely had fun playing it, which all that matters in the end.\n\nYou can check out the video on YT at Foolsgold","timestamp_created":1582118803,"timestamp_updated":1582118803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494646698236465454","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ446LorvACc8ek8wE="}
