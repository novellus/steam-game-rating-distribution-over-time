    developer_response: 'We understand your frustration in the lack of updates, and
      we are sorry about the long wait. It should be known, however, the the game
      itself is under an overhaul. We have been working out some kinks in a building
      system as of late and are trying our best to release v2.0.0 Christmas. Thank
      you for your review.

    review: 'So right now this is a super Alpha game with just a couple of places
      to visit (apartment, jobs and a convenience store) and you have to jump to get
      over the curbs. The camera movement is really weird (mouse moves tilt your head
      more than turning it) but the developer is pretty into it and it has some good
      potential as a 3D life simulator. Probably wont be much to speak of until Q2
      2019 but if you like voxel games and life sims it''ll probably be good someday.
      I''ll keep it instead of returning just to support the makers and will check
      back often for updates. I''m going with ''Recommended'' because I''ve seen much,
      much worse in an alpha game and good developer interest.


      EDIT: Already seems like a crappy moneygrab abandonware. No updates or posts
      since launch.'
