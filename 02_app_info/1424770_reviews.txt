[/b]\n\nI hate to leave bad reviews.  Even with games that aren't particularly fun or original, I still generally rate them favourably.  Making a game is hard work, and anyone who does should be commended, unless as is the case here, there are too many problems with the underlying systems.  And even more egregiously the developer seems to continue to release games with the same problems and does nothing to address the issues.\n\nThe game looks gorgeous, and I did enjoy looking at the magical realist worlds.  Each level has a different shader in effect which leads to some rather ethereal views and does make for some occasional breathtaking moments.\n\nUnfortunately, that's really the only good thing going for this game.  It looks pretty.\n\nThis beauty is superficial, and right from the outset my alarm bells were ringing.  The options screen is so very limited.  Audio options are three sliders for main, music and sound.  Controls are for invert Y and Sensibility (sic).  Graphics have a fairly generous range of resolutions.  That's it.\n\nAs soon as I started the game, the silence was deafening.  There is no background music in this game, besides in the opening menu screen.  I checked on the discussion thread and this is a known issue.  The developer responded to another user by essentially asking \"did you check the sliders were fully up?\"  Of course changing the sliders makes no difference, and so you must swoop around these pretty worlds without so much as a breeze blowing or the sound of your wings flapping.\n\nAt the start of each level there is an obnoxiously long \"story\" thread which cannot be skipped.  It is often nonsensical and is littered with grammatical and spelling errors.  Of course everything has to have a story these days, even Doom Eternal has a story, but really here it is unnecessary.  A brief opening line or two would suffice.  My biggest issue is that often these lines of story are describing something which is not representative of what is happening in the game.  This rather takes you out of the experience.\n\nAfter completing a level, the game throws you back to the initial stage.  There is no progression.  You must quit to the main menu, and start again.  The map screen does unlock the next level, but it does not flow through them in a natural way.  This is true of EVERY level.\n\nNone of the achievements unlock upon completion of a level, nor does completing the game unlock them.  ACHIEVEMENTS ARE BROKEN.\n\nThe actual flight mechanics are terrible.  This does not feel like flying, rather you are simply moving forward at a fixed velocity.  Diving towards the ground does not cause the bird to accelerate.  You could replace the model of the bird with anything else and it would feel as much like flying.  Someone else described it as flying a brick and I would totally agree.  We can only change direction, and even that feels stiff and unnatural.\n\nIn each level, you are tasked with finding a number of feathers.  These give off light, but regularly bleed into the background to make seeing them more of a lucky happenstance than requiring any actual skill.  You will need eagle eyes of your own.  This artificially increases the difficulty.  This is hardly surprising as the game is very short.  I completed all levels in around an hour.\n\nAlso, while I'm on the subject, why the heck are we a PARROT?  So many beautiful birds known for their grace and aerial superiority, and we are a parrot.  It feels more like an ex parrot.\n\nAnd worst of all, from reading reviews and discussions for the next two games, all of these same problems exist in those games too.  The developer releases new games without addressing issues with past games.  This is BAD PRACTICE.  \n\nIt's also worth noting, all the positive reviews seem to be from accounts with very few games or other reviews.  I'm not saying they are all from the same source or paid for reviews, but I am thinking it very loudly:\n\n\nSweet Girl says \"This game helps you relax, the flight is especially well worked out.\"  \n\n ☼Łē✖'αŘ☼  ☭  says \"I like to relax to my own music more, so I turned it off in the game (don't thank the life hack for this).\"\n\nNot Jelimazu says \"In short, an exciting and soothing game with a pleasant visual map and relaxing music..\"\n\nempira's full review reads \"Looks very bright! I haven't bought new games for a long time, but now I could not resist ... the 20% discount influenced my choice. The game captures with its atmosphere and freedom. But the game is only suitable for a short time\".\n\n\nAll of these reviews seem to be in the same vein.  They misrepresent, they fail to mention any of the problems and they all share a similar tone of voice.\n\nLike I say, I hate to leave a negative review but I could not in good conscience support this developer.  I feel a more representative review is necessary to either warn others away; or to make the developer sit up and take notice that people who have actually paid for the games are not happy with the lack of support and apparent disregard for their complaints.\n\nA real Dodo.","timestamp_created":1609638201,"timestamp_updated":1609638223,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558096408843994141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ycP64vYCc432vwI="}
