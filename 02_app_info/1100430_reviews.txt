Finishing this on 1/1 was really a great way to start off the year.\nI really enjoyed Death Mark, but there were some big problems I had with it (slow text speed, a lot of guesswork, and outcomes that are impossible to see coming without a guide), but I feel like NG addressed those issues and elevated everything else from its predecessor. The plot is really gripping and really falls together nicely in the end, the artwork is amazing, the creepy/scare factor is there and better than ever, the areas Akira and co. explore are both creepy and interesting, and the soundtrack, albeit kind of small, is excellent at setting the right mood. In particular, I really enjoyed how the characters are all so likable. I really got invested in all of them and that made me want to save them all. \nThe only issues I had with this game are in the context of replaying the story. For those unaware, there are two (technically three) different main routes in the game, but there's no chapter select, and getting to the point where the routes diverge can take about an hour of skipping dialogue and solving puzzles again. To compound this issue, there are only 4 save slots, so it's difficult to keep a bunch of save files if you're just going for specific endings/routes. Normally I save at important divergent points and reload after finishing a route, but it's pretty clear that the developers intended players to use New Game + to get to different endings. Unfortunately the only thing NG+ offers is that it carries over any CGs and character profile updates you acquired in the previous run. Having a chapter select and a downloadable soundtrack would really boost this already excellent title.\n\nAll in all, excellent game for horror visual novel fans and I would consider it a must-play.","timestamp_created":1609624337,"timestamp_updated":1609624337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4psfF4vYCdfXuvwI="}
