    review: I started the VN expecting a Pocahontas-like plot, so I was not at all
      prepared for the sudden turn of events... not going to spoil anything here,
      but this is a solid, good read to pick up if you're looking for something short
      and interesting.  I really wish there's going to be a sequel though, there were
      so many questions left unanswered even to the end. Oh and also, the soundtrack
      is amazing.
