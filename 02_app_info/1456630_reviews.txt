Most deaths past the very beginning will occur from incapacitating crits (and sometimes critical fumbles); successful strategies will revolve around mitigating risk and/or playing rocket tag with certain enemies so they can't fight back.  Unlike many other games, hit points or health is a very poor measure of character survivability - in comparison with defensive skills, armor, etc.  Control of distance, visibility, light levels, and cover are very important.  Personally, I like it; but not for everyone.\n\n* Fairly linear game world, with one optional offshoot (to my knowledge anyway, have gotten far but not completed the game).  HOWEVER there is ultimately a wide variety of terrain types within that line.  Every single game level provides a new and unique challenge (sometimes in the form of new enemy types rather than new terrain).  Cope with freezing cold areas, sweltering heat, rivers filled with deadly salamanders, crushing earthquakes, ferocious winds that batter you against razor-edged rocks, giant owls with incapacitating cries.\n\n* UI somewhat awkward and inconvenient - multiple key strokes needed to light or extinguish a torch or swap weapons around; buff spells may have a short duration and need to be manually refreshed on a frequent basis.\n\n","timestamp_created":1609843090,"timestamp_updated":1609843090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpYSI6fYCd9XUwAI="}
