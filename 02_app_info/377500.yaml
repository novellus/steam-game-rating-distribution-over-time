    review: "Prismatica is a color theory puzzle game where colors are scrambled and\
      \ you have to rotate the gears to move the colored tiles around until they are\
      \ in their appropriate places. This includes their combinations as well (example:\
      \ If a red and a yellow gear have shared tiles, those tiles will turn orange).\
      \ There are four total sections, each with a standard and challenge category\
      \ of 12 puzzles (so there are a total of 48 puzzles that are the same in both\
      \ standard mode and challenge mode). Standard mode gives you your first of three\
      \ stars for that level, and challenge mode asks you to finish the same puzzle\
      \ under a certain number of moves and under a certain amount of time to get\
      \ the other two stars. I finished the game with all puzzles at three stars in\
      \ about 11 hours. \n\nI definitely enjoyed my time with this game. I think it's\
      \ great that there is a standard and challenge mode. A nice feature they included\
      \ is that you don't have to finish both of the challenges at once to get the\
      \ other two stars. You can focus on one at a time if you would prefer, because\
      \ once you complete a task it gives you the star. This is much more preferable\
      \ to having to be conscious of the moves you are making, while still moving\
      \ as quickly as possible. When it came to the challenges, I felt there were\
      \ levels that gave you plenty of time/number of moves to complete it, but there\
      \ were also some others that felt like it didn't give quite enough wiggle room\
      \ for mistakes. I did find, however, that after moving forward in standard mode,\
      \ the challenge mode for earlier levels became easier to handle because of the\
      \ extra practice I had gotten, so I recommend continuing standard or just jumping\
      \ to a different challenge level if you are having trouble.\n\nThe game settings\
      \ are pretty simple, but this isn't really an issue because of the minimalist\
      \ nature of the game. There is a button to toggle music on and off and another\
      \ button to toggle sound effects on and off. There is also a colorblind mode\
      \ that puts symbols over the colors for clearer matching. I ended up muting\
      \ sound effects because they became a bit irritating to listen to. I kept the\
      \ music on because it had enough variation and I enjoyed its upbeat nature.\
      \ The fanfare that comes with completing a level filled me with so much joy\
      \ and satisfaction. It made working through the puzzles very rewarding.\n\n\
      I definitely recommend this game to those who are looking for a short but fun\
      \ experience that exercises your brain. I felt myself starting to understand\
      \ the required rotations necessary to move the tiles where I wanted to (In that\
      \ respect I very much see how the Rubik's Cube inspired them), and at the end\
      \ of each level I felt accomplished and pleased. Some may feel that the price\
      \ is a little high with the amount of hours played, so if that's the case go\
      \ ahead and get it on a sale, but I personally enjoyed the whole experience\
      \ enough to say it's worth the full price."
