Darker and darker still, mixing well with the still, somber cutscenes.\n\n[h1]Songs [/h1] \n1.) Aegis Defenders Main Theme - Heavy orchestral sounds with long string instrument pulls, and low wind instruments allow this song to be a very epic start to a good soundtrack. A bit of Dark Synth blends into the end as it crescendos.\n2.) Ruinhunters of Annwyn - A bit of a low tide song, feels like you're in a cave with different wooden beats that resemble drops of water coming off of stalactites.\n3.) Ruins of Sen - Orchestral sounds bring memories of Kirby and the Cave of Wonders to mind.\n4.) Temple of the Goddess Kanzeon - [spoiler] When you come across the first dead God, this song plays, and as you drain the remaining life force from it to further your fight against an evil emporer [/spoiler] This song starts wtih very sad low tones, and hums its way to the end, symbolic.\n5.) Nereis Desert - Very on point, most video games have a wind instrument that, when heard, will almost unanimously cause someone to think of \"Desert,\" 2-3 seconds, and you're like \"oh yup this is a desert level.\" I wonder why that is.\n6.) The Catacombs of Vaara - In this song, the game capitalizes on the \"tower defense,\" making use of industrial sounds, clanks, cranks, etc.\n7.) Jheon, the Capital of Indra - As the Journey leads towards the end of the conflict, we are met with secrets, and more danger, this songs crescendo introduces a sad yet upbeat tone.\n8.) Aegis Awakens, Final Battle - In the end you must fight man itself. This song sounds a lot like that of Shadow of the Colossus, or Monster Hunter World, it has moments between rounds where the song dies down, just to return with full force, as the battle of attrition begins.\n9.) Aegis Theme - When you find out who the Aegis is, this sad and intimidating song begins to make sense, the longing strings and lasting hums make sense.\n10.) Caravan - Calming music that plays in between levels, this is the song for resting, saving, and buying. Very minimalistic in the composition, an electric piano, as well as as chimes, and a regular piano make up most of this songs instruments.\n11.) Defend - Preparation song, you hear this in the first round of every level, it is orchestral, but it brings back the rhythmic industrial sounds as you build up your defenses.\n12.) Bart's Theme - Interesting theme for one of our main characters, Barts [spoiler]a hardened vet [/spoiler] allows you, the player, to feel the weighted emotions that Bart has held on to from his passed.\n13.) Clu's Theme - The wondrous composition of this space-age pop song reflects our other main characters free-spirited nature.\n14.) End Credits - A mix of Aegis Defenders Main Title and Aegis Awakens, Final Battle. Done Completely in a 16-bit Chiptune style.\n\nAll in all, I love this dang soundtrack so dang much. Very good listen, very good game in general.","timestamp_created":1608756464,"timestamp_updated":1608756464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmPHWyPYCeJ7KvAI="}
