      a few reasons. One of which was this was actually my first game that I made
      as a programmer, so I was really learning the ropes of Unity as I was going.
      Also, it''s a very weird design, and I''m now thinking the way to go forward
      with it would''ve been to make it a real time game - the Rogue-like input mechanism
      just doesn''t work all that well over huge spaces that you traverse repeatedly.

    review: 'There are some interesting ideas here, but the game doesn''t feel finished.  The
      "early access" tag is removed, so I assume the game will never be truly finished.


      For example, you can only pick up items if you''re standing on them.  But, if
      you click on them, you can ALWAYS see the "pick up" button, even if you can''t
      pick it up.'
