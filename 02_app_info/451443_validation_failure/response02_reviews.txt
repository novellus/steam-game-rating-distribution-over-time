Ever since I downloaded this DLC I have not been able to get through a single matchmaking screen. It just searches and searches and basically I paid my money just to be able to look at an intro screen.\n\nI'm so pissed off I don't even know if I want to play this game any more. Seriously not recommending it right now, at least. I previously had fun, but this is BS.\n\nI've tried verifying my game files, everything. Maybe people stopped playing and they just can't put together a match. I don't know. But this sucks.","timestamp_created":1471854664,"timestamp_updated":1471854664,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlPvX2NYCdeTQXw=="}
