In short, it was a brutal, controversial, genre-defining car combat video game. It had the blood splatters, the dystopian vehicles, the bleak locations, the offbeat humor, the industrial music, the addicting gameplay, and more. [b]Stainless Games[/b] was the company behind the madness.\n\nAfter [b]Carmageddon II[/b] in 1998, Stainless dropped off the radar. They made sporadic one-off games, and a brief stint with [b]Magic the Gathering[/b]. Eventually, they regained the Carmageddon brand. They first released a well-received mobile port of the first game. They then released [b]Carmageddon: Reincarnation[/b], the long-awaited sequel (aka revival) in the series. It was followed shortly by [b]Carmageddon: Max Damage[/b], which for the most part, was the same game but more polished and more content (and owners of Reincarnation received Max Damage for free, a plus). Sadly, the writing was on the wall for Stainless. Due to various reasons, they pawned off the Carmageddon series to [b]THQ Nordic[/b], where its days are currently spent in the ground. Stainless moved on, but, not completely.\n\n[b]ShockRods[/b] is the studio's newest project. The best description of the game is a cross between car combat and arena shooters. It is like as if someone got bored of simply driving a car, and instead, wanted to control it like a first-person shooter. That seems to be the entire premise of ShockRods, and although the handprint of Stainless remains, that is both good and bad.\n\nSince Stainless is known for their car combat, it comes as no surprise for them to revisit the genre. The vehicles resemble off-road dune buggies, to an extent. They are contraptions that is uncertain if it wants to be a vehicle or a mech; however, this all makes sense, given the two genres that Stainless has presented. They don't look completely basic, and the interesting crossbreed is something new at least, but fans looking for the unique machines of Carmageddon will be quite let down.\n\nThe other genre, first-person shooting, makes a twisted appearance. Unlike most car combat games, the method of moving and aiming is very similar to a shooter. Even though the camera is from behind the vehicle per usual (but it can be adjusted to your liking), the controls for the four-wheeled contraption is more similar to controlling a human, or a fast-paced mech. The movement is quite fluid in its approach, and this is a refreshing change for both genres; however, the downside is that if someone typically dislikes one of the two genres, then they probably won't find this combo attractive. ShockRods basically has to shoot for that gamer whom appreciates both sides of the coin.\n\nThe actual weapons in the game are more closely related to arena shooters than anything. There are revved-up miniguns, oversized shotguns, high-caliber sniper rifles acting as a “rail gun” of sorts, launchers that possibly resemble grenades, and more. The weapons are varied, and thankfully, each one has a purpose. Some of the weapons will cater to a more cautious player while others are perfect for the haphazard ones, and everything in between. Sometimes, it's a bit challenging to keep an eye on the ammo count as it isn't too prominent, but that seems to be the only major downside to an otherwise stabilized weapon lineup. \n\nAlthough the actual players' cars are detailed to the point as they were intended, the locations are even more-so detailed. They are quite solid, and even though the landscapes are generic such as a rustic factory setting or a bumpy desert setting, they fit like a puzzle piece, and are great arenas for such battles. There are no options to create or edit one's own map, and due to the small number of locations, one might feel tired of the scenery after so long. In addition, due to the game being built on the famed [b]Unreal Engine[/b], a lot of the atmospheric vibes and presentation will be familiar to a player, for better or worse.\n\nEven though the mixture is executed well enough, it is laid on a foundation of potential. The key word is “potential” since, as of this writing, it has been nearly a year since the game's final release. From the beginning, ShockRods did not have a large fan base. Various theories circulate due to that, such as the aftermath of the Carmageddon series, the previously-mentioned “both sides of the coin” appeal, the lack of reach due to the company's small indie size, and more. Despite the reasons, this is a crucial point, since ShockRods was developed as an arena-based game, and other humans over multiplayer is essential to experience the full impact of the game. Of course, there are options to play bots offline, and the AI isn't half-bad; however, it can get tiring after awhile. One small saving grace is that the community has a dedicated Discord, and if someone was persistent enough, they could easily find a match.\n\nTo summarize, ShockRods feels like a refreshing take on two very specific genres. The gameplay elements are implemented on a solid foundation; however, the foundation only allows the game to stay upright, and does not extend beyond that. Overall support and buzz around the release was low-key from the start, and the game's long-term impact suffered as a result. Still, if someone wants a quick occasional session to experience a different vision, ShockRods is worth digging up. \n\n[i]7.0/10[/i]\n\n[u]Top 3 Pros:[/u]\n\n-The movement of the vehicles resembles a first-person shooter, and creates a unique twist on the genres.\n\n-The weapons are varied, and each one has a strong yet distinguished characteristic. \n\n-Although multiplayer is the preferred option, the offline mode with bots is not a total snore.\n\n[u]Top 3 Cons:[/u]\n\n-The locations can become stale over a long period of time.\n\n-The meshing of the two genres will only cater towards specific fans.\n\n-Overall activity for the online community is limited, and has been for an extended period of time.","timestamp_created":1600920896,"timestamp_updated":1600921733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+OCX3/QCdb3XowI="}
