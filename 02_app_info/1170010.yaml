      \ war rages on, all the factions engaged in a fierce struggle to dominate Gladius\

      \ defensive weapons.<br><br><strong>Space Marines - Aquila Macro-Cannon</strong><br>Macro-cannon\
      \ Aquila Strongpoints are massive fortifications, often used as bastions in\
      \ Imperial defensive battle lines. Each consists of a munitions silo, topped\
      \ by a large turret that houses the huge macro-cannon that gives the strongpoint\
      \ its name. The munitions silo allows the Aquila Macrocannon to fire special\
      \ &quot;Quake Shells,&quot; each of which measures several Terran feet in length\
      \ and has a powerful charge that causes the shells to reach hypersonic velocity\
      \ when the Macrocannon is fired.<br><br><strong>Astra Militarum - Void Shield\
      \ Generator</strong><br>Void shields are normally localised force fields reserved\
      \ for protecting the monolithic Titans of the Adeptus Mechanicus, but static\
      \ generators can be erected to serve as an aegis for other targets of vital\
      \ import. The largest Void Shield generators can even project an invisible bubble\
      \ of power across a large area of the battlefield, sheltering both troops and\
      \ strategically vital battlefield locations by absorbing or deflecting the energy\
      \ of incoming munitions.<br> <br><strong>Chaos Space Marines - Noctilith Crown</strong><br>Noctilith\
      \ Crowns are brutal edifices raised up by the Chaos Space Marines to weaken\
      \ the very foundations of reality. Crafted from the mysterious material known\
      \ as blackstone, these vast psychic resonators thin the veil to deadly effect,\
      \ shielding your own units and damaging enemy psykers. <br> <br><strong>Necrons\
      \ - Gauss Pylon </strong><br>The mysterious Necron defence turrets, designated\
      \ as 'Pylons' by those who originally encountered them, were first recorded\
      \ on the uncharged world of WDY-272. Rising suddenly from the desert sands,\
      \ the Gauss Pylons opened fire without warning and with devastating effect,\
      \ tanks and armoured carriers burning as the crescent-shaped weapons tore through\
      \ the unsuspecting Imperial Guard column whilst resisting all return fire.<br>\
      \ <br><strong>Orks - Big Mek</strong><br>Especially talented or popular Mekboyz\
      \ will soon attract a following, lording it over a growing gang of underlings.\
      \ A Mek with this much clout is referred to as a Big Mek, and can prove indispensable\
      \ to the local Warboss with his knowledge of shokk attack guns, force field\
      \ technology, and tellyporta rigs.<br> <br><strong>Tyranids - Biovores</strong><br>A\
      \ Biovore is a squat, bloated creature -- yet no less deadly for all that. Deep\
      \ within its lumpen form, the Biovore nurtures a clutch of Spore Mines -- living\
      \ bombs that blanket the enemy in acids, poisons and shrapnel-sized pieces of\
      \ chitin. Biovores thump forward in battle, bony protrusions on their fore-limbs\
      \ anchoring themselves into the ground as they release their vile payload in\
      \ a single shuddering spasm."
