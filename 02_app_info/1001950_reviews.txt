Gameplay feels really fetchquesty at times, and quest markers are not obvious. Plus, sidequests don't even have markers at all, causing me to get lost at times when trying to not only do the sidequest, but also returning to the quest giver so I could finish. Also I know the game's in Early Access still, but the game still feels very buggy in places that shouldn't be buggy, like the tutorial which I had to skip since it didn't detect me doing the tutorial. I was interested in this game, but came out pretty disappointed with the product I got. Maybe a future patch can fix these issues, but right now, I'm no longer interested","timestamp_created":1609170766,"timestamp_updated":1609170766,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwi6mD1fYCffWRvgI="}
