    review: 'Definitely +1 for the cover art :)

      Gameplay is quite generic and mediocre RPG maker (or alike) game. But no complaints
      there, as creating party, leveling up, battles and the story was all well connected.

      Common, devs never tried to sell this as AAA or AA project, look at the price
      ... hence IMO, it well worth the money.

      Just set your expectations right and you will have your portion of fun.'
