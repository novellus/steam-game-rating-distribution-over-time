Some worked every time and could be cast quickly while others you'd do the same gesture three times and get three different spells. \n\nHopefully this was a first time project and lessons were learned for the next one. \n\nKudos for releasing a finished if unpolished product instead of leaving it to rot in the endless pit of abandoned early access.","timestamp_created":1567942392,"timestamp_updated":1567942392,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541641712188720703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjMepiO0Cd+vv0QE="}
