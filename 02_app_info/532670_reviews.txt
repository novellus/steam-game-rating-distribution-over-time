It has some serious glitches that seem to be related the disappearance of the sfx after even brief playing periods. There was already another reviewer here that pointed out a glitch preventing the opening of walls and passages. (Edit note) I am in contact with the game developer and they are attempting to resolve this nasty game breaking issue now. Once the bug/s are squashed I will likely be revising my review and even reversing my recommendation. My only cause for a downvote is the fact that the game is unplayable in this present state. I can't even get it to progress far enough to find the first save point which would be enough to frustrate any player, especially when you can see the means of progression but you can't progress further due to the glitches.\n\nFrom what little I was able to play in between the glitches, it would seem to remind me of a Zelda-esqe title. However, it took several restarts to get to the second area where there were npcs to talk to. Then when I went a little further I hit another game stopping glitch where I couldn't progress into the passage because some key background processes are failing and it prevents the game from opening up to the next area. There are no saves yet so it's a crap shoot where you start up and pray that you make it through all of this and to the first save point. If the game just offered an ability to save anywhere I might be able to force my way through by playing until it glitches while saving frequently. Then closing the game and relaunching it to continue. But that's not an option. \n\nWhat perplexes me even more is the one review that had a lot of details on it. It's actually the reason I was willing to give the game a try. But I don't see how they could have played through this game without experiencing the sound effect glitch where all sfx from combat just stop working or the glitch that prevents you from opening passages right from the very beginning of the game.  Unless they played an earlier build that wasn't glitched that is. But the version you get as of now is unplayable. I've restarted the game about 20 times now and only made it through the  wall with the sword in two of those plays now. At first I though the sfx glitch was related to whatever was going wrong but it apparently is just something else that went wrong.","timestamp_created":1490400906,"timestamp_updated":1490523536,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586776852607727051","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqIeIhdsCfuSVdQ=="}
