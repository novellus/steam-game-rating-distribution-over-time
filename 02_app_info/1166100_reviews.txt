However, this game was just so dull to me. I thought this was actually an arm swinger locomotion type game. Instead, you have full locomotion with snap turning. I normally like full locomotion, but in this type of game, I think you need an arm-swinger to bring some immersion to the challenge.\n\nThe graphics are basic and so is the gameplay. The music is pretty bad. I did the first few levels and was just bored playing this game. It does get more difficult the further you get, but it's just such an ugly, clunky game that it's difficult to get motivated to continue playing. \n\nI played for as long as I could. I had to tap out. This is a .99 cents mobile VR quality game at best. \n\n[b]Rate 3.5/10.[/b]","timestamp_created":1576895303,"timestamp_updated":1576897802,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612178027629852295","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8d2bk+8CfdjX5QE="}
