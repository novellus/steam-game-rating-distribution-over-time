I think its overpriced for what it currently includes. The model quality is decent enough and even the texturing is ok (clean/new). It would have been nice if it included some alternative textures (used or worn/bloody). Also, this set has some odd choices of individual models (like door handles being separate from the doors or the single standing curtain,  IDK just kind of odd really, though I do wish the reception sign was its own entity). Its not bad overall but its not great either. I don't feel as bad about this purchase as I did about the construction site one. but still overall I just don't think its a good value for your money. Look at the antiques in the attic for a much better lot of models.","timestamp_created":1560547541,"timestamp_updated":1560547541,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gLj4q+sCc9C1wwE="}
