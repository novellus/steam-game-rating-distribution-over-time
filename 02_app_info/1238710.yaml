    review: "You are the white rabbit working for the queen of hearts. There is a\
      \ 4 day submit with the other kings and queens from the other countries in wonderland\
      \ to decide how they will govern between war, magic, trade and borders. For\
      \ the 4 days you're there it's your job to schedule the activities between the\
      \ kings, queens and their daughters/sons/advisors. \n\nQuite an interesting\
      \ game, I'd say. Basically, you will unlock mini plots and stories between the\
      \ characters depending on who you pair off with who. Re-playability is a given.\
      \ It's highly advisable to play it many many times to get all of the plots and\
      \ it will involve a lot of trial and error for a lot of the acheivements without\
      \ a guide. Luckily for you, 1 complete playthrough is quite short so you wont\
      \ have to worry.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Well, I liked it, it was interesting.\
      \ It had many mini sub plots that slowly told us each person's story there,\
      \ it doesn't allow you to grow very attached to the characters but all characters\
      \ are quite interesting in their own right. Mind you, expect lots of playing\
      \ again and again to get everything, even with a walkthrough. It might not be\
      \ for everyone but try it out if you can."
