      complete freedom on how to tackle missions. Engage in our 15 hand-built campaign

      money to buy new gear, hire new agents and upgrade your base for more passive
      bonuses. Collect Prototype items from within missions to build extra powerful
      weapons and gadgets.<br><br>Defend your base from enemy attacks by building
      turrets, barbed wire fences, places to take cover, and by sending agents to
      repel enemy attack as they occur.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/712650/extras/features_bar(1).png?t=1557971409"
