    review: '[h1]Not a fan of the puzzles, but necessary for 100% achievements[/h1]


      I don''t mind the soundtrack, has a few ambient tracks I really like. I''m only
      a little miffed about the lack of the credits music, but I''m sure I can pick
      it up off the internet somewhere.


      The gameplay of this DLC is just straight electrical diagram building, in a
      similar vein to the ones in the original game. You have diagrams to build, but
      there''s a twist - you build it with whatever you are given, a bit like IKEA
      except you''re always able to finish it.


      One annoying thing you''ll find is a lot of the HUD tends to get in the way
      of the board, and rotating older placed parts is sometimes a chore as you''ll
      probably first put your current tile on it instead so you''ll have to go back
      and re-select the older tile again before you can rotate it... ugh. They could
      have added a few puzzles on a larger grid too, or allowed it to zoom out.


      Anyway, if you''re a completionist this''ll be a breeze - if you get stuck you
      can just look up the solution. But to get your value for money I suggest sticking
      at it. Either that or get it when it''s discounted.'
