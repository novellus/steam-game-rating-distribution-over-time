That being said, it's a nice idea and once this is finished and polished up I think it will be a great little hotseat, multiplayer party game.\nSo, I've said I don't recommend this game for now (and certainly don't get it if you expect a completed game), but really this is a neutral review.\n\nHere are the bugs I noticed, the first being the most problematic:\n1) The last player (tried in 2 player and 3 player) always plays two extra games, that they clearly aren't supposed to play. Then when the final scores come up the last player gets points and the other players get 0.\n\n2) In the bull fight and the shopping game the bonus scores don't seem to be working properly (always display as 0)\n\n3) There's sometimes a graphical glitch with the arrows in the archery game\n\nAs for the games themselves, there's a nice selection, some of which seem quite original. The ice cream game and the hole in the wall game were my favourites. Though with hole in the wall, some poses were too high. I think the devs need to add height calibration for each individual player for this to work. Least favourite games are probably the bull fight, which is just a bit boring (plus the bull sometimes inexplicably goes for you right at the end), and the game where you punch the blocks. Some of the combinations are impossible to get and because it isn't in time to music (as Soundboxing/Audioshield are) it isn't all that enjoyable.\n\nAnyway, these are my first thoughts and I'll update as the game is updated.","timestamp_created":1525814715,"timestamp_updated":1525814715,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472440958023071289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4p5zpoOMCfYj4nwE="}
