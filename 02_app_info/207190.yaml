    review: 'Fireburst is basically just Motorstorm with boost takedown mechanics,
      but with terrible physics and really cheesy, stereotypical (also unmemorable)
      characters.


      There isn''t really much to say, you have multiple kinds of boost systems that
      can take down other cars with different ways, and you blow up if you boost too
      much.

      There are barrels around the track; blue for water barrels which cool down your
      car, and red ones that heat it up and can cause your car to blow.


      The game is super easy and can be completed 100% under 4 hours.

      I kinda like the track design in this game, I really think there was thought
      put behind that aspect of the game.

      But the physics just hold it back waaay too much.'
