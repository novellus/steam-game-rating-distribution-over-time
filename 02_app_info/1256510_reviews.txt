While the core gameplay looks fun and promising, the game engine is so disfunctional that I sometimes cant even be sure if I play the game wrong or stuff is broken.\n\n- Turrets ignore enemies: So far it is a coin flip if a turret needs a moment to recognize that an enemy is in range, fires directly or never fires at all. 90% of all my buildings lost were turrets that were not defending themselves. Ignoring all other issues this alone completly breaks the game\n- ressource management: the game feels like either ressource spots should be infinite or wood should be regrowable. I constantly ran out of wood and sometimes rarely out of minerals, but I always hat a ton of the 3 magical ressources.\n- the whole expansion and caravan system: There is no way I see a future were this system is salvagable. It is only there to annoy and confuse the player, make the economy even more confusing. Why do buildings get more expensive the further they are away from the base? Why? We are already prevented from expanding too aggressivly because buildings have to be connected to work properly. I lost 2 games until I understood why I constantly ran out of ressources.\n- I lost 2 games by running out of wood before reaching a second forest\n- Massive memory leak: I started the round with 120 fps and ragequitted when I went under 5 fps after 2h\n- my HQ took randomly damage without any enemies in range and having turrets all around it in case an enemy had clipped into the textures. at 700 HP it stopped taking damage\n- ressource leak: in mid game I mysteriously started losing ressources. I had a ton of mines and woodcutters but my wood and minerals were constantly 0 and I couldnt figure out why.\n- sometimes buildings never get build\n- units feel worthless, especially melee units since their survivability is like a snowflake in hell and they cost more than a standard tower that has way more health and damage","timestamp_created":1607283196,"timestamp_updated":1607283196,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550172984600067139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwhujinPYCeujptwI="}
