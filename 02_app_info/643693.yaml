    about_the_game: "Take your simulation to the next level with these gorgeous Low\
      \ Window Corridor Coaches! Built from 1926 to 1929 under the direction of Southern\
      \ CME Richard Maunsell, these classical carriages were built to replace much\
      \ of the wooden bodied pre-grouping stock Southern inherited from its constituents.\
      \ The new carriages were based upon the former LSWR &quot;Ironclad&quot; carriage\
      \ designs, and comprised First and Third Class compartments, each of which contained\
      \ a corridor and doors for each compartment, enabling quick egress on commuter\
      \ services.<br><br>The Southern usually ran their carriages in defined sets,\
      \ though many individual carriages were classified as &quot;Loose&quot; and\
      \ could be added to trains when required, this was the case with many BCK's\
      \ and TK's. It was common practise to combine sets to make longer trains in\
      \ busy periods.<br><br>The Maunsell's would be seen over all the Southern network\
      \ on suitable tracks. On trains to the west of England it was common practice\
      \ to place a number of BCK's at the end of a consist. These where dropped off\
      \ at station with branches when the train stopped, and formed the branch trains,\
      \ sometimes with a TK. Sadly, withdrawals started in 1960 with the last of the\

    review: Fantastic model, being anticipating the arrival of these since seeing
      the production diaries on MatrixTrains' Facebook, both these and the Crimson/Cream
      ones are highly reccomended if you have the S&D... both are beautiful inside
      and out and they look smashing trundling up and down the Mendips behind 9F's,
      Light Pacifics, 4F's and all manner of S&D motive power in general... well worth
      the money for such a product...
