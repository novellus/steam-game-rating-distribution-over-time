However, there're two issues I'm so disappoint.\nFirst, DX ver. almost same as original ver., except for 2P system and colorized.\nSecond, the secret items hide in somewhere without ANY HINT! How could dev. do it in an RPG?\nThat's why only few players unlock collector achievements. I spend over 10hr for searching and still something did't get.\nI won't recommended this game until someone tell me where're secret items hide.","timestamp_created":1601899813,"timestamp_updated":1601899813,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.450819671154022217","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iOuq/PQCdYGCpgI="}
