    review: "Delta Squad has nearly been out for a year now and I stumbled upon it\
      \ while browsing the store pages for smaller games. I was visually attracted\
      \ to the art style for a top down shooter and thought this was a game I could\
      \ get my friends into after giving it a quick play through.\n\nArt, Lighting\
      \ & Rendering 5/5\nLoved the appeal of the modeling, colors and textures.\n\n\
      Animation & FX 5/5\n\nMusic & Sound 5/5\nI loved all the sounds the guns made,\
      \ when they hit their targets or the environment nearby. I don't know why but\
      \ I enjoyed shooting the lamp post just to hear that ping sound. Voice overs\
      \ took me back to the arcade days. \n\nGameplay & Controls 3/5\nThis is where\
      \ I feel the the game could improve for a solid top down shooter (I played with\
      \ a keyboard and mouse).\nI felt the speed of the game to be a bit slow. Most\
      \ top down shooters have faster paced movements. It took me forever to get around\
      \ the map looking for the coins as part of the first side mission.\n\nControls\
      \ are limited, LMB to shoot, RMB for a grenade, R to reload and Spacebar to\
      \ roll. I enjoyed the simplicity but everything felt slow.\n\nMenus 2/5\nMenus\
      \ where hard to navigate and seemed rather oddly keyed compared to most games.\
      \ When I did click on a Menu button it didn't always work, especially when I\
      \ died and wanted to restart the 1st Mission. This is where the game loses points.\
      \ Upon restarting the first mission, I SPAWNED out of bounds! I had to quit\
      \ the game entirely to replay the 1st Level.\n\nThis game seems rather polished\
      \ at first glance but there are some tweaks to make the game smoother, more\
      \ enjoyable and playable after running out of respawns. I would recommend this\
      \ game but these issues are critical to a fun and successful game. If there\
      \ is an update and the menus / respawn is fixed so I can continue playing, I\
      \ would recommend it but for now, it is what it is."
