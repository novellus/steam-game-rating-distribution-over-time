The camera is correctly positioned over the seat, so this isn't so much a fault of the modelling as the fact you can't move your head around in the game without a head tracking peripheral.\n\n+ Lots of configurations! For your money you're getting what DTG would split into multiple different loco addons (or, more likely, they simply wouldn't model the variants ever).
