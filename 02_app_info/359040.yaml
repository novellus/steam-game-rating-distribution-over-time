      with her old friend Quintin. He's a ghost now, and he's puppeting her body with
      the intent of finding a satisfactory way of killing her. This dubious quest
      has led them to a mysterious abandoned island, where several people were recently
      murdered.  And where, among the rotting cabins and dense trees, a strange new
      building hides a bizarre secret...<br><i><br>&quot;He met a man an eyeless man
      a toothless man and he looked at the man and the man looked at him and he saw

      long since you've tasted bone marrow' and he told him he told him truthfully
      and the man said 'come' and he came with the man and they vomited pure cold

    review: The Music Machine is a beautiful game; foreboding in its grandiosity at
      points. The visuals are beautiful and the gameplay simple but rewarding. The
      only issue i can find is that it is badly written. Not the whole game, mind
      you, just the dialogue between the two main characters. They have no chemistry,
      they are stiff and wooden. The other character you meet, and even the notes
      you find on the ground, flow better than the dialogue between the two main characters.
      This is a small complain though. The game as a whole is beautiful, haunting,
      thought-provoking, and overall worth your time.
