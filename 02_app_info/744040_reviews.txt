On a whim I decided to revisit it, and all I gotta say is, I’m really disappointed. When I last played this, I felt that the concept was cool but it was lacking in content, and just needed something more; according to the discussions, I’m not the only one that felt that way.\n\nOther than some bugfixes according to the patchnotes (although OneWay’s AI is just broken), version 0.6.7275.31597 (which is the current version as of me writing this) has two new maps and SLIGHTLY different car handling. Nothing else, no alternate game modes, no new cars, no career mode, nothing. Just quick play with bots, other people on the same screen, or literally no one online. My problem with that is, Street Heat feels nothing more than a proof of concept that you get bored with after maybe an hour tops. At least grinding the car unlocks & achievements only takes three total at most.\n\nI literally searched out of curiosity, and [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/262690/Little_Racers_STREET/]Little Racers STREET[/url] is 2 bucks less than this game and will last you way longer; also, that game was actually finished before the developers stopped updating it. Just buy that game instead.","timestamp_created":1599281918,"timestamp_updated":1599540727,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zdGDtvQCdKrwnwI="}
