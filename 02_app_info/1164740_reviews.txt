That's going to introduce a bit of bias/wilingness to forgive it for smaller things, but I'm fairly confident in saying it's a pretty good experience aside from that. The poor gay part of my heart loved it - but it's not without significant flaws, primarily in how it's written, and too a lesser extent the audio experience.\n\nSo, it starts out with a route selection - which caught me as odd from my experience of VNs. Instead of throwing you in and letting your paths branch from one, you can choose to pursue specifically two routes, or go at it in the traditional sense. This, I sort of appreciated as someone that doesn't play many VNs, and is rarely inclined to go through walkthroughs. This meant I was pretty easily able to play through the main routes the game wanted to show me, then go through on my own and see what else it had to offer - which felt like a really good way to experience it. This does lock you in to certain choices with no flexibility if you choose one of those paths it seems, but the more hand-held experience to get to know one of the characters in a focused way before letting me loose was good for someone like me who barely plays VNs. If that's not to your taste, you can select the \"choose your path\" sort of option by default, though the main two paths it wants you to take get much more screenspace.\n\nFrom there, we'll touch on the art and the characters - the art makes heavy use of distinctive line and blocked shadowing which gave it a rather distinctive look compared to a sea of fairly samey looking VNs (and a whole lot of WLW VNs that seem targeted at men, which is kind of why I don't play many. A bit of bias, and a lack of willingness to dig through such. This is not that, however - it pulls on the strings of my sapphic leanings very nicely. The game is for gay gals and not for fetishistic, leering men and I appreciate that) and is incredibly welcome. The character designs too - each one feels interesting and unique, and I enjoyed getting to know each character introduced. Nim'gann got my poor heart the most.\n\nAs an aside, black/odd-coloured sclera in character designs is one of my favourite things to see, and this game agrees with me. I appreciate that.\n\nThe writing and dialogue however, is a little mixed compared. Whilst the plotlines are interesting, and the characters are lovely - the prose it uses for both dialogue and description is a little stilted and odd. Not enough that it'll take you out of the experience, but enough that it gives an odd... tang? to reading it. It feels as if the writers wanted to give the characters a sense of not being native speakers, where instead it ends up feeling like it's all written by a non native speaker. This does lead to an strange feel of otherness when reading it, adding to that feeling of dipping into an unfamiliar culture, but still. An odd lack of contractions leads to a very formal prose, while the main character/POV character is written to have rather informal and colloquial speech -  it's very at odds, and at times made me pause and give it another read. For some characters, the stilted dialogue fits how I might imagine the way they describe them to speak - and often times it gives a 'lost in translation' feeling where an expression they use sounds odd to read, but fits the vibe it feels they want the characters and world to have - but for our character, Roo, with her flirtatious speech and informal chatter, it does take me out of the experience at times.\n\nMind - this is not me saying it's badly written! It's an enjoyable read, the descriptions are nice and vibrant and they take good time to flesh out small world features and facts that you might be curious, and a lesser writer would tend to drop and leave without expansion. The characters have their own biases, preconceptions and views on the world, and you can tell how that colours their perceptions and dialogue - and it makes for an interesting read. Occasionally it can be a touch blunt with bits of interest, or slightly long winded, but it's much more preferable to having them skip such entirely.\n\nAudio on the other hand, is at best, servicable, and at worst could detract and wear on me. Sound effects looping in odd, stilted ways that grate were common, and the music, at best, tended to be servicable and inoffensive. Music or sound effects will also be faded/paused to nothingness at odd timings for single lines, before continuing, in a way that if intentional, feels ill targeted. Very often, audio would abruptly stop and loop in an interrupted way that was very noticable. Audio very clearly wasn't their focus, and the experience does suffer for it. I ended up turning off the music and turning down the sounds to a very low volume, and playing my own music.\n\nAll of this combined, would usually lead to me giving a positive but flawed review - but, if, like me, you become a useless piece of gay mush when it comes to a certain type, you really cant go wrong with it. There's not much that caters to the specific buff lesbian orcs with clearly sapphic tones, let alone being as well built as the orcs it portrays, and this does a pretty bang-up job of it. Hopefully I'll find the time to get through every route, because I very much want to, even if I'm asexual leaning and the main characters occasional overt horniness gets an eyebrow raise.","timestamp_created":1609029957,"timestamp_updated":1609029975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vZ/q0PYCd87JvQI="}
