    about_the_game: "Holy violence?! That\u2019s how Jamshid Farrokhi, a crystal meth\
      \ addict, is thinking. After using this narcotic industrial chemical, he ruthlessly\
      \ kills his whole family - his wife, 12-year-old daughter and newborn son \u2013\
      \ out of severe hallucination. It was only after he sobers up that he realizes\
      \ what a disaster he has brought to himself. So, he decides to avenge those\
      \ who were responsible for his decadence and for turning him into a human less\
      \ worthy than an animal. Thus began the murders and the unimaginable violence!\
      \ The recorded films during the murders and the heartbreaking confessions by\
      \ the victims shock everyone and cause turbulence in the society. Faramarz Afshar,\
      \ a 32-year-old detective, is assigned to investigate this case; a case which\
      \ can seemingly be regarded as the most difficult challenge in his life. In\
      \ \u201CMurder in Tehran Alleys 2\u201D you experience the encounter between\
      \ Faramarz and Jamshid Farrokhi in a clash of violence, reason, and the Great\
      \ Sins (religion) with a taste of serial killing stories. \u201CMurder in Tehran\
      \ Alleys 2\u201D is a tribute to David Fincher\u2019s \u201CSe7en\u201D"
