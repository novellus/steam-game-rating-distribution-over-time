    about_the_game: '<strong>Ventura Inc</strong> is an economic simulation in a consistent
      multiplayer world. (MMO)<br>As a player you''ll be running a company, signing
      contracts with other players involving the exchange of goods and services.<br>In
      this simulation, you are, just like in the real world, doing business with other
      player companies to make your profit. <br>It is possible to choose who you deal
      with and who''s pricing you''ll try to undercut. There are different business
      branches available from where you can make your money:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Oil
      Refinery<br></li><li>Transportation<br></li><li>Storage<br></li><li>Farming<br></li><li>Banking<br></li><li>Power
      Plants<br></li><li>...</li></ul>Key to avoiding bankruptcy is making sure you
      run your business more cheaply than that of your opponents. (Signing better
      deals)<br>Most of the branches need other branches to function. As an example:
      to generate power you have to rely on storage as well as oil transported to
      your power plant. Someone will also need to build your power plant for you (someone
      with a construction branch).<br><br><strong>Ventura Inc</strong> wants to bring
      you a game in wich you can play with your friends , work in team, communicate,
      trade and get rich.'
