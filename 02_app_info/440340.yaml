    review: 'Wow.

      The story was really tough and the controls were very simple at the beginning,
      but that also increased dramatically in the later course of the game.

      After playing through it, I still have an oppressive feeling that I only know
      from Half Life or good anime when you can''t wait to watch the sequel.'
