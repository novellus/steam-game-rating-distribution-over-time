    review: 'It is about time I get this year''s character pass. Funny that I did
      not notice ever since, the lack of presence of these newest additions of characters
      of the game. Since, I got them anyway as CPU adversaries and, arcade mode bosses
      to their respective retro-editions of Street-Fighter games.


      Really enhances the game play experiences and, forces you to improvise to each
      of these awkwardly new and, re-brought back from a deep past like bosses(Gill
      and Sagat).


      My satisfaction to this game is completed. Only Ultra Street-Fighter IV is to
      be considered as a throw back title to revisit and enjoy. ;)
