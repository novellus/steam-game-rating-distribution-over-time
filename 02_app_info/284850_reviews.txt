If you like this type of game, then you definitely won't be disappointed. There is a wide variety of different puzzles to solve as well as mystery objects to find (not related to the story). The story is captivating and detailed and the game has very pretty graphics and nice sound effects. You get a map for fast travel to known locations, so you can concentrate fully on the tasks at hand. It definitely feels like something one will want to play again at some point.\nI'm also very impressed with the difficulty level: it is challenging enough for an adult to be entertaining, but it should also be solvable by an inquisitive child, so it's something that can be played with the family. The story is a little dark, but no more than any traditional fairytale.","timestamp_created":1609797646,"timestamp_updated":1609797646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw69ba5/YCd/bCwAI="}
