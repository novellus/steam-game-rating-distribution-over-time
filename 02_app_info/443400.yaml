    about_the_game: <strong>This DLC contains no extra in game material</strong>.
      Instead you get an art book with over 60 pages of concepts and illustrations
      that we have created during the making of <i>Medusa's Labyrinth</i>. Buying
      this DLC is also a way of supporting us, which would be very much appreciated
      and also sends a signal to publishers that people are willing to pay for this
      kind of game. Who knows? Maybe your contribution will help tip the scales in
      our favor.
