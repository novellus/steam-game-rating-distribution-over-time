      /><br>You''re a law-abiding citizen and he has never dreamed of becoming a legendary
      hacker, but the circumstances forced you to step onto this slippery slope.<br><br>Welcome
      to the society where electronic social rating plays a great role in the life
      of each citizen. It changes due to the person''s actions and affects his/her
      rights and liberties. Citizens with higher rating have more benefits, and zero
      rating means forced liquidation of the person.<br><br>Because of a technical
      error you have received a rating that was even below zero: -0.01. Theoretically,
      this is simply impossible, and now you &quot;do not exist&quot;: electronic
      devices do not identify you, officials and public services refuse to deal with
      you because of a system error. Now you can''t even buy food or pay for treatment.<br><img

      /><br>Trying to obtain justice is useless, and the only way out is to hack the
      government server where the rating base of citizens is stored and edit the data
      on it. It''s very difficult because the server is controlled by a quantum computer,
      and huge processing power is needed to overcome the quantum encryption. Your
      home computer is definitely unable to do this, so you need something more powerful.<br><img
