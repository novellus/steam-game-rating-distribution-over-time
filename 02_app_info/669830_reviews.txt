The classic Hyperspace mechanic has been polished into something truly wonderful here. Also, in the original, you had to press a button for each attack shot and had a limit to that repetition before it would skip shooting a bit before continuing which created a unwelcome break in the steady repeatitive shooting. AM polished that, and you can fire repeatatively without a skipping a shot. Pure Awesome.\n\nThe Music, Sound Effects and Graphics are awesome. \n\nI Hot-Keyed the game as follows:\nMOVEMENT = WASD Keys\nFIRE LASERS = UP Arrow\nHYPERSPACE = Spacebar\n\nASTEROIDS CLASSIC is fantastic fun for what it is! MODERN is fun as well, but I prefer CLASSIC.","timestamp_created":1581483307,"timestamp_updated":1608805365,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40LaRyvYCdJze8QE="}
