This provided some respite from the main game. There are only 20 levels, so the difficulty doesn't ramp up quite as high as over the 50 levels of the main game; this is nice if--like me--you lack the mental fortitude to get 5 (or even 4) stars on some of the [b]positively arduous[/b] management puzzles in the original 50 levels.\n\nI was able to get 5 stars on every level, save for the one where pausing the game voided the fifth star--I just couldn't do it quickly enough, if I didn't pause.","timestamp_created":1605230457,"timestamp_updated":1605230457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ip7M3/UCdp2ErgI="}
