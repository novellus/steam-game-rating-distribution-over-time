    review: 'This game felt a little shorter than the first two, but was still very
      good.  The option to choose a male or female voice, or neither, for your character
      is an example of the game''s quality.  The voice acting isn''t perfect, but
      it''s good by HOPA standards. In this third chapter of the League of Light series,
      the focus turns to problems within the League itself.  In the main chapter,
      you are tasked with finding and retrieving a colleague who has stolen an important
      artifact - and she happens to be the League Master''s daughter.  In the bonus
      chapter you must hunt down a spy within the League''s own building.


      [b]Overall:[/b] Get the whole series, especially if you enjoy a fantasy or quasi-fantasy
      setting. These are well designed and nicely drawn HOPA games.  I was sorry to
      discover that Steam only has the first three in the series (the third game indicates
      there is a sequel).  These games aren''t especially innovative, but they''re
      enjoyable.


      Pros:

      - lovely art and reasonable voice acting

      - good variety or both HO scenes and puzzles (mostly easy/medium, a few challenging)

      - collectables

      - reasonable in-game achievements

      - coherent story that feels at least somewhat connected to prior games

      - good world-building for a HOPA game

      - customizable difficulty level

      - fully interactive map


      Cons:

      - music is inconsistent (as with the first two games, it tends to play for short
      periods at a time)

      - minimal reuse of helpful items (i.e., "why can''t I keep that knife?!")


      Good luck, Detective!'
