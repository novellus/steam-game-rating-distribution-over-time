    review: It's okay, if there was a neutral button I'd give it that. You get a generic
      fetch quest that has you travel around killing four mini boss and then facing
      off with the boss to gain a new puppet, no character interactions or anything
      so not too memorable otherwise. I'd get it on sale only.
