      action game released in 1992 by Masaya in Japan, and renamed Cybernator and
      released in 1993 elsewhere.<br>In the original, the player took control of the
      titular assault suit, a tank on legs, and used various weapons such as missiles,
      laser and punches to defeat enemies through a variety of stages.<br>Assault
      Suit Leynos shares the same setting as Valken.'
