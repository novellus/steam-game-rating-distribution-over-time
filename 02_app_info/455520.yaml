    review: 'Ok fun fact time, one these are not meant to be used by the defualt rpg
      maker system these are best used for paralax maping it says so in descriptiong.
      This is why you make the map in photo shop, and load it up in game and use plugins
      to define where you can and can''t walk among other things. This means it does
      take a bit of skill, and more diffcult then normal tilesets to use.


      Also all these medieval sets are ripped straight from daz 3d store assets. Meaning
      it makes it very easy to use if you use daz 3d at all for CG. Like I got annoyed
      when I first saw all the stuff on here is from daz, then realized how much of
      a pain it would been to get the right angles, and render each one at the right
      pixel counts to make it myself and went meh this was worth buying on sale in
      a bundle to save me hours upon hours of work for slightly worse results lol.


      Just wish he/she did more daz 3d asset conversions to rpgmaker, would be nice
      to see a scifi pack or something down road, but I kind of get it these resource
      packs not exactly cheap on 3d daz store, and I hope they got all the licenses
      before they made these :P'
