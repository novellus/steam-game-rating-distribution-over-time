The reason for that is that this game is a timing puzzler with unsuitable controls. \n\nThe general idea is nice: you need to get colored runes to the same colored altars, except for tutorial dude, each elemental can only carry its own runes, and there are specific things only they can do, and they can be combined to combine their abilities. That should make for interesting puzzles, except they're timed, your guys never stop moving (why not?), and the camera and controls mean it's very hard to translate intent into the game world.\n\nNow with the same basic mechanics, this could just as easily have been a puzzle where you draw some paths in advance, including possibly some wait times, and thenset it in motion like a machine. But instead, like Charlie Chaplin in modern times, I need to struggle to keep  up with the \"machine\" that I want to see solve the level. Very annoying.\n\nIf you like timing puzzle games, this is a game you might want to try. If you like the puzzling without someone running and falling off a cliff while you try to figure out what's going on, get something else.","timestamp_created":1421211175,"timestamp_updated":1421211175,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.675236880779266357","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hbGy88oCfr2pNQ=="}
