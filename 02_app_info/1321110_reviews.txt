Well worth the money in my opinion.  There were several bugs on release but the dev worked directly with me over email and fixed them within a day or two.  Super responsive and willing to help a gamer he had never met to get his game working as it should.  More devs should be like that.\nThat said, be aware that this is the same game as SquaresStory just with graphics and a couple QOL changes.  It is a reskin and rerelease by the developer.  Don't buy both and expect different games like I did.  \nIf you like simple games that make you think about your next move this is definitely for you.  It rewards thinking ahead and planning.  Be warned it might take a few tries to win if you don't do the math as you go.  \nTotal play time is probably around 5 hours the first full playthrough.  Your mileage may vary.  \nReplayability is pretty low but a few hours of entertainment for less than the price to rent a movie is well worth it IMO.","timestamp_created":1590606897,"timestamp_updated":1590764240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyP+7sPICcKHVigI="}
