My opinion hasn't changed much, though!\n\nViridi is simply a game about.. plants. You plant them, water them whenever they need it, you can sing to them, and you can look at them. There's even an option to name them! Every week you can get a random new plant for free! It's not so much a game as it is just having some virtual plants. They can die and grow and flower like real ones; they're just on a screen. So hey, if you want to take care of some plants but for whatever reason can't have real ones, Viridi is probably for you!\n\nThe soundtrack is very soothing, and I love to listen to it whenever I'm reading or writing something. Makes for very good background noise if you don't want silence, and it's not distracting either. Letting the game sit open to let me sing to the plants with the music playing quietly in the background is a pleasant experience, to say the least.\n\nOverall, I would very much recommend Viridi! If you're looking for a game that gives you something to do, then maybe you wouldn't enjoy it - once again, it's mostly just virtual plants and you can't do much other than stare at them - but the graphics paired with the soundtrack makes for a nice few minutes whenever I check on my pot of plants every morning.\n\nOh also, you have a snail! I named mine Mint. I accidentally chucked her into the garden once. Sorry, Mint.","timestamp_created":1485895125,"timestamp_updated":1606661470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw846fivYCd/H7cA=="}
