But surely the developer would only release a game that is playable, right? Well, that's debatable here.\n\nThe game is as exciting as the first one, if not more. We are given a much bigger world, and with that comes more freedom, more discoveries, more dialogues, more mysteries... The thing is, it's harder than ever to find a way to the objectives on the map. There is just no obvious way to get where I need to get. On top of that, I might get distracted when I find secondary objectives. On paper, they're great and exciting, until I realise I can't quite figure out how to complete them either.\n\nWhen you combine that with the bugs and quirks and the fact you can't save at any time, anywhere, you are left with a frustrating experience. You see, I don't feel like I'm ever guided in the right, or one of the right directions. Maybe there has been a bug and I'm not supposed to be here. Or I've accessed an area which I was clearly not supposed to access given how utterly empty it looks. On top of that, when I explore vents or pipes, I can get killed very, very easily because of one misstep. And because I can't save all that often, I end up loosing quite a bit of progress. This doesn't encourage me to take risks and explore the world. \n\nWorse yet, I don't understand the enemies. They seem to get upset by the fact I'm walking around them, as I'm exploring the tower and picking up supplies. This further reinforces my feeling of \"am I not supposed to be here?\" and makes me feel more and more lost as time goes on. You do get a map that is revealed as you go along... but how do I know if I'm going in the right direction? Also, why, oh why, does it have to get wiped every time I start a new game? At least keep the save spheres I've found on there!\n\nThe game isn't missing much to be enjoyable. 1: more explanations, guides, or tips so that I can complete objectives. 2: exploration must be easier. This could be done with a save history, and by keeping the map revealed across saves, so that I can literally go down rabbit holes and explore the world without having to fear bugs or being killed because of a small misstep. Unfortunately though, the game hasn't changed all that much since I bought it almost two years ago...","timestamp_created":1602088390,"timestamp_updated":1602088390,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53764796257019043","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw15n6gfUCcuW4pgI="}
