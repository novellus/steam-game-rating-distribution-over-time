Very funny and interesting.\n\nThere is good variety in the levels and the challenge level goes from relatively easy to tricky after 12-16 levels, then more tricky and difficult in different ways, becoming quite challenging. I'm currently stuck on level 25, which is going to require me to learn some new skills.\n\nLook at the video to see the type of game that it is, but if that's a type you could like, I think you'll like this as it is quite nicely done.","timestamp_created":1604037417,"timestamp_updated":1604037417,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gpOFvPUCcdD/qgI="}
