DO IT! PLEASE!  This game could be major, but as it stands it can be beat in an hour.  It's fun to replay though.  Not worth the full price, and even the sale price is a bit high.  Seems like you get more content with Featherfall.  That being said, it is super fun and feels great to play, and is that perfect kind of game I always wanted.  Sokpop should make a kickstarter for a huge RPG game, like Souls, or Zelda, etc.\n\nPRO:  Fun, pretty\nCON: Short, over-priced","timestamp_created":1609792503,"timestamp_updated":1609792503,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zYfH5/YCdZjAwAI="}
