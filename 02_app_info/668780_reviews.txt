I would compare the tone of this game to something like [i]Anna's Quest [/i], it has that dark fantasy theme going, but it's a kid friendly game in general. That being said, the store page should be updated to inform us about the nature of the episodes (is it free or paid DLC?). I bought several episodic adventure games that never got finished, so that is something to consider when you buy a game in parts. I have played through the first episode and it was above average when it comes to this genre, but I did run into couple of glitches. So far the devs were very fast with the patches, fixing achievements and updating the puzzles on the first day. They were open to feedback back in the demo, even including a few of my ideas, so I don't have any reason to believe that game won't improve.\n\nWhen it comes to adventure games I am looking for good narrative, fun characters, immersive soundtrack and intuitive puzzles. This game has at least 3 of the 4, the puzzles being a bit sketchy. I think about 80% of the puzzles in this game were designed well, the other 20% need a little bit of 'intuitive' rework. For example, you might figure out an obvious solution to the puzzle, you might even have a correct item for it, but you missed a line of dialogue which is required to progress. So make sure that you talk to all of the characters multiple times, and they could have new options between the puzzles. You can also show items to your hungry companion which may or may not give you a clue. Aside from that, I very much enjoyed the story from start to finish. It has a creative world, characters with cool personalities and a few decent jokes.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ enjoyable dialogue & characters\n+ beautiful environments & soundtrack\n+ most of the puzzles were very creative\n+ achievements \n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- I had a few small glitches\n- a few puzzles could use intuitive updates \n\n[b] Overall Thoughts (episode 1): 7/10 [/b]\n\nThe game is unpolished at the time of this review but the developer has been responding to issues very quickly, so I would not discourage anyone from buying it. I think episode 1 was pretty good aside from technical problems, if they manage to finish the story I would be happy to play more.\n\n[code]For more Hidden-Gems: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]","timestamp_created":1553922961,"timestamp_updated":1582025280,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.673967599868774414","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoMGDrPACc+yQvgE="}
