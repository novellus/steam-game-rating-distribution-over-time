It's rough around the edges compared to more modern games; it doesn't have 1080p resolution and the mouse navigation is a bit clumsy. But it's a quality game from before the era of early access, where you got a shareware peek at the full game and paid for the rest of it if you liked it.\n\nIt also seems ahead of its time with its basic mining and crafting, but also it doesn't go too far with it, which a lot of newer games do. However, may I recommend you save often. There doesn't appear to be an autosave and you might not realize it, but if your escape pod gets destroyed, it's a complete game over!","timestamp_created":1602195217,"timestamp_updated":1602195217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ptuRhfUCcMzZpgI="}
