A hidden gem. \n\nI highly recommend this game. Well worth the full price (although I think it goes on sale for 75% off if that matters to you). I have paid far more for far less. This is currently my #1 game to play in a library full of indie games, big titles, and old classics. The interface style reminds me of MOO:2 which is also a favorite of mine in the space genre. I really enjoy mining and space in games; so GEO really scratches that itch for me.\n\nI was initially on the fence about this game. I remember thinking it looked repetitive and lacking in challenge. I was pleasantly surprised upon actually diving into the game itself. There is a lot of strategy and planning to be had for those that are interested. Usually, this sort of game snowballs out of control in your favor when you get too wealthy. So far the game has increased in challenge for every increase in my own drill team's strength. As your power increases you unlock tougher and more varied planetary bodies with higher exploration costs. Planning your optimum route to planet cores requires quick thinking, fast reflexes, and sharp math. Getting to the bottom of a tough planet core is a thrilling triumph. Space monsters also keep you on your toes: some reflexes required.\n\nEvery drill site is made up of unique sets of tiles. Due to how the many subsystems of the game work, some tiles will be more profitable to mine, some easier to mine, some required for research, and some harmful to mine. As your drill speed increases you will need faster reflexes to choose the optimal path to reach your current goals. Having mined a core, your goals may switch mid mission from expediency (due to limited drill health) to wealth (aiming for the more valuable blocks). I won't get into all the details, but needless to say there is a lot to chew on here for those interested.\n\nOther bonuses are the discovery of new planetary objects and crew members on your journey through space. I love the hand drawn artwork throughout. It is always a pleasure to discover a fantastic new world or a crazy new character. Often the descriptions of planets and characters are quite humorous.\n\nSpoiler Alert: The highlight of my game so far has been discovering the planet Earth in the Phinexies 872 system. It seems humanity has abandoned it due to the rise of the Dolphin Queen.\n\nThere is a lot of grinding in this game, but I enjoy the grind. There is also no fail state which I have so far discovered, but that is also a plus in my books. You could play this game badly, and still be successful. For myself, the fun is in trying to play as efficiently as possible. \n\nGraphics: 9/10. Reminds me of MOO:2. Sometimes text is a little clipped out of the screen, but still readable. The hand drawn artwork is a big plus for me. The 2D graphics suit this game.\n\nSound: 5/10. Has it's own soundtrack, but I prefer to make my own custom music playlist for this game which includes Queen's \"Under Pressure\". The game itself gives solid indication of block breaking, chest smashing, and loot jingling. Lots and lots of loot jingling.\n\nGameplay: 10/10. Relaxing, challenging, and fun. Great after a long day of work especially if you love mining, space, and art.\n\nDifficulty: 5/10. You can win this game no matter what you do. Just remember: \"It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game\". Personally, being able to play without the threat of permadeath is a bonus for me.\n\nIn closing, I'd just like to add that this game is clearly a labor of love. There is fine attention to detail everywhere. For a one man indie project this game is amazing. I've also had a ton of fun with it, and look forward to more hours of enjoyment in the future. I am sure GEO 2 will be a blast.","timestamp_created":1609997275,"timestamp_updated":1609998479,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528234422206878662","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46eXY7fYCeJCZwQI="}
