Cute art, nice writing, but really short (I completed it in a lunch break). Also, the story isn't really finished.  IMHO the title is a bit misleading, I was expecting a LOT more information on Helsinki, but hey, that's what Trip Advisor is for, innit?","timestamp_created":1559735608,"timestamp_updated":1559735681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1560266511,"developer_response":"Thank you for playing Life in Helsinki.
