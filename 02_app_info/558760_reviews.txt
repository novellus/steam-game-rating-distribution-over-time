One festival-themed tileset (without cars or buildings from the screenshots: only stalls, torii - red japanese gates - and statues), a couple of sprites of enemies, some festival-themed music (BGM, BGS, ME, SE), and all of this not worthy of $6.99 or even $3.14 on sale. One of the worst deals on my memory.","timestamp_created":1561823152,"timestamp_updated":1561898893,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512325823307037354","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47Leb1OsCcKa/xgE="}
