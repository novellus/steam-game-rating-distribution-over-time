    review: "I played this game back in 1995 and have been looking for it again since!\
      \ Nobody i have ever talked to has heard of this game and 25 years later im\
      \ still quoting it and getting weird looks. \n\n Superhero League of Hoboken\
      \ has a very funny story that adds famous sites around the New York area into\
      \ the environment. This game is a turn-based combat rpg with point and click\
      \ environments. You can customize attributes on your characters with different\
      \ items you find throughout the game. Music can be a little annoying because\
      \ of some sharp notes, but i would rank it somewhere between ok-ish to digging-it.\
      \ Interface is CLUNKY AF, but not unbearable. You can navigate using your keyboard\
      \ or mouse.\n\nBOTTOMLINE:\n If you are looking for a mostly unknown gem, and\
      \ can be patient with the aged parts of the gameplay, you'll find a really solid\
      \ and entertaining adventure that is filled with cheap laughs and topical puzzles.\
      \ - 7/10"
