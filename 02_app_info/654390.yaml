    about_the_game: "Dialogue: A Writer's Story is a game about conversations, writing\
      \ and science. In Dialogue, you play as the writer Lucille Hawthorne, exploring\
      \ characters and events through a year in her life via mostly ordinary, and\
      \ occasionally fantastical, conversations. <br><br>The game consists of various\
      \ types of conversations with different mechanics. Active conversations occur\
      \ in real-time, and the effect of Lucille's statements can be modified through\
      \ her equipped Focus. Exploratory conversations map different subjects spatially,\
      \ allowing for backtracking and finding new paths, while emails can be arranged\
      \ and edited.<br><br>Be inspired alongside Lucille as you help her write her\
      \ science fantasy novel, learning more about her neighbour Adrian's biochemical\
      \ research to see her book through to its conclusion!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654390/extras/SteamAdrFeatures.png?t=1561119230\"\
