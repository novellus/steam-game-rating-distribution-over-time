    review: Honestly I've had it for a while and I don't even know how to use it.  It
      seems it needs to be used in connection with the actual game somehow.  Maybe
      it gave me extra music while playing the game?  I don't know.  I don't even
      know if I've been able to listen to the soundtrack.  I thought when I bought
      it that I could download some music.  That doesn't seem to be the case.
