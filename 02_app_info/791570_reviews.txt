DON'T BUY IT!\n\nUpdate: 10-28-2018 The developer has responded to my review and posted an announcement in response. He indicates he \"may\" end up finishing the game. That's not particularly promising, but I appreciate his efforts at updating the community and responding to reviewer criticism. For that alone, I will change my review to recommened, but with the caveat that you should check the announcements and see if the dev actually finished delivering the game content BEFORE you purchase.\n\nOriginal Review: It would appear this game is abandoned for one of the devs many other projects. I purchased this game not long after it hit early release, and here we are six months later, with almost no updates in four months. I guess they lost interest.\n\nOne of the other reviewers likened it to an iOS game, that's accurate. There's not much depth, not much to keep you coming back, and enough bugs to keep you from wanting to come back. I happened to click on this game in my library tonight just to check it out and see if there had been any updates, and my assumption was right, no news since \"join our group, check out our homepage.\"\n\nIf any of this changes, I will gladly update my review. Until then, avoid this game, and, likely, this developer.","timestamp_created":1540690341,"timestamp_updated":1589157532,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1540753958,"developer_response":"I've posted an announcement that addresses some of the points you've raised here.
