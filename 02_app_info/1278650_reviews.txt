Even though it's not the first type of this game from them It is hard to recommend this one though.\n\nAs usual, the memory puzzle part offers no challenge nor variety. Lack of improvement between game from this dev shows lack of effort.\n\nThe art is of acceptable quality (barely) but the animation seem worse then other, similar games. Also, the H element of this game is almost non existent. The main selling point fails badly, so yeah, big negative.\n\nMusic is acceptable. The opening song is still a nice addition. Seem like a standard thing for this dev. Can't carry whole game though.\n\nNo issue, except for the achievement problem when DLC is installed.\n\nOverall, almost carbon copy of other puzzle games from this dev, with little to no challenge or variation, and with acceptable art and music. H-part sucks though. Not worth it: 2/10","timestamp_created":1607975760,"timestamp_updated":1607975760,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiN60sfYCd9SbugI="}
