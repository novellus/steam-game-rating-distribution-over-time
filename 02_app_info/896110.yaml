    review: 'This is a very, very challenging Match 3 game.  Every level after a certain
      point needs to be completed twice - once to fail and charge up all of your items,
      and the second for a chance to succeed.  I don''t see how obtaining three stars
      on levels is possible.  Perhaps someone out there can figure this out and post
      it somewhere.


      Still, very enjoyable.  Rewarding after playing all of those other super easy
      Match 3 games.  Don''t play this continuously.  Take a break and play one of
      the easier ones ... to preserve your sanity.'
