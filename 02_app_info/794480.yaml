    review: "This game is a first-person action-adventure from a Turkish developer\
      \ based in Ankara.  The tech is out-dated (think, 2000) and the graphics are\
      \ simple, but it has its charm.  If you like Anatolian culture and architecture,\
      \ you will enjoy this game.  \n\nDon't believe all the Russian haters who accuse\
      \ this developer of just trying to make a quick buck.  Yes, the developer used\
      \ an off-the-shelf game engine.  But he also used textures and sounds from Turkish\
      \ culture, to evoke the impression of Anatolia in the Ottoman age.  For instance,\
      \ if you approach a mosque, the muezzin will begin calling the faithful to prayer\
      \ from the minaret. \n\nSome constructive criticism of the gameplay:  the character\
      \ moves too slowly.  He always walks.  Is there a key to make him run, to cover\
      \ vast distances more quickly?\n\nThis review is based on just hour of playing,\
      \ so I have hardly scratched the surface of the entire game."
