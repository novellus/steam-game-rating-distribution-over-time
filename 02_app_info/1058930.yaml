      Game description key-points: 3 modes: Championship/Career/Time Attack | 3 separate
      Worlds with own Missions (1st has 60) - sequential unlock with up to 3 rated
      stars for each.

      Overview: Game looks ok, but very simplistic. each mission has opened burger
      layers to meet customer demand against the time limit. Gets boring after few
      plays.'
