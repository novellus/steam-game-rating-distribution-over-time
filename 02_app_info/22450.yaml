    review: 'I was able to get the co-op working pretty flawlessly with Hamachi and,
      having beaten it, I still don''t recommend this game at any price. It''s not
      terrible, it''s just really clunky, average and not worth your time. Go play
      Remnant: From the Ashes, Gears of War, or any Dark Souls game instead.


      Shame about the protagonists, though. The voice acting and banter is the best
      thing about the game, I just wish they''d ended up in a better game.'
