      who are tight on budgets to be able to have a fun game for their child to play
      so I made sure the Demo is quite substantial. On top of all that you can also
      make sure that the game runs on your system properly before you commit on a
      purchase.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/740040/extras/PWG_Info_7.png?t=1609258812"
      /><br>Hi Parents! As a father myself it was important to me that the design
      behind this game evokes a sense of exploration. The game started as a small
      side project meant for my 4 year old daughter to play. She loved it so much
      that I decided to make it into a more full fledged experience. Everything is
      designed around my observations watching her play and also through her own suggestions.
      I hope that your own child has as much fun as mine has.<br><br>Also important
      to note is that there are no micro transactions, unlockables (everything is
      unlocked from the get go) nor are there any cards or achievements. These things
      are thrown at children constantly and I am personally not a fan of them so I
      decided to leave these things out.<br><br>The game is about having fun, trying
      to find all the kittens, collect all the fish or try to get the golden fish
      yet it won't force or push you to do so. If you do collect everything in a level,
      the end reward is a nice fireworks show, nothing more. I wanted to keep the
      rewards to a minimum and something that means more than some unlockable reward
      or a high score, something that can be experienced.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/740040/extras/PWG_Info_8.png?t=1609258812"

    review: This is just adorable. One gets to guide a little kitten (Gilbert) to
      find and befriend other little kittens, search for fish, and explore many different
      and fantastic locations! The controls are easy and smooth, and one can leap
      small buildings with a single bound! Well, maybe 2 or 3 bounds. ;) It is very
      entertaining and relaxing and exciting. 2 paws up! =^..^=
