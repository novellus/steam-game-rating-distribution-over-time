    about_the_game: <strong>Will You Survive?</strong><br><br>Higher Ground is a 3D
      racing-like adventure game. You are Hoffman, a genius scientist who left behind
      in the polluted Earth, dedicates himself to escape to Mars. With your &quot;friend&quot;
      Swimmy, a one-manned spaceship, you will escape from Megaquake and harsh natural
      conditions such as flood, blizzard and strong magnetic flux. You will navigate
      into abandoned cities to avoid touching the surface and head for the higher
      ground. But don't worry. Your spaceship, Swimmy has numerous amazing modules
      to help you find a way to the extraction point. Test your driving skill from
      collapsing cities and devastating Earth environment. Good luck with your trip.<h2
      class="bb_tag"><strong>Key Features</strong></h2><br><br><strong>3D racing-like
      adventure.</strong><br>You will drive a spaceship, &quot;Swimmy&quot; to navigate
      the skyline of the city. It has incredible speed and propulsion that allows
      you fly and jump above buildings. You have to travel further and faster to avoid
      death.<br><br><strong>Don't touch the ground.</strong><br>Surface is very unstable
      due to strong geomagnetic flux. Navigate with rooftops of buildings to avoid
      getting close to the ground. Always look for HIGHER GROUND. Ocean is also not
      safe to land since your spaceship will sink. <br><br><strong>Megaquake will
      destroy cities.</strong><br>If you delay, Megaquake will devastate everything
      including you and the city. You have to escape from the city before destructive
      L-wave catches you. Buildings will likely fall and collapse on your way. Moreover,
      buildings will be destroyed randomly and unpredictable ways. Move faster, otherwise
      you will have no place to step on. Drive while you can. <br><br><strong>Advanced
      Modules.</strong><br>Your spaceship is equipped with very high-tech modules,
      which is intended for space travel. But still, it can help you to navigate from
      desolated cities to HIGHER GROUND. Modules are from Hoffman's three academic
      majors 1) Graviton Mechanics 2) Material Transmission and 3) Time Distortion.
      Unlock your modules and use them effectively.<br><br><strong>Randomized City.</strong><br>HIGHER
      GROUND supports progressive random map generation. In challenge mode, the map
      and weather will continuously change each time with preset difficulty. In campaign
      mode, random seeds are fixed so you can practice your basic navigation skills.

    review: 'It will take longer to map your game pad for this game than completing
      the game itself


      Higher Ground features a ball that must make death-defying leaps while keeping
      itself in the air

      utilising eight to twelve different cool-down actions


      There is no game pad support and even memorising the keyboard layout feels like
      the game is asking too much time and dedication from the player considering
      the limited number of campaign and challenge levels.


      This is one game that probably would''ve been more practical with a movement
      sensor controller and VR headset.'
