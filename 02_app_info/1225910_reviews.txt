This game has a really awkward control scheme for me. It's not a bad game, and I think that if you master the controls it would be a moderately enjoyable, albeit a little stiff, game. Enemies in this game aren't hard, it is just hard to control yourself while fighting them off at times. The platform placement is good, but once again the controls are your worst enemy, and it is just frustrating to do. This thing was like $0.50 so what can be expected. I might come back to this, but dang.\n\n*Edit* - I'd recommend it if you want to show it to your friends as a joke or something(what I've been doing), but it still stands. I finished it and it would have taken even longer if I hadn't accidentally stumbled across a... negative lives glitch? Idk if it is intentional or not, but I just stood in place for a while and it activated on me. Worth the amount I paid for it, but no more than that.","timestamp_created":1581981695,"timestamp_updated":1582141733,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iN+/r/ACe8788gE="}
