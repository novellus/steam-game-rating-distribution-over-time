      notes: "This is an open-world stealth action game in which players assume the\
        \ role of tribe chief a quest for vengeance. As players explore an open-world\
        \ environment, they interact with characters, infiltrate enemy camps, mines,\
        \ forts, and towns, and kill human enemies. Players use bows, guns, and melee\
        \ weapons to kill enemies in melee-style combat. Players also use stealth\
        \ attacks (e.g., knife stabbing) to dispatch enemies discreetly. Dead human\
        \ and animal bodies can be found around the world. Large blood-splatter effects\
        \ occur as enemies are killed. The words like \u201Cf**k\u201D and \u201C\
        sh*t\u201D are heard in the game."

    review: 'The two main reasons i got this are the ancestor bows and the war paints..
      both are very powerful in comparison to just the base game.


      It an absolute pay to win option... playing the game solo i have no issue with
      this.


      As the token system and social inventory is broken the other advantages are
      minor at the moment, but would also give a huge advantage if this aspect to
      the game was fixed. As this would be pay to win against other players, its maybe
      not so great for the game.


      to explain, as you can make copies of the save folder it is currently very easy
      to duplicate items. buy an item, save the game, put the item back on the market,
      restore your save, put your item in the market again, repeat. you can do the
      same thing with in game email, once you have one of any item, there is no need
      to buy another, ever, just duplicate it.
