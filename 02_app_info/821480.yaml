    about_the_game: "Space Flowers is an intra-galactic tradewars game.  You start\
      \ with a basic starship at a friendly starbase.  You can buy a variety of different\
      \ flowers to sell elsewhere and then begin exploring the galaxy looking for\
      \ other starbases to trade with.  Some are friendly and will trade with you\
      \ immediately.  Some are hostile and will attack your ship if you enter their\
      \ systems.  Others are more or less neutral and will react based on your actions.\
      \  You can also attack hostile starbases and engage in combat with them to gain\
      \ experience and valuable items in the debris you salvage from their destroyed\
      \ ships.  Destroy enough enemy ships and the system will surrender to you and\
      \ become one of your allies.  You can also peacefully ally with star systems\
      \ just by trading with them enough.  Every transaction you make with them will\
      \ raise your influence with them until they eventually ally with you.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nThere are also specialty starbases you can find that will sell parts\
      \ to upgrade your starship.  You can upgrade your engines, weapons, shields,\
      \ armor and firing control.  As you gain experience, you will find out an alien\
      \ presence is starting to invade and take over starbases in the galaxy.  You\
      \ will need to deal with this threat as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou have also\
      \ learned that your long lost family has been scattered among the stars.  You\
      \ will be provided clues as to where they are located, and you can choose to\
      \ search for them as well.  Every member of your lost family is unique and brings\
      \ an extra bonus that will help you in your mission.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe\
      \ ultimate goal is to ally yourself with every starbase in the galaxy through\
      \ trade or warfare.  Use skill and cunning to find the most profitable trade\
      \ routes, deliver specialty goods for additional profits, and accumulate funds\
      \ to upgrade your ship to advance in rank from a lowly bud to the ultimate Star\
      \ Flower!  Whether you advance peacefully or through warfare (or a little of\
      \ both) is entirely up to you."
