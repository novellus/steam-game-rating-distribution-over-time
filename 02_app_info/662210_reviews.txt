I thoroughly enjoyed every last bit of dialogue and character development. I especially loved that this game had so many incentives for you to explore the world they built. There's exp to gain, but also additional dialogue to read with extra hidden joke gems :) You can really tell that a lot of love went into this project, and especially the script. The lines never got stale for me, and I loved that in the case of the cream that Alexandria likes, she (or others) had a different thing to say each time you picked one up. \n\nOverall - if you enjoy culture references and mature humor, and you're in the mood for a fun RPG, Metal as Phuk is so worth the buy.","timestamp_created":1608341510,"timestamp_updated":1608341510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9/qnvPYCcpypuwI="}
