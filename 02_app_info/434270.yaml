    review: "This game has some elements of a metroidvania with backtracking with\
      \ new abilities you unlock. But it gets annoying to use certain ones and doesn't\
      \ control well enough. \n\nThe text in this game is way to big that sometimes\
      \ it will just take up the entire screen while you are playing the game and\
      \ you have wait till it disappears till its comfortable to keep playing. \n\n\
      Also changing to different forms to progress through the areas costs one heart\
      \ every time you change your character and I would love to know why that's the\
      \ case cause if your confused and don't know which form to use as your cycling\
      \ through them you then realize you are about to die in one hit and can make\
      \ the game frustrating when that happens constantly. I haven't gotten far to\
      \ tell if this would happen but what if you get in a situation where you need\
      \ to change to different forms and if you don't have enough health at one point\
      \ you might be stuck, just a random statement of how annoying that is.\n\n3/10,\
      \ I don't recommend this game at all."
