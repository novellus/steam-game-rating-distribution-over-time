    about_the_game: This package contains the Ultimate version of Fantasy Grounds.
      Just like with the normal version of Fantasy Grounds, you can:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Run
      games as the Gamemaster<br></li><li>Host games as a GM for other players and
      GMs who are connected as players<br></li><li>Join games as a player<br></li><li>Create
      characters locally to take with you into a game session<br></li><li>Create additional
      rulesets and modifications with custom XML and LUA Scripting<br></li><li>Use
      hundreds of built-in top-down tokens for monsters, characters and animals</li></ul><br>In
      addition, you can also do this:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Host an unlimited number
      of unregistered players (limited only by your connection speeds) running the
      Demo version of Fantasy Grounds. This means that you can play with players who
      have never purchased Fantasy Grounds.<br></li><li>Host games for Players, GMs
      and FG Demo players together.</li></ul><br>This upgrade will supply you with
      a new license key. After it is entered into your settings and you complete an
      Update, it will activate the Ultimate version. The former license key should
      be replaced in your Fantasy Grounds setting. When successful, the Launch screen
      of Fantasy Grounds will show Ultimate in the upper-right corner of the screen.
      You will now be able to run actual campaigns with players running the Demo version
      of Fantasy Grounds. Any ruleset you purchase will be usable by the Demo users
      and other connected players while connected to your host license.
