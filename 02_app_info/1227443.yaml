      /><br><br>Stella is a free, open-source emulator for one of the most popular
      and influential home video game consoles of the 1970s and '80s. This emulator
      was originally developed for use on the GNU/Linux operating system but has,
      over time, been ported to many different platforms, including libretro, which
      allows it to play through the RetroArch gaming and multimedia system.<br><br><img

      /><br><br>Over the past couple of years, the Stella development team has made
      great strides in mimicking the many quirks of Stella's target console, making
      it compatible with many difficult-to-emulate games, homebrew software and demos.<br><br>Through
      RetroArch, you can bring a modern touch to this classic emulator, with support
      for real-time rewind and RetroAchievements, as well as RetroArch's best-in-class
      shaders for CRT display emulation and more.
