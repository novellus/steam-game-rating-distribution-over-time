Couldn't see any difference at all. Why didn't the developers instead add something that people are going to like such as extra weapons or some different armour (even if the stats were the same as the current ones, just give some variety. Face paint and a rookie aren't going to please anyone.\n \nOR \n\nwhy not add an easily-implemented and kind of obvious DLC: maybe some more 'countries' and 'languages' which is a feature that feels missing from the game.\n\nI'm a Kiwi and wanted to see New Zealand added to the game (unlikely choice I know). Japanese would want Japanese language added , Chinese will want Chinese language.  Etc, etc. There are 195 countries in the World so this would have easily added heaps of content and variety to one of the aspects of the game.\n\nSorry developers, this DLC didn't work out - but overall your game is absolutely awesome and you could maybe still add a 'more countries and languages' DLC which might be popular with the many fans.\n\nXCOM2 is still alive and well so some interesting DLC would still be easily marketable.","timestamp_created":1597730458,"timestamp_updated":1597733738,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49253728985786438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4cKWgPQCeZGUnAI="}
