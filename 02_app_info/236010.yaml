    about_the_game: Bloxitivity is a puzzle/platformer with a powerful twist - you
      get to create the puzzles! Using the built-in level creator you're given the
      power to create intricate puzzles which you can share with friends and fans
      instantly using the Steam Workshop or directly by sharing the XML files used
      by the game. Build your levels with a host of tools and placements such as different
      colored blox and goals, teleporters, enemy spawners, conveyors, and more! Then
      share them with others for playing, streaming, or simply to show off what you've
      made. It's not just a game - it's a tool that unleashes your creativity. What
      will you create?<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/236010/extras/bloxitivity-in-text-01.png?t=1589341019"
      /><br><br><strong>Play</strong><br>Move around unique stages created by fellow
      players as you push and pull blox onto matching goals with your powerful beam
      weapons. Switch between three different camera angles to get the best view of
      the action. Utilize your movement, dashing, and double jumping capabilities
      to traverse platforming elements and dodge enemies, or blast them off of the
      platforms so that you can solve each puzzle and clear the level.<br><br>Bloxitivity
      comes with an assortment of initial levels that serve as examples to inspire
      you and fuel your creativity. As free updates to the game are released, we'll
      be adding even more official levels created by the development team behind the
      game; 55 Revolver. You can also download and play levels that you and other
      Bloxitivity players have created using the level creator.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/236010/extras/bloxitivity-in-text-02.png?t=1589341019"

      the tools you need to build your own puzzle/platformer levels including time

      or by sharing the XML files that the game reads from. Make stages that will
      stump your friends, or create a relaxing setting to take the edge off. It's
