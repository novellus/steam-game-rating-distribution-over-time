    reviews: "\u201CFor an indie title that seeks to present physical challenge and\
      \ old-school, arcade thrill in place of a meaningful narrative, it accomplishes\
      \ its mission beautifully. If this were a true arcade game, I\u2019d have spent\
      \ all my quarters long, long ago.\u201D<br>90/100 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://cogconnected.com/review/atomicrops-review/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >COGconnected</a><br><br>\u201COn the\
      \ surface, Atomicrops is a retro-inspired, top-down 16-bit shooter. However,\
      \ even early stages start to reveal a much deeper experience, filled with love\
      \ interests, guns, and unrelenting enemies. Perks can become permanent down\
      \ the road, but the path to getting there is fulfilling and enough to keep you\
      \ returning after each defeat for more crop production and bullet fire.\u201D\
