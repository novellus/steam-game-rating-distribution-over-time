LOL the only way to make real money in this game right now is by rolling joints, which seems fun and fine when you're buying low-price items. You want a tractor? That's going to be 1,000 times you're placing bud, tobacco, and papers into their boxes, then 200 more clicks to make the joint roll itself. After, you'll have to click each individual joint into the selling page, and you're capped at 30 items. Want to buy more papers? My bug says that's not possible without saving and quitting the game, then reopneing it and trying again. In my 10 hours playing, I had to do this about every half hour. Maaaybe they didn't expect someone to play longer than 30 minutes.. lol \nThis game is fun, there's interesting electrical equipment that is fun to use, cool decorations, a vast open space to grow in, pretty visuals, but it's painstakingly hard to play again because the game has turned from growing the weed, to rolling it for hours to get money. To be fair, I bought a tractor and irrigation attachment, some lights and heaters, but I can't go on like this. Please for the love of god, update this with a joint rolling machine that I can buy from the store, and I'll be back here playing again. I'm not returning it cause I can't wait for the updates! There's going to be Multiplayer later on, per the Discord, and it sounds like the devs are understaffed/ there's a lot still to do, but I can't wait to see what this game becomes!! \n\nI would recommend buying it for a very casual game that will bring you novelty enjoyment (for right now), and I would say buy it now before it gets more expensive (after all the updates, probably, idk)!!  This game will be fantastical and unique once it's later on in its life. Keep in mind this is EARLY ACCESS, so your patronage is helping develop the game, and it's clearly stated it's not finished.","timestamp_created":1609809078,"timestamp_updated":1609809078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw76SG6PYCe5DIwAI="}
