    review: 'TL;DR I am horrifically blinded by nostalgia, and I have no shame about
      it.



      This game''s about as old as the platform itself. I used to play the demo a
      bunch when I was a kid, back when Counter-Strike: Source was the only game I
      owned. This and Codename Gordon, the Half-Life 2 demo and Lost Coast are some
      of the oldest memories I have from gaming in my childhood, and I''m happy this
      game still works so well despite the passage of time.


      Not surprisingly, my current computer''s way better than whatever I had back
      in the day, so I get to experience it in 1080p at a silky-smooth 60FPS. The
      gameplay is niche and the networking''s dated (not sure if anyone even plays
      the multiplayer anymore), but I mainly grabbed it for nostalgia''s sake. Doesn''t
      feel right not to own it. If that''s a reckless use of my money, I honestly
      couldn''t care less. You can''t get any more OG with steam games than this ancient
      title.



      Would I recommend it? Definitely. I see some people whining about the game length
      and all that, but this game''s singleplayer wasn''t meant to last for days on
      end. Ten bucks isn''t much to get something unique, compared to the regurgitated,
      buggy trash released on a yearly basis in the Triple-A industry for 60 dollars
      a pop.'
