    review: "I think this is very good DLC. Locomotive looks realy good, only thing\
      \ that isn't realistic is that it's too mat and not metalic.\nSounds are amazing.\
      \ I was standing right next to S\u017D 363 in real life and it sounded just\
      \ like in game. I didn't experienced any bugs, for now :). I think that physics\
      \ are realy good, but I don't realy know because I didn't drive it in real life.\
      \ And there aren't any pixelated textures anymore. I recomend it to beginners\
      \ and also professional drivers. I realy like it, because it's fun to drive\
      \ and it's only Slovenian Locomotive in Train Simulator (for now).\n\n(These\
      \ are only my opinions and my experiences. Don't hate on me if yours aren't\
      \ going to be the same)"
