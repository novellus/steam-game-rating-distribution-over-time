      \ ultimate customizable platform fighting game, featuring a cast of some of\
      \ indie gaming's biggest icons. Duke it out with up to 4 players, and call on\
      \ assists to help out in the heat of battle. Create or play custom characters,\
      \ stages, modes, and more for infinite fun!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Traits</h2><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Easy to pick up, hard to master</strong> - Fraymakers\
      \ is designed to be friendly to new players and challenging and expressive for\
      \ veteran players. You\u2019re going to have a ton of fun whether you want a\
      \ quick round with your friends or you\u2019re looking to climb the leaderboards.<br></li><li>\
      \ <strong>Rollback Netcode</strong> - If you\u2019ve been part of the fighting\
      \ game community over the past few years, you know that rollback is the gold\
      \ standard for fighting game netcode. We\u2019ve prioritized and designed around\
      \ rollback from the outset of development, meaning that Fraymakers will provide\
      \ the smoothest possible online experience.<br></li><li> <strong>Full Movesets</strong>\
      \ - With over 80 animations per character, we've skipped nothing! Each character\
      \ comes complete with every motion and attack you've come to expect from a platform\
      \ fighter as well as some brand new techniques.<br></li><li> <strong>Assists</strong>\
      \ - Choose from a massive selection of indie characters to unleash an attack,\
      \ fire a projectile, buff your character, or inflict a special status effect\
      \ on your foes.<br></li><li> <strong>...And Infinite Expandability!</strong>\
      \ - We designed both the game and our custom content editor to be accessible\
      \ and powerful. We want the process of creating your own content to be simple\
      \ and fun. Whether you're a player or a creator, this means that the possibilities\
      \ are endless.</li></ul>"
