      /><br><br>Stealthscape is a top-down momentum based speed game that has you
      pitted against a wide variety of enemies and obstacles while you try to quickly
      make your way to the portal at the end of the stage! There's tons to explore
      from campaign stages created by a variety of people, to workshop maps created
      by people around the world with the built-in stage editor. Unlock customization
      options for your ship while playing and truly take control of the game.<br><br>Each
      stage in the campaign is created differently, some like to hold your hand, introduce
      you to new mechanics, and puzzle you, while others can be brutal, unforgiving,
      and push all your prior knowledge to the extreme.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/670720/extras/stealthscape_gif_600px.gif?t=1606061312"

      /><br><br>The built-in Stage Editor was developed to be user friendly and as
      customize-able as possible. As a result, it's easy to create, concept, and publish
      stages with ease. The Stage Editor is constantly evolving with more and more
      features allowing for even more creative possibilities, and with the wide selection
      of Objects, Traps, Enemies, and Logic, you can bring any idea to life!<br><br><img

    review: One of the more interesting games I have played recently. You can explore
      8 different levels filled with all sorts of fun mechanics, that challenge you
      to adapt and overcome your weaknesses as a gamer. No matter how good you are
      there will be at least 1 level that you get stuck on at some point but it makes
      it that much more satisfying when you finally conquer the level. 10/10 would
      recommend to anyone looking for a game that's easy to learn but difficult to
      master. Plus there's online leaderboards for people who want to grind out best
      scores even after the game is done.
