So it's just hit & miss on whether you can achieve concluding it.    However my reason for the thumbs down is the \"No more moves\".   Some of the boards are designed so restrictively you can get this a half dozen times in a couple of minutes.   Not much of a \"match-3\" game when you're limited to one choice or zero choices.   Not worth even the 1$ price point.  I gave it to level 70 or so in Arcade mode.  I can't see it improving.   \n\nLook elsewhere for your match-3 fix.","timestamp_created":1605648236,"timestamp_updated":1605648236,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3veF7PUCeqWBrwI="}
