This aircraft is not however for the casual simmer or someone who is beginning to fly sims. It's a real challenge to taxi and take off if you don't know what you are doing. I do not have rudder pedals and use my joy stick for rudder. I have to say it takes quite some skill to keep her on the centre line. Practice, practice and more practice. Once you get her up you still need to understand her quarks. Don't slow down to much when landing. That wing will drop and you will kiss the ground before you know it. Absolutely love the sound of the engine. Reminds me of  past airshow displays of the bent wing bird. Very nice. So glad it was on sale. Great job A2A sims! Now back to those take practice take offs and landings. Don forget to read the manual that comes with it. Absolutely essential to fly it properly. Once you master it she will give you quite a ride.","timestamp_created":1563160843,"timestamp_updated":1563160843,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539622604846954346","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r7Lp+esCe5WyzgE="}
