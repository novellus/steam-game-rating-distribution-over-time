However, it lacks polish, the pacing is weird, and I found it to be a bit punishing with no option to turn down the difficulty.  Would have been nice if any of the background was destructable consideriing the low res nature of the game.  Also, being able to run out of ammo conpletely in a bullet hell game is not a wise design choice.  \n\nWorth the sale price.  Surprised they're selling it for so much as early access.","timestamp_created":1545937702,"timestamp_updated":1545937702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx6nE+OcCcvzPtgE="}
