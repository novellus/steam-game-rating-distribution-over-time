    review: 'Promising game, but needs a lot of polishment.


      It feels incomplete, and the fighting was just a matter of mastering the dash
      attack (for me, it was the only way of beating the some enemies). The batle
      against the cult and demon was weird, I could have lost the sword if I missed
      a few more skulls. Also, not having a map in the dungeon was terrible, since
      everything was dark and similar. Selling / buying itens is terrible right now,
      it''s so easy to sell an item buy accident...


      For some reason the steam did not recorded my playtime in the lap top, so I
      had to reinstall just for the review (but my 2 achievements are there...)


      Still, I can recommend this, trying to introduce a "souls like"battle system
      in a zelda-like game was nice.'
