    review: "[h1]Exclaimer: this is NOT a (only read spoiler if you played hikarus\
      \ route)[spoiler]Galinns[/spoiler] route. [/h1]\n[b]It is kinda the natural\
      \ consequence or the aftermath of hikarus route and serves as both a tie up\
      \ and together of all the other routes before AND a teaser for the sequel.[/b]\n\
      \n [h1]Game overall: [/h1]\n- My only critique is the music, wich becomes boring\
      \ after some loops. \n- CS were good but i would have hoped for more (or i'm\
      \ used to get more of them in other VN/Otome).\n\n+ Other that that the game\
      \ is unusually polished\n+ i personally enjoyed a more western/realistic artstyle\
      \ for once \n+ and the writing was good (both in grammar AND storytelling)\n\
      + the maincharacter is normal, in a GOOD way. She reacts grumpy when someone\
      \ is rude, shes flustered if its the situation but shes not overly anything.\
      \ The writing conveyed a fully fleshed charcter wich you shape with your reaktions\
      \ one by one. I really enjoyed seeing this instead of one blunt character!\n\
      \n [h1]This particular Route/DLC: [/h1]\nthis time i start off with the rather\
      \ negative stuff... (dont be scared!)\n-? i dont care for digital artbooks so\
      \ this i wouldnt recommend for it\n- the POVs were really short. you get one\
      \ important scene (usually climax) and have a textblock of what the guy is thinking\
      \ in that moment. Most of them are pretty forgetable (like, you should know\
      \ what goes on in their head if you played the route). I kinda liked tatsuyas\
      \ tho i guess. On its own its not worth 5 bucks tho.\n-? as i mentioned i also\
      \ likda liked the soundtrack (specially in hikarus book they tried really hard!\
      \ thx guys! but the looping made me sick of it after a while. (i took a long\
      \ gaming break wich kinda fixed it tho. It IS enjoyable in the game again for\
      \ me and memorable, but i dont think i would listen to it otherwise so idc about\
      \ the digital soundtrack either xD)\n+/- While i'm not sure if this is worth\
      \ 5 bucks for everyone (and i'm actually not sure if i bought it of got it in\
      \ an update since i bought this game a logn while ago) i do think its an amazing\
      \ (2nd) climax to the story with ties up everything and gets you REALLY fired\
      \ up for the seuel wich is heavily teased in the chaos route ( not in a bad\
      \ way tho).\n+ amazing wallbreak and (like in hikarus books) selfaware-writing\
      \ in a hilarious, greatly pulled of way\n\n [h1]Verdict: [/h1]\nLike usually\
      \ i dont like teases like this, specially if you practically pay for it wich\
      \ at least some people have to --- but this was amazing honestly. Even IF i\
      \ would have bought it, i wouldnt reget... \xD6.\xD6\nSo all in all, i think\
      \ eventho i dont care for most of the features you get here (or like i see them\
      \ merely as bonus?) all together i would say its not a bad price if you liked\
      \ the game. Again, as shown here and in my other reviwes i do had my issues\
      \ with the game at times but all in all it was a really amazing VN wich i wont\
      \ forget and would happily play and buy again (or its sequel)!"
