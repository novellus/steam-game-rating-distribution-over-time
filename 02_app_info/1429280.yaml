    review: 'Like the game, this soundtrack is very enjoyable for its clever arrangement
      of chiptune and sampled instruments. However, also like the game, it feels incomplete.
      Like, where is Keaton''s song? Where is the outdoor variation of the casino
      theme? Where are the item acquisition jingles? :(


      These are honestly nitpicks, though. This is great stuff, honestly better than
      half the game soundtracks I''ve picked up on Steam. My only hope is that it
      will only grow bigger as the dev continues to work on the game.'
