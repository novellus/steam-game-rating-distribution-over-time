I find myself not playing much of it right now due to me being unable to buy the DLC thanks to parents.\n\n___________\nSECTION 2\n\nRemarks 1:0\nso far I have not come across any bugs, which is surprising. Computers are always full of errors and by the 2 hour mark of new games i encountered one or two. This makes me add another point. 8/10-9/10.\n\nRemarks 1:1 \nI have a hope that after the sequel they continue support of the prequel. If not, I may refund this for the new one.\n\n_______________________\nSECTION 3\n\nThank you developers for this awesome game. I hope you take my critique above into consideration though there isn't a lot.
