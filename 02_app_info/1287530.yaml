      create and decorate the houses for your villagers. Expand your manor, build
      churches, warehouses and all kinds of buildings your civilization needs to prosper.
      Thanks to your input, no settlement is ever the same.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1287530/extras/01_building.gif?t=1607044266"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Split the Land</h2>Take advantage of the procedurally generated
      world, understand where certain lands are best to be and set your village up
      in the most efficient way. Or just experiment and go wild!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1287530/extras/02_zones.gif?t=1607044266"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Manage Families</h2>The family profession is passed between
      generations and their members are tied to your service. Your production depends

      with their life to your land and will work as long as they are given the opportunity
      but they can also be the source of problems and may disobey your orders.<br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Expand your Production Chain</h2>The production chain involves
      over 100 different resources and 40 professions. Every game is different and

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Prepare for the Winter</h2>Collect production and control
      the economy. Take too much and your villagers may starve. Take too little and
      you might be in trouble with the king. Are you willing to risk some lives?<br><br><img
