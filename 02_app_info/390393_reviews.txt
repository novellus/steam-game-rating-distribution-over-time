It is built around getting your fret hand in place to play an A chord barré in a fraction of a second, making a long slide on the E string, quickly bending the A string. The barré is definitely the greatest challenge; I couldn't get it right until I played over 1000 hours of Rocksmith. Once you can nail it, the song is very fun to play to people and watch their jaw drop.","timestamp_created":1574975444,"timestamp_updated":1574975444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwsL22e4CcKmL3wE="}
