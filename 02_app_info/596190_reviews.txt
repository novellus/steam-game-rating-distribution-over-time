It unlocks a pvp matchmaking thing in the terminal in the base, and it's entirely dead content. You cannot find a match in it. Not only this, but every time you enter the terminal, dickhead benitez gives you the same unskippable speal about playing it and no matter what you do, you can't make it stop until you queue into a match which, again, is fucking impossible to do because there isn't even 8 players that play this entire video game let alone 8 players that want to do this shit minigame to allow you to make it stop. i would literally pay to make them take this dlc away from me but even uninstalling it wont make it stop","timestamp_created":1608562750,"timestamp_updated":1608562750,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo/bzwvYCeM36uwI="}
