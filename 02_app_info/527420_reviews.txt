The story line flows well and the graphics are brilliant. Some of the mini games are very easy. The only negative that I have with this game is that is short and the bonus chapter is extremely short. Other than that it is a great game and I probably will get more in this series.","timestamp_created":1606703237,"timestamp_updated":1606703237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+Li+i/YCfYjLtQI="}
