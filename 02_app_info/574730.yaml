      you thought you had survived nature's worst.<br><br>Now, in the darkest days
      of winter, a terrible blizzard is sweeping the country.<br><br>Shivering in
      the storm, you hear the patter of hooves above you. Through the snow, you see
      a shimmering red light soaring through the air. What a jolly sight! Could it
      be Rudolph?  No. It's Garth, the red-nosed buffalo. And the Buffalizzard is
      only just beginning.<h2 class="bb_tag">This alternate version of <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/534720/"

      on the VR headset. The other players take turns controlling buffalo from the
