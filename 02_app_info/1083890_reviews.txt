The resource missions are very repetitve and feel like they are only there to prolong the content. The crew of Galactica is not likeable. Neither do the added ships have much of an impact. \n\nThis is a DLC you can skip.","timestamp_created":1605438075,"timestamp_updated":1605438075,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h57k5fUCfJTBrgI="}
