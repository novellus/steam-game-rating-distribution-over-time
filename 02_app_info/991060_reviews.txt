There's a lot of heliports (nine?), so to get the most out of this package you should fly a helicopter around the Faroe Islands, it's a lot of fun! I can recommend the Bell 407 which is a great helicopter.\nIf you're only into airplanes, I think this scenery is a bit too expensive for only using the EKVG airport.","timestamp_created":1589717517,"timestamp_updated":1589717517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rIijkfICfKCviAI="}
