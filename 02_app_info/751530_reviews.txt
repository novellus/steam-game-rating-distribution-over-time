The controls are alright, but it seems way too easy to get shot down even with a shield.  And you're usually going to hit something anyway and then it's parachute time down to the ground.  Funny thing, I got the fox or wolf upgrade which is supposed to hunt downed alien dudes, but it seems to be more interested in chowing down on you instead.  Also, I wish there was a way to skip the text at the start of every campaign mission.  Oh well, not for me.","timestamp_created":1557108148,"timestamp_updated":1557108148,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529703021049499512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8pi4xeoCfdPUwAE="}
