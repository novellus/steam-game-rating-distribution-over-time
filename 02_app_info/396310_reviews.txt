Usually when this is said in movies or games it's not true. However I googled a bit, and turns out that this indeed was based on the true story. Next part will be spoiler, because I recommend reading this article only after you have finished the game, because otherwise you will spoil yourself a lot of things. The story of this game is based on the [spoiler]serial killer Hamliton \"Albert\" Fish https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Fish [/spoiler]  \n\nWhat is this game about? This was taken from the store page so it's not a spoiler: \"A young man discovers through a series of hallucinations that he will grow up to become a violent psychopath. How will he respond to these revelations? Can he change his fate? Can you even... change fate...\" You play as the youngest child of some mentally ill family, which consists of masohistic brother, sadistic father who beats you whenever he wants, and mother who blames you for everything and keeps threatening you how your father will beat you. Everyone hates you in this family. So what is your goal in this game? Your goal is to find what is your fate and is there any way to change the fate, same as it was said in the store page description. So can you change your fate, are there any choices? No, you can't. And why is that? It's because as developer said in one thread, how this game is based on real life story, so you are not supposed to be able to change events of this story. You don't even get illusion of choices in this game, it's clear to you that you will not be able to change the fate and that you will become psychopath. How shocking! You are tortured your whole life, and it's suprise that you become psychopath one day. No S_H_I_T Sherlock. Basically like every psychopath ever. You can be terrible at statistics and you will still be able to guess outcome of this game. I understand that this story is interesting to developer cause he made this game based on this real person, but if you dont know backstory its just not that interesting unless you google it, but why would we be obliged to do so? Whole game you are doing some stupid pointless tasks, listening to gibberish, and interracting with disturbing people, really nothing interesting about story of this game. \n\nGameplay is classic Point&Click gameplay. You click on items, you have inventory, and you can use those items. Other than story and the gameplay, characters look very ugly, but that was done on purpose. Game is very short, around 2,3 hours long. It's also buggy game, 2 times I had to restart chapter cause item disappeared from my inventory for no reason.  Atmosphere is non-existent in my opinion, this game is soulless.\n\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1] This game is based on real life story, and you can read about it here: [spoiler]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Fish [/spoiler]  If you plan to buy the game, don't read this article before finishing the game, otherwise you are free to read it, but it's just sick stuff. Story is disturbing and not interesting at all, so in conclusion it's just disturbing, it's a bit buggy game, and very short, around 2,3 hours. I feel like I wasted my time playing this game. It's not a terrible game, but it doesn't offer much. I don't recommend it.\n\n[i]Note: This explains how I rate games in my reviews. https://imgur.com/gallery/z9ZjA47[/i]\n\n[h1]Personal rating: 5/10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1547232482,"timestamp_updated":1609873316,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.591038107872009277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiqv76fYCfbCLuAE="}
