    about_the_game: Gary the Gull is an VR Interactive Animated Short Film where you
      are part of the story! <br><br>You're about to enjoy a tasty lunch on a beach
      when a seagull shows up and starts talking to you. And you can talk back! Answer
      Gary's questions by nodding or shaking your head, talking (using voice recognition),
      or by doing nothing at all. Your decisions affect how the story plays out, giving
      you different experiences of the same narrative when you try it again. Interact
      with the environment by using motion controllers to draw in the sand, pick up
      your drink, or toss your flip-flops around on the beach.<br><br>Gary the Gull
      is directed by Mark Walsh of <i>Motional</i>, an 18-year Pixar writer-director
      and animation supervisor, including the director of the Pixar short film <i>Partysaurus
      Rex</i>. It was built in partnership with the ex-Pixar ex-Bungie team at <i>Limitless</i>.
