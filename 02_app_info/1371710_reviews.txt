Mostly because it's a lot of fun, but a little bit because of the nods to Skystrike ;) (a game I wrote many many years ago on the ST). If I were writing Skystrike again nowadays, I'd be pinching lots of stuff from Rogue Aces as it's an absolute belter :)\n\nRogue Aces is a properly difficult game, but you learn a lot in the early part of the game from your mistakes and immediately dive straight back in for another bash at it.","timestamp_created":1609709177,"timestamp_updated":1609709177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ipmJ5fYCetKZwAI="}
