      \ moves by looking at the cards they will use and select the most optimal card\
      \ to oppose them.<br><br>When combat begins, how the dice from your chosen card\

      \ on your librarian's feelings, positive outcomes or powerful effects with penalties\
      \ can occur.<br>In addition, as the emotional tension of the guests grows, the\
      \ difficulty of combat increases, yet at the same time, rarer books can be acquired.<br>Furthermore,\
