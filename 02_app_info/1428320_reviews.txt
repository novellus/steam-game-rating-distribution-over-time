I have to uninstall and reinstall the game 3 times to finally get all achievements to pop.\n\nAgain, I got what I came for...but if you are going make an achievement game that isn't even fun to play....at the very least, make sure it works correctly.\n","timestamp_created":1609324505,"timestamp_updated":1609324505,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+uTN2fYCe7XevgI="}
