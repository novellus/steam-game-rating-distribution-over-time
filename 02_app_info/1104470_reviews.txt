Nobody i have ever talked to has heard of this game and 25 years later im still quoting it and getting weird looks. \n\n Superhero League of Hoboken has a very funny story that adds famous sites around the New York area into the environment. This game is a turn-based combat rpg with point and click environments. You can customize attributes on your characters with different items you find throughout the game. Music can be a little annoying because of some sharp notes, but i would rank it somewhere between ok-ish to digging-it. Interface is CLUNKY AF, but not unbearable. You can navigate using your keyboard or mouse.\n\nBOTTOMLINE:\n If you are looking for a mostly unknown gem, and can be patient with the aged parts of the gameplay, you'll find a really solid and entertaining adventure that is filled with cheap laughs and topical puzzles. - 7/10","timestamp_created":1587589372,"timestamp_updated":1587589840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.739644527435302734","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyM/u0fECeKjkggI="}
