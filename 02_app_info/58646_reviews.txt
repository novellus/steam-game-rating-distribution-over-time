I cannot recommend the game therefore because multiplayer is the best aspect and yet the games are always full of a lot of arrogant, argumentative, rude, aggressive and hostile people (nasty pieces of work sums it up). For this reason you can barely ever just enjoy a game without some sub-human racist trying to pick a fight over every aspect of the game or some egoist blowing his own trumpet so hard it makes you want to vomit with disgust. People sprouting pathetic insults everywhere, complaining constantly and sometimes even team killing your units to be antagonistic. If you can find enjoyment beyond this fact the actual game is pretty awesome. I however have decided to uninstall the game to avoid this perpetual abuse.","timestamp_created":1566602036,"timestamp_updated":1566602036,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.419972002506256104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwssCw4OwCfLb40AE="}
