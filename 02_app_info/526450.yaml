    review: This game is super freaking boring, the other two were okay but all three
      fall into the same issues. The games are super repetitive and all around not
      interesting. The plot twists at the end of all three games are really dumb and
      take me out of the immersion. Also the voice acting, the horrible voice acting,
      there is no emotion in any voices in these games. I beat these games only because
      i remember them from when i was younger and because i like beating games, but
      it was NOT worth it. I want my 20 hours on this entire series back
