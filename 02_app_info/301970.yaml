    short_description: "Screencheat is a ridiculous competitive split-screen first-person\
      \ shooter where everyone is invisible, so players are forced to look at each\
      \ other\u2019s screens in order to win. Supporting both local and online multiplayer,\
      \ combat in Screencheat is fast and furious with a wide variety of one-hit kill\
      \ weapons."
