Save your money and spend it on a game whose devs aren't actively involved in censoring negative publicity. I was actually fairly mild in my initial criticism of the game because I thought the devs had tried to make something cool. \nI can safely say now (after reflecting) that the game is awful and way too expensive. (Biased, I know.)\nThe UI is shocking.\nThe gameplay is trash.\nThe devs are abusing the Youtube copyright takedown system.\nAvoid this and any further games by this developer.\n\n*Original Review*\nI really want to enjoy this game but it is essentially a 3d hidden object fetch quest game with a lot of missing localization and placeholder object names.\nThe UI is really really annoying.\nThe premise is pretty cool but I think it got lost in the execution phase.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FnOhxv_cPAU","timestamp_created":1583235782,"timestamp_updated":1587084970,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.592183589935302734","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1587366464,"developer_response":"Hello,\nWe contacted you via email on April 6th, but so far we have received no answer."}],"cursor":"AoJwgdnowvECe/3t9QE="}
