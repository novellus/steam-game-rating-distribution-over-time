Although i may not have that much hours on this game (i roughly have about 3 minutes on this particular game) this is still very much worth your money. When i bought the game well actually it wasnt me it was my friend that was on my account but it was discounted at the time but the point that i am trying to get to is that ever since that moment my life has never been the same.I have only had positive experiences since i have gotten it, some examples of this is that i was on a game of csgo when two random strangers gifted me karambits!! This has honestly been such a good experience  and i am recommending this game to everyone who wants to have a good time.","timestamp_created":1566961865,"timestamp_updated":1566961865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kpKN6+wCeLad0QE="}
