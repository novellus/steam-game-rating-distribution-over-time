      \ been developed. It was created to help patients recover their memories. But\
      \ the hospital was attacked. The drug was stolen, and all the staff and patients\
      \ were killed. Explosion and conflagration destroyed a part of the hospital.\
      \ And Jack was the only survivor. As a result of a strong explosion, Jack lost\
      \ some of his memory, he remembers only small fragments of what have happened.\
      \ <br><br>Jack is helped by Dr. Romanov \u2013 the chief scientist of Memority\
      \ hospital and the mastermind behind the drug. During the whole game, the protagonist\
      \ will be staying in a hospital bed, and all the gameplay will occur in his\
      \ memories restored with Rammex. The game world is divided into two parts: the\
      \ real world, where the hero is confined to a hospital bed, and the world of\

      \ one person who jumps down from the dam trying to commit suicide. Realizing\
