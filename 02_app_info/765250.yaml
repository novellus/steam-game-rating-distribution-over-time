    review: "**After 2 years of waiting for an update changing this to not recommended*\n\
      \n\nFun little game that is obviously in early Alpha.\n\n I decided to buy the\
      \ game to support the devs.\n\nAfter playing it for an hour I wanted to let\
      \ you know it runs super smooth and is already a decent city builder and management\
      \ game. Well worth the $10 to have a little fun running a viking town.\n\nIdeas/Suggestions\n\
      \nMOBS:\n Add Mobs: Farmable mobs like chickens, cows, pigs, etc...\nAdd Aggressive\
      \ Mobs: Rival Vikings, Pirates, ets...\nAdd Useful Mobs: Horses, Donkeys, Bees,\
      \ Birds, Deer, snakes, etc...\n\nFarming Depth:\nCreating a fenced in area and\
      \ dropping a person in it is pretty simple for sure. Spice it up a little bit\
      \ and maybe give us the ability to pick what we grow. This would make having\
      \ multiple farms/farmers worth while, as well as add another element to farming.\n\
      \nFishing Depth:\nI like the fishing dock but why not add more to it? Maybe\
      \ fishing boats, nets, etc for the vikings to use. Maybe give us the ability\
      \ to build boats for fishing/fighting.\n\nReally we are lacking weapons and\
      \ war. I am sure many people would love at least something simple to fight...\
      \ just don't make it something crazy although I would not be opposed to dragons.\
      \ ;-)"
