    review: 'Unfortunately, I can''t recommend this game 100%. It is very interesting
      and even though I dislike point and click adventures and visual novels this
      somehow manages to tickle my fancies. It is unfinished though. I talked to the
      dev and it was a very pleasant experience. She explains why this game is like
      this and she knows that it is underdeveloped. If you want to support the dev
      just buy it and try it out.
