      \ /><br><br>Take a the driver seat of one out of five different tramways and\
      \ explore D\xFCsseldorf anno 1981! Drive across the great Jan-Wellem-Platz,\
      \ cross the Rhine over the Oberkassler bridge and really turn up when it goes\
      \ over the overland route to Krefeld!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Tramways</h2>The\
      \ addon includes typical D\xFCsseldorf vehicles; all of them have a wide range\
      \ of functions. Here is a brief overview:<br><br><strong>GT8S</strong><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374770/extras/GT8S_Description.png?t=1608846664\"\
      \ /><br>Construction: 1973 - 1975<br>max speed: ~76km/h<br><br>The GT8S is the\
      \ first light rail vehicle of the Rheinische Bahngesellschaft AG and was intended\
      \ to drive through the new tunnel. But this never happened, instead 40 vehicles\
      \ of this type were converted into GT8SU, the remaining vehicles remained in\
      \ the tram network. The vehicle has driving and braking control via a setpoint\
      \ device and is a real bi-directional vehicle. Despite the setpoint generator,\
      \ it remains a challenge to drive this headstrong vehicle.<br><br><strong>GT6*/GT8</strong><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374770/extras/GT8_Description.png?t=1608846664\"\
      \ /><br>Construction: 1956 - 1969<br>max speed: ~65km/h<br><br>Rising passenger\
      \ numbers and increased demands on local public transport forced Rheinische\
      \ Bahngesellschaft AG to act. Together with the D\xFCsseldorf wagon factory\
      \ &quot;D\xFCWag&quot;, RBG AG developed a new vehicle type in 1956, which had\
      \ a walk-in joint by means of a Jakob bogie. The GT6 was born and was quickly\
      \ produced in large numbers. In 1958, D\xFCWag installed a middle section in\
      \ the freshly delivered 2310 railcar for its own account, which marked the birth\
      \ of the GT8. Since then the vehicles have been built in all imaginable variations\
      \ and sold in many West German cities. The Rheinbahn alone had 167 GT6 and GT8\
      \ at peak times.<br>However, that is no reason to turn the wheel: The crank\
      \ switch is more demanding to drive than the setpoint generator and requires\
      \ the highest concentration from the player at all times in order to drive the\
      \ train safely through D\xFCsseldorf and the surrounding area.<br><br><strong>B80D\
      \ Stahl</strong><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374770/extras/B80_Description.png?t=1608846664\"\
      \ /><br>Construction: 1981<br>max speed: ~80km/h<br><br>Called by some as the\
      \ cr\xE8me de la cr\xE8me of rail vehicle construction, the B80D is the vehicle\
      \ that was ordered and built exclusively for the light rail lines. With comfortable\
      \ air suspension, three-phase motors and a sophisticated control system, it\
      \ is the ideal vehicle for overland and tunnel routes for both the driver and\
      \ the passenger.<br><br><strong>GT8SU</strong><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374770/extras/GT8SU_Description.png?t=1608846664\"\
      \ /><br>Baujahr: 1981-1984<br>vMax: ~76km/h<br><br>Developed from the GT8S,\
      \ the GT8SU is a typical conversion vehicle. Its great advantage is the universal\
      \ usability both in the tunnel and on the surface, which is achieved by the\
      \ complex folding step construction. You can clearly see where it was developed\
      \ from, but there are more differences than you might expect!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >The Map: D\xFCsseldorf in 1981</h2>In 1981 D\xFCsseldorf had an extensive tram\
      \ network and many lines that connected not only the city center, but also the\
      \ outskirts and neighboring cities to the state capital. You will experience\
      \ three lines with this addon:<br><br>In addition to D\xFCsseldorf city center\
      \ with the main train station and above all the central junction, the &quot;Jan-Wellem-Platz&quot;,\
      \ you can also go to Belsenplatz in the direction of Krefeld Rheinstrasse. The\
      \ scenery changes from an urban big city and highways in the center to Wilhelminian\
      \ style houses and old buildings in Oberkassel, further to fallow industrial\
      \ areas in Niederkassel and L\xF6rick, to forests and meadows in Meerbusch until\
      \ finally the settlement in Krefeld is reached again.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374770/extras/Luegallee_Description.png?t=1608846664\"\
      \ /><br><br>For fans of debauched track systems, the route offers the four-track\
      \ stop Hauptbahnhof with a three-track turning loop and an extra turning track\
      \ for line 76, Jan-Wellem-Platz with its countless train and bus platforms,\
      \ the three-track stops Opera House, Belsenplatz and Meerbusch-Haus Meer , the\
      \ Meerbusch-Hoterheide reversing loop with an equally abstruse track layout\
      \ and the four-rail track in Krefeld with the old turning system on Rheinstrasse\
      \ in Krefeld.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374770/extras/JWP_Description.png?t=1608846664\"\
      \ /><br><br>All the vehicles that are used on the three lines must of course\
      \ also find shelter. In addition, we offer the depot at Am Steinberg, which\
      \ has 17 tracks for the trams. Built in 1907, the hall has been preserved to\
      \ this day and now offers a roof and pit for today's historic vehicles that\
      \ were still in daily use in the add-on.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374770/extras/Steinberg_Discription.png?t=1608846664\"\
      \ /><br>Current state of Development!<br><br>For a rough overview, we have a\

      \ Game</h1><strong>Welcome in D\xFCsseldorf!</strong><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374770/extras/Main_Title.png?t=1608846664\"\
      \ /><br><br>Take a the driver seat of one out of five different tramways and\
      \ explore D\xFCsseldorf anno 1981! Drive across the great Jan-Wellem-Platz,\
      \ cross the Rhine over the Oberkassler bridge and really turn up when it goes\
      \ over the overland route to Krefeld!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Tramways</h2>The\
      \ addon includes typical D\xFCsseldorf vehicles; all of them have a wide range\
      \ of functions. Here is a brief overview:<br><br><strong>GT8S</strong><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374770/extras/GT8S_Description.png?t=1608846664\"\
      \ /><br>Construction: 1973 - 1975<br>max speed: ~76km/h<br><br>The GT8S is the\
      \ first light rail vehicle of the Rheinische Bahngesellschaft AG and was intended\
      \ to drive through the new tunnel. But this never happened, instead 40 vehicles\
      \ of this type were converted into GT8SU, the remaining vehicles remained in\
      \ the tram network. The vehicle has driving and braking control via a setpoint\
      \ device and is a real bi-directional vehicle. Despite the setpoint generator,\
      \ it remains a challenge to drive this headstrong vehicle.<br><br><strong>GT6*/GT8</strong><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374770/extras/GT8_Description.png?t=1608846664\"\
      \ /><br>Construction: 1956 - 1969<br>max speed: ~65km/h<br><br>Rising passenger\
      \ numbers and increased demands on local public transport forced Rheinische\
      \ Bahngesellschaft AG to act. Together with the D\xFCsseldorf wagon factory\
      \ &quot;D\xFCWag&quot;, RBG AG developed a new vehicle type in 1956, which had\
      \ a walk-in joint by means of a Jakob bogie. The GT6 was born and was quickly\
      \ produced in large numbers. In 1958, D\xFCWag installed a middle section in\
      \ the freshly delivered 2310 railcar for its own account, which marked the birth\
      \ of the GT8. Since then the vehicles have been built in all imaginable variations\
      \ and sold in many West German cities. The Rheinbahn alone had 167 GT6 and GT8\
      \ at peak times.<br>However, that is no reason to turn the wheel: The crank\
      \ switch is more demanding to drive than the setpoint generator and requires\
      \ the highest concentration from the player at all times in order to drive the\
      \ train safely through D\xFCsseldorf and the surrounding area.<br><br><strong>B80D\
      \ Stahl</strong><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374770/extras/B80_Description.png?t=1608846664\"\
      \ /><br>Construction: 1981<br>max speed: ~80km/h<br><br>Called by some as the\
      \ cr\xE8me de la cr\xE8me of rail vehicle construction, the B80D is the vehicle\
      \ that was ordered and built exclusively for the light rail lines. With comfortable\
      \ air suspension, three-phase motors and a sophisticated control system, it\
      \ is the ideal vehicle for overland and tunnel routes for both the driver and\
      \ the passenger.<br><br><strong>GT8SU</strong><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374770/extras/GT8SU_Description.png?t=1608846664\"\
      \ /><br>Baujahr: 1981-1984<br>vMax: ~76km/h<br><br>Developed from the GT8S,\
      \ the GT8SU is a typical conversion vehicle. Its great advantage is the universal\
      \ usability both in the tunnel and on the surface, which is achieved by the\
      \ complex folding step construction. You can clearly see where it was developed\
      \ from, but there are more differences than you might expect!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >The Map: D\xFCsseldorf in 1981</h2>In 1981 D\xFCsseldorf had an extensive tram\
      \ network and many lines that connected not only the city center, but also the\
      \ outskirts and neighboring cities to the state capital. You will experience\
      \ three lines with this addon:<br><br>In addition to D\xFCsseldorf city center\
      \ with the main train station and above all the central junction, the &quot;Jan-Wellem-Platz&quot;,\
      \ you can also go to Belsenplatz in the direction of Krefeld Rheinstrasse. The\
      \ scenery changes from an urban big city and highways in the center to Wilhelminian\
      \ style houses and old buildings in Oberkassel, further to fallow industrial\
      \ areas in Niederkassel and L\xF6rick, to forests and meadows in Meerbusch until\
      \ finally the settlement in Krefeld is reached again.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374770/extras/Luegallee_Description.png?t=1608846664\"\
      \ /><br><br>For fans of debauched track systems, the route offers the four-track\
      \ stop Hauptbahnhof with a three-track turning loop and an extra turning track\
      \ for line 76, Jan-Wellem-Platz with its countless train and bus platforms,\
      \ the three-track stops Opera House, Belsenplatz and Meerbusch-Haus Meer , the\
      \ Meerbusch-Hoterheide reversing loop with an equally abstruse track layout\
      \ and the four-rail track in Krefeld with the old turning system on Rheinstrasse\
      \ in Krefeld.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374770/extras/JWP_Description.png?t=1608846664\"\
      \ /><br><br>All the vehicles that are used on the three lines must of course\
      \ also find shelter. In addition, we offer the depot at Am Steinberg, which\
      \ has 17 tracks for the trams. Built in 1907, the hall has been preserved to\
      \ this day and now offers a roof and pit for today's historic vehicles that\
      \ were still in daily use in the add-on.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374770/extras/Steinberg_Discription.png?t=1608846664\"\
      \ /><br>Current state of Development!<br><br>For a rough overview, we have a\
      \ network plan for you:<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/374770/extras/Netzplan_Description.png?t=1608846664\"\
