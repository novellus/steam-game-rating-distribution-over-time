It should be located somewhere like:\n\nC:\\\\Programs\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\Okhlos\\\\Okhlos - DLC - Encyclopaedia\n\nYou can then drag out the PDF document onto your desktop.\n\nReview:\nIt is a nice requiem of the magnificent humor of the game and worth the money. It is also made in a way so that you could technically print out the pages and make little booklets out of it. Since there is no wiki for the game, you can also use it to check the heroes which you are missing for the achievements so you would know which ones to buy in game. There are some small formatting and spelling mistakes, in case you have serious OCD and can't bare that kind of stuff.\n\nMy OCD couldn't bare the thought of this encyclopedia not having a review oO. Also I love the game and the devs.","timestamp_created":1499983518,"timestamp_updated":1499983518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.732577800750732422","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk4P/nt0CcObrfw=="}
