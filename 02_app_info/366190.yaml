    review: "This is what's installed on my computer, while AGK is installed on my\
      \ phone.  While I like that the lighting physics have had several adjustments\
      \ in CopperCube 6, since the swf was removed and the Javascript is still version\
      \ 3 in both 5 and 6 until later updates, I think 5 Pro has more benefits to\
      \ me since I am still in the planning stages of a game.  For the planning stages,\
      \ I think CopperCube Pro is great.  As far as outputs, the more the merrier.\
      \ When it comes to considering making a game pretty, well, AGK is on phones,\
      \ works on Linux, and has incredible manuals available in addition to all the\
      \ documentation available online.  \n\nI remember when I first got CopperCube\
      \ Pro DLC, I ran across a dismal scripting interface, but when I open it these\
      \ days the scripting window is far more of what I expect of a good spartan scripting\
      \ window.\n\nThe major weakness of CopperCube is a lack of walkthroughs, example\
      \ games to learn from, and offline documentation.  I think the documentation\
      \ on the website for CopperCube is very nice, yet when compared to AGK, even\
      \ the phone app has example games to look at and learn from.  CopperCube is\
      \ more like getting a nice toolbox with no one to learn from."
