Everytime clicking on trading posts card doesn't make sense. Already visible area on the top can be used.\n\nAlso when we get \"1 gold token acts as any 2 chip\" power there is a flaw. Assume I need 4 green to purchase a card, and I have 3 green and 1 gold chips. Game takes all the green chips then the gold chip. But instead I may choose 1 gold chip (which stands for 2 green chips because of power) and 2 green chips. So I still have 1 green chip available.","timestamp_created":1585865972,"timestamp_updated":1585866079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.727581799030303955","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sf++nvECcpbB/QE="}
