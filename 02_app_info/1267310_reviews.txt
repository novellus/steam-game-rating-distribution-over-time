Understandable since it's an indie game but it's still a problem. No crashes or soft locking bugs tho.\n\nSolid game for a very cheap price, totally worth it.","timestamp_created":1609848733,"timestamp_updated":1609848733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41Med6fYCcZTXwAI="}
