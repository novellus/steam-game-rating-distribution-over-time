      /><br><br>StellarHub is a starbase management game with strong survival elements,
      where you act as the Captain of a space station embarked on a pioneering mission
      to build new homes for humans in outer space.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/672860/extras/titles_key_eng.png?t=1592027318"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Assemble modules to build an extensive station</h2><br>You
      can choose from a range of 30 different modules (including solar panels, research
      labs, crew quarters, organic farms, greenhouses and many more) equipped with
      all kind of facilities to ensure your station stays functional and safe. Every
      module consumes a certain amount of energy and oxygen and needs time and resources
      to be assembled so ponder your choices carefully!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/672860/extras/modules.jpg?t=1592027318"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Manage, take care and enhance your station crew</h2><br>Each
      crew member is endowed with a unique set of skills and abilities, as well as
      personality traits and specific needs. Find the most efficient way to assign
      them to various tasks such as construction, extraction of resources, research
      and trade. Watch your crew thrive but always remember to keep an eye on their
      morale and health conditions -- once someone dies they're gone forever! Preserve
      them by building special modules for leisure activities and med bays.<br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Develop research and trade to enhance the efficiency of
      your station</h2><br>Use the Scientific Research Map to unlock special bonuses
      and technologies that affect some vital aspects of your station ecosystem such
      as the speed of resource depletion, the power of your defense weapons, the growth
      rate of livestock and so on. Trade ores and other resources with space merchants
      to avoid running out of funds or supplies.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/672860/extras/research_full.jpg?t=1592027318"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Test your planning skills on different types of environments</h2>You
      will be able to choose among 6 different worlds offering unique playing conditions
      and challenges to face (sun and meteor activity, the presence of space pirates,
      resource amount and placement, etc.) or to randomly generate a completely new
      map. Will you be able to master them all?<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/672860/extras/battles2.jpg?t=1592027318"

    review: Frequent crashes. The concept of the game itself is good. You order guys
      around to do work for you. The problem is that its too difficult to issue these
      orders and then they ignore them. Poorly executed.
