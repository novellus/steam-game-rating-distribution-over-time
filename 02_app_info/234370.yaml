    short_description: An Environmental Puzzle Game About Family, Grit, and Survival.Grays
      roam the land, largely in the absence of human interference. These aren't your
      typical Zed -- theirs is a very different sort of apocalypse. Animals spontaneously
      transform into twisted, violent beings. The earth decays, collapsing into a
      network of abysses.

    review: 'I quite liked this one.  It reminds me of arcade games like Boulder Dash,
      but with a story.  Basically in each level you are set down in a maze and told
      to kill all the zombies.  They bill it is as a puzzle game, but the emphasis
      is much more on avoiding the zombies, the puzzle comes into it in that usually
      you must kill the zombies and pick things up in a proper order.  It did get
      a bit repetitive eventually, but I could see myself coming back to it and playing
      a few levels here and there.


      The hub on which all of the little levels are built off of is quite unique,
      and is also where the story progresses.


      About the only thing I don''t like is the same thing I''ve experienced with
      all of the Arcen games I''ve tried and that''s that there''s always a lot of
      filler.  Rather than a few lovely levels there are tons and tons of samey levels.  I''m
      sure the lovely levels are in here, but it''s why I''ve gotten tired of it before
      the end.'
