    review: "4\u20AC - Typical marketplace price. Here, you get a reskin, its own\
      \ custom train with 5 special cars (no interior), and free 1000 points in a\
      \ minimalistic, but fine little scenario. The default consist can be used in\
      \ place of an HST.\nThe design & quality matches the early TS era.\nTolerable,\
      \ not realistic engine sounds, something like the Settle-Carlisle 66.\nVery\
      \ easy to drive, no fancy controls. You can take that as a positive or negative;\
      \ it's beginner / casual quick drive friendly.\nIf you like it, you can consider\
      \ either of the other 67 packs."
