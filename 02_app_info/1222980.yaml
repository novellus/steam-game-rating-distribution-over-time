    review: 'A simple but fun Space Invaders game.  Unlike Space Invaders Extreme
      here on Steam, you do not need a constant internet connection to play it.  Wow!


      Pros:

      + It''s fun and cheap

      + Excellent arcadey sound effects with booming bass!

      + Enemy variety, Upgrades and Bosses spice up the classic formula


      Cons:

      - More visual options would be nice.  I don''t need to see a "0" pop up when
      my hit scores zero points.

      - Audio mix options would be nice.  At first I thought the fun music in the
      game''s trailer was not in the game.  It is there but very quiet compared to
      the sound effects.

      - Upgrade system is very simple.  Single level for each upgrade that times out.

      - I think you have to start from the very beginning for each new game (like
      an old-school arcade game).

      - A few bugs.  Once I killed all enemies but the game did not move on to the
      next level.
