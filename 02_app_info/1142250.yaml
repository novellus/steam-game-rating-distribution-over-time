    review: "okay... having just finished Po's route (on novel mode), I feel like\
      \ I can review chapter 2. uhh, SPOILERS, obviously. maybe. \n\nI'm not sure\
      \ if it's just because i'm on Novel mode, but everything after Po tries to write\
      \ an apology to Fraype, and then decides to clean his shop instead, feels kind\
      \ of... rushed? Not to mention that plot point never actually going anywhere\
      \ in his route. There's a lot of time that goes by without having any Po events,\
      \ which is kind of weird on his \"route\". Also, I'm not sure why \none of the\
      \ days in Po's Novel mode route is almost completely dedicated to Tsitsi, I\
      \ think Nil shopping for the crossdressing supplies makes a lot more sense,\
      \ because it features more of Po and actually provides some backstory for him\
      \ as well. The overarching plot outside of the routes is kind of like AWSW,\
      \ but I adored AWSW, so i'm down with it. I am of course sad that there's no\
      \ more Po content after finishing his route, because he is hands-down my favorite\
      \ character, but the date scene was nice. \n\nSorry I responded to this like\
      \ it was a piece of fanfiction, but it needed to be done."
