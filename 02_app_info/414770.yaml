    about_the_game: "Over 6 years in development, BIONITE: Origins is the first in\
      \ a series of games set in the future of mankind. The mysterious element called\
      \ \u201CBionite\u201D is accidentally found on Venus by a crew of prospectors\
      \ looking for deposits of Helium3. They soon learn that Bionite has a very unique\
      \ quality that has laid dormant for thousands of years.  In order to extract\
      \ the Bionite a massive mining operation is built on Venus.  As the result of\
      \ a minor disagreement with the military, a group of scientists are banished\
      \ from Earth and form their own faction dedicated to stopping the military.\
      \  Because of its nefarious uses by the military and the spread of mining facilities\
      \ throughout the galaxy, the Rebel Faction has dedicated itself to stopping\
      \ all Bionite production. Players can participate in battles on the Military\
      \ Side (IMI) or for the Rebel Faction. Sniping an enemy vehicle for infiltrating\
      \ the enemy base is a great way to launch a sneak attack\u2026<br />\r\n <br\
      \ />\r\nThe game includes 3 maps; The Emze Mine (located on Venus), Biodome\
      \ 24 (located on Mars), and Hadley\u2019s Hope (located on the Moon). This release\
      \ is a single player version against the computer which includes Skirmish Mode.\
      \ The fully developed turn based missions are currently in development and will\
      \ be released with the Full Version.  It is also intended to introduce gamers\
      \ to the complex command system used in the game. There is a learning curve\
      \ for Bionite: Origins and requires some time to develop the skills necessary\
      \ to lead a successful campaign against the enemy.  We like to think of the\
      \ game as \u201CChess on Steroids\u201D. It requires players to understand how\
      \ to develop successful military strategies while relying on vehicle-driving\
      \ skills to win and advance in rank."

    review: 'As others have said, this game unfortunately seems to have grinded to
      a halt since 2018? Developers obviously lost interest. It''s a buggy mess that
      is totally unplayable at this stage, controls are whacky and nothing seems to
      work right. Don''t buy it.


      I thought something great would come of this... it''s a shame. Oh well, Battlezone
      Redux and Battlezone: Combat Commander are on Steam so we have them now. Shame
      we can''t get our money back now.'
