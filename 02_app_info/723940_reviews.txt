The visuals are appealing and immersive, and the historical background was nicely presented (for those of us who enjoy these things).  I'm especially a fan of the way this series lets you complete the game - collectibles and achievements - through the Extras menu after the fact.  There are no Steam achievements, but it's fun to work toward the in-game achievements.\n\nPros:\n- nice artwork, appropriate music, good voice acting\n- lots to do both in each scene and overall\n- the bonus chapter feels more coherent than usual (and the story is good)\n- the post-game access to puzzles and HO scenes is excellent\n- there is the usual Adventure Game Logic(TM), but I rarely had to stare at the map wondering \"what now?\"\n- fully interactive map and customizable difficulty settings\n\nCons:\n- two or three abrupt transitions between major locations\n- I prefer fewer overall locations with more to do per location; however, the variety is nice\n\n[b]Overall:[/b] While still not my favourite of the Eipix (for Big Fish) series, this game was interesting and well-worth adding to any HOPA library.  It felt a little contrived at first, but I became more engaged as the game went on.  The characters of the villains were better defined and even (slightly) nuanced, compared to earlier games in the series.","timestamp_created":1605048795,"timestamp_updated":1605048894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.592183470726013184","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo9CX2vUCd6TSrQI="}
