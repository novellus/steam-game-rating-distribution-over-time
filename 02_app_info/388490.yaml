    short_description: After waking from a terrifying dream of your own untimely death,
      you attempt to make your way to the Finnigan Brothers' Fun Park for its last
      day then back home again. It's like playing Russian roulette with five chambers
      loaded, but more frustrating.

    review: "Short text based game with achievements and trading cards (not dropped,\
      \ must be bought on market or through badge booster packs) that requires the\
      \ lost art of reading and that even more ancient art of knowing the reference\
      \ used for the pun or punchline.  I personally nominate this character for a\
      \ Darwin Award ... now 131 times.\n\nThis might be free-to-play but the 0.99\
      \ cents (US) DLC is worth adding, and quite often on sale for 0.49 cents.  111\
      \ different ways to die (with DLC added), some bizarre, some funny, some absurb,\
      \ some WTF, some STEAM related and all a reference or pun to something (even\
      \ the page titles).   With the 2015 Halloween update there are now 121 ways\
      \ to die (The 10 Halloween related deaths give the achievement The Hallowest.)\
      \  The developer added another 10 deaths for 2015 Christmas and claims this\
      \ will be the last time. (The 10 Christmas related deaths give the achievement\
      \ Crimson X-Mas).  Note: Both of the holiday related deaths and corresponding\
      \ achievements are only available during that particular holiday. \n\nIn the\
      \ 2019 update, the music is better, picture graphics have been added and the\
      \ game play has been tweaked.  It is much easier to die now.  Not sure I would\
      \ still recommend it since all the dying gets in the way of the absurd story\
      \ of getting to the fun fair, winning an elephant, and making it home alive\
      \ again.  It was much more fun to work at dying in bizarre, unusual and downright\
      \ stupid ways.     \n\n\n\nReview edited 11/1/2015\nRevised 12/23/2015\nUpdated\
      \ and revised 11/2/2019 Developer promised not add another achievement but did\
      \ anyway."
