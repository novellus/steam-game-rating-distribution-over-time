If you're into that, this is recommended.\n\nI have fun playing this game locally, but without that personal touch, it's just going to be frustrating, especially as the game demands your attention being on everything, including your opponents piece, their next piece, combos their setting up, their meter, and have an understanding of how it all connects together. For something like this, there might be a bit too much going on for a genre that generally is recommended for it's simplicity. \n\nNot bad, but not recommended over Poyo Poyo Tetris.","timestamp_created":1533695896,"timestamp_updated":1533695896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwnMXZi+UCffvopwE="}
