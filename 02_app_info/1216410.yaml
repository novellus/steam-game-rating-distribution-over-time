    about_the_game: "Change Ranger, developed by Joy Way Games, is a new first person\
      \ shooter and puzzle game in virtual reality. In each level of the game you\u2019\
      re given a limited period of \u201Cfrozen time\u201D in which you must alter\
      \ the scene just enough to result in the destruction of your enemies when time\
      \ starts flowing normally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach level in the game consists\
      \ of three phases:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. Time flows at normal speed. The location\
      \ is filled with enemies who rush to kill you. They are just about to pull their\
      \ triggers or otherwise bring rain death upon you when...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      2. Time stops. This is your chance to save yourself by cleverly altering the\
      \ scene. You can, for example, strategically change the direction of an enemy\u2019\
      s pointed gun. During this phase, a timer shows you exactly how many seconds\
      \ you have until time returns to normal.<br />\r\n <br />\r\n3. Time is restored\
      \ to normal. You are instantly transported back to the original position of\
      \ your body and your enemies continue on whatever trajectory and with whatever\
      \ momentum they had before time stopped. If you\u2019ve managed to make the\
      \ right changes while time was frozen, your enemies will be simultaneously destroyed\
      \ and you\u2019ll move on to the next level unscathed. However, if you\u2019\
      ve miscalculated, you\u2019ll suffer the wrath of your enemies\u2019 vastly\
      \ superior firepower.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Change Ranger, each level presents\
      \ you with increasingly complex challenges and offers you an increasing variety\
      \ of tools at your disposal. The deviously clever alterations you\u2019ll need\
      \ to make while time is frozen include redirecting a car, arming a bomb, strategically\
      \ opening or closing a door, directing an enemy\u2019s hand to a lever that\
      \ triggers the devastating fall of a weight, and positioning an object to result\
      \ in a deadly bullet or shrapnel ricochet. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMake sure you\
      \ get it just right though because if your changes don\u2019t manage to result\
      \ in the complete destruction of your enemies, you\u2019ll be the one who ends\
      \ up dead when time starts flowing again!"
