    review: "Whoa! Quite the epic proposition here.\n\n   139 tracks - yes, you heard\
      \ me, ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-NINE TRACKS - with the series' usual fair variety\
      \ of moods, tending mostly towards orchestral-style/fantasy-themed compositions.\
      \ \n\n   Evidently, the value being offered here is quite phenomenal. About\
      \ the only other way you could get so much high-quality instrumental music for\
      \ cheap (or rather, free) is to pirate it. You're not one of those filthy pirates,\
      \ are you? Of course you're not... \n\n   Four bucks, you f*ck. If you already\
      \ own the game, you have precious little excuse. Even if you don't normally\
      \ listen to instrumental music, maybe it's time you started. Miley f*cking Cyrus\
      \ is rich enough, already. The good people behind this product could put your\
      \ money to much, much better use I suspect. (It won't go straight up their nose,\
      \ for starters.)\n\n   Verdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel\
      \ free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\n\
