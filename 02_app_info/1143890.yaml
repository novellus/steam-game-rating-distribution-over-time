    review: "HMS Leopard, for me personaly best looking ship in game.\nPretty quick\
      \ ship with fine punch, not like being under fire\nIts something between Indefatigable\
      \ and Agammemnon.\n\nmin crew 160 max 400\nship can be equiped with full carronades.\n\
      \nIf you new and looking for good premium 4th rate ship \nfor grind beggining\
      \ lvl am reccomend get Rattvisan more due to \nit armor cannons number and decent\
      \ speed."
