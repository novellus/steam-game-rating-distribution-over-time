    about_the_game: "World War 3 is a multiplayer military FPS set in a modern, global\
      \ conflict. Strong teamplay, national armed forces, real locations, full body\
      \ awareness and a versatile customization system all contribute to the authenticity\
      \ of the modern combat experience enhanced by other essential elements such\
      \ as a robust ballistic system, advanced armors and life-like weapons. Produced\
      \ in cooperation with military R&amp;D centers and consultants, World War 3\
      \ shows the consequences of every battle in the context of a global war campaign\
      \ on a strategic war map.<br><br><br><strong>KEY FEATURES:</strong><br><br><strong>Modern\
      \ Battlefield Experience</strong><br>World War 3 presents a modern conflict\
      \ with tactics, techniques and procedures inspired by true combat engagements.\
      \ All of this packed into two exciting game modes. Warzone offers opportunities\
      \ for dynamic, intense firefights in teamwork-focused battles of infantry and\
      \ armored units over fortified points. The tactically-oriented Recon allows\
      \ players to cooperate within small reconnaissance squads left on their own\

    review: "A frankly excellent game. \nPeople complain about a small playerbase\
      \ but there is always a minimum of 1 server with enough players for a good game.\
      \ \nFar more than expected from an early access release - especially so when\
      \ compared to the other offerings when browsing early access on the steam store.\
      \ \nLooking forward to many more happy hours on this title and the upcoming\
      \ release of v1.0\n\n\n\nEDIT: well several months have passed since i left\
      \ this review - What a tragic shame about this game. \nSo the discord server\
      \ is full of people talking about the game all day every day. I just wonder\
      \ who they're playing with. \nFor the last 3 days I have been sat at home under\
      \ quarrantine so I've had plenty of time to keep an eye on this - The most I've\
      \ seen online was 3 people. \nYes, 3. \nDuring peak hours too - 19:00 GMT. \n\
      So disregard my initial review that there's always enough players for a fun\
      \ match and I re-iterate - a tragic shame. "
