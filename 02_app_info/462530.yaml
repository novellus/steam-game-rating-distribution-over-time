    review: 'This is a disappointing tech demo. While the photogrammetry-produced
      human models ARE impressive, they don''t do much. The four minute-to-two-minute-long
      vignettes are all basically the same; the gladiator scene has an actor standing
      around, the wasteland scene has an actress standing around, the mountain scene
      has an actor crouched down, and the boxing scene has two (!) actors standing
      around. A fifth scene is present in the trailer but is not in this demo; featuring
      a model during a photo shoot, I can''t imagine I''m missing much. For such little
      content, it takes an absurd amount of space (8 gb at the time of this review,
      so roughly 1 gig per minute of content).


      The boxing scene is perhaps the most disappointing as it''s the featured scene
      in the trailer. The coach repeatedly phases in & out of scene (likely due to
      multiple takes), and they use different footage from his audio track in the
      second half, breaking the immersion. Speaking of breaking immersion, this should
      be a seated experience as walking away from the center of the play area makes
      it look like the coach is talking to an invisible person and the boxer is fighting
      a ghost.'
