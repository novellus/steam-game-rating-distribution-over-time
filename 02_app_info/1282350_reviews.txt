More like Free Support!\" \nSo, if you want to ensure your position in power forever, get this DLC. Sure, you handicap yourself with the problems of getting and spending Swiss money. But you can remove half of the cost-benefit problem of the edict system. And you can also, for example do free building after that with the conservatives and build as many Wind Turbines and Solar Power Plants as you want. And finally, you can kick out the members with next to no downside and keep ALL the benefit. Not to mention there's a trait for no corruption on spending, and the capitalists unique benefit is half corruption gain. People who say corruption is too punishing don't know how broken the benefits are. ...Or they are playing the mission, which is a real miss seeing as you have to on several occasions send your corruption up to max. It's really the only bad thing about this DLC. \nIf you don't have 100% support in at least three factions with this DLC, you're doing it wrong. It's like Tropico 3 and 4's faction system. Very easy to max their support out on most, if not all.","timestamp_created":1609131962,"timestamp_updated":1609131962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6aXv0/YCda7/vQI="}
