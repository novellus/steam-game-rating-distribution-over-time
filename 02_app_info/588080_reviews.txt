Takes place during the Roman conquest of Hispania. Standard combat for its type. Background is interesting as not many games cover this period. Any most of those donâ€™t focus on this particular conflict. Rather interesting.","timestamp_created":1607290377,"timestamp_updated":1607290377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4spr+nPYCecTstwI="}
