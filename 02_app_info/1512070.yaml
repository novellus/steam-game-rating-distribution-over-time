    about_the_game: "This is a sad story, a tragic moment. In the summer of 1945,\
      \ atomic weapons were used for the first time in human history. This VR game\
      \ allows you to experience the feeling of being in Hiroshima, watching the atomic\
      \ bomb slowly fall, the mushroom nuclear cloud rises, and everything around\
      \ being dissolved by nuclear energy radiation. We wish that mankind will never\
      \ experience the pain of war again. Peace forever.<br />\r\nIn the game, the\
      \ player will walk in the city, and then witness the atomic bomb explosion.\
      \ All the surrounding buildings disappear in an instant. A bustling city instantly\
      \ becomes a wasteland with no one. You will experience the despair of the atomic\
      \ bomb explosion. You can repeat the experience"
