    review: 'Long story short, the gameplay here is pretty casual and easy, and there
      are a few character portraits that are oddly horny. If you''re fine with both
      of those (hell, it''s a tower defense game so you might be looking for a pretty
      casual experience anyway) then there''s 20USD worth of fun here, with some pretty
      visuals and voice acting on top. Otherwise, it might be better to grab it on
      sale. I had my problems with it, but I basically played through the game twice
      so I must not have minded that much.


      The gameplay is passive: That''s kind of inherent to a tower defense game and
      the game doesn''t give you much reason to push out from your base most of the
      time. It''s also really easy to clear stages, further making it feel passive
      and hands-off- ymmv but I definitely felt myself checking out during longer
      stages. There''s a lot of gameplay variety between the 17 characters and ~20
      traps, but the balance is somewhat poor and you can only take 4 traps into a
      stage, so it''s hard to use the more exotic ones when it means sacrificing boring
      but reliable options. The problems are somewhat exacerbated by an upgrade system
      that makes the power imbalances between the traps worse, and makes replaying
      stages more tedious unless you deliberately downgrade yourself. There might
      be some challenge if you play to three-star every stage but I wasn''t really
      feeling the urge. There are a couple of really interesting stages in the game
      but most kind of blur together.


      The presentation is quite good: Environments are really pretty, with good use
      of the Unreal Engine''s lighting and shadows, and the effekseer engine for particle
      effects. Character models are chibi and detailed enough, but the animation is
      pretty limited and some actions don''t blend with each other, leaving an almost
      stop-motion effect. The sound effects are mostly serviceable, but several are
      re-used in ways that make them bad gameplay cues, for example the same sound
      effect used for the base taking damage is also used for random traps firing,
      which means you can''t rely on it as an unambiguous indicator that you screwed
      up and cue to defend your base.


      The story''s kind of an excuse plot, and that''s fine enough. There are a couple
      of interesting flourishes that use the wide swath of characters in interesting
      and clever ways, and that helps it feel like a somewhat cohesive whole rather
      than a greatest-hit collection of characters. The story does have character
      portraits though, and while half of them are really good, the other half are
      bizarrely horny. Reimu with a barely existing top and skirt down past her hips
      is a good example. More mature characters have massive chests with vaccuformed
      clothes. It''s just jarring against the rest of the game''s atmosphere, which
      is pretty cutesy.


      The voice acting is good, with a variety of performances. It''s impressive that
      all of the story dialogue is fully-voiced, but the actual gameplay voice clips
      are highly limited, with each character only having one voice line for each
      prompt, so you''ll be hearing the same lines over and over again during gameplay,
      and they can get grating before too long. The priorities here might have been
      in the wrong place.


      It''s a bit rough around the edges, but if neither of the warnings in the first
      paragraph scared you off? Yeah, it''s fine.'
