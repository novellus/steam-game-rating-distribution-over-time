Doobie Brothers - that's who! It should be called Doobie Brothers feat. Michael McDonald, to my knowledge he was a member of the brothers at the time, but started his own thing and 'I Keep Forgettin' was one of his greatest hits. A remarkably groovy song and a insta-evergreen. You'll have a lot of fun playing this one, Guitar or Bass, its just alright with me ;)","timestamp_created":1461838809,"timestamp_updated":1461953944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.631451845169067383","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnNvPsdQCe4jFVg=="}
