Does what it says on its tin! Excellent 1980s arcade shooter style. Yes, I was a teenager back then and frequented videogame arcades - never enough money - good times! Now, 30 years later I get to go old school for free! Well apart from the price of the game itself! :D If you like this genre, then BUY SPACE TOADS: MAYHEM now! Recommended.","timestamp_created":1546369919,"timestamp_updated":1546369919,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gY21hegCc8+XtwE="}
