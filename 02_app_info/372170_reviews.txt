I have no idea where the screenshots on the store page are coming from, but since the game is literally unplayabe with so many glitched out parts you will not be able to pass you would never get far enough to witness the stunning effects of the Dr.Test DLC anyways... I am pretty sure you wouldn't even want to see them. \n(If anyone can ever prove me wrong on these then I will instantly lose my faith in humanity for containing an individual actually willing to try out InsanZ DLCs... That must really not ever happen.)\n\nDon't wonder about the price. Since a few months ago this DLC will be add to your library for free if you purchase the standard game alone and I doubt they will ever have to be manually purchased anytime soon again. At least that's something. \n\nSo overall this is nothing but some broken coding, but in fact still better than the game, so I rate up, whatever.","timestamp_created":1516899136,"timestamp_updated":1516905661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532163739204406738","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pPCnl+ECd+KMlwE="}
