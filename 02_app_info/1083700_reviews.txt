But in its current state it is almost unplayable.  The camera freezes in places then jumps ahead.  It seems that you are unable to use items that are equipped, this could be user error at the moment.  It had  a lot of potential for Zork fans, I would not call it a exact remake, but hey it was a text adventure so each persons imagination is different.  If they can fix the glitchy controls then it seems it will be a lot of fun!  I am hoping for a fix to the controls so I did not waste 17 bucks.  Please fix as I want to give this game a thumbs up!\n\nHappy to say the developer has fixed the controls!  I was able to move around plus use my equipped item.  I am not sure if the overall game is good yet as I have not put much time into it, but since the developer did make the fix I am changing my review to a thumbs up.  I will continue to update the review as I progress in the game!  Thanks for making the game playable.","timestamp_created":1568165381,"timestamp_updated":1569207134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503818035125732422","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1568443374,"developer_response":"UPDATE PATCH 14th Sept - the stuttering in the forest at the beginning of the game has been removed.
