My favourite aspect is most likely the little customizations; I loved the animals (pigs, alpacas) with the different colour swatches, as well as the costumes. The fighting gameplay was often surprisingly difficult, which I enjoyed, as I played the game on the regular setting, and the soundtrack was interesting enough for me to go find online and listen to again.\n\nMINOR/MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD; RAYOR (read @ your own risk, yo)\n\nThe idea behind the endings is very interesting; however, I wish there was a bit more detail into how and why these endings occur, as well as a way to change the trajectory of the game without starting anew. While the game is fun and interesting, it is not interesting enough to warrant a second gameplay for me, so I googled the alternatives (I know! Flay me alive); it's a really cool storyline, though I do wish I could complete it a second time without the repetition. Maybe more interactions with the other zodiacs would help alleviate this, providing a fresh run-through, as only some of them got screen-time, and the fire signs were a little ignored (fire sign rep here lol)... Regardless, an excellent thought-provoking game.","timestamp_created":1609984835,"timestamp_updated":1609984835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ429+k7fYCe4SVwQI="}
