    review: 'Thought this game would be fun from what I saw, but It fell short. No
      clear instructions on how to move, etc. Found it really easy to avoid the cops,
      could play all day and not get caught if I wanted too. I had to hard exit the
      game. Even the movement was off. Not fun at all :(.
