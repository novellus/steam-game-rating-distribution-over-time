    developer_response: 'We agree with you and are awaiting approval to move into
      the Early Access Program right now. I''m sorry we failed to do this before release.
      That was my decision, and it was wrong.


      Hopefully you''ll give it another shot as we continue to add features and improve
      graphics.

    review: 'This should be in early access.  It is not complete and does not work.  Audience
      starts to clap randomly until conversation is over.

      Other problems:

      1. Very low-resolution textures

      2. Audience doesn''t move properly (hands clap 1 foot apart)

      3. Interface and navigation very confusing or don''t exist

      How do I stop or start?  How do I select a topic?'
