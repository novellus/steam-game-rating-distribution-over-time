    review: 'Black Mist is a fun Metroidvania game with some interesting mechanics.  I
      quite enjoy the black mist that the game gets its name from.  It adds suspense
      to what would otherwise be a very bland game.

      The lives system is also quite nice.  Instead of having a certain amount of
      lives and ammo, the two are combined.  Shooting uses Energy, which can be regained
      from falling enemies.  Energy also acts as a life force, so when you run out,
      it''s game over.  You lose Energy when hit by enemies too.

      It''s clearly a game that was made with love, but without too much ambition.  It''s
      a nice time killer if you want something more in-depth than cookie clicker,
      and brings some new ideas to the genre.
