I LOVE the art style and the animations, levels are very interesting. The game runs super well.\n\nOnce you're done with the walkthrough, it has an incredible speed-running replayability with global rankings built into the game, separated by overall and by each level, i.e. you can run individual levels and compete with others there. \n\nOverall, such an incredible game. Big thanks to the developers and I wish there were more like this!","timestamp_created":1609601369,"timestamp_updated":1609601369,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uvjt4fYCeoHhvwI="}
