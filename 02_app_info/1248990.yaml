    about_the_game: <i>Thank you for 180,000 downloads across steam and itch.io!</i><br><br>Inspired
      by Iceland's unique landscape and colours I sought out to make a realistically
      inspired exploration experience set on iceland's southern coast. The game is
      a short immersive walk though an expansive section of land with moss, glacial
      rivers, foggy grasslands, waterfalls and scenic vistas. Use the game's camera
      to observe and interact with the world around you while listening to an immersive
      curated soundtrack. Your attentiveness and eagerness to explore will be rewarded
      with access to hidden areas, areas that will be easily missed by a rushed player.<br><br>I've
      been able to utilise some great new technology in Unreal Engine 4 and some high-fidelity
      photoscanned models from Quixel to try and push the visuals in this game as
      much as I could. I hope you are able to dive into this game without much context
      and just enjoy being immersed in the world. Thanks for playing and for your
      support !

    review: Beautiful imagery, except the fog was a bit much. So much so it took away
      from enjoying the atmosphere. The camera function worked in this one, but it
      was jittery when in use. Still worth exploring.
