I'm a fan of cheesy b-movies and I love the unknown. I like to find things that no one else has heard of and bring it to their attention. At the time, I said I liked it and it's not for everyone.\n\nFast forward to 2020, and guys... well, yeah. The film is awful, and considering its history, I expected it to be. A long story short, an Iranian filmmaker named John Rad (I assume that's not his real name and I'm too lazy to check, I'm sure you really don't care) had moved to the United States and began filming Dangerous Men from the late 70's to the early 90's, then it was officially released in the mid-2000's. This is not the only example of a film being shoved off until getting an official release years later, but I just found it fascinating that of all the films that had to be delayed, it was this one. And for what? A campy mess that even a high school student with an iPhone could beat?\n\nThis film has everything: Bad acting, out-of-place music, disorienting editing, you name it! I can't even call it comparable to The Room, because that film, while it was bad, was very entertaining, despite the director's intentions of trying to make it more serious. This film isn't remotely entertaining, which, in my mind, makes this a bad film. After all, it's a form of entertainment, which means it has to be... well, ENTERTAINING!\n\nWhat the hell was I smoking when I wrote that review back in 2015?","timestamp_created":1485888459,"timestamp_updated":1586794047,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44fSSuvECd+/6cA=="}
