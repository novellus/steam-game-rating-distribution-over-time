When the maniacal Major Strauss plans to open a gateway to Hell itself to reinforce his armies, an elite team is deployed to thwart his plans - The Mad Devils. But sometimes, regular heroism just isn’t enough. Dead, defeated, and damned, the Mad Devils regroup in the underworld itself and draw up plans to close the gateway from the other side.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SIX DEMONIC GI's, SIX SETS OF POWERS, SIX PATHS TO VICTORY<\/h2><br>You’ve got a hell of a mission ahead of you. Cast into the abyss, the now skull-headed Sergeant Jack Asher must explore the afterlife and reassemble his fallen squad. Each member of the team has been warped uniquely by infernal forces, twisting their bodies and empowering them with new demonic abilities. Snipers, demolitionists and heavy weapons experts, now armed with elemental and ethereal magics, all of which you’ll have to master in order to finish your fight.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FIGHT FIRE WITH HELLFIRE<\/h2><br>It’ll take more than good friends and unbreakable will to smash the Nazi’s demonic ambitions. You’ll need the biggest, most chthonic weapons you can get your boney hands on, and enough magic to light up the stygian void itself.
