    review: 'I had a great time with this one!


      As of writing this review there are 28 songs in total, but it''s worth noting
      that mysteriously only 2 of these songs appear if you select the Slash Mode
      in the options. In other words, regardless of how you plan to hit the notes,
      play this game in Punch Mode (which I played using slash motions with no issues,
      getting SS ranks and all that jazz).


      Most of the songs are not available initially and get unlocked by playing the
      game.


      The majority of the music is J-Pop and J-Rock, and about half of the songs are
      Vocaloid based.


      There''s a good amount of visual variety. All songs take place on a stage setting
      that features flashy equalizers and lighting effects. The style of notes switches
      between solid colors and notes with lyrics written on them, which feature several
      different fonts depending on the song. There are also flame effects that trigger
      from time to time in certain songs, and some of the songs feature live action
      or animated music videos; the ones that don''t feature a video have an art image
      on the main screen; the song lyrics running across the bottom in both cases.


      All songs appear to have only one note chart, although you can change the speed
      at which the notes approach to four different speed settings. Personally, I''d
      recommend leaving the approach speed at Normal. The charts are not insanely
      difficult, but people looking for a serious challenge may be left wanting more,
      and people who struggle with rhythm games may find themselves getting frustrated
      (especially since this game takes cues from Vocaloid games, in that parts of
      the lyrics and audio cut out when the player is missing notes). In short, the
      difficulty is average.


      One thing that''s kind of lost in translation is what appears to be the karaoke
      element of this game. Tying into the reason there''s only one note chart per
      song, the lyrics appear on the notes as they approach and go along with the
      melody, written in kanji/hiragana/katakana (the lyrics also being displayed
      on the screen in the back). Notes that are based on musical melody rather than
      the lyrics are solid-colored stars. I feel like if the developers added a romaji
      option some people might like that, so it would still be possible to sing along
      if you''re not familiar with written Japanese; I suppose this might be a decent
      tool to practice speedy recognition of the characters if you''re studying these
      alphabets.


      All in all, if you''re looking for a casual flashy rhythm game and enjoy Japanese
      music, this is an easy recommendation.'
