Initially it was made as a DLC that you need to enable when installing the game or can enable at any time later from the game properties in Steam. There were no changes regarding this.\n\nWhen it's installed, you can access it by opening Steam Music Player. To do so, run Steam Client -> top menu \"View\" -> \"Music player\". Pless \"Browse music\" icon (near the window close button) to browse all the soundtracks you have including those for VoidExpanse.\n\nThe soundtrack is downloaded in the game installation folder, \"Soundtrack\" subfolder. There are three different formats (MP3, OGG, FLAC) and composer notes (a text files). So if you want to access the soundtrack directly and read the composer notes, please navigate in the installation folder: open VoidExpanse game properties in Steam -> tab \"LOCAL FILES\" -> button \"BROWSE LOCAL FILES\".\n\nPlease let us know if you still have a problem accessing the soundtrack. In which case we will investigate further. But on our side everything seems to be working, as it always has been.\n\n[b]Please note however, due to recent changes to steam client (not related to VoidExpanse) Steam client might NOT automatically install the DLCs, in which case please open game properties, switch to DLC and enable download of soundtrack.\nThis recent change in steam client behaviour is very inconvenient as you can imagine.[/b]"}],"cursor":"AoJ43cawnfYCc8b6tgI="}
