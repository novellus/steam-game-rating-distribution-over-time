I think it is a fun little game. I love games like this but, As of now there really isn't enough direction I guess. Cant turn the music off, the mouse pointer covers up the description of the parts you need to put down. just small things. But I did refund but will keep my eye on this game for updates and improvements. I think if they work on it, it could be a really good game.","timestamp_created":1515339349,"timestamp_updated":1515339349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548332452774047852","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4wO/Q6OACdOWulQE="}
