      /><br>Kakatte Koi Yo! is a platform fighter where cats battle with powerful
      fish. With the use of Japanese theming and the irresistible adorableness of
      cats, KKY creates a fun, fast-paced, competitive co-op game. Players can fight
      in 1v1 or 2v2 matches where they have three ways to win the round!<br><strong><h2

      /><br>Instantly win the round by blowing your opponent's shrine to smithereens
      with the bomb. Cats are small, and the bomb is big and heavy, don't forget to
      grab a fish before trying to move it!<br><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">DUNK ON
      EM!</h2></strong> <img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1145380/extras/FishBasketORANGE.gif?t=1606268800"
      /><br>Dunk, snipe, and swish your favorite fish into your basket to earn a point,
      getting you one step closer to sweet victory.<h2 class="bb_tag">CAT FIIIIIIGHT!!!</h2>

      /><br>If you are less of a strategist and more of a fighter, forget the other
      objectives and take your opponent head-on. Drain your opponent's health to ring
      them out and gain a point. (If you get to the point cap from ring outs and scored
      fish, you win!)<h2 class="bb_tag">SINGLE PLAYER</h2> <img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1145380/extras/BlankTaunt.gif?t=1606268800"

    review: "Very promising looking game with a cute premise. Looking forward to seeing\
      \ how this game develops, and what new content the developers might add as things\
      \ go. \n\nFingers crossed that online play is on the game's short list of planned\
      \ features."
