    review: 'Not gonna lie, of the five packs this is the one I''ve found least enthusing.
      I''ll give a positive review because, as always, the tables are well-done, with
      lots of great bonuses from history to new ball designs, and more pinball is
      always a good thing, but overall the tables here, at least for me, do less to
      show the real range of tables they could have, with no really stand-out inclusions
      or oddities. Likewise, the inclusion of El Dorado is a bit of a cop-out, since
      it''s simply an older skin of a table they already had in a previous pack.
