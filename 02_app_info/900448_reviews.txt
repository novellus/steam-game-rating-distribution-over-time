I would give it a neutral recommendation if I could, because there are some good ideas and design in few places, especially in the last dungeon (which has problems of its own too), but overall the DLC feels like a small piece cut from the original campaign, only worse and on rails. Unless you're a hardcore Kingmaker completionist you can safely skip this, and even then, the DLC campaign has almost nothing to do with the base game and little to no effect on your kingdom from the main story. It's not terrible, but generally a lot poorer than the base game, so I canâ€™t recommend it.","timestamp_created":1609878606,"timestamp_updated":1609878606,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi8KP6vYCfuDnwAI="}
