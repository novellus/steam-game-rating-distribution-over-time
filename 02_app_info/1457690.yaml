    about_the_game: "Dwarves  &amp; Dungeons is my first steam game. After two years\
      \ of development, it has completed the whole framework and the complete content\
      \ of two characters. The game is innovated on the traditional game of Match-3\
      \ Puzzler, combined with the elements of rougelike game, adding hard core content,\
      \ bringing a new and unique experience.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Innovative ways to play</h2></strong><br><br>Dwarves  &amp; Dungeons is different\
      \ from the traditional combat Linking game. It combines the combat part and\
      \ the Linking part organically. It is no longer a sequential operation of &quot;Linking\
      \ = &gt; fight&quot;. Instead, the character you control is placed on the Linking\
      \ chessboard. All Linking actions must be initiated from the character's position,\
      \ and the character's walk should be completed at the same time of Linking.<br><br><img\
