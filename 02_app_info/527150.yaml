    review: "DEAD \xE9 um jogo que me surpreendeu por ser t\xE3o bom mas mesmo assim\
      \ t\xE3o barato, no come\xE7o as batalhas parecem ser bem dificeis mas quase\
      \ todas elas tem algum truque escondido que facilita UM POUCO. Para fazer todas\
      \ as conquistas voc\xEA precisa de muita paciencia pois algumas delas chegam\
      \ ao ponto de partir para a injusti\xE7a de testar as suas habilidades ao maximo.\
      \ Ent\xE3o se voc\xEA gosta de um bom bullet hell com uma arte e trilha sonoras\
      \ muito boas e uma lore que faz todo sentido voc\xEA vai adorar DEAD"
