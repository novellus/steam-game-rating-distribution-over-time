A simple, but fun arcade racer, that impressed with its high speed and great responsiveness. Just race and have fun.\n\nWhile the Steam edition of Moto Racer works on 64bit Windows 10 out of the box with poor SW rendering, but applying the patch from the Guide section greatly improves the experience by enabling D3D or glide. \n\nOn 64bit Windows 10, the Moto Racer 2 requires another patch to run at all (see Guide section).\n\nBoth games support (digital) game controllers (or keyboard). A Xbox 360 controller with analog controls is not well working.\n\nMoto Racer 3 works out of the box and supports analog game controllers.\n\nMoto Racer 15th ANNIVERSARY is the port of a mobile phone game. Not as good as the classic series. It aims to be more realistic, but is rather disappointing, much less fun.\n\nI have bought the entire collection at just $1, a real bargain.\n","timestamp_created":1606340741,"timestamp_updated":1606340741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+NDXgPYCcKmMsQI="}
