    review: "It\u2019s a cute game, but I fully admit that I don\u2019t have any strong\
      \ feelings about it one way or the other. Again, it\u2019s sweet, but nothing\
      \ to write home about, and I don\u2019t know if I will be replaying any time\
      \ soon. Quality wise, the art is nice, and the music can be a bit overbearing\
      \ at times, but it did match the theme well enough. There were a few snippets\
      \ of text here and there that confused me a bit, some were small spelling errors\
      \ and there were a few that I\u2019m not quite sure if they were typos or just\
      \ figures of speech that I had never heard before, but it was nothing major\
      \ and I wouldn\u2019t say that they detracted from my overall enjoyment of the\
      \ game.\nReally my biggest issue with the game was the progression of the story,\
      \ which went WAAYY to fast for my liking. These two dudes have just met this\
      \ girl and suddenly it\u2019s all \u201CHey let\u2019s date!\u201D I mean, it\
      \ even sorta gets acknowledged in game how quickly things are progressing. But\
      \ again, for a $5 otome game, I wasn\u2019t expecting an Idea Factory narrative.\n\
      In conclusion: It\u2019s a short game you can finish in less than a day, it\
      \ has it\u2019s cute moments, and the art is pretty, so go ahead and buy it\
      \ if you like the beach and shirtless mermen. It's only $5 after all.\nOn a\
      \ side note: there was a scene near the beginning of the game that was unintentionally\
      \ funny? [spoiler]It was a pan up of Crylis (The merman\u2019s) sprite, and\
      \ for some reason this merman sprite descending from the heavens was just the\
      \ funniest thing to me.[/spoiler] Don\u2019t ask me why; it was late, I was\
      \ kinda tired, and I have a terrible sense of humor."
