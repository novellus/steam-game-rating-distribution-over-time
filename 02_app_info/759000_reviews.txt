All 80 levels have four different play modes:\n1: regular (find any shape that matches both shadows)\n2: minimal (find any shape consisting of the minimum amount of blocks)\n3: maximal (find the shape consisting of the maximum amount of blocks)\n4: picross (find a shape consisting of the number of blocks given)\nBasically you're solving all puzzles up to four times, which unfortunately doesn't hide the fact that this is a very easy game. Do not expect more than a couple of hours of game play to solve all '320' puzzles. If you have difficulties with shapes and shadows this could possibly take a bit more and / or even help with that.\n\nGraphics are minimalistic but perfectly sufficient. Only issue I have is that it can be difficult to discern if blocks are actually adjacent to one another or if there is a gap between them. All in all a small and simple game. Don't expect too much replay value, especially on the short term. If you can get this at a discount, you can't really go wrong here.","timestamp_created":1609355875,"timestamp_updated":1609355875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4q7rF2vYCc4vvvgI="}
