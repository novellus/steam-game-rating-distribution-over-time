My quick impression after playing it for like 12 minutes is as follows:\n\n+ Looks good!\n+ Physics feel interesting\n+ You can drive underwater\n\nbut\n\n\n- Feels totally unplayable / undrivable with all cars - they can't even drive straight on a straight road\n- Poorly optimized, low fps \n- Ugly HUD and its placement of elements\n- Ugly main menu\n- When you drive underwater the water disappears \n\nAs of now, I would not recommend this game to anyone, because, although it looks good it also feels kinda pointless. But the developers have plans for the future, so we shall see. Above all, the cars need to be more playble / drivable!","timestamp_created":1542169527,"timestamp_updated":1564890388,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.451877355575561523","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw4oqvrewCe9rdrgE="}
