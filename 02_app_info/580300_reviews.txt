Super Stone Legacy brings a twist on your standard class-based 'arcadey' hack-n-slash; you get to play 6 classes at the same time but if one dies it's locked out for the rest of the run.\n\nThere's a bunch of bosses and they're, honestly, quite fun to fight. I had a blast unlocking all of the bosses 'no damage dealt' achievements. The classes are 'varied', but totally unbalanced. You'll notice that some classes are pretty useful while others are completely obsolete. The difference between the damage dealt by your hold attack vs main attacks is kind of dumb, you'll never switch as one is always better. It's kind of a let down. \n\nThere is an Upgrade/Shop system where you can purchase stats. I could barely see any difference at all and the whole system could have been stripped, but that's purely based on the terrible execution. I can see why it would fit in the game loop as if you invest a lot in a character and it dies, you get punished, rewarding risk.\n\nThe 'dungeon' areas, are terribly boring and require no skill at all. They keep getting larger as you progress, amplifying the mind boggling nonsense. The worst part is that I kept getting playthroughs where monsters would get stuck in/beyond walls, forcing me to abandon my run. The chance of this issue kept increasing as I got closer to the final boss.\n\nIf it wasn't for the frustrating technical issue where monsters get stuck in walls, I would have recommended you to get this game on sale.\n\nTLDR: Game is not so bad, but monsters glitch behind walls and force you to abandon runs.","timestamp_created":1530513524,"timestamp_updated":1530513624,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvJHurOQCdcz3pAE="}
