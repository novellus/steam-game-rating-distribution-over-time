    review: 'I really, REALLY wanted to like this game.  The first was such a wonderful
      nostalgia trip that had big Earthbound vibes and even moments that literally
      took pages from the game (such as the continuous cop battles to recruit the
      Cop).  It was just such a great game, and I was really equally excited to play
      a game like that set in space.


      Sadly, like some other reviewers, I can''t.


      Upon loading the game and wanting to tweak the settings, I found that the game
      freezes the moment I hit settings...or at least the graphics themselves just
      suddenly stop since I can hear the movements from if I moved on the controller/keyboard,
      but the graphics are frozen onto the main menu screen.  Resetting the game or
      even my computer doesn''t help this, and it happens every time I try to load
      the game and hit the settings, and I''m forced to force-close via Alt-Ctrl-delete
      just so the game doesn''t continue clocking time.


      If that''s not bad enough, while the game itself will load after hitting New
      game and it seems like the Settings menu crash is the only problem...we then
      cut to the next problem: Shortly after you''re allowed to move on your own,
      I go to talk to an NPC...any NPC.  Much like that first issue, the game suddenly
      crashes/freezes right there.  I can still hear the dialogue from the NPC and
      can probably move around, but once again I can''t actually see what I''m doing
      because the graphics have decided to freeze right at that moment I clicked to
      talk, and stay that way until I force-close the same way as before so that the
      game doesn''t accrue time during that frozen state since the game is still running.


      From what I''ve read in the bug thread, this has been an issue reported back
      as far as barely a day or so after the game initially released, and has never
      been fixed because it apparently only affects some users and not all.


      And apparently I''m just unlucky enough to be one of those users that it does
      affect...though a year+ later you''d think they''d have gotten that bug figured
      out and taken out.


      But alas, they haven''t.  So while some may be able to play this game with no
      problems, fair warning that some of you who purchase this may run into that
      same graphical issue that will literally make the game unplayable for you.'
