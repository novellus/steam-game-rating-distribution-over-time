    review: This is a fun and powerful 3D modeling suite in VR! And I believe this
      is the best VR sculpting tool! This has real potential and makes sculpting/
      designing much more fun. The bad reviews are old and I think this app runs perfectly
      now. For me as a graphic design student, This software is amazing! recommend
      everyone to try it.
