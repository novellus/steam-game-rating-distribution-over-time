Although traps and hazards are so difficult to see because of a poorly made terrain that its annoying this game is incredibly fun. Difficulty is not properly laid out and some times it feels a bit to intense for what it is, But with its incredibly smooth controls and decent plot its definitely something that anyone who likes platformers can enjoy.","timestamp_created":1608163972,"timestamp_updated":1608163972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508196711540222168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwutqCt/YCfKTpugI="}
