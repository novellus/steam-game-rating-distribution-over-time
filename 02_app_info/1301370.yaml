    about_the_game: Pyro Fighters is a scrolling space shooter with platforming physics.
      You are equipped with a flamethrower you can use to propel yourself in the air
      by aiming downward. It is also your primary method of attacking, so don't get
      too distracted trying to stay airborne. The game pits you against tricky platforming
      and bullet-hell challenges, so be sure to bring up to four players to better
      prepare for the challenge ahead!

    review: "What kind of game is it? : Action Platformer. Slightly bullet-hell. Autoscroll\n\
      Is the price right? : Yes\nWho is this for? : Action platformer fans, all ages.\n\
      Does the multiplayer work well? : Yes, Shared lives\n\nHow is the game lenght\
      \ and pace? : The game give you the option to start with more lives as you keep\
      \ playing, ensuring steady progress and motivation.\nHow are the graphics? :\
      \ Clean. Responsive. Some platforming hasards (like spikes) are hard to spot.\n\
      How is the UI? : Simple and fast.\n\n-----\n\nI played this in multiplayer with\
      \ a friend and it was a fun challenge. The different powerups were a nice touch.\n\
      I encountered no glitches at all.\nThe difficulty was a bit inconsistent, with\
      \ some platforming sections being extremely tight later on-- and some bosses\
      \ being quite easy.\nThe flamethrower controlled aerial movement is fun and\
      \ well executed.\nWhile it is not a game for everyone, at this price, it's definitly\
      \ worth a try for any fan of action plaformer games looking for something to\
      \ keep em busy for a couple days. \n\n[7.5/10]"
