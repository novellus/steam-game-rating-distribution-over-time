You have an improbably large number of ways to generate beats in this, and so it lends itself to sophistication. If you're just making a four-on-the-floor you don't need this at all, but if you need complex fills, polyrhythms, call and response or even a starting motif for melodies...this is the place to go.\n\nThe problem with software-assisted composition is simply that most of it gets too detailed and fiddly - it makes student-grade composition, and then once you know what you really want you start fighting the tool to get it, which means you don't really \"stay in flow\" at all. The remainder is like an arranger keyboard - great, very flowing, until you want to edit the style, and then equally as fiddly and tedious, if you can even do it.\n\nBut if you take a bits-and-pieces approach to building up the composition you don't have to feel quite so limited. My favorite software arranger is Chordpulse, but it has no style editing at all. What to do? Export the midi to the DAW, then substitute in some rhythms exported from LR and it's practically a new style. Like a lot of things, you have to use it judiciously. The point of using these tools isn't to replace your ears and brain, but to get you out of the rut of your muscle memory leading to the same ideas over and over.","timestamp_created":1608119736,"timestamp_updated":1608119736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7PrZtfYCcJfXugI="}
