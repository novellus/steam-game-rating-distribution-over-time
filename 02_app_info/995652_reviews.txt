Today we will be looking at “Grim Penance” a small DLC that includes a new priority assignment.  It’s only $3 but is it worth a purchase?  Let’s discuss.\n\nI’m so Sorry:  This is another priority assignment, which include another series of themed missions that you could encounter through the normal random assortment, like the others not even the voice overs are unique.  As the previous ones I enjoy the choose-your-own-adventure style story but this one is really lacking in the rewards department.  The previous ones include unique Tarot Cards or character cosmetics, this one comes with a hub cosmetic that is basically braziers in the far corners of your mission hub area (where you talk to the NPCs).\n\nIf I’m being honest the cosmetic rewards are very lacking, they appear to the far corners of the hub and you basically never notice them unless you look for them.  Additionally the rewards aside are lacking but the story is unique as always.  Ultimately, I’d avoid it unless it is on sale and you want to complete your set or it is just part of a bundle.
