    review: "Gra ,,Plastris'' jest niszowym produktem na platformie Steam, kt\xF3\
      ra nie jest wielkim produktem od giganta na rynku gier. Z czym si\u0119 gra\
      \ je? Jest to szczera do b\xF3lu gra logiczna, w kt\xF3rej naszym zadaniem jest\
      \ wype\u0142nienie kafelk\xF3w za pomoc\u0105 tego za pomoc\u0105 symboli, kt\xF3\
      re gra nam da na dany poziom. Koncepcja prosta ale potrafi\u0105ca utrzyma\u0107\
      \ gracza na pewien czas. Wygl\u0105d gry jest uproszczony, niczym si\u0119 nie\
      \ wyr\xF3\u017Cnia, \u015Bcie\u017Cka d\u017Awi\u0119kowa urozmaica ucho gracza,\
      \ lecz gdy mowa o muzyce zamieszczonej w grze nie ma tu \u017Cadnych fajerwerk\xF3\
      w. Gra nie posiada \u017Cadnych wi\u0119kszych b\u0142\u0119d\xF3w,  a to samych\
      \ wad mo\u017Cna da\u0107 tu poziomy, kt\xF3re s\u0105 po prostu wtr\u0105cone\
      \ na chama i kt\xF3re przechodzimy po kolei, za co nie otrzymujemy niczego konkretnego.\
      \ Mimo to gra ta dla fan\xF3w \u0142amig\u0142\xF3wek powinna by\u0107 ciekawa,\
      \ dzi\u0119ki niech mo\u017Cna dobrze sp\u0119dzi\u0107 czas."
