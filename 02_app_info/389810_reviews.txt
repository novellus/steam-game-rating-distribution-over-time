Sadly, this looks similar but it's real time and the combat does not translate at all. The combat is fast and frantic, but the controls are meh and the weapon and vehicle variety is very limited. The car customization feels a lot like Autoduel, but the combat has a very GTA1 feel to it. Unfortunately, unlike GTA1 you can't zoom out, so it's hard to drive and gun at the same time since you can't see what's ahead. Missions are an interesting idea, but the maps are boring and repetitive (as are the arenas). If this were turn based I'd give this a 'maybe', but as a car based top down shooter I didn't like this at all. It feels like a free flash game more than a finished product.","timestamp_created":1598126036,"timestamp_updated":1598126036,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwoLvi/QCfKOPnQI="}
