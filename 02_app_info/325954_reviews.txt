A lot of scenarios also included. One of the best routes, and even though its always a bit more than the others price wise, is worth it. Frame rate is questionable around Rugby however, in the region of 25-30 even with a decent rig. Rest of the route is fine though (although the detail means the classic ts \"lag-spikes\" are quite pronounced).\nAs for sounds, the class 66 is ok, and the traction motor sounds on the 350 are accurate, but just a bit synth-sounding. Certainly not the worst I've seen. 350 horn is a joke though, not even 2-tone interactivity.","timestamp_created":1451381767,"timestamp_updated":1605417439,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503477036952972412","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48cGV5fUCc/vDTA=="}
