    review: This game is hilarious and a lot of fun if you can laugh at fictional
      gang violence. Imagine being in an intense shootout with your rival when suddenly
      a random NPC comes out and tries to mug you. Then a driveby rolls through and
      shoots at all of you at the same time. It's these random moments that bring
      humor to the game in the midst of chaotic explosions and steady streams of gunfire.
      Don't buy this game to play by yourself. If, on the other hand, you have one
      to three friends to play with, I'd definitely recommend picking it up. I'm hoping
      they add more maps and weapons in the future, but in the mean time there's enough
      content with three different game modes to keep you and your friends amused
      for a while. [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt_0VniXo1I]Check out my gameplay
