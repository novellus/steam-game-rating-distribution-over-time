You'll need to simultaneously manage them both and direct them to where they have to be. Make sure that sending one drone here won’t send the other into danger somewhere else. This becomes increasingly difficult, especially with the combination of obstacles and puzzle elements. You’ll run into spikes that toggle with every input, arrows that flip at the push of a button, gates toggled by lighting beacons, and even evil, flamethrower-wielding robots.
