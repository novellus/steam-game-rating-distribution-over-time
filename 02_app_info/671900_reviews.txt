There was some auto save, but it didn't load. \nIt does have nice UI and crafting panel is interesting, it is nice you have 3 classes to choose from, but the mage didn't feel like mage, so I didn't feel any desire to pick up another one. \nBut the levels and music which are much more important for me in isometric games are generic and boring, enemies attacks and design are very basic, the camera turning is too slow and there is no way of customizing your keys, so you don't even know which one you can use. \nI went into 2nd level and then  died to some sort of bosses right next to the door, then I gave up. \n","timestamp_created":1604060997,"timestamp_updated":1604060997,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513124465942382813","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42IzfvPUCd6CGqwI="}
