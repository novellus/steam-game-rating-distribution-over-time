I liked the original so this seemed like a no-brainer purchase at some point. The art, animations, gameplay depth and units are all expanded with lots of new combos and play styles. Much higher quality overall for this sequel. The story is along the same lines, I skipped most of it as it became a bit time consuming when I wanted to just jump into the game.\n\nSo the reason for the average review? I'm not sure why, but the flow or the something is just off. Not sure if this is down to balancing or just my preference on the original (maybe it's just nostalgia) or the way the units were slowly drip fed through the campaign. Rarely would there be a game where it was a good back and forth battle with higher units coming into play. There's certainly a lot more depth for tactics, but often just doing a quick rush brought on the win. I did like the side battles where you are forced to choose a select number of units to play with (which suit your style), but finishing the campaign actually ended up feeling like a grind to me.\n\nDon't buy it for multiplayer. It's completely dead. I couldn't match a single person for a game, which is probably not too surprising given the age of the game and I'm guessing a low amount of reviews indicate a very small amount of buyers for this one. Unless you've got friends who also have a copy, then matching them up seems straight forward.","timestamp_created":1610019132,"timestamp_updated":1610019132,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpsqn7vYCeoWgwQI="}
