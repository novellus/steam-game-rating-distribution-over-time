As a small school we do not have available space for a sensory room so this product helps us offer a sensory experience to our ASD students. Evenness offers a calm environment where the children have control over their surroundings. There is lots of opportunity for sensory engagement and the space encouraged imaginative thinking. The children loved the sounds and colours and the movement of objects and colours creates a calming effect. I would recommend this product to others.","timestamp_created":1555050499,"timestamp_updated":1555050499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u/GOiOoCdbKJvwE="}
