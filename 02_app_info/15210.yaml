    review: "Es un simulador genial, no solo manejas el submarino sino tambi\xE9n\
      \ gestionas la tripulaci\xF3n, y la posibilidad del c\xE1lculo manual de los\
      \ torpedos . Lo peor el poco trafico civil y (no s\xE9 si se ha programado as\xED\
      ) el que los barcos civiles no suelen ver el rastro de tus torpedos aun en las\
      \ mejores condiciones."
