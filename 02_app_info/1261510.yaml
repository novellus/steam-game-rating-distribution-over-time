    review: "I'd only consider this DLC if you liked the in-game music. [i]Forget\
      \ about the artbook.[/i] I was surprised to see that an \"artbook\" was being\
      \ released for this title, as I figured that there was no character development\
      \ and little original assets. However, I figured that [i]maybe[/i] the developer(s)\
      \ creatively posed the in-game characters, and rendered some cool scenes. \n\
      \nThey. . . kind of did that.\n\nBut all of the art is stuck in a .PDF file,\
      \ and not only that, it's poorly formatted. Is there any good reason to upload\
      \ images [i]diagonally?[/i] Overall, I give this DLC a [i]thumbs down.[/i] I\
      \ bought so you don't have to, so [i]don't.[/i]"
