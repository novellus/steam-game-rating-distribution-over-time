We get to meet Oberon and Titania, king and queen of the fairies, and learn about the  fairy folk living in our own world, exiled from Fairyland. The protagonist is the young granddaughter of a writer with a mysterious connection to Fairyland.  She is pitchforked into her grandfather's (previously unknown) role as a human with ties to Faerie after his death, when a witch starts abducting the fairies living in the human world.\n\nOverall:  a solid HOPA game with lots to do, a good bonus chapter, and a moderately interesting story ~ 8.5/10\n\nPros:\n- lovely visuals/art\n- lots and lots of HO scenes ranging from word lists, to silhouettes, to riddles (lots of riddles)\n- a decent number of puzzles, mostly in the lower-middle to upper-middle of difficulty (though many are easy if you stop and look at the starting positions)\n- collectibles indicator, fully interactive map, fully integrated Guide\n- full voice acting, mostly good (maybe all good, but I'm not the best judge of Irish (quasi-Irish?) accents)\n- the extras include a good bonus chapter, replayable HO scenes (giving in-game achievements), and access to the \"Bubble Shooter\" game (which I never fully understood except in its basics); the usual bonus content you'd expect, nicely presented\n\nCons:\n- the hit box for HO scenes was occasionally too picky, just often enough to annoy me a little\n- the HO scenes were well laid out, but sometimes overly complex without clear instructions (plus see above)\n- the plot was a little weaker than the first and third games in the series (but better than game two); I liked the protagonist's backstory, but would have appreciated more than just glimpses of her own character and reactions\n- toward the end of the game, not being able to use obvious items became irritating (I know it's classic HOPA stuff, but don't make me walk past two *obvious* buckets so that I can use the gourd I've been carrying around)\n- unlike in games one and three, I found myself referring to the Guide a couple of times: once because an obviously correct solution wasn't accepted (very annoying, and the Guide had the same answer - this turned out to be an actual glitch, forcing me to \"skip\" the puzzles to continue); the second time because \"what to do next\" was too obscure for me\n- on two occasions, I went through and just clicked on everything in my inventory looking for what worked; in one case, the \"correct\" combination was ridiculous (and I say that advisedly, since I know the genre)\n\nThis is still a very good game for the genre; if anything, it tries to do too much and be too clever with HO scenes, which isn't usually my complaint. With the exception of the second, weaker effort, this whole series has been very enjoyable, my criticisms notwithstanding.","timestamp_created":1595762090,"timestamp_updated":1595762090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605587542057037354","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgaS1xfMCfPPRlwI="}
