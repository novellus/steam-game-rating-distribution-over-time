The story is simultaneously sweet and dark, but always enjoyable.  There are a handful of word-choice and missing-word errors sprinkled throughout Anji's route, but they are all minor and you can generally figure out what was meant.  I personally loved the humor and found the characters more relatable because of it.  The characters are interesting, if sometimes frustrating.  However, even their frustrating traits make them more interesting as the story progresses.  For example: Learning of tsundere Anji's tragic past goes a long way to explain why he is initially such a flaming d***** to the MC.  We also watch MC growing through and past her indecisive nature -- a trait that was initially irritating, but was crucial in her being able to change her long-held prejudices and help others do the same.\n\nAdditionally, the adult scenes are particularly well written and feel geared toward a female audience, which is both wonderful and rare (i.e., focusing on a slow build up and teasing -- emotionally and physically -- rather than the usual \"BOOM. Boobs out. Make sex now.\" of many hentai games).\n\nFinally, I love the extra artistic effort the developers put in to help keep the story feeling realistic.  For example, giving all of the characters at least 2 outfits and/or hairstyles helped maintain my immersion in the story because, unless you wear a uniform or have very little, people don't usually have only 1 outfit or wear the same thing every day.  It also helped establish the passage of time or circumstance -- different outfits = different day or event.  However, this fact often overlooked (or sacrificed) in this genre of game due to the extra time and resources it demands -- which is understandable given that many of these games are not huge blockbusters.  So the fact that the extra effort was made here is a major plus for me.\n\nThere are definitely a few plot holes that need to be filled, but the developers seem to be very responsive to suggestions and constructive criticism on anything pointed out -- judging by how quickly the Anji sex-scene issues were addressed and corrected through Steam forum discussions.  I'm feeling pretty confident that the final story will be cohesive and comprehensive enough to be satisfying and enjoyable.\n\nSupes excited for Mimi and the King's routes!!","timestamp_created":1609439866,"timestamp_updated":1609440225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ47pyH3fYCd+yWvwI="}
