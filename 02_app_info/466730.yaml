    review: "Not a great tower defense game, but a nice basic, serviceable entry in\
      \ to the genre. \nGame play is rather claustrophobic, with short paths and a\
      \ severe camera angle that can often make it hard to get a feel for what is\
      \ going on, and the tower upgrades are very basic, with no choices to be made\
      \ once the tower is decided on. There is no pathing, and limited strategic options.\
      \ \nThat said, the graphics are very cute, the sound effects and music are nice\
      \ and there seems to be a robust upgrade system, though to date you can never\
      \ actually use more than four of them. There also seem to be a lot of levels,\
      \ I think there are twenty levels for the first set of missions, and there appear\
      \ to be three sets of missions, so it looks like it might be a lot of game.\n\
      Other comments talk about an increase in difficulty around level five? Either\
      \ this has been addressed or it simply didn't impact me. \nGet it on sale if\
      \ you like the genre, but you wont be missing much if you give it a pass."
