Maybe because it's too subtle or I don't have deep enough knowledge about music. I do notice that some traps move corresponded to the music, which is a nice little touch. \n\nLevels are randomly generated and surprisingly well paced. The difficulty feels right and I constantly feel challenged without too frustrated. \n\nThe game prevent you from going backward, which is quite unnecessary since it also has a countdown timer to stress player to move forward. \n\nThe unique locomotion system, which moves player based on the HMD's offset, fits very well to the fast-pace gameplay. It's intuitive once you know the logic, and I can see the advantage of less VR-sickness and easier dual-wielding pistols. It's harder to control at low speed but it's also a right amount of extra challenge.","timestamp_created":1550560850,"timestamp_updated":1575013878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj5GJ2+4CddikuwE="}
