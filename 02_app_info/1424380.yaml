    review: "This game is honestly the first of its kind. It\u2019s so simple you\
      \ just avoid the bombs being dropped from above and make it to the bottom. It\
      \ gets pretty challenging the farther you go down but the reward is worth it.\
      \ Like I was able to unlock higher jumps so instead of 2 block jump height I\
      \ was able to go 3. It makes it easier but it still gets difficult the farther\
      \ down you go in apocalypse. There are plenty of unlockables and I\u2019m sure\
      \ many more to come in this game so it makes the  $2 worth it. This is an extremely\
      \ addictive game and I can't wait to see what the dev adds in the future."
