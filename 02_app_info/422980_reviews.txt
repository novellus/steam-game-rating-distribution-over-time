Games like these remind me of the old NES and SNES days when games were really challenging. Super Robot Jump Jump is super hard especially if you want to collect all achievements. Can be quite frustrating repeating levels all the time but reloading is fast and levels aren't particularly long. Well recommended. 8/10.\n\nEDIT: After many hours and deaths I have finally beaten both The Desert and The Volcano with all cogs and speed stars. Then comes \"The Space\" with it's ridiculous long and impossible levels! Unfortunately the game has changed from fun and challenging to extremely frustrating and enraging. For this reason I don't recommend the game anymore.","timestamp_created":1543787479,"timestamp_updated":1544306940,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhrv3x+cCefKmtAE="}
