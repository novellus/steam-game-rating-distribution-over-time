    about_the_game: "Princess Niamh wants her dinner - but someone left the door open\
      \ and now the entire forest fancies a snack! Brave the hazards of the castle\
      \ tower, dodge the lunges of Squire Benoist the incumbent ghost and purge the\
      \ encroaching pests - but don\u2019t let the food get cold! Get to the top of\
      \ the tower in time and receive a reward that only a delectable and benevolent\
      \ damsel can bestow.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCastle Clamber is an arcade inspired\
      \ action platformer for one or two players, either locally or over a network.\
      \ It tells the time-old story of a devoted underdog, blinded by a well-meaning\
      \ sense of duty and a rose tinted visor. Trap enemies in your bubbles, defeat\
      \ them with explosions or crush them with crates! Reclaim the food they stole\
      \ and carry it to the waiting Princess Niamh to collect your prize and earn\
      \ a place in the world online rankings."

    review: "Castle Clambers is an addictive little high-score platform game that\
      \ could come straight from the arcade halls. And just like games in an arcade\
      \ hall, it makes you keep playing.\n\nWith the low price and simple game mechanics\
      \ I did not expect this game would be fantastic, so it surprised me in a good\
      \ way. It may not keep you playing for days or hours straight on end, but (at\
      \ least for me) it makes me come back to play a few games every now and then.\
      \ Especially with the developer still giving his/her project attention, which\
      \ is much more than I expected. Both the game and dev deserve a bigger player\
      \ base.\nThe controls and 'hitboxes' improved a lot since I bought the game.\
      \ And especially after you get a little familiar with the game and levels this\
      \ is less and less a problem (if it was one to begin with.) The game is pretty\
      \ forgiving and levels are not crazy difficult either, so it is not an issue\
      \ to me. What is even better; in recent months several improvements and even\
      \ some new features were added to the game. And with Steam's recent new feature\
      \ 'Remote Play Together' the (enjoyment) value of this game has increased even\
      \ more!\n\nTops:\n+ Catches the retro arcade atmosphere perfectly\n+ Low price\n\
      + Addictive\n+ Developer still updates the game and replies to feedback\n+ Fast\
      \ paced\n+ Levels are not too difficult (since it is a highscore oriented game,\
      \ making levels too difficult would be questionable.)\n+ Perfect for (couch)\
      \ Co-Op\n+ Music\n\nNeutral:\n- Only (local) couch Co-op, No Online Multiplayer\
      \ (However, with Steam Remote Play, this should be no problem.)\n- Not much\
      \ to do after you finish all levels/achievements, except for beating highscores.\
      \ But that is one of the core goals in these game genres.\n- Controls can be\
      \ a little confusing when first playing (the tutorial in the menu prevents this\
      \ though.)\n\n\nDownsides (nitpicking):\n- There are some (very) rare glitches\
      \ that can make you get pushed inside the top wall or get stuck in a level after\
      \ you complete it (happened only once.)\n- In some rare cases you die while\
      \ it looks like not hitting an enemy/deadly thing. \nNote: The cause for this\
      \ last point might be too technical for me, but I assume bc of the retro pixel\
      \ style and low resolution this is not totally avoidable. Also, this problem\
      \ was worse when I bought this game, and the situation has improved significantly\
      \ after updates. With the current difficulty of levels, it should not be a (big)\
      \ issue."
