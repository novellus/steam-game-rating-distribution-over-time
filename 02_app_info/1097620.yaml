    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Description</h2><br>In a city under\
      \ fire...it is up to two cops to clean up the streets. Players can take control\
      \ of either Officer Maximus Faust (controlled with VR), or they can play as\
      \ Officer Samuel Lo (played like a traditional FPS). Players using Officer Faust\
      \ will be able to use VR moves (like peeking around corners, blind-firing their\
      \ weapons, and dual wielding), whereas players using Officer Lo will be able\
      \ to take advantage of a wider array of gadgets that is not available for Faust.\
      \ Players can go through the levels solo (with their respective AI partner),\
      \ or they can team up locally via <u>asymmetric multiplayer</u> to tackle each\
      \ mission.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Built\

      \ or two bursts, but likewise, you can take out threats with one or two shots\
      \ as well (depending on your accuracy). I wanted to create a game where the\
      \ weapons have a strong impact when fired, making the kills feel very over-the-top.\

    short_description: A VR experience like no other. Take control of either Officer
      Maximus Faust or Officer Samuel Lo. Or team up locally via asymmetric multiplayer
      to tackle each scenario. 'Cause when the bad guys gotta go...you gotta hit 'em
      Fast...and you gotta hit 'em Low.

    review: Fast and Low is a Must have for any siege loving vr gamer.  The mix of
      fun in multiplayer and difficulty is perfect to keep you excited and coming
      back for more with its quite hidden progression system of finding new guns through
      the levels.  Overall, if you don't have friends, wait for a sale, but if a few
      lads have 20 dollars to spend on a fresh cut or this game, go for the game.
