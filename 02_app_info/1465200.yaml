      \  [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b]Broken Ecchi Gallery[/b] is a jigsaw puzzle game.\n\
      \n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nArrange assorted pieces to assemble an image. [b]Broken\
      \ Ecchi Gallery[/b] is a basic jigsaw puzzle game. There are eight puzzles to\
      \ choose from, of varying difficulty. The image of the completed image is overlayed\
      \ onto the playing area -- that, combined with \"snapping\" puzzle pieces make\
      \ [b]Broken Ecchi Gallery[/b] a breeze.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThere is no story\
      \ (and I'm not making one up).\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe titlescreen and user-interface\
      \ are appealing and simplistic. However, the user-interface is slow to respond\
      \ -- I found myself furiously clicking as I waited for it to respond my requests.\
      \ From \"Settings\", you may adjust audio preferences. There doesn't seem to\
      \ be any in-built way to window the application. There is no gallery. To review\
      \ CGs, you must always complete their respective puzzles. The puzzles themselves\
      \ and the playing pieces are stylistically [i]broken,[/i] but there is no way\
      \ to see the artwork without the \"broken\" filters. \n\n[b]- The Goods-[/b]\n\
      There are eight puzzles to see, each featuring an anime babe. There is no nudity,\
      \ I did catch some [i]mean underboob![/i] The artwork is decent, but you could\
      \ find similar content with a quick Google search. If you're here for \"mature\
      \ content\" (as advertised on the Steam Store), [i]you're going to be a sad\
      \ camper.[/i]\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nI don't recommend this game, even if you're\
      \ in the market for discount jigsaws. I don't ask for much -- all I want is\
      \ a functional, responsive game with a good selection of artwork. [b]Broken\
      \ Ecchi Gallery[/b] is the minimum of functional. There's no difficulty settings\
      \ or \"save\" functionality. The UI isn't snappy, and there's no proper gallery.\
      \ The artwork isn't bad, but it's both generic and not well suited for a widescreen\
      \ monitor. My expectations for [b]Broken Ecchi Gallery[/b] were already rock-bottom,\
      \ but this game couldn't even reach the bar.\n\n[table][tr][td][url=https://wombattrap.com/review/broken-ecchi-gallery/]To\
