This one is a pretty good one actually. Some of the features are:\n\n1. A map that shows where things aren't finished. Automatic travel using the map cuts down on backtracking\n2. Clear and interesting puzzles. Only about 2 or 3 of the minigames were difficult and that was mainly due to the amount of work that needed to be done in order to finish them.\n3. Collectible masks that also have interesting histories tied to them, once you find them\n4. A bonus chapter that tells more about the mysterious assassin\n5. Movies and wallpapers are available in the extras menu\n6. Multiple different difficulty settings to suit everyone's chosen play styles\n7. An intriguing villain with a good story\n8. Strategy guide\n9. Can replay minigames and HOG's from the extras menu\n\nNegatives:\n1. Some of the voice acting was just awful. It was painful to listen to at times.\n2. The few minigames that were just super long to do. Skip is nice, but I prefer not to do it. I also don't want to spend like 20 minutes of my life turning dials or moving panels around.\n3. Achievements in game, but (like so many other HOG's) not on Steam. So, your achievements are cool, but since they aren't displayed on Steam... *shrug*\n4. A few of the objectives for puzzles were vague. Might've been nice to have an \"info\" button that gave more information on what was expected for puzzles.\n5. HOG's were pretty good, but some of the ones that required you to combine objects weren't always clear on what needed to be done. \n\nOtherwise, if you like hidden object games (HOG's), this is a pretty good one. I don't regret playing it and genuinely enjoyed most of it. For the price, it was good.","timestamp_created":1606042326,"timestamp_updated":1606042326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv6Ll9/UCfJXtrwI="}
