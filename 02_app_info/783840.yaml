    review: 'To call this a "Murder Mystery" is a bit of a misdirection. Yes, people
      certainly die, or at least one person does at the beginning unless you choose
      to add to that body count depending on your play style, but it never really
      feels like a "mystery" that can actually investigate and explore.


      Your character cannot talk. When interacting with other NPCs, you are only given
      the predetermined lines that they speak, you have no dialogue options of your
      own nor do you have a way of interacting with any of the characters other than
      intended. This means when your bus runs over a woman on Day 1 (not a spoiler
      because it happens within the first minute of the game), you cannot actually
      warn anyone of the event.


      My first instinct was to warn someone in town or the sheriff of what happened
      in the intro, but talking to any of them yielding no results. Next thing I tried
      was going to the infirmary, taking a med kit, and then tried to use it on her.
      You can only use items on yourself, not other people, so that didn''t work.
      Finally, I tried dragging the woman''s body into town for help, and was immediately
      attacked and killed by the Sheriff, because his coding was clearing reacting
      as if I had murdered the woman.


      Honestly, I felt disappointed by this. It felt a little weird trying to do a
      "pacifist" run where the bus I was on runs over a woman and I was encouraged
      by the game and its residents to essentially just... ignore it... so I tried
      playing again as a murderer.


      This time, I killed the Bus driver, disposed of the evidence, and then just
      explored and talked to the townsfolk the rest of the game. I never killed another
      NPC again because I wanted to take my time to learn their behaviors and learn
      a bit about their backstories and characters, so I took things slow and methodical,
      dedicating my time to playing the game more like Stardew Valley by improving
      my home, doing favors, romancing some citizens, and earning popularity... at
      least long enough until I could start huntning each of the NPCs down one by
      one.


      ... but this didn''t work out for me either, because as it turns out, the game
      week does not repeat, you only have 7 days before an ending event is forced
      upon you, and I wound up dying in the end of the game not for killing someone,
      but for "stealing" various objects from people''s homes.


      I had already spent 5 or so hours at that point and was somewhat frustrated
      by the outcome. I could tell the game wanted me to go places or do something,
      but there was a terrible lack of direction to tell me what I should or shouldn''t
      be doing at any one time.


      This is also a personal preference, but the story and setting, with what little
      I understand of it, is very dark, bizarre, and hard to understand.


      After close to 6 hours of playing, I have come out of the experience neither
      feeling like a clue solving hero OR a formidable danger to the world around
      me... I just felt confused, creeped out, and bored.


      Its a fun concept, but its not at all what I expected and it perhaps could have
      been executed differently and more effectively.


      EDIT:

      Did another run thru as murderer, I hadn''t discovered Morgo or his upgrades
      in my first serious play through, which certainly helped with some of the more
      frustrating elements of the game (stamina, dragging speed, inventory, ect.),
      but there''s currently too many bugs with the evidence system to be enjoyed
      in the way it should be.


      There were a number of occasions where I had killed a villager, made sure I
      was never attacked back/took damage, and was always very careful I didn''t leave
      any of my items or murder weapon behind at the crime scene... yet the recap
      by the sheriff that night would often claim "There are multiple pieces of evidence
      at the scene, but no fingerprints" or "There was blood at the scene not belonging
      to the victim" or "Found a murder weapon from a previous crime"... yet none
      of these were actually true, and because of it I, once again, felt cheated out
      of the ending I expected/desired.


      I killed 4 people on my very first night, and despite leaving no evidence except
      in one case where I took damage from one villager, the Sheriff said "all signs
      point to [Protagonist]"


      Its a fun concept but in its current state the game is too buggy to be enjoyed
      as intended.'
