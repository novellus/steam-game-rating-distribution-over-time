    reviews: "\u201CCaptain Nemo is a hidden object / adventure game where you follow\
      \ the story of the professor Arronax, his helper Conseil, and Ned Land.   I\
      \ am always on the lookout for Hidden Object games. Crisp App Studios has become\
      \ one of my favourite developers in this genre. In their latest game, Captain\
      \ Nemo, the standard is as sharp as it can be in regards to the hidden objects.\
      \ The objects are well blended into each of the scenes with over 50 per level.\
      \ Bear in mind, you have to find around 15 items per level on each of your walkthroughs,\
      \ which will give you good re-playability.  In this game, Crisp App Studios\
      \ introduces the 360 degree panoramic levels, which are great fun.\u201D<br><a\
