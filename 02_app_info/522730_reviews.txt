The bloody gore and violence of other games is replaced by a multitude of humoristic characters, which makes it suitable for more people. Instead of the enemies attacking you, they attack the castle door and this works better in many ways. A drawback is that you always play against the same background; it would be refreshing to change the scenery sometimes (and the music).\nThe use of the bow feels very realistic and you really get the feeling of improving your skills. The first levels are easy but as you get beyond level 25, it gets quite challenging. You just want to start over and over again to make it on the hall of fame.","timestamp_created":1564356755,"timestamp_updated":1564356755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ447e7newCcImpzwE="}
