    review: ONce you get to far the game just crashes and you cat even load up your
      game, whats the points of endless upgrading if your game cant even handle it,
      now im stuck cant load or continue, nothing should stop me from going further
      but your game is built so you never get far as you want only as far as the game
      cant handle before it cant keep up with its self and stops, pay money for a
      game that never ending and in 30 hours its to fast to keep up with its self,
      stupid. might has well but a cap so this didnt happen, played lots of these
      games where you got super strong and flew throught the start after you reset
      and got bounuses but this game cant even handle it when your super strong so
      whats the point. Worthless peice of sht using up 96 of my Memory the second
      it opens than froze my whole PC coz the game is to stupid to keep up with its
      self over price cat sht.
