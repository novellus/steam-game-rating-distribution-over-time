Obviously, as it is early access, purchasing the game at this stage isn't for everyone. However, I enjoy seeing the updates as they come and playing them as soon as possible to get a feel of where the game is going. I heard about Skara a few weeks ago and cannot wait to bring all my friends in to play it when it's more stable :) The graphics are beautiful and what they seem to have in mind keeps me excited for updates.\n\nTL;DR,\nIt's early access, buying it now will mean you're getting it before it's \"finished\".\nIf you don't want to go ahead and buy, add it to your wishlist and follow it and check back every so often!","timestamp_created":1414724567,"timestamp_updated":1588907400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555946707725524902","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwtNuQ+fECfue6MA=="}
