First of all, there are no options. I was missing at least a volume slider and a fullscreen button.\n\nThe game has three endings, I got one of them. Not sure if this was due to some choices I made, but the story seemed to end all of a sudden, right when it felt like we were getting started. Perhaps there is more in the other endings...\n\nFor someone with no experience with Tarot cards, choosing the right one was purely trial & error. (Choosing the wrong one leads to instant fail + retry.)\n\nThe UI is simple, working, but clunky. It feels like playing an old Flash game. The transitions between scenes and music switches did not feel smooth.\n\nIt's a trippy little story with awesome art, if that's enough for you, this game is great. I wish there was a little more polish for the price, so I cannot recommend it.\n\n(About 10 minutes of my playtime was spent trying to make the game fullscreen.)","timestamp_created":1602570274,"timestamp_updated":1602570274,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514285683631896973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzbiokPUCeqHKpwI="}
