Nonetheless this game is a gem, it has fantastic controls, music, and is a decent length. What I personally observed was that a lot of people who just didn't feel motivated to keep playing, but the game is ironically about persistence through a strange and changing hellscape. For real though, I would seriously recommend TEiN to people who already think this game looks fun from seeing it on the store page or really like McMillen's work in general and are ready to be persistent.\n\n I would give this game a 8.9/10 based off of raw personal experience. \n","timestamp_created":1609895318,"timestamp_updated":1609895318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn6LP6vYCe7fvwAI="}
