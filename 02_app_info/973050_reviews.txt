Love old style better than most. Alot of the conversations have me giggle whilst reading. The comedy injected is quite great I think.

I am enjoying quite well.","timestamp_created":1600507119,"timestamp_updated":1600507119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42ZDq0vQCdYLeogI="}
