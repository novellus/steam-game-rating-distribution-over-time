It took me just over three hours to play through the game, with an extra two and a half afterwards to find all the cool stuff and get the dialogue and achievements I missed. If you do play this game then make sure to check in with the NPCs in the Settlement regularly so you don't miss anything like I did.\n\nI only really have two issues with the game. First, there's never much indication that you should head back to the Settlement between puzzles, nor is there any way to go back to the things you missed there once you've completed all the temples. You also can't get a lot of the hints twice, meaning if you missed them the first time around then tough luck. Secondly, There's no way to explore after you've beat the game. This one's pretty minor but it would've been nice to be able to find the things you missed without making a new save.\n\nOverall, a solid 8/10 experience. It's not very long, so eighteen dollars may be a bit pricy for some. If you see it on sale then definitely pick it up.","timestamp_created":1610060885,"timestamp_updated":1610060885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wO3G7/YCc6SzwQI="}
