    review: '**WARNING** I WOULDN''T TOUCH THIS GAME WITH A 100 FOOT STICK!


      Graphics are bad for the content this game provides, graphics don''t need to
      be insane, if...the game it''s self provides amazing content...this provides
      neither.


      Hold right click mouse button just to turn , no options in main game ...for
      sensitivity, etc.


      copy paste map of trees and basic land with copy pasted wolves , terrible optimization...


      I can go all day, this is not something I want to support...


      People think "early access" means you can have an unplayable game, than we are
      going to make it for you, eff that...you need to put in actual effort for us
      to believe this is even worthy of being in "early access".  This is just insulting
      to everyone..to see a game for ten bucks have such a lack of everything.'
