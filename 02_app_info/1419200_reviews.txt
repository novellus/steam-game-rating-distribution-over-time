And not even from a choice I made!\n\nSad to think I wasted money on these two, wish the other book that was supposed to have been released yesterday had been released on time.\n\nBottom line unless you like dying and trying to figure out why so as to avoid it again maybe on your next play through (Im sure only to be killed by something else) Id suggest a hard pass on this series.","timestamp_created":1603468100,"timestamp_updated":1603468100,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475438624620437622","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmrCJq/UCco7RqQI="}
