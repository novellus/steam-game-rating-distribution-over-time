    review: My main gripe is that since installing this, the other inbuilt flights
      in FSX have gone to pot, with numerous niggling faults, such a not being able
      to fully switch off aircraft electrical systems using the battery switch. Now
      I can't use any flights at all, as the program shows the initial cockpit screen
      before giving an error message and crashing to desktop. The manual does warn
      you that the code used does "mess about" with the basic FSX programming, but
      surely that should be a warning BEFORE you buy it! Also, before I realised that
      this add-on was going to trash the existing FSX parameters, I'd already begun
      to suspect that it was just TOO complex. The "must read" manual goes on and
      on...and on...and on... and on..., and when I'd spent three evenings going through
      the "sample flight" and not even getting as far as starting the engines, I began
      to realise that this was going to be a real chore rather than a bit of escapist
      fun. For example, you apparently can't use the "time compression" utility to
      speed up flights, so if you want to fly from Manchester to Turkey, be prepared
      to spend four hours staring at your screen! This is clearly only for the "hard
      core" FSX enthusiasts who really think they COULD fly an airliner and have unlimited
      leisure time at their disposal. I'll be ditching it and re-installing FSX asap!
