The game delivered on all aspects of the proposed experience but had issues with bugs and glitches. I've heard talk of some exploiting or even hacking but I have never had the displeasure of encountering them so I cannot talk much on them.\n\nFinding a lobby with any amount of players became a challenge as the months passed. (We're talking anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes to find a lobby and then again to wait for others. Most people do not have that kind of patience.) I hear now it is even worse but there are still games being played out there apparently. I even managed one myself recently so it's not dead yet. Floundering? Maybe but not dead by any means. \n\nGame play is what you would expect if you have played Dead by Daylight and Left 4 dead. It blends the multiplayer concepts the two games have. It is less smooth then either of the two in my opinion but the overall challenge of outpacing a team of 3 distinct killer types controlled by one player. Is sometimes overshadowed by how easy it is for the survivors to rush the objectives.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes but I'd also recommend using discord to link up with other players. It's far far faster that way. (We're talking down from 5-10 to 2-3 minutes with wait for other players) Plus there is ALWAYS someone trying to play as a killer (just like dead by daylight) so chances are you'll get paired up fairly quickly.\n\nTLDR? \"too few ppl casually play now so have a backup to lure extra players\"","timestamp_created":1610202507,"timestamp_updated":1610202507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ474zj8/YCc7HowQI="}
