    review: 'Refunded.  The hands are completely wrong to hold the swords (Vive).  Play
      is not explained and the story is not apparent.  Gameplay is very very simple
      with little variety or interaction.  Essentially, you can just wave your swords
      around and hope you kill something.  No blocking and not much of anything else.  Nice
      visuals but needs a lot of work.
