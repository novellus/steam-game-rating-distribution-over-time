Weapons and Perks are a nice bonus too.\nFree DLC is a dying breed. GOOD DLC is not far behind. GOOD AND FREE DLC is endangered. This is a breath of fresh air, as long as you don't mind the smell of four roses bourbon.\n\nWho wants some WANG!?","timestamp_created":1599259663,"timestamp_updated":1599259663,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qbvTrfQCeITqnwI="}
