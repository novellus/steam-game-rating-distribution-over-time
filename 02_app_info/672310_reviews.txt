I have decided to keep it, and I have decided to recommend the game. But with some reservations.\n\nThe game is played on a single map (divided by portals which you can freely move between). It is a pretty hardcore game, in which you can lose everything and can be forced to reset. In many ways making this a survival game. In this game you will be able to meet hundreds or even thousands of other players all trying to expend their empire.\n\nThis is personally something I love, no instance based RTS, but one massive world. Everyone connected to each other. For that reason alone, this game gets a massive plus, as there are very few games like this and even less that succeeded. It is a genre that needs to be tamed, as a true MMORTS is something I have been longing for for years.\n\nThe basics are there and they work. The pathfinding is not perfect, but your units do get from A to B. Building works correctly and your resource gathers work as they should. \n\nThere is however not much beyond this point. The amount of buildings, resources and troops is limited. When it comes to war, generally the player that is online the most wins, as he can gather more resources. The developers have mentioned that more resources are on the way and hopefully more unit and building variaty will be added as well.\n\nThe game is also lacking a real objective, as there is no way to 'win' the game. This might not be seen as a negative for everyone however, as some prefer the sandbox gametype.","timestamp_created":1533841736,"timestamp_updated":1542910929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551352977752685547","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ho2qnucCeun4pwE="}
