      /><br><br>Born into a normal family and living a normal life is our protagonist,
      Yukino.  She's a scatterbrained klutz who frequently suffers from bad luck.<br><br>She
      is currently staying with her uncle, Yoichi. They live in the city, where she
      is working hard on her studies.  As a result, she regularly goes to the library
      to study and read. While she was studying one day, she locked eyes with a young
      man who went to her school.  Being shy, Yukino immediately averted her gaze
      until the young man spoke to her.<br><br>&quot;Do you like that book?&quot;<br><br>The
      young man's name was Souji. He was a charming young man who was working hard
      to get admitted to graduate school.  He said he was preparing to take famously
      difficult exams in the hopes of becoming a doctor shortly. Yukino was moved
      by his admirable goal and decided to support him. Afterward, the two found that
      it was quite easy to talk to one another.  They spent their days growing closer
      while going to the library together to study and read.  While there one day,
      Souji confessed to her.  Yukino thought highly of him, so she happily accepted
      his confession.  Souji was an upbeat and friendly person. But he was inexperienced
      with women, and so didn't get intimate with Yukino. Instead, they enjoyed a
      platonic romance and then Yukino made her decision.<br><br>&quot;For Souji's
      sake, I'll try to get into the same graduate school!&quot;<br><br>However, she
      was still under the care of her uncle.  And he wouldn't agree to pay the hefty
      admission fees.<br><br>Wanting to pay the admission fee so she could get her
      foot in the door, she decided to take a part-time job...<br><br><strong>Find
