    review: 'Night of The Scarecrows is a quirky survival FPS in which the goal is
      to survive as long as possible while spooky scarecrows spawn continuously from
      various spots on the map.  All scarecrows kill with one hit, some are faster
      than others, and there are three special types: spitters are slow but project
      poison onto you which dramatically slows you and disturbs movement for a short
      duration; flamers deal some explosive damage and cannot be killed with the shovel;
      stompers move at a snail''s pace but take a tremendous amount of damage.  The
      player can sprint for a limited time, but moves slowly once stamina has depleted
      and until it replenishes, so this is best reserved for quick getaways.  Your
      speed also declines when your health is low.


      As of now there are three modes.  "Quick Death" involves killing groups of enemies
      with one shot, rewarding you with ammo for every two kills.  The flare gun''s
      splash damage hurts the player and is lethal within melee range.  The shovel
      is used for close combat or to conserve ammo and must be aimed very precisely.  Scarecrows
      toting a crate on their back drop a bazooka, which has a much greater splash
      radius.  Gas jugs can be filled by two pumps when activated to power a harvesting
      machine which mutilates scarecrows for a period of time.


      "Barn massacre" mode plays much like Quick Death though on a smaller map and
      weapons which spawn periodically, and only one pump.  Additional weapons include
      the machine gun and shotgun.


      "Tower Defence" is focused on defending a Mother Mary statue which provides
      precious ammo in exchange for prayer and equips you with a sniper rifle.  Some
      scarecrows will pursue you while others assault the statue.


      GOOD:  The nostalgic atmosphere is reminiscent of classic horror films and doesn''t
      overstay its welcome.  The scarecrows are a little corny in a good way and sometimes
      even creepy and the challenge is exhilarating.


      BAD:  Mobility can be clunky.  Taking too much splash damage slows you down
      until you find some health, and running scarecrows are impossible to escape
      while in this state.  This wouldn''t be an issue if flare splash damage were
      slightly reduced and I do feel that it is too high for such cramped environments,
      especially given how limited stamina is.  This leads to more frustration than
      necessary and I think it will push a lot of potential players away.  Nine times
      out of ten I lose to mobility issues due to a combination of damage taken and
      low stamina.


      All in all this is a fun, unique game that offers a real challenge and both
      quick, casual gameplay or grinding match after match, and I eagerly look forward
      to more developments and improvements from the developer.  In the meantime,
      I''ll see you out on the farm.'
