Fantastic narration drives you to your objective to get the hell out of the massacre that your character evaded.  The world that this title sets up is intriguing and deep, providing story bits throughout the adventure via written and recorded logs of the victims in the building.  It makes you want to learn more about the world of Kanaka, something that I plan on doing by checking out Dogwood's other title in the universe, Ashes of Kanaka.","timestamp_created":1554774349,"timestamp_updated":1554774349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526665210723876953","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zLrx/+kCfMDxvgE="}
