    about_the_game: <strong>Without the Cell, you won't be able to move a single inch.</strong><br><br>In
      &quot;Heart in the Cell&quot;, you will take on the role of an agent who infiltrates
      the Oniros Corporation and uses the Cell left behind by the first president
      to defeat unknown cosmic beings and unlock the secrets hiding within the Oniros
      Corporation.<br>The game sheds the traditional UI design, breaking the concept
      that the UI can only be used as a fixed layer, and blends it with combat. In
      scenes, the UI will float freely as cells, and players will need to use them
      at the right moment to unleash spells and summon creatures to fight the enemy.
      Players will also need to move their heroes to avoid damage from enemies or
      scenes.<br><br><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">You will experience<br>A world where
