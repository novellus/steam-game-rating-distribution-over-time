    review: "Road Rash em Mad Max\n\nPara quem ficou \xF3rf\xE3o de Road Rash por\
      \ tanto tempo, enfim a espera terminou. Sensa\xE7\xE3o de velocidade bem trabalhada,\
      \ desafio alto, diferentes motos, variedade de armas e golpes pra jogar fora\
      \ da pista, decapitar ou at\xE9 mesmo explodir os advers\xE1rios. Cen\xE1rios\
      \ bonitos, com pistas bem trabalhadas. Jogabilidade muito boa e de f\xE1cil\
      \ assimila\xE7\xE3o, possibilitando ainda a configura\xE7\xE3o dos comandos\
      \ conforme o jogador achar melhor. Trilha sonora espetacular, exatamente dentro\
      \ do que se espera de um jogo nesse estilo.\n\nUm cl\xE1ssico atualizado, com\
      \ nova e \xF3tima roupagem.\n\n10/10"
