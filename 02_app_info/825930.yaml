    about_the_game: Sometimes there is nothing better than a tourney in a classic
      battleships game. You can see a beautifully designed sea battle, familiar to
      those from your school times. You have to play against the computer and you
      need to destroy all enemy ships before yours are destroyed.<br><br><img src="https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/825930/extras/RoyalBattleship_animation.jpg?t=1523039439"

      are preparing for the match, there are some ships of different sizes - from
      simple battle boat to a huge battleship. You put them on the battlefield and
      nobody else than you knows their location. Of course, don't know the enemy's
      positions neither. Thus the battle is absolutely fair and you can only guess
      where to shoot. Of course, if you hit a battleship for the first time, it will
      be easy to find the other tiles. However, finding all enemy boats can be a real
      challenge. Do not forget that this game is not about speed, but about variety,
      so that the battle is always different. The game perfectly develops strategic
      thinking and will be useful to both adults and children. In addition, it will
      help you to plunge into nostalgia for simple classic games.<br><br><img src="https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/825930/extras/os.png?t=1523039439"
