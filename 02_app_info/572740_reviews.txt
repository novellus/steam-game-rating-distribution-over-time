Trying to find out what to do next is much easier now because of the addition of the on-character checklist to keep yourself on track with tasks. The cell phone with internet on-character is much easier to research puzzles to find solutions. I would say a negative about this one is that a lot of it is translation puzzles which I am not a big of fan of as well as the magnet puzzle is one of the most annoying puzzles I have ever done. Play it and find out what I mean.","timestamp_created":1609819367,"timestamp_updated":1609819367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45cSt6PYCd5vMwAI="}
