    about_the_game: "In your city, there is a new chain of fast food restaurants,\
      \ so-called fast food and everything, but one chain you found very suspicious.All\
      \ because they literally filled the entire city and it is not clear how. They\
      \ are not in great demand among consumers, but they are opening more and more.\
      \ Where did they get their money from?<br />\r\nAfter conducting a small investigation,\
      \ your hero finds out that fast food is just a cover, in fact, they are engaged\
      \ in nothing more than the arms trade.<br />\r\nNow you will have to fight against\
      \ this mafia, illegally selling weapons, destroying one point after another.<br\
      \ />\r\nArm yourself to the teeth and go on this most dangerous, full of shootouts\
      \ journey. Think over your actions, discover new abilities and buy new weapons,\
      \ all in order to defeat evil."
