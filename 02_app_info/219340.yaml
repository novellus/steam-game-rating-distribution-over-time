    review: "The Banner Saga: Factions revolves around the first part of the banner\
      \ saga story, in which you are permanently stuck inside one area of the story,\
      \ fighting battles in a bar against others in a multiplayer tactics game. This\
      \ game has a ton of potential to grow, and can be very prominent as a game.\
      \ However, the fact that it is not original in itself compared to the actual\
      \ banner saga game, and the fact that no one is able to play the game, as there\
      \ is no one to play against in this multiplayer only game, makes this game a\
      \ little less than promising. I would not waste time on this until the developers\
      \ work on the game to increase popularity, through advertising or working on\
      \ the game's content, of which it is lacking, if at all.\n\nRating: 2/10\n\n\
      Overall Review:\n\n        Pros:\n\n                -Interesting Gameplay /\
      \ Potential\n\n\n        Cons:\n\n                -Not original in any way\n\
      \n                -Very small playerbase for a multiplayer game\n\n        \
      \        -Gets boring if you have any luck finding matches"
