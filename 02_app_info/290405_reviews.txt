These three types are easy to craft/find and nothing special. Fight monsters for a while and you can get them. This DLC adds unnecessary \"advantages\" that you can easily get on your own. Ironically, the more useful three jewel types from the other two DLCs - citrine, tourmaline, amethyst; are missing in this higher quality variant. You only really need these jewels on the Expert difficulty and even then you find plenty of these three types in the game...\n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] To activate the Faceted Oculi Pack install it on Steam and then launch the game while having uPlay on. It should ask you if you want to add it to your uPlay account and then confirm once you are in the game. You also have to start a new save in order for these rewards to appear.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this DLC review you can find more in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1586259382,"timestamp_updated":1586259417,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+rqbqvECeu/w/gE="}
