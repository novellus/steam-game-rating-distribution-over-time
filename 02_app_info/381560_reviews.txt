The more time you put into it the better your decks can become. You get daily rewards for the first month only, but there are other ways to earn rewards. Campaign is an easy way to level up in the beginning and gain gold. This is better than Hearthstone in my opinion because when you buy diamonds to get other cards  for some of them you are guaranteed a legendary or epic. Heathstone only gives you a rare or better card no matter what card pack you purchase, mostly rares are what you get. Also in this game you can level up every card in the game by dust. This can increase their attack ad defense as well as their hit points and as with spells can make them do more damage or heal you better or protect your cards better. Yes I put money into this game to help me get better cards, but people did that in hearthstone too. The cards are better in this game than hearthstone. Hearthstone you got to pay for your story line or campaign quests. In this game it is all available to you as you reach the right level for that area. And in this game You get rewards for  completing easy, normal & hard modes. In Heartstone you don't get any reward for for completing quests in hard mode. This game should be at least tried for 30 days so you get all your daily rewards For being a new comer. I can't say for certain if this game is f2p or p2w because I am investing my money in this game and I think it is better to pay for stuff in this game than others especially hearthstone. I stopped playing Hearthstone when I tried this game out. I did not pay for anything up to level 25. In this game you can join a guild or if you have enough gold make your own guild.. And you can stay in that guild as long as you want to if you keep active in the game. I do both campaign and pvp. I was winning more than I was losing before I paid for anything. It is cheaper to level up 1 star cards than 2, 3, 4 or 5. And also the higher the level your card is the more dust it costs. After 30 days if you still don't think it's worth your time than that's your opinion and not mine. I plan on putting my time and spare money in this game because I think it's worth my time and money more than any other card game. I can now have upto 10 decks saved.. You only have upto 6 cards in a deck and in hearthstone you have 30. But it is harder to win in Herathstone than Epic Cards battles. Hearthstone relies on luck to win, having the right card at the right time. In this game you can win with 1 star cards as often as you can win with 4 or 5 star cards. And most cards can be bought with gold which is easier to get than in hearthstone. In Hearthstone you get 10 gold for every 3 wins. In this game you get more gold and every time you win you get gold and alot more experience.","timestamp_created":1487727179,"timestamp_updated":1510864263,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.419939637184143066","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49eKh498Cf93kcg=="}
