      - totalling 3 albums worth of music. Available in FLAC and MP3 320 kbps.</i><br><br>Disco
      Elysium soundtrack by the award-winning rock band British Sea Power exemplifies
      the ethos that made Disco Elysium an unforgettable experience. Pushing the idea
      of what games can be, artists from outside the industry have used their talents
      to show us new possibilities in interactive media. And this music is at the
      core of the experience. It is the heart of Martinaise, where everything beautiful
      is right there, just out of reach. It's atmospheric -- so much like home, but
      still with something to yearn for. It says everything the words can't. <strong>Revachol
      is all right here, baby.</strong><br><br>(You can find the soundtrack in your
      LIbrary, left side, under Soundtracks filter - you can also browse the local
      mp3 or flac files right there as well!)
