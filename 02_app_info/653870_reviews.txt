It has the worst GUI of any game I've ever played, and I can't even seem to figure out how to start a game with more than one player. On top of that, exiting a game literally just restarts it. There are so many bugs and problems it's almost impossible to get to the actual gameplay, which is sub par due to extreme lack of customization. There is barely any gameplay that can be changed. The graphics are pretty bad, and the different characters are the exact same but with different colors. The audio/music is equally bad.\n\n\nEDIT: Hello again. I'm sorry for leaving such a negative review, as in the way things were worded. It was pretty rude of me. It seems you've updated the game, but I could be wrong.\n\nThank you for your response, the GUI is still not very good but I can actually get into the game now. The music is less repetitive, but the graphics are still very basic. The movement feels pretty floaty which is nice, but doesn't feel like there's quite enough control, for example when you jump to the side and stop moving in that direction, you continue moving that way until you hit the ground. There are just a few weird things about the game still, for example when the first player joins he is automatically player 4. I don't understand why this would happen.\n\nThe game also seems a bit repetitive, and there aren't very many interesting mechanics.\n\nI'm very glad that you responded, and I'm sorry for being so rude. Good luck on your next game, or on more updates for this one.","timestamp_created":1534381666,"timestamp_updated":1538780266,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1534446626,"developer_response":"Hey sorry you had a bad experience.  I'd love to help you out anyway that I can, though.  \n\nYou say you can't figure out how to start a game with more than one player. To play with more than one player, you need a controller or keyboard for each player, since you can only have one player per controller or keyboard.  Then, to add a player in the player selection screen, just hit 'A' on the controller, or 'Enter' on the keyboard.  And then when you are ready to move on from player selection, just hit 'Start' on the controller or 'Esc' on the keyboard.  Let me know if this helps you out at all.\n\nAnd exiting a game should bring you back to the game options menu where you can change the game type, length, and map.  If you want to go back to the player selection screen, you can hit 'B' on the controller or 'Backspace' on the keyboard.\n\nHopefully this is helpful for you."}],"cursor":"AoJw4e+co+YCd4bDqAE="}
