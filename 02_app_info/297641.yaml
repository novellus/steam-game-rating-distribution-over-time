    review: 'Definitely not for someone hoping to make a serious game.

      I was pretty disappointed with this pack. There''s only one Female Hero and
      a Sorceress. The Wizard sounds like an old man, and the rest are evil voices.

      Aside from the Evil Villain voices (the third I actually liked), they just lack
      emotion, It sounds like someone read them while rolling their eyes - they just
      weren''t into it. I won''t lie that some made me chuckle, but I won''t use 3/4
      of the samples. Might have been better if there were more variety of female/male
      as well.
