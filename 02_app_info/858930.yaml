    review: 'It''s a really good expansion that lets you build synergies within your
      deck faster with empower (lets you banish another card when you acquire it),
      and allows you to slow down an opponent of your choice by sending monsters into
      their discard pile with infect. Some cards provide a direct benefit for banishing
      them on top of their usual effect. Most importantly none of the cards in this
      set actually force you to banish a card, so no banishing cards you would otherwise
      have liked to keep.


      There are 5 events respective to all 5 categories in the game which are flavorful
      and well designed, and can be acquired as a card with its own effect after paying
      its cost. Some cards in this set will also allow you to benefit from monsters
      in your deck.


      The beauty of this expansion is that it can integrate nicely with other expansions
      and it accelerates synergies within decks. Essentially helps and rewards you
      for building decks in a game where you build decks.'
