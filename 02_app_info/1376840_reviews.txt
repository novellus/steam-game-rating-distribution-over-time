It definitely focuses more on the story than the romance, and the mystery is quite obvious. I knew who the villain was from the first conversation I had with him, and it wasn't because i'm good at solving mysteries lol. There were also some typos and grammatical issues, especially towards the end of the game. The game's greatest strengths are it's atmospheric soundtrack, and Jack the Ripper, of course. It helps that I find the Jack the Ripper case fascinating.\n\nIt was fun, and I enjoyed my time with it. 5/10","timestamp_created":1609713233,"timestamp_updated":1609713233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xtWY5fYCee2bwAI="}
