It's a time attack game but you're hopping on one leg trying to get to the finish line located on the other side of a mountain. \n\nI don't mind time limits in games, but you never ran out of it in Metal Slug and you probably didn't even notice it there in the first place. Yet in Gigantic Army it's ever present, with pickups designed to extend it by 1 or 5 second intervals, why?\n\n[hr]\nThat all aside, if you can accept that it's a time/score attack platformer with little to no mech customisation that looks like a SNES game and plays a little rough then by all means give it a shot. \n\nI eventually found my groove and enjoyed replaying levels a little to try and get through with little to no damage and take down bosses faster, but there's little else to actually do and there's no actual incentive either. There is a storyline there somewhere and that's probably the games strongest part - you read text off a data tablet between each level so... I guess your imagination fills in the details?\n\nI'd give this a Neutral if it were possible, however there's not enough in this game to recommend. \nHave a look at the total hours played for most reviewers and you'll find there's a reason most are only 2 hours on average.\n\nAt least the Nintendo Switch version looks a good deal better than it does here. Though it was made by another company and a shame it didn't not make its way onto steam to replace this version.","timestamp_created":1609508844,"timestamp_updated":1609595590,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1/LX4fYCf7yzvwI="}
