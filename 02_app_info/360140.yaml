    review: "I'm yet to play the game, but discovered the music on a USB labelled\
      \ \"Video Game Soundtracks\" that I recently compiled for my PS3 (which is little\
      \ more than a glorified multimedia player these days). Lo and behold, this album\
      \ is a bit of a doozy! Super-atmospheric, surprisingly melodic...a simmering,\
      \ sinister mini-masterpiece that threatens to explode into full-blown apocalypse\
      \ at any moment.\n\n   Put it this way: there's a lot of bass frequency, yet\
      \ very little for your average ecstasy-addled raver in pink furry booties to\
      \ bop to. EBM-loving goths, maybe...but even that's a bit of a stretch. This\
      \ is some moody, broody sh*t.\n\n   If you're still in your teens and living\
      \ with your parents, and are looking for a fresh new way to \"rebel\" against\
      \ them, I strongly recommend purchasing this soundtrack. Your folks will immediately\
      \ cease searching your bed for marijuana and wank mags, and start looking for\
      \ razor blades and Anton LaVey autobiographies instead. Forget Metallica and\
      \ Marilyn Manson: take a gun to school with a burned copy of THIS surly f*cker\
      \ sitting at home in your CD player, and the cops and courts will have a field\
      \ day.\n\n   There won't be any \"but he seemed like such a nice, normal boy\"\
      \ testimonies from people who know you. Even your Mum will say: \"Yep, I'm not\
      \ surprised, given that depressing, Satanic crap he listens to. Now if you'll\
      \ excuse me, officer, I was just in the middle of playing all my Beach Boys\
      \ records in strict chronological order...\"\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Yes,\
      \ the Beach Boys joke is a thinly-veiled Charlie Manson reference. No, I don't\
      \ expect anyone except myself to get it. Yes, I am a sad, snarly b*stard who\
      \ needs to get out of the house and watch happy-go-lucky Marvel movies more\
      \ often.)"
