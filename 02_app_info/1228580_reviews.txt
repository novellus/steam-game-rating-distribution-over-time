For Trine 2 there are a LOT of songs available - 23 wonderful tracks from the base game and 9 more from The Goblin Menace expansion. All available in both .flac and .mp3 formats. A good buy overall and definitely worth getting on a sale. \n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] You can press Download Album in the Soundtracks section of the library filter and then find it in \"..\\Steam\\steamapps\\music\\Trine 2 Original Soundtrack\". Or in the game directory if it downloaded with your game.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this DLC review you can find more in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1604431605,"timestamp_updated":1604433566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538891494274139404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk6vsx/UCdKONrAI="}
