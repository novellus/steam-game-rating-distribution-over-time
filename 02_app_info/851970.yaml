    about_the_game: "The aim of the game is saving from the sinking ship. The player\
      \ is represented as two passengers who should cooperate in order to save themselves.\

      \ ship. How not to be drowned? Fight a fire, find a way around unfamiliar places,\
      \ go through the dark and obscure compartments of the ship - you will face these\
      \ and many other difficult situations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Two characters.<br\

      \ team in order to survive. They will get stuck in this hell working separately.\
      \ Cooperation is the key to success.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Passengers are in\
      \ danger.<br />\r\nYou will meet some trapped passengers on your way and they\
      \ will need your help to get away. You will have to choose whether to be a &quot;hero&quot;\
      \ and give a chance of survival to others or save only your own life. However,\
      \ remember that each saved person can change the course of events. Moreover,\
      \ the water fills the ship very quickly and there is no time to save each poor\
      \ fellow.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* The atmosphere of the sinking ship.<br />\r\n\
      You are followed by rushing water; you feel sinister breath of death around\
      \ the cold and half-destroyed wreckage of the cruise liner. This morning it\
      \ was a place of relax and pleasure, but right now your only wish is to make\
      \ a run of it. Scattered furniture, broken items, dead passengers. The game\
      \ in 2,5d-format gives you a chance to have a look at an amazing story of the\
      \ hope of salvation."
