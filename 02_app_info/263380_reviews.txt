Full price looks a bit excesive because the game is not polished enough and still contains several bugs and achievements that can't be unlocked. I highly recommend to buy it on sale except if you want to help indie developers.\n\nThe game is extremely simple and fun. The story is compelling enough to keep you going. Like reading \"the crazy adventures of...\" kinda book. It's interesting to see personal projects like this come to reality.\n\nHowever, if graphics are very important to you then this is not your game.\n\nI, overall, enjoyed it quite a lot. That's why I recommend it.","timestamp_created":1603142565,"timestamp_updated":1603142565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yMevofUCesXzqAI="}
