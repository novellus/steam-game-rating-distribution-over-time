Unable to leave her house, she seeks help from an incorporeal and seemingly omniscient entity residing in the shadows of her home. Sara learns that she’s stuck somewhere outside the boundaries of time and space, in a supernatural town called Raven’s Point, and being held captive by four ethereal creatures that call the town home. In order to escape this world, Sara must make contact with each of the entities trapping her there and destroy them by any means necessary in order to break the tethers they hold. In order to do so, Sara must find a number of Keys scattered throughout her home and the various other locations she will visit. Every Key is a remnant of the entity it belongs to, and a gateway to the Door the entity hides behind. By finding these Keys, Sara is able to travel through time and space to confront the being behind its corresponding Door, and, finally, take its life in order to regain part of hers. As Sara progresses, remnants of the past and memories of others begin to surface, revealing more about the town and the fact that not everything is as it appears.<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1152170\/extras\/thedemo.png?t=1567563656\" \/><br>The demo has the player guide Sara through one of the game's four boss fights: The Basement.
