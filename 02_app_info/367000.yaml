    review: 'Minesweeper + Quality of Life Improvements = Fine Sweeper

      ---


      If it wasn''t obvious enough from the store page, Fine Sweeper could easily
      be called a clone of Minesweeper. But it''s not quite a clone, it''s a much
      improved variant that offers a greater sense of progression, less random failures
      (that aren''t your fault) and numerous other (minor) improvements that total
      up to a much better game than the one it''s cloned from.


      If you already know what Minesweeper is and want a better version of it, this
      is a no brainer. It''s a cheap and pleasant way to kill some time and play with
      brain teasing puzzles.


      If you aren''t familiar with Minesweeper, it''s a classic game that used to
      be included with early versions of Windows operating systems to give people
      a fun way to practice their mouse clicking skills (yes, prior to a mouse being
      a ubiquitous and common tool, people honestly didn''t know how to use the thing
      well). These days (for whatever reason) it''s no longer included by default
      with Windows 10, but can be found for free through various sources.


      Sometimes you just want a simple relaxing series of puzzles to chip away the
      hours.
