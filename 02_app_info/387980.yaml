    about_the_game: "There are countless dimensions that are quite similar to ours,\
      \ yet with subtle differences. In one of these dimensions, wars are not fought\
      \ with weapons, but with music. Those that we know as mercenaries are the most\
      \ amazing musicians in the other dimension, and they've enraptured countless\
      \ worlds with their beats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the DJs enlisted in the\
      \ ranks of the great music syndicate known as the Awesomenauts is called Rocco.\
      \ He was once a rising star in The Intergalactic Symphonic Orchestra, but was\
      \ ousted by a concertmaster who would not tollerate Rocco's ruthless freestyle\
      \ jammin'. Refusing the back down and drop his aspirations of becoming a great\
      \ musician, Rocco instead opted to drop the beat and joined the Awesomenauts,\
      \ who welcomed him with open arms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nElectronic Supersonic\
      \ Cybertronic Rocco is now one of the most prominent DJs in the galaxy, and\
      \ uses his music to bring peace to worlds ruled by dissonance.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nThis DLC contains a custom skin for Rocco in Awesomenauts. You need\
      \ to have Rocco available as a playable character in order to access the skin\
      \ in-game. Owning this skin will also unlock the special portrait for use in-game.\
      \ The Electronic Supersonic Cybertronic skin comes with a unique character theme,\
      \ killing spree theme, a unique voiceover, and special in-game audio effects\
      \ for his abilities."
