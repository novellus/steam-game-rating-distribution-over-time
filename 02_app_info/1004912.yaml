    review: 'I have 3 max level characters and I don''t even know whats gold for.
      The only time I see its use, its to revive on the spot, instead of restarting
      the map. It takes a % of your gold pool (which is shared for all characters),
      so the firts time you die, It will hit you hard.


      I have yet to explore the end game (invasions, TOC, relic hunt) to see if gold
      has any use at all in thewhole game.'
