    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Ekstase</h2>Ekstase is a love letter to Berlin
      and its techno scene. Amazing techno beats and beautiful visuals set the stage
      for a game that honors the long forgotten falling block puzzle genre. Fresh
      but familiar gameplay ensures that Ekstase is easy to pick up and sink many
      hours into. With both classic and new game modes, there is something here for
      both the casual and the hardcore puzzle game player.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay
      description</h2>In Ekstase, shapes of 3-5 blocks fall from the top, and as soon
      as they hit something, they fall apart. The scan line changes color every cycle
      and removes the squares you formed with blocks of the same color.<h2 class="bb_tag">Game
      modes</h2><strong>Reach a &quot;state-of-flow&quot; in Flow mode</strong><br>Flow
      mode is the frictionless &quot;jump in&quot; game mode in which the game adapts
      to how you play. Are you getting better? The game will ramp up its difficulty.
      Are you getting worse? The game becomes easier. In doing so, the game teases
      out a &quot;state-of-flow&quot; in the player, a state in which you are fully
      immersed in a feeling of energized focus, involvement, and enjoyment.<br><br><strong>Keep
      a beat with Beat99</strong><br>Beat99 is the rhythm mode in Ekstase . The goal
      is to rank up your multiplier by dropping shapes to the beat. You'll be given
      99 &quot;lives&quot;, dropping a shape subtracts one life, missing a beat subtracts
      ten! Try to survive as long as possible and try to score as high as you possibly
      can.  <br><br><strong>Pick your own challenge in Classic mode</strong><br>In
      Classic mode you set the challenge. Choose the amount of colors and the speed
      of the shapes. <br><br><strong>Time Attack</strong><br>Can you stack efficiently?
      Prove it in Time Attack mode. Beat the highscore in a set amount of time. <br><br><strong>Two
      rotation modes</strong><br>Ekstase can be enjoyed in two different play styles;
      play style &quot;A&quot; and play style &quot;B&quot;. In A you rotate the colors
      in a stationary shape, in B you rotate the shapes. This way you get two games
      for the price of one!<h2 class="bb_tag">Accessibility</h2>Are you colorblind?
      No worries, I've got you covered! In the options menu, pick your type of color
      blindness for the appropriate color palette, or hand pick the colors yourself.
      Motor challenges? No biggie! Ekstase comes with custom button mapping and co-pilot.
      Do you find the background animations too distracting?! Not a problem! Turn
      it down, or all the way off, from the options menu. <br><br>In Raskal's games

    short_description: Amazing techno beats and beautiful visuals set the stage for
      a game that honors the long forgotten falling block puzzle genre. Ekstase is
      easy to pick up and sink many hours into. With both classic and new game modes,
      there is something here for both the casual and the hardcore puzzle game player.

    review: "Great puzzle game, with great accessibility support. Keyboard controls\
      \ are rebindable. \n\nThe aesthetic is top-notch, and it was easy for me to\
      \ melt right into this game.\n\nEDIT: Game runs fine through Proton as well\
      \ (not surprising, since it's Unity) but the video backgrounds are unavailable\
      \ there."
