    review: "what the fuck did i just read.\n\nFirstly, SOH4, much like the previous\
      \ entries, is extremely well written but there are a few sketchy lines scattered\
      \ throughout and it sometimes goes overboard on the horniness.\n\nNow onto the\
      \ more important stuff.\n\nSOH4 is so emotionally taxing and unrelenting, that\
      \ there were points in this where I just wanted it to stop. In fact, I had to\
      \ take a break in order to preserve my sanity. However, the pay off and character\
      \ development that arises from the pain and torment, was incredible.  SOH4 is\
      \ not content with simply describing the struggle of its characters, it forces\
      \ the reader to experience them. \n\nThe fact that SOH4 so effectively captured\
      \ the pain of its characters and shared it with the audience, similar to that\
      \ of The Last Of Us Part II, is an astonishing achievement for a text-based\
      \ game. I would liken playing SOH4 to my experience during The Last Of Us Part\
      \ II, where the emotional toll is suffocating and the violence is unforgiving\
      \ and endless. Some may not find that to be enjoyable (which is fair enough),\
      \ but when a game can make me feel such strong emotions like anger, hate, sadness,\
      \ longing and happiness then that is an achievement that must be noted.\n\n\n\
      However,  SOH4 does have a couple issues. \n\nThe smaller issue:\n\nSOH4, admirably,\
      \ has a very large scope which, sometimes leads to pacing issues. \n\nThe more\
      \ notable issue:\n\nAdditionally, much like the previous 2 installments, SOH4\
      \ is quite liberal in its definition of 'choice'. What I mean is that it clearly\
      \ guides the reader to making certain choices and these choices have very little\
      \ variety. That can be a massive turn off for many readers and usually it would\
      \ be for me too. However, I adore SOH4's the story and the characters, so the\
      \ lack of choice becomes less of an issue for me. Nevertheless, it should be\
      \ mentioned as SOH4 doesn't really offer much in terms of choices.\n\nOverall:\
      \ 9/10\n\nWarnings: Violence & Sex & Sexual Violence\n\nOk, so it should be\
      \ clear that SOH4 is extremely violent but it's also extremely sexual. They\
      \ did (sometimes) break my immersion because of the way they were written but\
      \ that wasnt always the case. Also, please keep in mind that SOH4 is beyond\
      \ fucked. It's 100% the darkest COG/HG I have ever played."
