    about_the_game: "In Voxel Bot you play as a robot that needs to clear all cubes\
      \ in the level. By jumping from cube to cube you change the color of the cubes\
      \ and when all the cubes are purple you cleared the level. To make your goal\
      \ harder there are enemies that you can\u2019t touch or trying to catch you.\
      \ To make it even more challenging there are spikes that strike when you are\
      \ too long idle on a cube. The levels will get more complex progressing the\
      \ game. New mechanics will be introduced like a green cube that will let you\
      \ move further and a cube that can be solid or not solid by pressing a button.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this game, the player controls a cubicle robot, who starts\
      \ each game on a grid of cubes and moves by hopping diagonally from cube to\
      \ cube. Landing on a cube causes it to change color, and changing every cube\
      \ to purple allows the player to progress to the next stage."

    short_description: In this game, the player controls a cubicle robot, who starts
      each game on a grid of cubes and moves by hopping diagonally from cube to cube.
      Landing on a cube causes it to change color, and changing every cube to purple
      allows the player to progress to the next stage.

    review: 'The visuals and music in this game are really good but some might be
      put off by the Qbert-styled controls. To break them down:

      Up/W: used to ascend the level, not to move forward

      Down/S: used to descend the level, not for backing up

      Left/Right/A/D: still move you across the level in said directions but do so
      isometrically

      It takes some messing around with to get used to.


      That said, the level designs and play-thru are well worth the price.
