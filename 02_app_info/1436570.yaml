    review: "The atmosphere of this game hooked me to play this game. I enjoyed the\
      \ relaxing gameplay and music. It looks like they decided to scrap the whole\
      \ potion making options that were in the last Enthralling Realms game. For me\
      \ it\xB4s far the best of the 3 or 4 existing parts so far. There is a thrilling\
      \ story line and interesting characters with good voice over, who appear with\
      \ the ongoing story. The graphics are bright and clear and the special effects\
      \ are unrivalled in other match-3 games I,\xB4ve played. There are four different\
      \ types of Power-ups available, and each one requires a Mana Meter refill after\
      \ each use. The Mana Meter is refilled by making any Match, but larger matches\
      \ will fill the meter more quickly. There are 5 chapters and at the end of each\
      \ you have to defeat a beast to clear a chapter.Blacksmith's Revenge is a really\
      \ good Match 3 game with interesting board layouts that present a good challenge.\
      \ The only two small minus points are that there is no option to select difficulty\
      \ modes such as Relaxed, Normal or Hard and I hate I hate all the spiders that\
      \ appear in the cut scenes.\n"
