    about_the_game: "Deadside is a hardcore multiplayer shooter with large open world\
      \ and wide gameplay possibilities. Deadside gets you into realistic game environment\
      \ full of hopelessness and despair. It tries to keep balance between the dynamics\
      \ of the shooter and the hardcoreness of \u201Csurvival\u201D gameplay. The\
      \ world of the game does not imply the existence of fantastic elements like\
      \ zombies or anomalies, concentrating the player's attention on realistic aspects\
      \ of life on the ruins of the dead civilization.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEADSIDE\
      \ WORLD</h2><br>The world of Deadside is vast open spaces full of bushy forests\
      \ and abandoned settlements. Players will have an area of \u200B\u200Babout\
      \ 225 sq.km., entangled by a network of roads and rivers (in early access the\
      \ territory of the game world will be limited to an area of 25 sq.km.)<br>In\
      \ addition to players, the game world is inhabited by various hostile and friendly\
      \ NPCs. Going through the forest, you can face a gang of cannibals just about\
      \ to eat lunch. Or a group of wanderers trying to survive in a hostile environment.\
      \ The results of these meetings are completely dependent on your decisions and\
      \ ability to get those decisions to life. Or death.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/895400/extras/Missions_map2.png?t=1589988562\"\

      \ getting lost and to keep themselves busy, players can use the map to see where\
      \ in the world armed bandits are raiding, areas being cleared by security forces\
      \ remains loyal to the ex-government or cannibals settling in abandoned villages.\
      \ Anyone can take part in mass combat. It will not be an event with a limited\
      \ number of players, anyone who wishes can go to the mission sector and affect\
      \ the outcome of the battle. Battles with participation of NPC and players can\
      \ continue for hours but the reward will go to the one who can seize the prize\
