    about_the_game: "Welcome to our special brand of Super Long Nose Shooting Game.<br><br>Nandeyanen!?\
      \ \u2013 The 1st S\xFBtra is a horizontal 2D shoot\u2019em up that introduces\
      \ gameplay mechanics such as bullet counter and blast pods: the first allows\
      \ the player to survive waves of attacks by returning them to their sender and\
      \ the second is a tool meant to valorize the player\u2019s learning curve by\
      \ letting him spread his attacks on the whole screen. In a narrative thought\
      \ as a homage to Japanese imaginary worlds and creative game design, the player\
      \ takes the role of Tenguman, a long-nosed goblin who wakes up after a thousand\
      \ year sleep to see the world overrun by an army of mythical pranksters. The\
      \ game structure seeks to emulate both the tenacity and the virtuosity required\
      \ by the genre. Thus, while meant to be easy on the eyes the game is not targeted\
      \ at beginners.<br>Nandeyanen!? - The 1st S\u016Btra contains the three first\
      \ stages (Mountain, Forest, Temple) in four languages (english, japanese, korean\
      \ and french). <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/386090/extras/CoverArtNande.jpg?t=1488720324\"\
      \ /><br><br>Gameplay:<br><br>The project mirrors the prolific d\xF4jin (amateur)\
      \ Japanese scene and we made our game always with this specific creative context\
      \ in mind. For the game design, our main goals were to mix the manic shooter\
      \ subgenre with original and challenging mechanics that could be seen during\
      \ the NEC PC-Engine/Super Famicom era. Since we enjoy games that are well balanced\
      \ and that rely mostly on skills, we decided to remove any form of power-ups\
      \ in order to obtain a precise and demanding game design that values our gameplay\
      \ mechanics. <br><br>The gameplay introduces challenging mechanics such as bullet\
      \ counter (directly inspired from SFIII: Third Strike) and blast pods represented\
      \ by your 3 Karasu-Tengu partners. <br><br>In that sense, the \u201Ccounter\u201D\
      \ mechanic is the more original feature of the game as it breaks the dodge\u2019\
      nd shoot routine common to the shoot\u2019em up genre and let us experiment\
      \ with new rhythm and bullet patterns. The feeling of danger/courage the player\
      \ gets when confronting a bullet is the gamer\u2019s rush we are looking for\
      \ in our design. <br><br>-Nandeyanen!? is played like a regular horizontal shoot\u2019\
      em up except for some subtle mechanics that we try to force the player to learn\
      \ little by little in order to progress. As there are no power-ups, the standard\
      \ shoot is not upgradable but the button can be pressed continuously. <br><br>-The\
      \ \u201CBomb\u201D button deals no damage to the enemies but draws the bullets\
      \ away and makes Tenguman invincible for a short while. <br><br>-Pressing on\
      \ the \u201CPod\u201D button will place one of three \u201CMini-Tengu\u201D\
      \ that will release a heavy damaging violet beam after 3 seconds. The three\
      \ \u201CMini-Tengu\u201D appear on the HUD and recharge after 2 seconds each\
      \ and 10 seconds when all used quickly. <br><br>-Holding the \u201CPod\u201D\
      \ button will deploy an aura around Tenguman. Every bullet that enters inside\
      \ this aura can be countered by tapping forward. Releasing the \u201CPod\u201D\
      \ button after 3 seconds will make Tenguman shoot a violet beam himself. <br><br>-Some\
      \ enemies will come equipped with either a yellow or a blue shield. The blue\
      \ shields are broken using countered bullets and the yellow shields with a violet\
      \ beam released by Tenguman or his little acolytes. <br><br>-In each level there\
      \ are five \u201CSiddham drops\u201D hidden in enemies that when collected will\
      \ make Tenguman do an extremely powerful shot against the boss. <br><br>-We\
      \ strongly recommend you to play with a gamepad or an arcade stick (Xbox360\
      \ gamepad/arcade stick are supported). <br><br>Narrative &amp; Inspirations:<br><br>The\
      \ visuals and the storyline are thought as homages to the 1991 Nec Pc-Engine\
      \ game Hanataakadaka!? (\u201CSuper Long-Nose Goblin\u201D). We also count among\
      \ our main influences the Ganbare Goemon series, Treasure and Cave shmups but\
      \ also games such as Clover's Okami and Vanillaware's Oboro Muramasa. <br><br>Nandeyanen!?\
      \ \u2013 The 1st S\xFBtra is meant as a tribute to the creative ways in which\
      \ the Japanese popular cultures use folklore as inspiration and reinvent it\
      \ constantly through imaginary but meaningful worlds for us to step into. We\
      \ tried to visually reinterpret the influencing works of Hokusai, Lafcadio Hearn\
      \ or Shigeru Mizuki in order to understand the creative process behind recent\
      \ Japanese video games involving mythic patterns. As fans of Japanese esthetics,\
      \ the manga visuals were also selected since they were much easier to work with\
      \ for our graphic designers. Backgrounds were made to remind the players of\
      \ ukiyo-e drawings. <br><br>The Team:<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/386090/extras/tchagatabannerSteam.jpg?t=1488720324\"\
