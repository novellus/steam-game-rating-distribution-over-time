Only things I would say is maybe make it possible for an easier teleportation system rather than movement through the pushing the joy stick forward and sliding, or give players a way to choose one or the other. The joystick movement makes me rather motion sick and I get migraines after due to the graphics being too bright. I haven't been able to find a good adjustment to make them easier on my eyes. The teleport works fairly well but often I find I bump the joystick trying to just pick up objects which shoots me across the room in some cases. But I love how ambitious and large this game feels so far!","timestamp_created":1600543422,"timestamp_updated":1600543422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw48700/QCferqogI="}
