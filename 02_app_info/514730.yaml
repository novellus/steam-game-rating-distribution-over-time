    review: 'Sneak your way into a strange research facility and discover the origin
      of mysterious tremors. Uncover a plot to send humanity back to the Stone Age.
      Find a missing girl.  As an agent of HELP (I still question this choice of acronym),
      you can do anything and everything with the help - er, assistance - of your
      courage and ingenuity.


      As long as you don''t mind a "retro" sci-fi / secret agent plot that feels more
      like the 60s than the 90s, this is a fun HOPA game with lots to do in the way
      of HO scenes and puzzles.  Not the best out there, but entertaining nonetheless.


      Pros:

      - variety of HO scenes

      - ability to return for missing collectibles and achievements via Extras

      - most of the voice acting is quite good (if I were a girl in a car about to
      be squished, I''d be more scared, but that''s me...)

      - variety of puzzles (mostly on easier side, but some challenges)

      - fully interactive map

      - customizable difficulty


      Cons:

      - no particular cons, but I didn''t love the game (although some of the toys
      provided a real trip down memory lane!)

      - why are so many genius scientists embittered megalomaniacs?


      Overall:  It''s a moderately good game in a moderately good series.  I prefer
      other Eipix games, but probably because they''re prettier visually and have
      more memorable characters.


      Note:  The bundle includes three older-style HO games that are not HOPA games.'
