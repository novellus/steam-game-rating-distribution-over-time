    about_the_game: Kingdoms and Castles is a game about growing a kingdom from a
      tiny hamlet to a sprawling city and imposing castle.<br><br>Your kingdom must
      survive a living and dangerous world. Do the viking raiders make off with your
      villagers? Or are they stopped, full of arrows, at the castle gates? Does a
      dragon torch your granary, your people dying of starvation in the winter, or
      are you able to turn the beast back? The success of your kingdom depends solely
      on your skill as a city and castle planner.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/569480/extras/cd.png?t=1598199208"
      /><br>Strategically layout your town to improve your peasants' happiness and
      to attract new residents. Tax them just enough to fund your castle. Make sure
      your peasants are fed in the winter and healed of plagues. Build churches to
      keep them from despair and taverns to keep them happy. You can even throw festivals
      if you've built a town square! Send out wood cutters to collect wood, set up
      stone quarries to build your castles, and farm the land efficiently so your
      town can grow and thrive.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/569480/extras/banner_city.jpg?t=1598199208"

      /><br>The new land you're settling is at risk of viking invasion. These raiders
      seek to kidnap and kill your peasants, steal your resources, and burn your town
      to the ground. Use a powerful castle building system where castles are constructed
      using blocks which can be placed anywhere. Towers and walls are dynamically
      created based on how you stack and arrange them. Archer towers and other weapon
      emplacements have longer range the higher their tower. Try different layouts
      to best protect your kingdom and express your glory as a king or queen.<br><br><img

      /><br>And it all takes place in a beautiful dynamic world with a stylized procedural
      cloud system and season cycle from summer to winter.  A realistic tree growth
      algorithm simulates the forests. Depending on your needs, wood cutters can clear
      cut or responsibly manage your forests.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/569480/extras/banner_world.jpg?t=1598199208"
