    review: 'A very well done route and models. I would say great for the price and
      I have heard that there are many workshop add-ons. This is not for everyone
      but a nice change. Good learning tutorials.

      It was a sham that GM bribed and bought out our light rail systems so they could
      sell buses. All that economical transportation and infrastructure that is now
      too expensive to replace and was built without taxpayer money. Killed many mid-sized
      cities downtown economics. Google it!'
