    about_the_game: "Moscow: somewhere in the near future. The city and perhaps the\
      \ Earth's surface has turned into a radioactive ash. Survivors are living a\
      \ savage lifestyle: they kill each other, they rob each other, they eat and\
      \ rape each other (sometimes both at the same time). Those who decided that\
      \ they could not exist in such conditions began to live under the ground. \u201C\
      The underground people\u201D is how they referred to themselves and you are\
      \ one of them. The times have changed and it is time for you to make your own\
      \ journey into the big world. The biggest problem is that the people on the\
      \ surface do not know about your existence. They have heard about \u201Cunderground\
      \ people\u201D, but they consider those rumors to be fiction. Your objective\
      \ is to prove to them that you do indeed exist and that you also possess the\
      \ ability to adapt to the extreme conditions of the wild radioactive desert.\
      \ Moreover, you will be responsible for provisioning your fellow brothers and\
      \ sisters, who are staying underground. <br />\r\nFeatures of the game include:<br\
      \ />\r\n-Enjoyable retro-graphics <br />\r\n-A post-apocalyptic theme<br />\r\
      \n-Extremely detailed characters <br />\r\n-A cozy bar as a location <br />\r\
      \n-A unique system of character development; you write it yourself and it is\
      \ applied to your adventures. <br />\r\n-Mercenary-girls that will help you\
