Seen this on sale i gave it try and it is worth the money especially if you like Pen and Paper or those dungeon books like \"The Third Expedition\" where read a page and then had to make a decision and process the story on the new given page. \n\nEvery corner of the dungeon describe to you by a formidable narrator can contain bad/good or as it should a slight glimmer of hope. As having come to the final room, with some more hints i wonder how the next run will end. \n\nI have done the first with the original rule set - which is nice. Time for the first run had been 2 hours which is not to long and not to short for such kind game. I am looking forward for the next run which hopefully is going differently - but i assume the Deathtrap Dungeon will yearn some more souls before it solve :D\n\nOn the a quest.","timestamp_created":1609882242,"timestamp_updated":1609882242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvbGd6vYCes7pwAI="}
