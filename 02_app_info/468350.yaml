    review: 'I feel like if this game was an RTS, I might like it quite a lot. It''s
      got cool things, like craters, digging tunnels, and bombers that make your enemies
      go like the White House from Independence Day, but suffers a bunch from the
      problem many turn-based games have, where sometimes you get a turn where you
      have lots and lots of decisions to make, and most of the turns you have no decisions
      to make at all, and the other player has those things happening on different
      turns from you.


      The game ended not when I destroyed my friend, but a while after, when the neutral
      AI faction decided to blow up my base.


      Also sometimes I''d order four tanks to carefully approach a rocket turret simultaneously,
      and find that two or three of them hung back (out of cowardice?), causing them
      all to die uselessly.'
