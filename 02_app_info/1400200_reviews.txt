If you like the signature Big Fish mcf mega puzzles that open on to a huge strange contraption with few clues that you have to click and hover your way to figuring wtf?!? you will be disappointed in this offering. Lots of finding pieces that you have to remember what it goes to and the story is engaging but its no Madame Fate.","timestamp_created":1608057342,"timestamp_updated":1608057342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg/nrs/YCcfrAugI="}
