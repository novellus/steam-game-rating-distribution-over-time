    about_the_game: Welcome to the gritty reality of Deathdays End, where every adult
      in the world has mysteriously dropped dead. The shadow of a woman on TV claims
      responsibility and before they know it every teen, child and baby is forced
      into a global phenomenon known as the Death Game. Learn more as the story progresses
      and play through the perspective of several different protagonists around the
      world, helping them survive a game of violence, death and betrayal.<br><br><img

      /><br>Deathdays End contains a whopping cast of 11 youths with over half controllable
      in this volume alone. Each of them have their own distinct quirks and methods
      to survive the ordeal thrust upon them. Will morality win over? Or does survival
      of the fittest trump all.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/964770/extras/Arryn_Grace_text.png?t=1581254861"

      /><br>Nothing special about this one. Before the adults died, Arryn lived a
      quiet life with his mother and adopted sister, Marie. Technically speaking,
      he is the main character of this game and serves as an introduction to the world,
      however let's be realistic for a moment. Can a completely ordinary 17 year old
      boy with no talent whatsoever really survive such a messed up world? Does this
      face really look like that of a seasoned warrior?<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/964770/extras/Rex_text.png?t=1581254861"

      /><br>Dorothy's legal institution is a school specially made for young criminals.
      With ferocious punishments including physical abuse dealt by teachers on whims,
      Rex is someone that already has the necessary qualities needed to tough it out
      in the new world. The question is, why doesn't he have a last n - I mean how
      far will he go in his quest for survival? <br><strong>Fair warning:</strong>

      /><br>Appearances may be deceiving, but this guy's a genius through and through.
      Born into money and perfect grades, you'd think Marcus had it all. Of course,
      nobody can be that perfect and beyond his innocent smile is a world of pain
      before the international tragedy even begins. Having a rocky relationship with
      his parents and now having to look after his sweet but frail younger sister
      alone, Marcus Levesque will need to use all his wits and intellect for them
      to have a chance at coming out alive.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/964770/extras/And_more.png?t=1581254861"

      te* ! \nVous avez l\u2019\xE9pisode 1 des trois personnages principaux, qui\

      \ de Visual Novel Maker. Elles sont correctes, sans plus. \n* Je les ai vus\
      \ dans d\u2019autres histoires visuelles sur Steam, alors il m\u2019est difficile\
      \ de les appr\xE9cier \xE0 120%.\n\nLa musique est par Kevin Macleod et elle\
      \ colle parfaitement \xE0 l\u2019histoire et \xE0 ses moments forts.\n\nL\u2019\
      histoire ? C\u2019est un prologue, mais\u2026\nLe + : Elle a un concept int\xE9\
      ressent, bien que vu dans bien d\u2019autres \u0153uvres. Tous les adultes sont\
      \ morts d\u2019une mani\xE8re \xE9trange et les survivants doivent jouer \xE0\
      \ un jeu sadique cr\xE9er par une fille pour rester en vie. \nLe - : Sans trop\
      \ spoiler, il y a pleins de moments \xAB WTF \xBB qui g\xE2che le tout. Par\
      \ exemple, l'un des personnages arrive \xE0 op\xE9rer une fille qui a une tumeur,\
      \ sans exp\xE9rience en m\xE9decine, parce qu\u2019il est un \xAB prodigue \xBB\
      . \n\nNous sommes en 2020 et aucune trace d\u2019une suite en vue.\nDeux des\
      \ trois \xAB \xC9pisode 1 \xBB sont aussi beaucoup plus court \xE0 lire. \n\
      Je ne peux donc pas recommander Deathdays End."
