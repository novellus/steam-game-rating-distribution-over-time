    review: 'Another made in Unity game that is not optimized.  Game is mostly you
      running in small mazes looking for the next trigger to proceed further while
      avoiding the monster by running away from it.  Very little notes to find.  You''ll
      mostly just find a few id cards telling you the bio info about people you don''t
      know.  The worst part of the experience for me was right near the end you are
      not given a choice but if you do not perform the action you die which will do
      the following:


      1.  Change the default language to Spanish

      2.  Cause you to have to reset the language into English but give you a warning
      in Spanish before you change it to English.

      3.  Find out that the warning in Spanish was actually telling you changing the
      default language will erase any saved progress.

      4.  Lose all 45 minutes I just played.


      Refund requested.  Kudos to the sound though.....'
