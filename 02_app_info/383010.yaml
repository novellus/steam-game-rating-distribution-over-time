    review: 'Purchased this game not long after it had gone into early access and
      thought it looked like a game with great potential.  Being a massive fan of
      Ballance, I was hoping that this game would be able to rival it.  Whether that
      is the case or not we will probably never know since development on it seems
      to have long stopped.


      +Game currently loads up and doesn''t crash while playing (which is more than
      can be said for some so called finished games).

      +The game gets very difficult very quickly in a mostly makes you stop and think
      way, not a die 1000 times way.

      +While there is not much to see in the game visually (it''s mostly water with
      a blue sky), what is there is high quality.


      -Menu options are bare bones and resolution settings do not work.

      -If you are not one for thinking the difficulty may be too much and could cause
      you to give up within an hour.

      -A couple of puzzles do require pin point accuracy (although they are further
      into the game).

      -Reached a point in the game where I am stuck (may be the point where the dev
      stopped working on the game).


      Despite the fact this looks like it will never come out of early access, I am
      still giving this a thumbs up because what is here provides a great challenge.


      7/10


      Also will ammend this review if anymore progress is ever made with the game.


      still no update.  At least it still provides a challenge.


      yearly update to get the review reward'
