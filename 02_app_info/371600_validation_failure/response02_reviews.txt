Pure action. If you are looking for a realistic race you will be disappointed, this game is for arcade racers only. If you don't mind a relaxing load of speed, wheel to wheel bump, without thinking much about the damages, this game will provide you tons of fun. If you want a deep simulation, just avoid it.\nIt would be nice, however, to have a championship option, or the possibility to change your car (who wants a yellow thing?) or upgrade it.\n","timestamp_created":1438449581,"timestamp_updated":1438449581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vNeR9c4CdoCRQg=="}
