    developer_response: 'Hi, thanks for reviewing! There are all very valid concerns,
      but I''d thought I''d jump in and try to help anyway.


      There *is* a level editor tutorial. On the first launch, the game will ask you
      if you''d like to watch it. It appears you''ve missed that somehow, so here''s
      the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWZi8oisDDI&feature=youtu.be


      I''d like to change some things so this is more obvious, so that''s a big woops
      on my part.


      Additionally, when you launch the game, it starts with a "game configuration"
      window. You are able to view, and change key bindings there. I would like to
      do key bindings in the actual game, but the engine I use makes things quite
      complicated.


      Take care!


      EDIT: I''ve now patched the game so you can view the tutorial at anytime.'

    review: '*This review has been edited after the Dev''s response to reflect some
      provided clarification and troubleshooting.


      - I recommend taking a look at "input" for keybindings before launching the
      game to save some frustration. I had skipped over this assuming it would be
      in the actual game.

      - The campaign is roughly 3 minutes of holding "a" or "d" for 10 seconds each
      level until it says you''ve won and moves onto the next.

      - Dying first, although advertised as the goal makes no difference to whether
      or not you win or lose. You win if you die, essentially.


      The campaign levels are a snoozefest, but I can see how it would entice somebody
      to want to create their own levels. The controls are unintuitive and frustrating
      - I recommend taking a peek at the youtube video in the Dev''s response as it
      provides much needed clarity.


      This game has potential based around its level creator. If you enjoy a more
      "lemmings" type level creator where the only goal is to kill a bunch of guys
      as interestingly as possible you may enjoy this game.'
