But the game has changed so much and even transitioned to being a 3D game instead of the original 2D style that I loved. The 2D version is still playable but isn't being updated anymore. It used to be so good but the updates have really let me down and have changed the fundamental features of the game that made it special. Just depressing, 4/10.","timestamp_created":1608998578,"timestamp_updated":1608998578,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw9bzyz/YCceG2vQI="}
