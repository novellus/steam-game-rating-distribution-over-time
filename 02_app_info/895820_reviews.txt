(especially such a long ending, where the character makes choices without your input so if it's bad you feel like you're being punished for something you didn't do)","timestamp_created":1584687651,"timestamp_updated":1584688912,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522610008716583252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6Lq0+/ACdpqz+QE="}
