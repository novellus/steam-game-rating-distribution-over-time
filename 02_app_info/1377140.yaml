    about_the_game: Don't Look is a horror game where you are being hunted by things
      that can only move when you see them. You feel a surging urgency to escape this...
      place. You MUST escape. Unfortunately, sometimes the only way out is through.
      While you have no weapon and no way you can defend yourself, you are lucky enough
      to discover the weakness of your hunters. They may have you trapped in a place
      where something feels.... off, but by not looking at them you might just be
      able to escape. With no explanation or recollection of where you came from your
      only objective is to survive and make it out of that hell and hopefully uncover
      some secrets on the way. (Voices by Natasha Mozdzen)
