    developer_response: 'Thank you for your feedback. I''m sorry you had a bad experience
      with PowersVR. In case you haven''t refunded the game I wanted to let you know
      that there are currently four enemy types throughout the city, typically located
      in different parts of it.


      I realize that detail in the city is fairly lacking, however as a single developer
      I had to prioritize either a smaller detailed environment or a larger one which
      better allows for usage of movement abilities.


      I''ll try to improve on some of the areas you''ve mentioned in future updates.'

    review: So I don't know what the people leaving positive reviews are doing, but
      don't listen to them, this is not a 10/10 game, it's not exciting, and the graphics
      suck. I was bored after about a solid 10 minutes of playing. The "enemies."
      You can fight are limited to only one type and are only in a single part of
      the map. Speaking of the map, it looks like the devs got a template of a city
      done and just stopped. There are no details, it's really small with little to
      no reason to explore it. I absolutely do not suggest you buy this game, I looked
      at a couple other super power simulator vr games and they were far better than
      this.
