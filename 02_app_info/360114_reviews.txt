This is not a review for this module specifically, but a review for how these adventure modules work in general. \n\nAs of writing this review, there is no way to redeem a physical copy of the book that the DLC will be based on. You're basically looking at purchasing the same book, but in a format that exclusively works with fantasy grounds - so if you're choosing between buying a physical book and buying this module because of economical reasons, I'd say go for the book and save up for the fantasy grounds modules later in life. \n\nAdventure Modules for the 5E ruleset with Fantasy Grounds are used in the same way they are in regular D&D - as a pre-made ready-to-play module that can function as a self-contained campaign or as part of a longer campaign. \n\nWhen you load the Adventure Module and click the library button in the lower right corner, you will see the adventure module listed as \"Adventure\", and you can click the title of the module there and it will bring up a content list that you can use to access the important content from the module, but in a format that has been processed to be fully integrated into Fantasy Grounds - for instance, you can open up the Pre-Generated Characters option (if the module in question has these), and just hit the \"plus\" symbol to add the characters to the roster or the \"magical items\" and just drag individual items into inventories or loot-piles you're creating. \n\nYou can also click on \"Reference Manual\" (as seems to be the case with all of the Fantasy Grounds 5E book conversion DLCs) and it basically lets you read the book page for page, though in a slightly cumbersome and inconvenient manner, but it works well enough that you can prepare for a module etc.\n\nThe module will most likely contain battle-maps of dungeons etc. that you can simply add character's to (NPC's come preplaced on the map, except for special encounters which you have to activate), and then the players can essentially move their \"tokens\" (fantasy ground equivalent of miniatures) around on the map and explore it. With the new dynamic lighting features etc., it is almost going to feel like a a video game, as tokens, treasures and points of interest are pre-added, and most of the time, you get a \"DM version\" of each map, allowing you to see room reference numbers and trap locations so that you know exactly where the players are and what should be happening in the game. \n\nAdventure Modules for Fantasy Grounds 5E appear to be worth the money due to the sheer amount of hassle they save the DM, but I can understand why someone would feel bitter about re-purchasing adventure books if they already owned them, but I personally find that the modules are no substitute for the real book - the ability to flip to a specific page and not have to open a bunch of windows in Fantasy Grounds to look something up is fine a must to me personally, but if I had to run a pre-made module on Fantasy Grounds, I would definitely buy it instead of attempting to recreate the module myself, but if I had to choose between buying the physical book and recreating the module step-for-step or buying the fantasy grounds module only, I'd choose the physical book any day of the week, because ultimately, this is a poor substitute, but it is an amazing supplement. \n\nMy main gripe is that that these supplements are the same price as the physical book, with no option for a discount or anything. \n","timestamp_created":1603612189,"timestamp_updated":1603612189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542790114879608154","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lISvr/UCfL3/qQI="}
