Corrected that problem and its OK. Although some of the airfields look like they just escaped off the Battle of Britain film set. I used to fly out of Dunkeswell in Devon and this is nothing like it. Very lean on  detail. \n\nCurrently though, I've got all 4 parts of VFR Real scenery disabled. \n\nI usually tend to fly around Europe and the UK but venturing further a field, I've spent the last day or so (3 reinstalls!), trying to find out why my system started hanging. I was trying to fly Changi (Singapore) to Noi Bai (VIetnam). I don't know what these 4 parts do (it doesn't matter what order you rank them in the scenery table)  but I cannot get that flight to work with them enabled. Works fine when they are not but as soon as they are enabled, my system just sits there. It's a case of hit the task manager and nuke the processes.  If I want to wait long enough (minutes) FSX shuts down eventually with no error.  On that point I give it 2. Should have spent more money maybe.\n\nSystem W8.1 ,I7 16GB ram, Radeon FX580 8Gb OC","timestamp_created":1552775772,"timestamp_updated":1552775772,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9r6pxOkCetubvQE="}
