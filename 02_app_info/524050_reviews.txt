And I am a massive fan of this style of platformer.\nIt looks great, and mechanically feels \"solid\".\nHas leaderboards and speedrun medals which is awesome.\n\nBUT\n\nNo controller support is a big con for me, could have easily had controller support with right stick for aiming the grapple like \"dandara\".\n\nAlso the game looks pretty nice and is well put together. But the level design, enemys, and bosses are incredibly generic and boring in terms of gameplay.\n\nThis isn't necessarily a downvote because it's bad, it's more that I would recommend probably 50+ other similiar games over this one at this price point, and honestly even at a heavy discount.","timestamp_created":1594506613,"timestamp_updated":1594506763,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r8uAoPMCd67VlAI="}
