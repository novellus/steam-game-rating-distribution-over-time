THIS SOFTWARE IS A COOL CONCEPT BUT IT EXECUTES VERY POORLY. JESUS, I COULDN'T EVEN GET THE SOFTWARE TO CLOSE PROPERLY SO THERE GOES MY REFUND OF 5$. THE SOFTWARE IS SLOW, THERE IS NO TUTORIAL ON HOW TO USE IT, SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE FIGURING OUT HOW TO USE THIS SLOW UNRESPONSIVE SOFTWARE FROM THE GECKO. MICROSOFT GAME BAR DOES THIS SOFTWARE'S JOB BETTER AND IT'S FREE. MICROSOFT GAME BAR HAS IT'S OWN ISSUES BUT AT LEAST IT'S BETTER THAN PAYING FOR SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T WORK. I HOPE TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS TO THIS SOFTWARE SO I CAN CHANGE MY REVIEW AND SAY \"HEY, GREAT SOFTWARE AND IT'S VERY CONVENIENT. NOW, I CAN WATCH MY FRIENDS STREAM WHILE PLAYING SKYRIM.\" THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND HAVE A GREAT DAY!","timestamp_created":1609844194,"timestamp_updated":1609844194,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrZ+M6fYCfY7VwAI="}
