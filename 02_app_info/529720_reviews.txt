Interesting.\n\nThe game is basically a \"crossover\" of several puzzle games, like Puyo Puyo, Columns, and Super Puzzle Fighter. You can either select them individually or play it on a set order, each game being its own \"stage\". That's a quite solid concept, but there are quite a few tecnical problems in this game\n\nFirst, visuals. The neon pieces are quite nice, but the problem lies outside the puzzle grid. There is a huge cluster of information concentrated outside of the grid on the left side of the screen. These  are huge lines of text (for an UI) with precise statistics. Things for a casual viewer, like number of lines, whith also numbers I've only heard being used by hardcore puzzle players, like current gravity and lock delay. I don't mind the quantity of information presented on screen, but I can see someone having a problem with that not being presented in text. It kinda looks like a debug build, Just text, mind you, nothing even remotely close to the aesthetics of the rest of the game. It's ugly and distracting. It is completely possible to have these statistics displayed in a more aesthetical way than this games shows right now. There there is so much text and information that,  if you're playing in the default windowed mode, four of those options will be hidden (I'll get to that in a second). \n\nMy second biggest problem is actually ironic, considering the last paragraph. This game has the habit to not telling what are you supposed to be doing in each segment. It probably helps that I played most of these puzzles, but there are a few games that are not self-explanatory (notably Super Puzzle Fighter). There are items on the game that I don't have the slightest clue on how they work. For example, the Pacman icon. What does it do? I have no clue. It doesn't work like in Pac Attack, because I can eliminate all the blocks present, and even then Pacman doesn't move (btw, Namco might sue you for using a Pacman, there's precedent for that). There are a few items on the first puzzle that I took a while to understand what they were doing, because the name of the information flashes rapdily on screen, giving me not enough time to process. \n\nThere's also no training mode, or any other outside of \"marathon\" or \"endless\", which... Actually, I have not that much of a problem with that, the quantity of games inside Bob's Game is a lot of content already (I kinda wish there was a \"random\" mode, with a randomly generated order of \"stages\"). \n\nAnd I will not try to use multiplayer because... Come on, Pelloni, you're asking too much from me. People are questioning the validity of this game enough, and you're asking people to register for online multiplayer? Come one, man.\n\nBut I would urge the author to not worry with extra features right now. Because this game is, above all,  collection of tecnical misteps. The game behaves differently based on the size of the windows, with information either missing or being relocated (and, need I remind you, this game opens in a small window by default). The transitions between games are very clumsy, without any kind of warning. The game loves using flashing lights as substitutes for more elaborate animations, which oh boy do I have a headache right now. Trying to vote basically softlocks the game with an error informing me the game cannot connect into the server. The menus are clumsy and look really bad. There's a wall of text on the title screen, with the author shilling his Patreon and other information (I'm not against Patreon, I'm against wall of texts polluting the UI). Scrolling is a mess, most notably in the tetris attack segment.\n\nWith all that said, this game has a lot of potential. The game sure needs a lot of work into it, but it is very possible to turn itself into a excellent puzzler. \nAnd its playable at least. That's a lot more than I can say about, for example, Tetris Ultimate.","timestamp_created":1488224153,"timestamp_updated":1488388801,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518258452415466309","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nti4xdoCe/ymcw=="}
