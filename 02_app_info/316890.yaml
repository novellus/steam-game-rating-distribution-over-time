      \ sneaking adventure through the 1930s European criminal underworld. Architecture\
      \ meets Noir as you become unwillingly entangled in a revolutionist plot. Sneak\
      \ through sewers, across rooftops, and past guards in this dark and mysterious\
      \ journey. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay as a disparate group of low-lifes, loners\
      \ and last-chancers as they fight for the future of a city sliding slowly into\
      \ the gutter. The characters of Calvino Noir exist in a moral universe which\
      \ knows only shades of grey. Some are broken souls, some are merely damaged\
      \ - but all are fighting to forge a future in an ugly world ruled by those whose\
      \ hearts are cruel and dark.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough inspired by the futuristic\
      \ dystopian visions of Deus Ex and Blade Runner, Calvino Noir is a throwback\
      \ to an era that could easily be from Earth's past. The game is heavily noir\
      \ influenced, but at the same time progressive, reflecting a somewhat modernist\
      \ take on the classic genre.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCalvino Noir:<br />\r\
