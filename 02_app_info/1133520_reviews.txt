Always been a fan of puzzle games so if you like puzzle games as well that can challenge you but also maintain a relaxing atmosphere then Iconic would be a good choice. For the price its worth it in my opinion.","timestamp_created":1609890108,"timestamp_updated":1609890108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwprK76vYCdZ7twAI="}
