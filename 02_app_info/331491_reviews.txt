The art style wasn’t great either, and the characters and a few situations were bad/didn’t made much sense. Only get this DLC on a good sale and if you want to read a bit more of Asumi material. \n\nOverall, I don’t recommend this graphic novel.","timestamp_created":1461763637,"timestamp_updated":1461763637,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.659578979015350342","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48N/5q9QCcLO5Vg=="}
