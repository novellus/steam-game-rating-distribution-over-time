    review: 'The third game in the Myths of the World series features First Nations
      (American Indian) culture and mythology. A distinct improvement over the second
      game, and similar to the first in terms of overall high quality and a coherent,
      interesting story.


      Pros:

      - interesting setting and story (like the first game, it''s obvious the developers
      took a lot of care)

      - good voice acting

      - lots of HO scenes (both word lists and silhouettes)

      - reasonably varied puzzles, varying in difficulty

      - good length of game, though not as long as the first

      - fully interactive map and (a favourite feature of mine) a collectibles indicator
      on the main interface

      - fully integrated guide (but I didn''t use it, although I did refer to map
      hot spots a couple of times)


      Cons:

      - there is little mystery in the story, and the protagonist''s background is
      never explored

      - the bonus chapter is an okay length, but there''s nothing of substance to
      it (more than usual for the genre, that is); I thought they could have done
      something more interesting, given the possibilities within the mythos

      - you can''t go back and replay the game in order to obtain achievements (you
      have to create a new profile) [but these are in-game achievements only]


      Overall:  9/10 ~ The third entry in the series returned to (near) the quality
      of the first.  Lots to do and definitely worth adding to your HOPA library.


      PS  All the games have super abrupt endings! There is a clear conclusion and
      then *bam* it''s over. You''ve been warned XD'
