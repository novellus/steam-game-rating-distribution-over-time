    review: 'Small co-op station game.


      1 submarine, 2 players, 4 stations (steering, weapons, scanner, smelter), 1
      level. essential, this feels like a minimalist version of [i]Catastronauts[/i]
      that is also less exciting. You navigate the deep looking for keycards and scrap
      metal while fending off laser sharks, and when you enter the enemy base, it
      turns out they''re in another castle, and the game ends. Mind you, the concept
      isn''t that bad, and if the devs had put some effort into making a campaign
      and different enemies, it could be a lot better; but as it is,  If you want
      to do couch co-op, I recommed springing for a better game that has more variety.'
