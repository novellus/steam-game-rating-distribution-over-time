If Episode Two contiunes along a similar vein and actually takes into account the choices in Episode One, then this was a worthy purchase. A lot of potential to be a gem hidden in the rough\n\n\nEdit: Sequel never came out so its a worthless purchase.","timestamp_created":1522966254,"timestamp_updated":1607215613,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xIDhmvYCed3JnQE="}
