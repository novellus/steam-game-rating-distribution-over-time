      \ right address.<br />\r\n   A maze game in bright colors, interesting and with\
      \ small puzzles: a walking simulator where you just need to find a way out.<br\
      \ />\r\n   Are you give the creeps from screeners? It's not here, but you will\
      \ definitely not be alone, and the clues on the walls will not allow you to\
      \ get lost in such a huge maze.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n    You will appear in a\
      \ world where you will encounter only the sound of the wind and the rustle of\
      \ leaves under your feet, and the light is the voice, the memory of your MO,\
      \ who lost at the moment of sealing to an empty world for the secret of the\
      \ labyrinth.<br />\r\n    Help MO get out of this world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      Gameplay: resembles a walking simulator, in which you can move freely in different\
      \ directions, stay in place for an unlimited time, and there is also a jump\
      \ function. You can switch between running and walking modes, returning to the\
      \ previous mode at any time."
