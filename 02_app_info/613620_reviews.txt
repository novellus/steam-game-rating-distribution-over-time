The graphics are not an eyesore anymore. There is a nice, almost cell-shaded look to them. The environment is stable, the droids are far less quirky to handle and the map, setup and weapons give it a 'Drone Unreal' feel.\n\nYeah, I'm really liking the direction it's going in now. Well done guys for turning this into a fun game! :D\n\nSo for the sake of clarity, this is my old review, which was a thumbs down:\n\nOk, I don't want to sound mean, and if there was a thumbs sideways option, I'd choose that one, not a thumbs down.\n\nThe game needs work. It's a fun concept, but at the moment the execution is choppy. I played this on my own against bots and then on local multiplayer with friends, and both times quit early due to all of us just not being able to take the crazy amount of flipping/tilting/spinning that goes on. The screen rotates when you do, pretty much like the old Alien game when you run on walls and ceilings, and it is visually overpowering. It's so fast, with choppy scrolling inprecise aiming that at the moment it's just chaos - not fun chaos like STICKFIGHT or ROCKET LEAGUE, but annoying, headache-inducing chaos.\n\nIt needs to be slowed down slightly, and the players given a bit more weight or the scrolling made smoother - *something* to just give it that polish. Too scrappy right now, but keep an eye on development, it might turn into something better in time.\n\nBest of luck guys.","timestamp_created":1517743947,"timestamp_updated":1552916288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497942358255386353","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwoMLByOkCdqX9lwE="}
