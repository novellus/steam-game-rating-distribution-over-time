Usually the small block is a car or a boat. This is the notion of that game with a cool twist of rotating the world and enemies. It's a really cool concept, you can play a few levels and come back later. Real easy to get into.  I recommend it!\n\nAfter a few hours of playing it, it is quiet the puzzle-gem, its totally worth it if you like puzzles where you have to play around with a lot of moving parts to get something done. Its a lot of fun!","timestamp_created":1578129216,"timestamp_updated":1578167901,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tOOIue8CdsPd6QE="}
