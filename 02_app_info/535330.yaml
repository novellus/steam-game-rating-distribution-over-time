      \ it's all over. Blast the floor out from under your opponents' feet to send\
      \ them to their doom; before they do the same to you. Will you risk an early\
      \ loss to grab the power up and gain an advantage?<br><br>Unlock dozens of models\
      \ and skins as you defeat online opponents or computer controlled bots. Show\
      \ off your new looks while sniping the floor out from under your friends' feet.<br><br>Play\
      \ with up to 8 people in each match.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Review from theXBLIG:</h2><br>&quot;Matches\
      \ themselves can last a few seconds or almost a minute, with tense duels and\

      \ can further improve your odds by collecting powerups at the start of the match,\
      \ using stuff like Blast Off (extreme height), High Jump, Camouflage, Lasers,\
