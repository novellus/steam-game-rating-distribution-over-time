      /><br><strong>The Haunted Exmone Theatre is a 2D Survival Horror Game based
      on the story of a paranormal investigator called Omar, who got an urgent call
      from the owner of the Exmone Theatre to investigate the building for the paranormal
      evidence. </strong><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1341500/extras/thet_gif_1.gif?t=1594996195"
      /><br><br>The Exmone Theatre was first built in 1974 where most of the actors,
      musicians and the millions of audience visited for entertainment purposes. However,
      various tragic incidents including murder, and suicide took place in the theatre
      which resulted in the escalation of the paranormal activities. In 1980, a very
      tragic incident occurred in which an actress in a wedding outfit got murdered
      by one of her fans and it was reported that the guy later took his own life
      in the greenroom. Since then, the various paranormal activities had been reported
      by the visitors and some of them got traumatized after seeing the white shadow
      of the lady who was murdered in the premise. <br><br>As a consequence, the theatre
      business got affected and the owner of The Haunted Exmone Theatre desperately
      called Omar, the famous investigator living in Los Angeles, to help him getting
      rid of the ghosts. <br><br>You play as Omar, the paranormal investigator. Will
      you be able to prove the existence of the Paranormal and get rid of the ghosts?<br><br><img
