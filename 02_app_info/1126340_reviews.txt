Make the rate of weapon spawning higher and add automatic weapons finally please add the option to change graphic/volume settings and maybe add the option to raid Area 51 yourself.","timestamp_created":1566389316,"timestamp_updated":1566389851,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4t4qH2uwCf9Dk0AE="}
