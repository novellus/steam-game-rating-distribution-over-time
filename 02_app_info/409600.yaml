    about_the_game: "The unknown sends you a letter and invites to his house, promising\
      \ to tell something very important about your daughter. But during the dinner\
      \ with the owner of the mansion, the terrible thing occurred: as soon as you\
      \ threw off the blanket from antique mirror, a mysterious evil force stole your\
      \ only daughter Lisa! Right before your eyes, she disappeared inside a large\
      \ mirror without a trace, and the only witness of these strange events who could\
      \ shed the light - disappeared. Return 7 vices back to the Vault in order to\
      \ help Sonya to save yourself and her daughter. Use the tips of a bogy Brownie\
      \ - it will become your faithful assistant in this dangerous journey full of\
      \ mysticism.<br />\r\nExciting tasks, unusual riddles, lots of logic puzzles,\
      \ search of items and important artifacts are waiting for you. And also, the\
      \ journey through the looking glass and a visit of the past.<br />\r\nDiscover\
      \ the sinister family secret and throw out a challenge to the power of evil!\
      \ But be careful, the closer you are toward the goal, the more someone dislikes\
      \ it much."
