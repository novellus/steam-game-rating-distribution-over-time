Relatable. In this clever twist on block pushing games, you are finally able to make use of the playable character's god-given limbs to crouch down, grab, and pick up various office furnishings. These boxes, desks, and other such things each have their own assymetric behaviour when you push or pull on them, making for some very interesting puzzles. The most fascinating aspect of these puzzles is their uniquely creative goal, requiring you to encase the character in a 1x1x1 space surrounded by furniture.\n\nThe game's sombre art style and ambience manage to convey its psychological and mental health themes without ever explicitly acknowledging them. It's also a very peaceful atmosphere, perfect for puzzle solving, with the occasional humorous moments as you perform all sorts of strange furniture-on-head balancing acts. Some of the furniture was occasionally buggy but a quick undo would always deal with it.\n\nVery different to Pipe Push Paradise and seemingly smaller in scope, it's easy to see how Hiding Spot might have been a chance to explore some of the ideas coming to Corey Martin's upcoming game, Bonfire Peaks, for which I am waiting in anticipation. It is nonetheless full of great ideas and fascinating puzzles in its own right.","timestamp_created":1609084184,"timestamp_updated":1609084184,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3IS50vYCf8nlvQI="}
