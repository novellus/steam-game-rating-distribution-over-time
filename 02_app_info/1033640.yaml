      \ battles with fixed camera angle. While players attack straight ahead with\
      \ guns, they can also fire and steer homing bullets with wires, and time-lag\
      \ attack to shave down HP with trackers. The sizes of the battle arenas are\
      \ just right, and stopping for a moment can become your downfall. You'll need\
      \ to push yourself and awaken synapses to handle the speed.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1033640/extras/about_1.GIF?t=1593162355\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u3010World Setting\u3011</h2>Set hundreds of years\
      \ in the future, diverse fighters from space have assembled on one planet to\
      \ battle in competitions. Some want to show off their abilities, some live to\
      \ fight, while others are after prize money... Whatever the reason may be, they're\
      \ all aiming to come out on top. To attain superhuman reflexes, these fighters\
      \ have mechanized their bodies to activate synapses in the brain. Such are the\
      \ origins of Synaptic Drive\u2122.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u3010Customization\u3011\
      </h2>The key to victory lies in customization.First, select a body, then customize\
      \ to your liking by choosing from over 100 types of trackers, wires, and guns.\
      \ Zip around with a light body and machinegun, or go with a durable heavy body\
      \ to take on hits from bombs,it's all up to you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u3010\
      Gun\u3011</h2>Your main weapon, and the one that attacks straight ahead. This\
      \ will act as the core of your attacks since it fires faster than the other\
      \ weapon types.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1033640/extras/gun_2.GIF?t=1593162355\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u3010Wire\u3011</h2>A homing weapon that can have\
      \ its trajectory controlled after firing. Fly it towards evading enemies, turning\
      \ corners to efficiently land it.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1033640/extras/wire_2.gif?t=1593162355\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u3010Tracker\u3011</h2>Put pressure on your enemies\
      \ with auto-tracking bullets. Use in combination with other weapons and chase\
      \ them down with time-lag attacks. There are various types of trackers, with\
      \ some that install onto the ground and others that follow along.<br><img src=\"\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u3010Body\u3011</h2>This part determines not only\
      \ durability and speed, but how your character looks. Choose a body by tactical\
      \ abilities, or just focus on how cool they look. There are also apparently\
      \ bodies that are hidden away... Play and find out for yourself.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">\u3010Battle Arenas\u3011</h2>The beautiful scenes that make up the\
      \ various arenas are enough to heal the minds of players grown tired from fighting.\
      \ However, don't forget that these are rigorous battle grounds, and arena walls\
      \ will turn into  shields for machinegun bullets once battle begins. There are\
      \ also blocks within the arenas that will break, so which arena you go with\
      \ is vital to increasing the number of victories you land.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >\u3010Cross-platform Match\u3011</h2>You can play online matches against users\
      \ all over the world including Nintendo Switch users. Experience the battle\
      \ across platforms."
