    about_the_game: The most valuable wealth is always hidden in the most remote places.
      For example, in the center of a huge maze, immersed in the impenetrable darkness.<br>But
      you're not one of those who are afraid of difficulties? Then feel free to go
      on a search! Your miner is armed with lamps that will help him to dispel the
      darkness hanging over the mysterious underground mines and caves. You can also
      mark the already passed route with lamps. However, do not forget that the number
      of them is limited, and without a lamp in your hand you will have to light your
      way only a dim miner's flashlight, the light of which is barely enough to see
      your own hands.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/893140/extras/GoldDigger.jpg?t=1532441306"

      need to be brave and smart to go through all the mazes and find all the gold
