    review: "Feels unfinished after playing for less than an hour so far.\n\nThe description\
      \ of this game after playing for less than an hour seems to be the description\
      \ for what it may become, which if it gets updated and fleshed out it could\
      \ be a fun. Currently though it is irritating, though the ui and screens are\
      \ wonderful, it looks nice.\n\nThe daily challenges at the is a cool little\
      \ walk through, as far as i have gotten.Which isn't far since 2 of the challenges\
      \ play for 5 days and use the search option under the season screen can't be\
      \ completed. I went through 10 days with the play 5 days challenge up and it\
      \ never updated, and then like the other user who commented capmjh I could not\
      \ find the search option.\n\nThe players themselves are very striped down, each\
      \ has 4 attributes and then their level in each is conveyed by the color of\
      \ the box. Each time you open a players menu you have to close it to get to\
      \ the next player, an option the would let you move to the next player would\
      \ be helpful. Since without opening a players menu you can only see their name,\
      \ position, current salary and current stats.\n\nMinor league team has some\
      \ issues, first its not actually a farm system in the normal sense of the word.\
      \ Unless you demote players to it, there wont be any players on the team. It\
      \ seems to be a resource generating aspect of the game, except there are 3 resources,\
      \ its not explained (possible in the challenges which can't be advanced) how\
      \ to generate them, you start getting popularity as you win games, which you\
      \ spend to make your minor league stadium better which then generates more popularity.\n\
      \nAgain as the other reviewer said the games play to fast, you can't pause them\
      \ to change the pitcher before the inning is over. If you go to settings there\
      \ is an option to slow it down, only you can't click it, there's also a option\
      \ to change difficulty which you can't select. These could be place holders,\
      \ or they could not be but if they are not working they shouldn't be on the\
      \ screen. \n\nThe number of available players in free agency is low, and again\
      \ to learn about them besides that free agent dh wants 25 million a year you\
      \ have to go into their menu then close out to get to the next one.\n\nI could\
      \ sadly keep nitpicking things about this game, but it feels unfinished for\
      \ a pc game, should of been released as a early access game, as there does seem\
      \ to be some good stuff here for a striped down, less intensive GM sports management\
      \ game. Sadly i don't know if we will ever see it fulfilled as looking at the\
      \ website it appears this game is actually meant for mobile devices. So in the\
      \ end.\n\nDon't buy this unless its updated big time, and knowing that its supposed\
      \ to be a mobile game those minor league resources are probably supposed to\
      \ be micro transactions."
