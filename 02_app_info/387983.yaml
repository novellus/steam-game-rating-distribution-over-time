    review: 'Non-essential cosmetic DLC. [b]Clockwork Yoolip[/b] was originally a
      pre-order bonus for the [url=steamcommunity.com/id/iN008/recommended/425540]Overdrive
      expansion[/url] however was later made purchasable. Its minor changes from Yoolip''s
      regular appearance alongside the slight changes to animations makes me question
      why the price is notably more expensive compared to other non-premium skins
      that also have visual overhauls some of which that look completely different
      from the base character. Don''t recommend buying unless you''re collecting all
      skins.


      Requires both [url=steamcommunity.com/id/iN008/recommended/204300]base game[/url]
      and [url=steamcommunity.com/id/iN008/recommended/425540]Overdrive expansion[/url]
      to use.'
