    reviews: "\u201CStarship Rubicon, to my surprise, combines the nostalgia of old\
      \ arcade shooters with the complexity of modern space simulators to create an\
      \ altogether amazing game that will have you playing, and dying, for hours on\
      \ end.\u201D<br>10/10 \u2013 Bezoned<br><br>\u201COn the surface, Starship Rubicon\
      \ looks like a basic arcade style space shooter with some roguelike elements.\
      \ Underneath there are a lot of fun mechanics that will feel familiar to experienced\
      \ gamers. It would be easy to simply call this game a mashup of many other titles,\
      \ but that wouldn\u2019t do justice to what Starship Rubicon delivers.\u201D\
      <br>True PC Gaming<br><br>\u201CStarship Rubicon is like FTL, Asteroids, and\
      \ Luftrausers all got busy inside of a wool sleeping bag.\u201D<br>10/10 \u2013\

    short_description: Starship Rubicon is a modern take on the classic space shooter
      genre. It's a smart and challenging rogue-lite that features a unique control
      scheme, pixel art remixed with NASA photographs, and an existential crisis about
      who is REALLY the monster.

    review: "An excellent game, the dev clearly put a lot of time and effort into\
      \ it, and it shows.\n\nPros:\n* Good starting loadout variety. My personal favourite\
      \ is the Pakiceph.\n* Good enemy type variety. There are varieties that teleport,\
      \ swarm, form laser networks, and much more.\n* Good equipment variety. All\
      \ sorts of weapons, abilities, and upgrades are available.\n* Interesting tetris-esque\
      \ outfitting system.\n* Variety of level types.\n* Amusing dialogue.\n\nCons:\
      \ \n* The plot is thin, and somewhat cliche\n\nI've been playing this on Windows\
      \ 10 for a while with no issues, so it seems the issues the author mentioned\
      \ do not occur on all Windows 10 machines."
