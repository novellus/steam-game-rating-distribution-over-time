    review: "Jupiter Hell is a traditional roguelike currently under development in\
      \ Early Access, set on a futuristic moon station that you might recognize from\
      \ the golden era of \u201890s gaming.  You play as a Totally-Not-Doom-Guy fighting\
      \ for desperate survival against swarms of demons and zombie soldiers armed\
      \ to the teeth.  Along the way you\u2019ll find plenty of pistols, shotguns,\
      \ grenades, medkits, and BFGs to fend off the hordes of hades.  Sound familiar?\n\
      \nRoguelike games are best described as a turn-based WEGO version of the original\
      \ Diablo on hardcore mode.  You start at the first level of a procedurally generated\
      \ dungeon and fight petty enemies and work your way down to the deadly bosses\
      \ and beasts at the bottom.  Anything can permakill you fast if you\u2019re\
      \ not careful.  The action takes place on a grid and all units\u2019 moves are\
      \ calculated simultaneously, usually with speed stats to determine who moves\
      \ first.  Thus, you can sometimes squeeze in \u201Cextra\u201D turns if your\
      \ speed is higher than the enemies.\n\nThese games typically have medieval fantasy\
      \ settings, and they require you to use nuanced tactical thinking to properly\
      \ utilize a staggering variety of spells and magic scrolls available.  It\u2019\
      s common for newbies and experienced players alike to die with inventories full\
      \ of situationally life-saving equipment.  Jupiter Hell stands apart from the\
      \ genre by offering a meaty, no-nonsense guns-n-grenades tactical turn-based\
      \ combat experience instead of magic and swords.  Anybody who has played classics\
      \ like X-Com and Shrapnel\u2019s 101st Airborne in Normandy should feel right\
      \ at home \u2013 only instead of a squad of poor schmucks tottering into the\
      \ dark, it\u2019s just you and your gun.\n\nYou start Jupiter Hell by creating\
      \ a player character.  You choose between three classes \u2013 Marine, Scout,\
      \ and Technician \u2013 each with their own starting equipment and special abilities.\
      \  The Marine starts with a medkit and has some self-heal abilities, making\
      \ him an ideal first-timer class.  The Scout starts with a .44 revolver, has\
      \ a stealthy cloaking ability, and begins every floor with the exit locations\
      \ mapped out for quicker access.  The Technician starts with a few multitools,\
      \ which are used to open doors or hack consoles to gain map data, track enemies\
      \ via radar, or even command security bots to kill everything on the floor.\
      \  Technicians can also use consumables faster than most, and can throw down\
      \ a smoke screen in a pinch.\nEach of these classes use different forms of \u201C\
      mana\u201D to power their special abilities: Fury, Energy, and Power, respectively.\
      \  These are earned by killing enemies, opening chests, and picking up orbs\
      \ from dead enemies \u2013 again, respectively.  Once you\u2019ve accumulated\
      \ enough \u201Cmana,\u201D you can activate your ability to use a quick flourish\
      \ that might save your life.  This is one of the newer systems introduced to\
      \ Jupiter Hell, adding to the legacy of the free downloadable DoomRL and making\
      \ the game just a bit more accessible to newcomers.\n\nIn addition to pretty\
      \ graphics and nice voice acting, this retail release enhances the combat by\
      \ adding a bit more tactical depth.  The biggest improvement is the cover system:\
      \ Walls and obstacles add to-hit maluses against targets in cover, with higher\
      \ maluses for better cover, making it advantageous to maneuver into cover or\
      \ around an enemy\u2019s flank.  Additionally, you can \u201Chunker\u201D by\
      \ spending a turn paused behind cover, gaining a temporary bonus to defense\
      \ and your next shot.  This is a welcome addition to other features carried\
      \ over from the free version, such as pain from wounds incurring penalties to\
      \ your to-hit rating.\n\nThe inventory management is streamlined from the original\
      \ free roguelike, which is a benefit for newcomers to the genre.  You have a\
      \ backpack limited to ammo and consumables.  You also have several weapon slots\
      \ which can be used for anything from firearms to melee weapons, and you have\
      \ slots for armor (helmet, chest, boots), but you can\u2019t store any spare\
      \ firearms or armor in your inventory as they must be equipped or dropped. \
      \ This feels like a bit of a drawback compared to the original where you could\
      \ store spare armor and weapons, but this may have been done in an effort to\
      \ balance new features that give the player an edge.  Overall I don\u2019t find\
      \ this change distracting as a fan of the original free game.\n\nAnother apparent\
      \ drawback is that you can only have one character at a time, which is an odd\
      \ choice.  Hopefully they decide to implement multiple character files before\
      \ the full release.  \n\nIn the true spirit of a roguelike, I\u2019ve yet to\
      \ survive far into the labyrinths of Jupiter\u2019s moon before being blown\
      \ up, shot dead, or eaten alive.  My first impression of the game is very strong,\
      \ though it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s still work to be done in Early Access.\
      \  I strongly recommend this game to fans of the roguelike genre, and cautiously\
      \ recommend it for interested newcomers.  The free DoomRL delivers another awesome\
      \ tactical turn-based gunfighting experience, along with similar free games\
      \ like AliensRL (set in the James Cameron movie), Cataclysm DDA (zombie apocalypse),\
      \ and Infra Arcana (Lovecraftian 1920s).  However, these games lack proper 3D\
      \ graphics and mostly rely on either community-made sprite packs or ASCII symbols\
      \ that take time to interpret on the fly.  As such, Jupiter Hell is a fine entry\
      \ point into the genre.\n\nSo if you always wanted to play Doom but lacked the\
      \ reflexes, Jupiter Hell is a fantastic tactical challenge that will demand\
      \ a lot for you to succeed.  Look up those keybindings, be patient with your\
      \ moves, and prepare to die a lot."
