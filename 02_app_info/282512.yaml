    review: "While the base game is pretty good (at least for hardcore alien fans\
      \ like i am) pretty much all the DLC for Alien Isolation is utter crap. It\u2018\
      s just that some of the DLC are less crappy than others. \nSince i don\u2019\
      t want write an individual review for every DLC, this covers all of them. \n\
      \nLet\u2019s start with the less crappy ones:\n\u201ECrew expendable\u201C and\
      \ \u201ESole survivor\u201C. There is really not much too say about those two,\
      \ apart from that they are directly inspired from scenes from the first alien\
      \ movie and that they are extremely short. We are talking about half an hour\
      \ maximum for each of them. They are playable, but simply too short to waste\
      \ more than maybe a buck or two on them.\n\nThe rest of the DLC are map packs\
      \ for survivor mode. \u201ECorporate lockdown\u201C, \u201ETrauma\u201C and\
      \ \u201Ethe trigger\u201C each consist of 3 small, short maps, while \u201E\
      Lost Contact\u201C and \u201ESafe haven\u201C are just one big map, that is\
      \ at least twice the size of the others, has 10 objectives and takes considerably\
      \ longer to beat.\n\nThe problem that pretty much ruins the all the dlc is the\
      \ fact, that you can\u2018t lower the difficulty (except for crew expendable\
      \ and sole survivor, which can be played on any of the difficulty modes). As\
      \ far as i can tell, the maps are set on nightmare difficulty, which is never\
      \ fun in this game. 95% of the time the alien is right at your heels and even\
      \ if you manage to hide, it just sticks around for way to long, just waiting\
      \ until you leave your hiding spot. It makes completing the required tasks a\
      \ very frustrating and unfair ordeal. In safe haven and lost contact you can\
      \ safe inbetween the missions at least but in the other 3 dlc, there is no safe\
      \ function. If you die, you go all the way back. The maps of the other three\
      \ can either be played in a row (you carry all your weapons and resources over\
      \ to the next map, but if you die, you always need to restart from the first\
      \ map) or individually (less frustrating when you die, but you always start\
      \ the next map only with basic loadout). I strongly recommend playing the second\
      \ way, because if you die on the third map and have to restart from map one,\
      \ there is hardly anything more rage-inducing.\n\ni completed the main game\
      \ in about 18 hours, and it took me another 17 hours just to complete the dlc.\
      \ It's not because the dlc is so long, it's because it's so f****** unfair and\
      \ unbalanced. If you are good you can finish the 3-map dlc within 15 to 20 minutes\
      \ each, but if you are not a super-patient alien isolation pro-player you WILL\
      \ DIE A LOT which really ramps up the time necessary to complete even the shortest\
      \ of maps. \nThe safe haven and lost contact missions would roughly take an\
      \ hour each to complete, but since i died so often it took me 3 to 3 1/2 hours\
      \ for each of them to complete. Like i mentioned earlier, those two have a safe\
      \ function, but the progress is only safed as long as you are playing. If you\
      \ leave the game, all your progress is erased and you have to start over again,\
      \ so you have to finish them in one sitting, (and i think not that many people\
      \ have 3 spare hours that often).\n\nNevertheless IF you  HAVE TO buy dlc for\
      \ alien isolation, I'd suggest taking either Safe Haven or Lost Contact, since\
      \ they have the most value for their price and sometimes even come close to\
      \ being slightly fun. Otherwise I'd say, just play the campaign of the base\
      \ game again, which is way better designed and much less frustrating than this.\n\
      \n( ) 0/8 Simply one of the worst games ever made. Don't waste any money on\
      \ this.\n( ) 1/8 Bad. Seriously flawed with barely any redeeming qualities.\
      \ Worth a couple of Cents at best, if at all.\n(X) 2/8 Sub-par. Only for hardcore-fans\
      \ of respective genre / series. Don't pay more than 5 bucks.\n( ) 3/8 Meh-diocre.\
      \ It\u2018s okay. Don't pay more than 10 bucks.\n( ) 4/8 Decent, but not for\
      \ everybody. Don't pay more than 15 bucks.\n( ) 5/8 Good game, Must-play for\
      \ genre- / series-fans. Worth 20 to 25 bucks max, if you are not a fan.\n( )\
      \ 6/8 Great game, universal recommendation. 30 bucks would be a steal for this.\n\
      ( ) 7/8 Outstanding game, a milestone of it\u2018s respective genre. Definitely\
      \ worth its full prize.\n( ) 8/8 Simply one of the best games ever made. Get\
      \ this, the prize doesn't matter."
