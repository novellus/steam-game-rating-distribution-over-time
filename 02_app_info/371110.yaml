    review: "The guide is very useful, and the table of contents is hyperlinked for\
      \ easy access to specific sections.  The bulk of it is a detailed walkthrough.\
      \  Bright red chapter headings warn you away before you read spoilers for the\
      \ next bit of the game.\n\nIt's a 16+ MB PDF file that is accessible two ways.\
      \  \n\nFirst, by launching the game through Steam.  After purchasing the DLC,\
      \ when you launch Midnight's Blessing directly from Steam you'll be asked whether\
      \ you wish to start the game or 'View Walkthrough'.  The latter option opens\
      \ up the guide in whatever program you have associated with PDF files.\n\nSecond,\
      \ you can just browse the game's local files and find it that way.  Right-click\
      \ on Midnight's Blessing in Steam, then click Properties->Local Files->Browse\
      \ Local Files.  The guide is the only file in the Guide directory.\n\n(This\
      \ might seem like information overkill, but at the time of writing the only\
      \ other review implied the guide couldn't be accessed.  The main reason for\
      \ leaving my own review was to set the record straight.)\n\nI bought it at 85%\
      \ off and am happy with my purchase.  I'm not sure I'd pay full price for it,\
      \ but at a 50% off or more sale it's probably worth it."
