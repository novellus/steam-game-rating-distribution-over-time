Some low brow jokes, but I really missed the typical Jackie Chan one liners. I have missed those since they stopped showing \"Jackie Chan Adventures\". Great back story into Chinese Myths as well.","timestamp_created":1495522748,"timestamp_updated":1495522748,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554625034332275391","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5sSGmtwCcd7eeQ=="}
