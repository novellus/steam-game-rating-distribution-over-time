    review: "A relaxing little puzzle game.\n\nShoot colorful balls into different\
      \ orbits around your ship.  Group enough of them together and they pop (thus\
      \ saving your ship from damage).  Seems easy but it gets challenging as the\
      \ orbits can change based on your actions.  \n\nGood value for the low price."
