    review: 'As it is, it''s a fun little detective game, however it does suffer from
      some later grammer errors and what''s interesting is the outcome can change,
      depending on who you talk to at what point during the game. I feel that the
      developer did pour their heart into it, however it still suffers a few problems
      and was clearly a mobile game, with certain areas asking you to tap, despite
      using a mouse and keyboard.


      It''s certainly fun for what it is, especially with different outcomes that
      can happen, depending who you accuse and how closely you look at the evidence.'
