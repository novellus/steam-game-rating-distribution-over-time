It is simple and fun, with everything that happens feeling like it was the correct result (this is important in a paddle game).\n\nIt has one major flaw. The room size retirement is completely unnecessary, and yet it makes the game unplayable. I am rating this positively since it lists that requirement on the store page.\n\nIn my 2.2x2.2 meter space all items of the menu are easily reachable. The main gameplay (volleying the ball) works perfectly as well. The only problem is that every single mine spawns outside the play space. That gives a hard limit on how far I can get because sooner or later (usually within ten hits) the ball hits a mine that I can't deal with.\n\nGiving multiple room options (possibly with adjusted scoring to compensate) would make this game far more approachable.\n\nEdit:\nAfter writing this I thought to myself \"What if I could reach the mines? All I had to do was shift my z position forward half a meter (thanks SteamVR Advanced Settings!) and I could reach them just fine. My high score is now 160 and I worked up a serious sweat.\n\nThe ball still sometimes gets shot outside my play space, but for the most part the game works great just by offsetting myself forwards.\n\nEdit 2: According to the Dev's response, the playspace can be repositioned via the touchpad. I have not tested this however.","timestamp_created":1484964966,"timestamp_updated":1484970218,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525153696537017822","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1484968649,"developer_response":"Thank you for the constructive review! I agree completely and I am working on an option that will make the game cohesive with smaller play spaces. In the meantime, I've added the option to use the trackpad to re-orient the space. Hopefully this will help a bit. If not please stick around as I plan on updating this game on a regular basis. Thank you!\n\nEdit: Read your update.  Glad you're having a better time of it now.  You actually don't need Advanced SteamVR to adjust the z position.  Just use the track pad! :)\n\nThanks for the feedback.  I will continue working on the physics."}],"cursor":"AoJwoerH39kCdtONcA=="}
