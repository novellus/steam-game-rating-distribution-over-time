    about_the_game: 'An intense, arcade-style, ''bullet hell'' SHMUP/STG in which
      you must master a vast array of ridiculous weaponry in order to defeat a race
      of evil aliens who are intent on abducting innocent civilians and turning them
      into mutants. Jetboard Joust blends the spirit and intensity of 1980s arcade
      coin-op SMHUPs with the replayability and tactical elements of hardcore modern
      roguelikes. <i>Don''t</i> expect a story. <i>Do</i> expect frantic, fluid, fast-paced
      60fps action, big guns, and explosions!<br><br><strong>The Jetboard</strong>:
      Leap from your jetboard like a boss to gain temporary invincibility and smash
      your enemies to smithereens. Destroy pretty much everything in your path. You
      rock.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1181600/extras/JetBoard_Squirmers03a.gif?t=1605030476"
      /><br><br><strong>The Enemies</strong>: Over fifty different enemies to outwit.
      Be prepared for them to come at you with all the game''s weapons plus their
      own special attacks. Watch out for a few tributes to classic arcade games of
      the past too...  <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1181600/extras/Enemies.gif?t=1605030476"
      /><br><br><strong>The Weapons</strong>: From the conventional  to the ridiculous!
      Jetboard Joust offers over thirty powerful weapons, each with its own distinct
      advantages and upgrade path, to aid you on your mission and leave a path of
      total destruction in your wake. Get up close and dish out massive damage with
      the shotgun, wreak havoc with the cluster bomb, fry enemies to a crisp with
      the flame tornado or shock them into submission with the lightning bolt. You''ll
      get a different selection of weapons with each playthrough and you''ll need
      to master them all!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1181600/extras/WeaponCarousel.gif?t=1605030476"

      multi-stage battles and then steal their attacks for your own use. Rendered

    review: 'If you like arcade style games, and especially if you like Defender,
      this is a no brainer. It looks great, sounds great, and controls great. The
      enemy variety is good, and the various weapons are fun to use. The developer
      is responsive and regularly updates the game.


      The roguelike elements affect stage order and weapon appearances, but they do
      not feel haphazard or disorganized, and there are no persistent unlocks. Even
      if you do not normally like roguelikes, you will probably find the roguelike
      elements inoffensive if the core gameplay is your thing.


      One last thought - this game has particularly good feedback. I''m talking about
      the visual and audio bits that trigger when collecting coins, blowing up enemies,
      using the jetboard attack, etc. Good feedback is important for all games, but
      vital for arcade style games, and this one nails it.'
