    about_the_game: It is the year 2140. One hundred years after a massive meteor
      struck the earth, almost wiping out the entire planet. The survivors retreated
      into the ruined cities and began rebuilding them into massive fortresses walled
      off from the rest of the desolate earth. <br><br>Those who did not make it to
      the cities were permanently shut out. Determined to survive, they are constantly
      trying to find a way in.<br><br>You wake up abandoned outside in the wasteland
      with no memory of what happened. Survive and ultimately make your way into the
      cities.<h2 class="bb_tag">INTRODUCTION</h2><br>This is a physics-based open-world
      survival adventure game. It is planned to include combat, base building, crafting,
      puzzles, survival and a compelling story to drive it. Building will be a core
      gameplay mechanic where you build structures to overcome challenges and solve
      puzzles in the world. For example building a bridge to cross a river, stairs
      to reach high places, or defending against enemies.<br><br>It is still currently
      very early in development, but some basic combat and building is already in
      place.<h2 class="bb_tag">FULL PHYSICS</h2>All characters are full physics-based
      active ragdolls and will react to and collide with physics objects. They can
      walk, run, climb and lose balance and fall down realistically. Grab and pull
      them and they will move along. Pull too hard and they will fall down.<h2 class="bb_tag">BULLET
      HOLES &amp; BALLISTICS</h2>Bullet holes are true 3D, unlimited and works on
      any object. Look at them at any angle and it really looks like a 3D model, not
      just plain flat. Real-time bullet ballistics system accurately calculates bullet
      path every frame and allows you to shoot through the tiniest of gaps. Ricochet
      and penetration also modelled along with realistic debris and sounds.<h2 class="bb_tag">BUILDING</h2>Build
      your own base and defend against enemies. Solve puzzles in the world, for example
      building a bridge to cross a river, stairs to reach high places, or just plain
      out creatively building things for fun. Crafting and survival still a work in
      progress.<h2 class="bb_tag">SEXY FEMALE ROBOT</h2>Your companion to love. She
      has big boobs. And breast physics. What more could you want?<br><br><br><br><br><br><i>Trailer
