Get on sale.\n\n    Start with Kein's route, it is the most enjoyable. I tried to save him til last, but I don't think I'll finish this game. I really enjoyed another game by this company called \"The Rose of Segundia\", and had hoped that this game would have the same feel. It does not. It is a more serious subject matter and there are very few moments of joy or fun. It feels like the game is trying to teach me something about the struggle of man to remain good in the face of extreme hardship and injustice, the corruption that can come with power, struggling to find onself and self worth, etc. I have a major in religious studies, and this felt like an attempt at a deep conversation. It succeeds at being intelligent and darker than most stories I've played... but almost to it's own detriment.\n     It gets repetative until the characters split about 1/2 way through. The seriousness of the subject matter makes a lot of the lovey relationship moments seem weird/forced. The romances almost don't fit into the story. It switches between tragedy and the struggle of man to a cute scene where the MC and LI help the other wash their hair or something. The art is usually very good with a couple scenes being a bit blurry and off looking. The MC is forced to be lawful good most of the time. Overall, I wouldn't say to actively avoid it.","timestamp_created":1573621705,"timestamp_updated":1593539469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543230056762695313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47NOWg/MCcKXg2QE="}
