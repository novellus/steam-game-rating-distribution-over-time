      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBackground: <br />\r\nAs tales go, Pheonix with flame\
      \ surrounded his body, is the king of all birds. <br />\r\nBut with the world\
      \ suffering, the Pheonix just wouldn't have it. He lit all evil with his fire,\

      \nStoryline: <br />\r\nThe game is about stories which happened when Lin was\
      \ following his junior fellow apprentice to go down the mountain for their martial\
      \ art training. During their way, when passing the Tanglin City, they found\
      \ Jolin Shen, a demon fox, was inciting and creating trouble there. Teaming\
      \ up with disciples from the Treasure Pavilion, they caught Jolin Shen finally.\
      \ But unexpectedly people from the Water God Sect were suspected of having been\
      \ involved in it. Afterwards, along with Seven and Bai, they went to the Four\
      \ Phase Mountain to explore the truth about the rumors on a legendary sword.\
      \ However, when they spotted the conspiracy, it had been too late. Did what\
      \ all happened stem from the Water God Sect? Or some sects else were behind?\
      \ Were the following men related to the conspiracy, who covered Yuu, Lin\u2019\
      s junior fellow apprentice, a mild yet severe man? Seven, a well-behaved hunter?\
      \ \_Or Bai, who was mysterious and unsociable ? Or Yuun, who was always elusive?<br\
