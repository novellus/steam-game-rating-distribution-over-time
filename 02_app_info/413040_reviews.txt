I am one to rage quite often but this was pretty fun to play. It is a classic hack and slash game which you embark on this adventure to save your friends! Below are my pros and cons of the game:\n\nPros:\n- Fun, good way to pass time\n- Easy, does not induce great amounts of rage\n- It makes me look like I a gaming lord\n- Didn't encounter any bugs. Gameplay was smooth\n- Classic hack and slash\n- Great pricing point\n\nCons:\n- May be a little too easy\n- Little challenge was saw \n- Controls seem to only be for controller\n- Combat can be a bit mindless. More button mashing that combos\n\n\nGameplay if you fancy it:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpPLTwyo6Dw","timestamp_created":1489734147,"timestamp_updated":1489734147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52649003267288208","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u+PE7doCdYHMdA=="}
