    review: This is the easiest scenario pack to obtain. You only need 2 things, the
      P42DC and the Montana Hi-Line. So it's a simple scenario pack, the scenarios
      are good and in the freight scnearios you aren't time rushed. (You'd know if
      you see 1000 points on the area where you'd see your TS score) So it's a good
      scenario pack.
