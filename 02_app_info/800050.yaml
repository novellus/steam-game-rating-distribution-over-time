    review: 'Really enjoyed this one. The relationships and friends you pick up along
      the way seem to matter a lot, and I found myself quite invested in all the side
      characters lives. Seems like there are many romanceable characters and all of
      them felt pretty interesting


      Your choices seem to matter a fair bit and can result in a variety of different
      paths and courses for you to take (these can be followed through to the next
      game, though see my review on it for some issues I felt)


      One thing I did quite enjoy was there''s an aspect of old gamebooks in this
      one, with stat based fighting and a bit of random variance. Nice to see that
      in a game, I used to love Fighting Fantasy and the like as a kid


      Towards the end of the game, it practically opens up into open world style travels
      and adventures, which was very surprising and ambitious for these type of games,
      was very interesting and I think it pulled it off quite well


      All in all, I found the story and characters very interesting and fun, and I''d
      really recommend this game'
