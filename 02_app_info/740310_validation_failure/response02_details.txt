You play as Chris, a janitor working at Perfect Future Laboratories. This high-tech and secretive research facility has suffered catastrophic damage. Now your only way out is through several radioactively colorful worlds infested with cute but lethal monsters. Armed only with your gun and the help of GRACE, you must transmogrify these enemies into the tools you need to solve the puzzles and escape.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRefreshingly different in its genre, Transmogrify does not shy away from cranking up the difficulty level where most puzzle platformers remain mechanically simple.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOver 75 levels are packed with fast-paced action, tons of enemies and powerups, all set to an exciting soundtrack. The player’s ability to manipulate the environment through transforming monsters into blocks, springs, floating platforms and other tools, is an innovative mechanic that is as fun as the name Transmogrify makes it sound.","about_the_game":"It all started while you were routinely cleaning storage room 2b in section 6.
