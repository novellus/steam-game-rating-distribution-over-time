    review: 'This DLC adds a new backpack to your game world, this backpack offers
      the highest amount of carrying weight to the game.


      Also included in this DLC is the Teddy Bear Helmet, the Crow Pet and then the
      Duel Knives, all items with decent stats to get you going in the struggle for
      survival.


      If you are interested in buying everything that the game has to offer i would
      suggest buying the  How to Survive 2 - Kovac''s Ultimate Edition'
