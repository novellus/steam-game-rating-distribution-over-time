    about_the_game: "Set around a city being consumed from within by a disease, Plague\
      \ Road tells a story of a lone doctor who once abandoned their home and now\
      \ returns to learn the fate of those they left behind. Travel from the safe\
      \ refuge of your farm through a series of regions progressively more affected\
      \ by the infernal plague. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the road, rescue survivors\
      \ and choose whether to use them as traveling companions or to improve the Doctor's\
      \ farm and gain access to new abilities. How your farm progresses depends upon\
      \ where you assign survivors to work. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome survivor types\
      \ are more valuable in certain jobs, but may be more useful still if kept available\
      \ for expeditions. Surviving the road will rely on your ability to fight horrors\
      \ created by the plague, in combat encounters featuring grid-based positioning\
      \ and turn-based strategy mechanics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTraverse four regions\
      \ with procedurally generated stages, featuring richly illustrated 2D art, music\
      \ from award-winning composer Sean Beeson and narration performed by Jim Sterling."
