      \ /><br>Collect bits to grow your worm \u2014 but don't bite your tail! Outwit\
      \ (and out-eat) an army of hungry ants and fast-moving centipedes in this challenging,\
      \ 8-bit quarter game. <br><br>Bitworm is a throwback to classic arcade games\
      \ of yesteryear, complete with retro graphics and 8-bit sound tones. In this\
      \ alteration of the classic Snake game, you work to grow your worm by obtaining\
      \ bits while avoiding running into ants. <br><br>Work quickly to eliminate all\
      \ of the ants in each stage to progress to the next stage. If an ant eats a\
      \ bit, it may spawn a new ant! If you take too long to clear a stage, more ants\
      \ will spawn!<br><br>The longer you grow your worm's tail, the easier it will\
      \ be to trick ants into hitting you, but don't bite your tail! Biting your own\
      \ tail will spawn a centipede! Centipedes move as fast as you do, and can grow\
      \ up to 50 segments long! They are also smart enough to avoid running into your\
      \ worm!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/950570/extras/_img_bwrmGIF.gif?t=1547836331\"\

      \ game isn't challenging enough for you, type &quot;<i><strong>TOOEASY</strong></i>&quot;\
      \ on the main menu. This will make the next game you play spawn only blue ants\
      \ that move as fast as you do. And if that doesn't sound hard enough -- you\
