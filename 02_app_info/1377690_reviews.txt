The ramps are prominent and the drop-targets are difficult to spot but that's the kind of modern pinball it emulates, and it's done very very well. It might be the best Deluxe table so far - for me it is. I would highly recommend this table to players of any skill as the Deluxe tables are easy to play but hard to master, especially this one.","timestamp_created":1597013640,"timestamp_updated":1597067701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sOWp7PMCcNm+mgI="}
