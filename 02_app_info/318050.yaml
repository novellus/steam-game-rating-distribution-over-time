      \ months ago, when I was walking around a large shipping terminal in Waigaoqiao,\
      \ Shanghai, I saw many colourful containers stacked together - which came from\
      \ all over the world - looking like towering blocks of beautiful skyscrapers.\
      \ From that time, I planned to make and place these cool iron boxes into my\
      \ favorite simulator, making our experiences more awesome and more realistic.\
      \ <br><br>Now, you will get a total of 10 styles of 20ft and 40ft dry van containers\
      \ in your railroad world. You are able to carry them by X2K double-stack container\
      \ well wagons.<br><br>Features Include: <br>- 10 styles.<br>- Normal Maps.<br>-\
      \ Weathered. <br><br><strong>X2K DOUBLE-STACK CONTAINER WELL WAGONS</strong><br>If\
      \ you intend to travel between Shanghai and Beijing by train, maybe you'll pass\
      \ a train with double-stacked containers - chances are it will be these, as\
      \ the X2 series well wagons are the only double-stack container wagons in China.\
      \ <br><br>The X2 series double-stack container well wagon is specially designed\
      \ to carry container traffic. Once a X2 wagon equips ZK6 bogies, it\u2019s called\
      \ \u201CX2K\u201D, and its max speed is up to 120 km/h. <br><br>Three colors\
      \ of X2K wagons are included, which should be mixed in a long train for a more\
      \ realistic effect!<br><br>Features Include:<br>- Normal Maps.<br>- Weathered.<br>-\
      \ Rear Sign Light.<br>- Load Product.<br>- LOD System."
