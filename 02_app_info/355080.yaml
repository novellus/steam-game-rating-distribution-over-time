    about_the_game: 'Crazy Steam Bros is a classical horizontal shoot''em up inspired
      by the gameplay of old arcades. Anton and Dupont are brothers, inventors, and
      a little mad also! With the help of their landlady, Miss Lily, they must defeat
      the evil Baron and their hordes of moustached soldiers. Fly the &quot;SteaMobile&quot;
      trough five levels of steampunk action. Traverse cities, jungles, caves and
      more. Collect Power-Ups for your machine and defeat the bad tempered bosses
      before the tea time! <br><br>To play you can use the keyboard or a compatible
      gamepad, and Keys can be redefined at the options menu.<br><br>Predefined keys

      keys for player 2<br></li><li>&quot;K&quot; key for player 1, &quot;Q&quot;
      key for player 2:<br>Shooting. It will activate all your weapons, except bombs
      and air mines. This is a game with automatic autofire, so there''s no need to
      ravage your keyboard or your fingers :D<br></li><li>&quot;L&quot; key for player
      1, &quot;W&quot; key for player 2:<br>Bombing. Hitting things with bombs is

      to show the pause menu.<br></li><li>&quot;ESC&quot; key:<br>To finish and quit
      the game.</li></ul><br>Gameplay is easy. Just advance trough the levels and
      survive the battle against the stage''s bosses.<br>Eventually, Miss Lily will
      drop random powerups. Collect them for increased firepower.<br>These powerups
      have a limited life, so use them sparingly.<br><br>The different powerups are:<br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Supershoot:    <br>Increased damage for the machinegun.<br></li><li>Trishoot:    <br>The
      machinegun will shot in three directions at once.<br></li><li>Air Mines:    <br>They
      will pursue the nearby enemies.<br></li><li>Tesla Shield:    <br>A force field

    review: "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] None [/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \nAbsolutely\
      \ not. This game has so many fundamental problems with it, it doesn't deserve\
      \ your time. I try to match people to the game and the genre type, and go with\
      \ its strengths, but there is no match here. I'm sorry, there's too many problems\
      \ with the game at a fundamental level. Yeah, it looks nice, but not only are\
      \ there ridiculously bad controls that are really hard to work with, but there\
      \ was bugs all over the place. Just avoid. \n\n[b]Video Review: [/b]  http://youtu.be/UzMZKwijtYs\n\
      \n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The ideas?\n[*]The art is not\
      \ bad.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Controls are floaty and abysmal\
      \ because of it. Needed precision is unobtainable. It makes the game literally\
      \ unplayable.\n[*]Obvious Mobile Design game is obvious.\n[*]Does not save options\
      \ like audio levels.\n[*]Game can exit with one single button push without prompting\
      \ with escape key. \n[*]QA did not exist. Bugs all over the place. Was able\
      \ to be in the options menu and kept on playing. \n[*]Nothing stands out about\
      \ game design.\n[*]Sound and music loops get old rather quickly\n[/list]"
