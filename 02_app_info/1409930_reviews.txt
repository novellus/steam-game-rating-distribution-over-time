I love the visual style of the game. But I have to give this a thumbs down because it has problems. The menu options are almost not there at all. If you hit escape it hard dumps out of the game without warning. There is also a big problem with white text on a very light if not white background. It's almost unreadable in places. It would also be nice to have your previous high scores saved so you know what to beat next time. The game feels rushed and still needs work. I bought all the expansions that adds up, it  would be nice if the interface and menus lived up to the game's potential. Aside from that it does (bare bones) what you would expect it to, it just does it in a not very professional manner. I will revisit the game if I see an update and change this review if the problems are addressed. It's charming under that layer of feeling unfinished.","timestamp_created":1600326906,"timestamp_updated":1600326906,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwida6zfQCfJGqogI="}
