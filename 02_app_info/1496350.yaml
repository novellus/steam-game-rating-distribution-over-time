    about_the_game: '<strong>Do your friends often tell you that you act like a hamster?
      Now you have the chance to prove that not only do you act like a hamster, but
      you can also think like one!</strong><br><br>You play as a hamster stuck in
      a strange world full of odd shapes and no food as far as the eye can see. You
      just want to get home to your sweet hamster cage and your delicious sunflower
      seeds, but these shapes will not take no for an answer. They continually block
      your way forward. However, with your amazing hamster brain, you quickly figure
      out that all these shapes have their own unique function. Some hurt a whole
      lot, which is not a good thing, but others can actually help you move forward!
      You just have to do a bit of thinking. Time to use your hamster logic! <br><br><strong>Features:
      </strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A cute hamster running in a ball.<br></li><li>Puzzles
      that make you think.<br></li><li>Engaging gameplay </li></ul><br><strong>Note:</strong>
      10% of the net revenue earned from this game goes to Blue Cross (UK).'
