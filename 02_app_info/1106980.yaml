    developer_response: Thank you for feedback! I just checked project and noticed
      that one of the levels has broken piece of navigation, thats why AI trapped
      near the wall. My fault. In general, AI can move to any base, even if there
      is no direct line between bases. I'll fix this bug in next update and try to
      implement your suggestions

    review: 'This game should be right up my alley: real-time strategy resource management
      bullet-hell tower defense!  And you can program drones to do your bidding and
      expand your empire!  Unfortunately, this premise falls flat due to poor drone
      AI, rendering the game too tedious and difficult.  I had amassed an army of
      drones to capture the next base, but the AI is programmed to move in a straight
      line, and in a level design that has obstacles and bottlenecks, the AI is not
      savvy enough to "go around" so I was left with half my army trapped against
      the wall.  Redirecting them to a new target didn''t do anything.  So I stood
      useless and overwhelmed by incoming enemy attacks.  Replayed the same level
      several times and kept running into some variation of the same problem.


      I''m not quite ready to hang it up, though.  I was having fun up until that
      point, and I''d like to eventually unlock the rest of the game''s full potential.


      Some suggestions:


      - fix drone AI

      - allow a "pause" feature when in Q-map mode, as reprogramming all the drones
      and trying to secure a base can be overwhelmed faster than I can get into build
      mode

      - allow drones to have a "patrol" mode for defense or "envoy" mode for flanking
      so they''re not uselessly splitting up and diving every enemy base


      Game has potential.  I''d love to see it through.


      In the meantime, I''d suggest checking out Particle Fleet: Emergence for a more
      dynamic, chilled-out version of Bulletorium.


      edit: game deserves praise for a cheap, fun distraction and a responsive dev.'
