It's a nuked to the ground warehouse of cliches that didn't run well enough on my machine to even finish once after battling my way through the slowdowns only to reach yet another in a series of hallway running, where do I go (?) maze segments.  \n\nWhat you get here is unfortunately your same ol' mental-illness madness tale with cement-shoes gameplay that consists of read a little of this and a little of that, solve some very basic puzzles, get stuck in weird hallways where you gotta stumble your way to the exit by picking the right directions (sometimes running from a goofy baddie or two) while generally getting annoyed every 20 minutes further.  It lacks atmosphere by settling on dark n' dreary visual choices n' nothing but although the sound is at least above average.  Stumbling around in the dark like a fool in horror games is one thing, doing it like a fool with very little point is absolutely another.  I actually had to take a couple of Tylenols after 3 hours of this frustration and still remember needing to do so.  It gave me a headache.  \n\nIt's not optimized as well as it could be but that's not the bottom line problem.  The game isn't enjoyable, progression leads to more of the same and with the running issues it became too much of a hassle to even want to finish.  Unfortunately I put too much time into it to refund it (I'm stubborn as hell, I like at least finishing things I buy once).  Road closed due to avalanche, proceed with caution.","timestamp_created":1607587805,"timestamp_updated":1607587805,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1607795054,"developer_response":"That was actually well written! But please keep in mind, I started developing Deluded Mind at the age of 15 and didn't have the money to realize the game as I wished. As well as that, I am just one developer and was limited very much in time.\n\nMy latest game, Beyond Senses, which is a Multiplayer Horror Game, is much more innoative, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to market it very well. I wanted to build this game together with the community but unfortunately I couldn't reach out and get people involved in the further development of the game.\n\nMaybe it'll change your opinion about my very first game. :) It was just me, not a team of experts."}],"cursor":"AoJ49ObspfYCdKbPuAI="}
