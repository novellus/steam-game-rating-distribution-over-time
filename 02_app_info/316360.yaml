      is a genius, but a humble one - a genius who takes your concepts and brings
      them to life in a way you could never have imagined. Rodina came alive because

      with this music.&quot;<h2 class="bb_tag">To Access the Soundtrack</h2><br>Rodina''s
      soundtrack is delivered as DLC to the main game. This means that you will need
      to navigate to your <strong>Rodina install folder</strong> in order to access
      your files.<br><br>1. After buying the soundtrack, go to your Steam Library<br>2.
      Right click on &quot;Rodina&quot; and choose Properties<br>3. Go to the DLC
      tab and ensure that the soundtrack is installed<br>4. Now, go to the LOCAL FILES
      tab and choose BROWSE LOCAL FILES<br>5. You should now see a window with your
      Rodina install files. Look in the &quot;Soundtrack&quot; directory! Feel free
      to copy files out of this directory.<br>6. If desired, go back to the DLC tab
      and uncheck the soundtrack to delete the files from the Rodina directory.'
