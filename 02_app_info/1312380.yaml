    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Everyone has performance anxiety.</h2><br>We've
      all had that nightmare where we're back in college, on stage, naked, and absolutely
      failing at performing Shakespeare's Hamlet. Now it is in video game form! You
      wake up in a strange dorm room, with a strange cat boy or cat girl roommate,
      depending on what gender you picked during character creation. Everything looks
      funky, probably because of all the backgrounds are pre-made art assets. Before
      you know it, you are thrust into a week of Shakespearian thrills, chills, and
      literature! Survive the entire week and hope to wake from this dramatic nightmare,
      where you go to school during the day, but perform a play that you keep forgetting
      the lines to by night!<br><br>In this visual novel/dating sim/anxiety simulator,
      either know the entire text of Hamlet, or perish. Only don't really perish.
      There's no fail state for not knowing Hamlet. You just might not get laid.<h2
