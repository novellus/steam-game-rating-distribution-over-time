    review: "So you can read plenty about mechanics in other reviews and ingame so\
      \ i'm not going to talk about that.\n\ni would recommend the game. Difficulty\
      \ levels to suit your wants including a chill mode if you want to play more\
      \ casually. I myself had great fun playing this game. The dev is very responsive\
      \ and even made some changes when i mentioned that chill mode was not very chill.\
      \ Continuous goals to strive for during the game. \n\nThe price is very good\
      \ for the time you can get out of this game on full price even. \n\nCertainly\
      \ worth picking up."
