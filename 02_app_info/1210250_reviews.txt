The gameplay is simple but engaging. Very similar to Slime Rancher but you can advance a bit more quickly and this story line is more fun, in my opinion. Have to admit, I freaking love making friends with the bankimals and having them follow me around :) You can feel a lot of love and thought was put into this game and the fact that it's free to play is amazing, because I'd gladly pay for this game (and did purchase both DLCs) Well done, devs, can't wait to see more!","timestamp_created":1602953654,"timestamp_updated":1602953654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7/Xem/UCdve5qAI="}
