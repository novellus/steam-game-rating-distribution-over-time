      Updated Review: 6/14/18

      The previous main issue I talked about was indeed fixed, though I can still
      not recommend the game as it''s a heavily story-based game and while I understand
      English isn''t the first language, it really needs to be worked on, some are
      alright, some are illegible, and some are just missing.  Also because I only
      made it a bit farther into the game before I found myself in a room I cannot
      leave from, I was sent to talk to a prisoner, and even after talking with him
      I am still completely stuck.


      From the very little I experienced I gotta say the graphics for being as simplistic
      as they are, are actually fairly pretty, the combination of basic geometric
      shapes and the more advanced and detailed lighting is quite a nice contrast,
      the animation is also quite nice (from what I''ve seen which is just a walking
      animation that is).  Though there is a wealth of small issues that don''t directly
      impact the gameplay but definitely need to be fixed, the biggest one is making
      it so the sound setting in the menu actually changes the volume, as it currently
      does not.


      Yea, so hopefully the developer is active and can get the game working as I
      would like to be able to provide a full review of the game, as of now, definitely
      avoid it.'
