I love space, exploration, Mars... anything 4X, really.    Given that this was an indie project, I really wanted to enjoy this, and assumed it'd be a little more offbeat than the usual \"colonise a planet\" simulators.\n\nSadly, I found numerous issues with the game.    Considering it's very low-poly, it fair kills a mobile GPU. In sandstorms, the game becomes a slideshow on my laptop.    The game has a number of pacing issues.  You just seem to spend a lot of time waiting for things to happen.    The tech tree seems moderately well thought out... A nice nod to the way that money reaches these projects.   There are some interesting things to do and see, some interesting ideas here, but after the umpteenth crash, the umpteenth failed mission because of some oversight, or someone ran out of something... I just gave up.   \n\nI really really wanted this game to succeed, but it needs some serious pacing changes and a good solid look at the way money and resources amass to bring the fun back in, and decrease the slog and repeated deaths.\n\nI don't want to do this, because it's an indie game, and it's clearly a labour of love, 80% of it is really well designed and put together, but it just isn't fun (yet)  :(","timestamp_created":1608415089,"timestamp_updated":1608415089,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ltLAvvYCd4vFuwI="}
