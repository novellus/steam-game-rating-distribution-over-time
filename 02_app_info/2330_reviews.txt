As with all mission packs, this is less plotwise and more just a semi-random collection of various FPS maps that you can slog through. \n\nQuake II was a great game, but it's far too dated and superseded by Quake II RTS.  This mission pack is less enjoyable than the original Quake II campaign, but has all the drawbacks.   Finally, it doesn't launch properly, with an Error 53 because the developers didn't bother testing the game on Steam before launching it.  They know about the problem, but refuse to fix it. \n\nWhile you can jump through a lot of contorted hoops to maybe get the game to launch, it's unacceptable for the developer to keep selling a product they know is broken, with no attempt or intention to fix it.  Thumbs down.","timestamp_created":1609647617,"timestamp_updated":1609647617,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vq6e4/YCda36vwI="}
