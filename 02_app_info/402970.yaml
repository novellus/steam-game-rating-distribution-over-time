    developer_response: 'Thank you so much for previewing this game.  Yes, it is still
      in development.  To assert, just in case anyone is curious: No, I don''t think
      it will increase in price.  I originally wanted to sell the game at the 19.99
      USD level, but I''m fine with the current pricing.  I hope to finish it and
      make it worth the money.  Sadly, I doubt I''ll ever profit from it so, truly,
      I make it out of love of making and playing this kind of game.  The more people
      who support me in Early Access, the faster and more elaborately it will be completed.'

    review: "\nFringes of the Empire was  released  via early access   back in November\
      \ and  according to the developer is expected to be in early access for at least\
      \ a  couple of years as there is only one person (Mad Merv) working on this\
      \ title.  He expects the  game to increase in price when the game is released.\
      \  The full price is \xA314.99 which I personally was  happy to pay as I love\
      \ single player  roguelike shmups.   I've played the game for  several hours\
      \ so far and although at times I found the game a little slow,  most of the\
      \ time I throughly enjoyed playing the game.  \n\nYou  can see where enemy \
      \ ships are located  via the mini map that is provided.  The developer has promised\
      \ ship to ship  encounters (i.e.  being able to board the ships and  fight your\
      \ way through the enemy ship; however, at this time there is only ship to ship\
      \  fighting via the usual  lasers, photon and rocket weapons).  I've still to\
      \   find many of the promised  thirty plus weapons and  allthough I've encountered\
      \ quite a few  weird and wonderful  looking ships there's  a lot i've still\
      \ to discover.    There is a level editor  and in future there will be scope\
      \ for  shareable moddale content, so  the potential for unlimited content if\
      \ this game  becomes popular is  petty much assured.\n\nThe art style is original\
      \ and IMO  excellent, with a retro feel, but without the pixillated graphics\
      \ older games have.  There's a large number of enemy ship types (86 at the time\
      \ of writing)  as well as friendlies that can  help defeat stronger  enemies.\
      \  The game also has RPG elements with upgreadable weapons,  ships and crew\
      \ training.\n\nThis is  only  an initial overview of what I've found so far.\
      \ I expect to play this game   for many more hours over the coming months and\
      \ years, so will be updating this  review as and when I am able.   I will be\
      \ keeping an eye on the developers updates. His last one was  31st December\
      \ 2015 and prior to that about 6 weeks before release.\n\n\nYou can see some\
