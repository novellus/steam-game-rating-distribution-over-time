    about_the_game: "This is the prototype that started it all! This build was oringially\
      \ created in 42 hours during the amJam game jam event hosted by <i>Artifex Mundi</i>.\
      \ The competition\u2019s theme was &quot;<i>this parrot is no more</i>&quot;\
      \ based on the Monty Pythons' Dead Parrot sketch. Oh...Sir! came in second and\
      \ received an audience award. Subsequently we decided to release this prototype\
      \ into the world, and much to our surprise players enjoyed it as much as we\
      \ do! We were thrilled to receive all of their feedback and feature requests\
      \ and decided to build upon them and create a honest-to-goodness real game called\
      \ <strong>Oh...Sir The Insult Simulator</strong>. However we still wanted players\
      \ to be able to play the original protoype that started it all, so here it is!\
      \ <br><br>If you think your best friend's mother is a hamster and your boss\
      \ smells of elderberries, invite them to play <strong>Oh...Sir!</strong>, a\
      \ jolly video game about dead parrots and insulting the *BLEEP* out of your\
      \ beloved loved ones. A game where your sister can convince you that your hovercraft\
      \ is full of eels and your hat is silly! You should always look on the bright\
      \ side of life - even the harshest insult can be classy when said over a cup\
      \ of tea. So track down a best friend, and enjoy the greatest local 1v1 multiplayer\
      \ insult simulator game of the century!"
