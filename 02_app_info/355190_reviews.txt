This was ONE GUY'S labor-of-love homage to the Descent legacy, made while players were being strung along for years, by the \"Descent:Underground\" and \"Descent (2019)\" vaporware projects (thankfully, we eventually at least got \"Overload\"). Lacking the support of a whole production studio, this game lacks Overload's polish and drama, and some technical glitches remain. But taken on its own merits, and taken for what it is rather than what \"Descent:Underground\" promised, it is a worthy companion to the legacy.","timestamp_created":1607366774,"timestamp_updated":1607366774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwz9Ghn/YCc9mDuAI="}
