The NPC are cool. Toad, giants Rats and stuff. They look really good. They come at you hell bent on killing you. Graphics shimmer in areas and they look low textures even on high. Blurry draw distance even on the Index. My frame rate was reprojecting, but I was recording at 4K at the same time. So upping the SS would be worse on the frame rate. Game Play is fun minus the grip on the Index changing the movement option every time I gripped accidentally. \nI have alot of wave games and I don't think this is the best. It is early access so it can improve alot. Other wave games have level ups, power ups and perks!","timestamp_created":1577801603,"timestamp_updated":1577801603,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4+7qTru8CcezU6AE="}
