During that period, a massacre took place in the school, which resulted in the death of 15 people (12 children and 3 teachers) and the disappearance of 8 people (7 children and one teacher). The information about the massacre has either been hidden or does not exist, because absolutely nothing is known about it, except that it happened!

I went to check what it was and I was lucky (if I may call it that) to find a DVD(Digital Video Disc)! I soon realized that this class is the one in which most human corpses were found! I kept wondering why no one has taken it from there so far! Maybe they didn't see it! But how the hell is that possible! A DVD can hide valuable information! I took the DVD and left as soon as possible because it is forbidden to enter this school without permission!<br><br> When I got home, I immediately opened the PC and inserted the DVD that I found!<br><br> I was shocked and amused at the same time! Why! Because I discovered the DVD's great secret! A game, there was a **** game! First, I thought it was a bad joke from some teenagers and I forgot about it for a while, but finally, one night I was terribly bored and I decided to open this game and see what it's all about!<br><br> Looks like it was a horror game. I started playing it a little and then a great idea came to me! I could make a few bucks if I put the game for sale on the internet and I would pretend to be its developer! That's what I did, but I decided to sell the game only to certain people because I didn't want to be accused of Copyright infringement! And that was the moment when copies of the game were released on the internet!<br><br> After that, I continued to play the game! It was a weird game, but I finally realized what was really going on!
