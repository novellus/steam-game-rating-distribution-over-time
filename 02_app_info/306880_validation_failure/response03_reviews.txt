Transition sequences last far too long even with the speed-up function of holding flippers/launcher. Unfair ballouts. Annoying ramp layouts. Characters walk across the screen, blocking view.\n\nIt's good for the Deadpool gimmick. Otherwise, it combines my least-favorite features/cons of Pinball FX2 all in one table. Totally worth purchasing on sale if you're a Deadpool fan however, or looking to up your superscore thing. Otherwise, there are legitimately good single-tables that go on sale for the same price.","timestamp_created":1481764126,"timestamp_updated":1481764126,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501108646392822266","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw08eBgNkCdqmhbA=="}
