      /><br><br>Bakery Biz Tycoon is a tycoon game where the player begins his adventure
      becoming an entrepreneur and runs a bakery delivered from his grandfather in
      the city of Middelton. Initially, the player has a small bakery and the amount
      of cash to dispose. <br><br><br>And with time, along with the development of  his
      bakery, taking care of acquiring new customers and expanding his stores, the
      player gains new opportunities. In the future, the player will be able to expand
      his company with new and larger bakeries, which will significantly increase
      production possibilities. And by introducing new products to its offer, it can
      increase revenues in such stores and thus increase its profits. The player also
      has marketing campaigns at his disposal, which can significantly affect the
      number of customers in the player's stores. The number of customers and by the
      volume of sales can also be influenced by high-quality products, thanks to which
      the player can win occasional bakery festivals that take place from time to
      time. <br><br>And with such a strong position, the player can conquer new markets
      in other cities, creating their warehouses and new stores there. On the other
      hand, however, the player has full freedom in action. It can focus on the production
      of the cheapest products and reach as many customers as possible. <br><br><img

      thanks to which the player has an influence on the production costs and on the
      product's opinion <br></li><li> Opportunity to participate in events such as

      /><br><br>The game itself is designed so that in each of the &quot;modules&quot;
      I can add functions and add depth to game features. And so far, the game does
      not yet contain all the functions and mechanics that I would like to see in
      this game. But mainly add depth to the production mechanics about production
      lines. Whether as part of the purchase of &quot;technology&quot; or building
      your own production line. I also think a lot about the introduction of the logistics
      module. It would be naturally connected to the warehouse. This would allow the
      introduction of delivery elements to the game. Purchase of delivery vehicles
      and possible plans for the supply stores. And that would probably be my biggest
      ideas for adding content. In the meantime, I will want to add new minor functions
      and improvements like a bank and other smaller features whcih will balance gameplay.<br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">A Few Words From the Author</h2><br>By creating Bakery
      Biz Tycoon, my main goal was to create a title that will relate to old school
      tycoon games. In which the player has to focus more on the macro of managing
      the enterprise than on micro-management or time management. I tried to create
      a more complex production than typical Time Management games, but simple enough
      for the time spent with Bakery Biz Tycoon to be fun. And I wish all this and
      I hope that my first game will give you at least a few hours of pleasant gameplay.
