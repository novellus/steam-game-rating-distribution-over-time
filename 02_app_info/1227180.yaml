      \ Isle is a exploration strategy card game.\_You are a hero who's ship has crashed\
      \ while sailing to the capital. You wake up on this Island that has been covered\
      \ in a mist for months, but the villagers do not know whats causing it. Due\
      \ to the protruding stones in the sea and the razor sharp reef no ships can\
      \ leave nor enter. So for you to get off this island you must discover what\
      \ is causing the mist and stop it. So you explore the island doing quests for\
      \ villagers, looking for treasure, solving puzzles and fighting monsters when\
      \ outside the village. Fights are a card game, your deck of cards is based on\
      \ your items you have equipped. You can get new items by buying them at the\
      \ marketplace defeating unique enemies or by exploration. The damage you receive\
      \ at the end of a fight stays with you unless you can heal before the next fight,\
      \ so don't stay out from the village too long or you might not make it back.<h2\
