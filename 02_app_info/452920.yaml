    review: 'tl;dr A groovy game which requires bullet conservation and a whole lot
      of time! A game that everyone who is a fan of Bullet Hell games should pick
      up!


      Pros:

      -Good music

      -Orignal mechanics

      -Asthetically pleasing

      -Well priced

      -Decent powerups

      -Addicting

      -Endless mode! (replayable)


      Neutrals: (mostly facts)

      -not enough enemies (a good possibility is that I have not got far enough)

      -bullet hell

      -brightly colored

      -groovy


      Cons:

      -No sensitivity option that I could find (sensitivity i think was pulled straight
      from my mouse so it was fine!)

      -no graphics options

      -i died and i almost broke my headset.

      -camera angle is RARELY off'
