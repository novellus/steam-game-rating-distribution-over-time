Made with free Unity assets and feels and plays like this developer tried to lazily follow some Unity platformer tutorial and messed it all up and went ahead and exported it to sell here anyway.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yutqcSBjVds\n\nThe games most basic control DOES NOT WORK!  You press left mouse to jump, but it FAILS to work most of the time which results in quick frustration and your quick demise.\n\nStay away.  Stay far away.  Terrible game and code made with nothing but free unity assets with NO attempt to make a fun game to play or give you a good value for your money.\n\n","timestamp_created":1558893904,"timestamp_updated":1558893904,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.690378785133361816","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiKjU+uoCcKyGwgE="}
