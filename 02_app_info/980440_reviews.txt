Being developed with Godot, while irrelevant to the gameplay itself, I was intrigued and happy to try it even more, since I like the engine and its community.\n\nHowever with the current implementation, unfortunately this is pretty much where the excitement ends.\n\nFirst, the game does not support controllers. Which means even for local-coop, we have to cramp ourselves over the keyboard. Secon,d the control buttons are really hard to manage. And with co-op, we were literally pushing each other's hands away.\n\nThe gameplay itself is also slow paced. Combat system is boring as welll and very repetitive. Timing the high jumps to reach higher and further areas is a struggle that isn't the fun kind. In fact it was one of those long jumps that made us decide to stop.\n\nI understand this is early access, but the promised upcoming features all don't touch on what I listed here, so I'm afraid they won't be fixed. I really wanted to like this game, and I applaud the developer for this wonderful concept. I hope he can expand on it and provide better gameplay experience. But until then, this game is more like an experimental concept prototype.","timestamp_created":1548175207,"timestamp_updated":1548175207,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4pd2bu+gCeZr9uAE="}
