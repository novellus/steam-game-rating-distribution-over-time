    review: "Okay... Magix software in general is one of those things that you either\
      \ click with or you don't. I like it because it allows me to do some the things\
      \ the big expensive software does at a much smaller price tag (Hitfile, vegas\
      \ etc). Overall Video Deluxe 2020 is a improvement from the version 2018 I am\
      \ coming from. It still has issues and its still a bit of a dog on playback\
      \ even at 8 times faster???? But it is improved somewhat. Overall I would give\
      \ it a solid 4.5 stars outta five. Just beware Magix will make you work for\
      \ the quality this is no simple one button push to get what you want. \n\nThe\
      \ software does what I need it to and that is what matters most to me. Overall\
      \ it's a decent video software package and this version should work well for\
      \ your basic video needs (youtube, family vidoes, etc). I would once again warn\
      \ against longer movie length editing with it (over 1+ hour or so)."
