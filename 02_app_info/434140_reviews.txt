And i also get the following error message so the likes when playing for more than 10 min.\n___________________________________________\n############################################################################################\nFATAL ERROR in\naction number 1\nof Alarm Event for alarm 3\nfor object obj_controller:\n\nVariable obj_slot.ToolBox(100213, -2147483648) not set before reading it.\nat gml_Script_scr_SavePlayerInventory\n############################################################################################\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nstack frame is\ngml_Script_scr_SavePlayerInventory (line 0)\ngml_Script_scr_savegame\ngml_Object_obj_controller_Alarm_3\n\nWhich is quite annoying when you cant play the game more than 10 min. without it chashing.\nBut i remain hopeful that the game will be polished and finished and it may be worth playing and buying when finished.\nBut i will keep my eyes open for updates on the game and will update as needed. But so far i dont think the game to be worth it YET, but keep it in the back of your mind and wait for it to be finished before buying.\nI do also apologize in advance since english is not my first language, and i am not the best at writing.\n","timestamp_created":1515274315,"timestamp_updated":1515274315,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57358086109161377","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4z+TY5uACc62jlQE="}
