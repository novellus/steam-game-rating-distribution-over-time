    review: 'I bought it because a lot of community puzzles did not work for me and
      the advertisement kept popping up. I thought: Oh well, If I want to play contraption
      maker at all, I need this.


      Actually, this DLC adds a new dimension to the game. A second "plane" where
      you can only place wonderstruct parts. Whatever is on the second plane does
      not collide with the first and default plane, so you can imagine them as running
      in parallel. The only way to move parts from one to another, is via special
      s-bend pipes that has one end in one layer, and one in the other. Wonderstruct
      parts can still be placed on your default plane, so no need to worry. What IS
      worrysome, is the fact that this applies only to the parts added by the DLC.
      If a non-dlc part tries to go through the plane s-bend pipe, it simply does
      not switch, which can lead to interesting "sorting" intersections where you
      can just make all wonderstruct marbles go down one path, and everything else
      on another.


      Another fun mechanism is the "wonderstruct switch" which is simply an intersection
      that switches itself as marbles go through. Every second marble goes onto an
      alternative route. There is a puzzle involving only this mechanism, where you
      have to set the switches up, so that the balls sort out between two baskets.


      However, there are only a few puzzles and none of them is really challenging.
      They merely introduce the mechansims.


      In my opinion, this DLC is a must-own for anyone and it really adds something
      refreshing to Contraption Maker unlike those free updates.'
