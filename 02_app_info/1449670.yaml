      notes: 'This game is set in the 1930s; it attempts to address some issues of
        that time, including sexism and racism, and highlights the harm, toxicity,
        and lies of far right ideology, segregation, and other such issues. Throughout,
        Nazis espousing racist ideology are countered and condemned by the protagonists.
        There are also some sensitive scenes describing violence against minority
        characters that was unfortunately typical of that time period. '

    review: 'First let me start by saying that all of the current world issues that
      some may feel are relatable to this story, are saddly not the authors fault,
      but our failure as a society.  All the ugliness that we can shamefully still
      relate to today, were definetly present in the time period as presented in this
      game.  The fact that they are still raising their ugly heads and afflicting
      millions of people in our society today is not the authors fault.  That being
      said, if reminders of the historical roots of current modern day racism and
      hatred bother you, you would do well to skip this one.


      For myself I found the story line to have moments of intense action and interest,
      and then other moments of long drawn out situations I really wasnt expecting
      or wanting to read/play through.  There are alot of different genres covered
      in this story, everything from high adventure ala Indiana Jones, to Private
      detective / clue finding / case solving (part I least enjoyed) to Romance (i
      didnt find a good match for me in this one, the only available male character
      (that wasnt already involved with someone else) was a no no for me.  After he
      killed a second person right infront of me I had zero interest in helping him
      in anyway and certainly didnt want to persue any kind of a relationship with
      him,) To Combat Simulator / Survival.  The whole combat part bothered me alot
      as for the first part of the game I was always presented with and chose non
      lethal options that worked for a good portion of the game.  The suddenly after
      I start being upset about a companion Im with turning around and needlessly
      killing people, the MC starts killing people too, without ever asking me if
      I was willing / wanting to do that.  From there on the MC ends up killing dozens
      and dozens of people, with me having to choose how Im going to go about doing
      it.  Its all in self defense, for the most part, although there are several
      times where you can choose to kill because you want to, sometimes the MC would
      just turn around and kill some one all on their own.  It left me feeling very
      unhappy.  I had a real hard time trying to juxtapose a story line where the
      ugliness of one group of people towards other groups was a running theme, at
      the same time I was being asked to handle situations where I was responding
      to violence, with extreme violence / killing of my own.

      All in All I think if your not triggered by historically accurate depictions
      of racism, and If you dont have any qualms with killing lots and lots of people
      in a fictional narrative, you will find a long and varied story line to read
      though.  If you do find either of those things disturbing though, your going
      to want to find something else to read.'
