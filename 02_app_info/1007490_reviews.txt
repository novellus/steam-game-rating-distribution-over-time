The environments are decent, I like the music, and there are enough characters to play.\n\nHOWEVER, it is currently unplayable. The character weapons are floating outside their hands, the camera has no lock-on feature, the controls are janky, and all character movements/actions are clunky. The hitboxes make no sense. After 12 minutes, I was ready to write a review saying this game isn't ready yet and needs more development time.\n\nI then checked and saw this is an actual release, not Early Access. This game isn't ready. I won't say it's terrible, because I still want to like it, but it is completely unplayable.\n\nI'd almost recommend trying it, if only to see how unfinished it is. I wish the developers well, and hopefully next time they'll be allowed more development time.","timestamp_created":1609626295,"timestamp_updated":1609626295,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rYPN4vYCfoTwvwI="}
