    review: 'It''s an okay short horror walking simulator, it has a good atmosphere,
      but turn down the volume, in some scenes the game is way too loud for no good
      reason.

      The story is actually quite nice, but it isn''t fully explained in the game,
      it only makes sense after reading the devopers comment, which I copied for you
      below and marked as a spoiler. Obviously only read it after finishing the game.


      I can recommend the game if you like shorter walking simulator games and can
      get it on sale, since it''s like 2 hours for a playthrough.

      Achievement hunters beware: some achievements seem to be broken and you can''t
      get them, this didn''t bother me personally


      Developers comment on the story: [spoiler] Christopher Adams is a journalist,
      writing stories and trying to sell them off for a profit. In order to increase
      the value of his stories he''ll take events and spice them up to make them more
      interesting. In the case of Valerie, a girl who was mentally ill and being cared
      for by her father, Adams decides to add imprisonment and incest. In the case
      of Jame Reed, a man trapped in a collapsed mine with some friends who ended
      up dying from starvation, he added murder and cannibalism. And in the case of
      Jean Jowars Remens, where a group of cancer patients decided to end their lives
      rather than go through the suffering of life, he decided to add a suicide cult.


      In the game you are presented with Adams version of events, rather than reality.
      And he become hunted by the monsters he created. In the end, the voice of the
      entity that is forcing this punishment on you takes matters into its own hands
      and walks you through your mistake. Ending all of it simply by telling you that
      your punishment is not yet over. Adam walks down the stairs, and the game ends
