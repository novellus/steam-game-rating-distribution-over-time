I created an NPC, imported a map, and  created an encounter on the map. My friends and I have been looking for something like this for years. We've messed around with other adventuring software and character creators, including the virtual tabletop and other web tools Wizards of the Coast briefly developed, and this demo puts everything we've used to shame. When I think of all the money we spent on books, adventures, and website subscriptions I would gladly take it all back and sink every dime of it into Fantasy Grounds.","timestamp_created":1486791868,"timestamp_updated":1506836004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511430442333221436","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwypeb694Cd5jqcQ=="}
