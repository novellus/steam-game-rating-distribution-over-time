It's pretty much like if Nuclear Throne was an arcade game and was, uh, a lot more repetitive... That said, I have an unreasonably high tolerance for repetition, and there is a lot of upgrade paths and weapon choices you can take every run. I'm pretty sure I'm like the only person out of like the twelve people who've bought this game that has played it a semi-significant amount, so I figured I might as well fill the empty void in the reviews section with my own thoughts.\n\nPROS:\n- Base gameplay is pretty fun, with gunplay and dodging reminiscent of stuff like Nuclear Throne and Enter the Gungeon as you defend against hordes of varied enemies\n- 20 weapons that are each unique, interesting, and effective\n- Each enemy fulfills a distinct role and is fun to fight\n- Most upgrades feel significant, you can make it through all waves of a level using pretty much any upgrade combo\n- The music and art's pretty good! [strike]Art could definitely be improved though, but I'm just nitpicking[/strike]\n\nCONS:\n- The enemies that spawn at each wave are entirely the same across levels and runs (and if that's not the case, then it certainly feels like it), and the same is true for hard mode (though the wave roster in hard mode is different from normal mode)\n- While each enemy fills a unique role, there's, uh, only 8 types? [spoiler]Well, nine including a final boss I haven't encountered yet, judging by the OST[/spoiler]\n- Unlocking the fifth secret stage is an extreme pain in the butt; [spoiler]I haven't actually unlocked it myself, but I'm assuming you have to beat all four base stages in a row on hard mode without dying, which is complicated by the addition of curse crowns after beating each stage... Combined with the game's usual repetition, it's borderline infuriating[/spoiler]\n- Certain projectiles can be quite hard to see at times; they're light purple with barely any outlines, and when combined with all of the erratically moving, saturated sprites flying around the screen at any given time... oof.\n- You never have any invincibility frames, not even during dodging. Typically it's not a major problem, though when combined with the aforementioned problem, it's just... bleh...\n\nOverall, if I had to use two words to describe Lot'zAmonsters, it's \"pretty good.\" Nothing is super-duper exceptional by any means, but it's just a fun romp. Now that I think about it, it's more like a 2D Devil Daggers; it's fun, it takes a lot of skill to get far, but it can get really, really monotonous after a while","timestamp_created":1543777349,"timestamp_updated":1543777349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517702102661132813","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1545362023,"developer_response":"Thanks for your review i really the same way about the game nowdays ,nothing exeptional but i hope you had a good time!"}],"cursor":"AoJ42J2TuOcCc72ltAE="}
