    about_the_game: 'Are you ready for Hogo OS 1985 Edition? Hey, it isn''t 1984 anymore!
      Time to trade in your dad''s operating system for the next generation of computing
      technology!<h2 class="bb_tag">UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY</h2><br>In the mid-1980s,
      the Hogo computer operating system was considered the next big thing. It powered
      cutting-edge computers by providing stunning color displays, generating amazing
      sound, and supporting huge 426x240 pixel display monitors. It really was the
      future.<br><br>And then practically overnight, Hogo OS disappeared.<br><br>What
      happened is one of the biggest mysteries of the 1980s. Rumors say that an evil
      mastermind attempted to use Hogo OS to take over the world, and was only stopped
      by the bumbling actions of a complete idiot. Those rumors are true.<br><br>The
      year is 1985. And you are that idiot.<h2 class="bb_tag">A FULL OPERATING SYSTEM
      EXPERIENCE FROM 1985</h2><br>Dum-Dum is equally a simulator and an adventure
      game. You must solve puzzles and decipher clues to uncover its secrets.<br><br>The
      interface is a full simulation of a fictional computer operating system: Hogo
      OS 1985 Edition. It includes everything you''d expect to find on a computer
      from 1985. Numerous games like Solitaire 1985 and Hogoworm Dungeon. Creativity
      applications like Animator and Piano Composer. Digital books, interactive stories,
      and features to customize your desktop. There''s even a simple working BASIC
      programming language.<br><br>But digging a little deeper will uncover new secrets,
      hidden activities, and quests. Part of the fun is exploring and uncovering the
      many programs and features of Hogo OS.<br><br>Ultimately, the main story requires
      you to figure out how to best use the Hogo operating system to solve a puzzling
      mystery. Hogo OS 1985 Edition is your key to interacting with quirky characters,
      uncovering the strange history of the Hogo Company, and saving the world.<br><br>Or...you
      can ignore the main story for awhile &amp; just enjoy the open-ended sandbox
      gameplay. That evil mastermind isn''t going anywhere.<h2 class="bb_tag">OFFICIAL

    review: 'This is going to be my first ever review on here, so I''ll try to keep
      things simple. Dum-Dum succeeds in being both an OS Simulator, and a full fledged
      adventure game in its own right. You take on the role of an everyday person
      who unknowingly uncovers a sinister plot lurking beneath the Hogo Company. Turns
      out, there''s more than just computer manufacturing going on, and YOU are the
      only one who can help the employees.


      In between various story scenes and puzzles, you are free to play around on
      the in-game desktop however you like! It really does feel authentic. Plenty
      of games and applications including Solitaire, an animation tool, 3-D mazes...
      there''s even E-books! At the time of this review, the developer is currently
      working on adding more content to the game via free update patches.


      If you''re into computer history, or Sci-fi, give Dum-Dum a go!'
