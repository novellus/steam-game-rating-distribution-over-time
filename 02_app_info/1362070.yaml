    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The year is 4335.</h2> You are one of few\
      \ remaining United States refugees from the Great Solar Evacuation. You wear\
      \ the flag of a country that was shelled out of existence nearly two kilo-years\
      \ ago on Earth. The then CCCP won the space race. With the ability to control\
      \ nearly all of space, it allowed them to influence economies and start conflicts.\
      \ In a ten year period after the first landing on Mars, the CCCP declared war\
      \ on its parent country, and then the world. Sides were taken, and bombs were\
      \ dropped from outer space. CCCP and it\u2019s allies were able to obliterate\
      \ the majority of the opposition. This alliance of tyrannical world-killers\
      \ was renamed the Federation a few hundred years later. Only after the first\
      \ interstellar colonies were sent to a nearby solar system was the invention\
      \ of sub-light speed travel. The Federation rules most of space in the current\
      \ year. However, during the Great Evacuation of 2110 remaining freedom forces\
      \ were able to commandeer a CCCP ship and plunge into outer space. You\u2019\
      ve inherited the responsibility of your ancestors to preserve the history of\
      \ the United States. In the current year, the freedom fighters have but only\
      \ a small planet with the technological advancement comparable to prewar. Up\
      \ against the universe controlling giant, the US Freedom Fighters are unable\
      \ to mount any offensives. The USFF has taken great care, and nearly insurmountable\
      \ risk to put you in your current position. You are born American and belong\
      \ to the USFF, but you are a member of the Federation. You will stance yourself\
      \ so that, upon your activation, you can return to Lazarus with the intelligence\
      \ and tools needed to bring the Federation to its knees.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\

      \ throughout an entire solar system without loading screens. From the blackness\
      \ of outer space to boots-on-the-ground, the entire universe is simulated without\
      \ scene transitions!<br>Land on terrestrial planets, some as big as 530,000,000,000\
      \ meters in surface area. Fly the rings of massive gas giants and see the aurora\
      \ over planets never yet discovered by man - all in your quest to cripple the\
      \ Federation. Travel from system to system through gargantuan holes, and experience\
      \ the gravity of a billion suns. See the specs of light fly by your windscreen\
      \ and know they represent an American future yet to hold and a past never to\
      \ forget.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Station Based Economy</h2>Buy and sell resources,\
      \ ships, and people at stations scattered across many solar systems. Use your\
      \ knowledge of specific systems to fill a gap in the supply of certain items\
      \ to advance yourself economically. Commit yourself to Federal missions, to\
      \ gain standing at those stations for economic and political benefit.<h2 class=\"\

      \ ring asteroids like geodes. Pick the right rock and strike gold, pick the\

      \ local station. Increase your standing at stations by interacting with them\
      \ economically.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat in Space</h2>Equip yourself to stand\
      \ up against any foe. Train yourself to use your ship\u2019s maneuverability\
      \ to your advantage. Commit yourself to the elimination of space pirates, rebel\
      \ against the system authorities, and grow your wealth and influence.<h2 class=\"\
