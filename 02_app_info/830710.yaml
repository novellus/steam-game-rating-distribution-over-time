    review: "Game took me 80 Minutes to beat, it scared the shit outta me, made me\
      \ laugh, got me hella confused, bit annoyed and welp... semi interested into\
      \ the story. It has a nice little story which I won't talk about but I can say\
      \ that it's quite easily predictable.\n\nPros:\n- short little game for small\
      \ price (even tho 5 Euro could b 2 much for some people)\n- scary game, sometimes\
      \ predictable jumpscares with loud af noise but they worked on me\n- nice voice\
      \ actors (except skinny and fat baldie lol)\n- nice little puzzles which were\
      \ quite easy to solve, if you were lookin around the house (except the safe\
      \ section)\n- good performance, no crashes (duh, imagine fps drops with such\
      \ game)\n\nContra: \n- clunky movement\n- unfortunate camera placement during\
      \ 'cutscenes'\n- jumpscares r way tooooo loud at times\n- predictable (yet nice\
      \ little) story\n- very short game (60-80 minutes if you r as slow and scared\
      \ as me)\n- NO SETTINGS?\n\nNeutral:\n- funny, slow, clunky character animations\
      \ (got me laughing a lot, thx for that)\n- simplistic low budget graphics but\
      \ I didnt care about that, otherwise I would've not bought the game"
