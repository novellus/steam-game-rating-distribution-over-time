This dlc in particular can be polarizing with the academy now being a separate faction acting on their own, but the prospect of the abilities offered can add a fresh change up of the game. the new race is ok**. The they feel like an early game bully faction that starts off strong with tech, but are handicapped for the rest of the game in science until you've gathered enough relics. God forbid you go up against the soprons who will eventually dust you in science and can easily overtake you, the Nakalim falls flat later in the game. This dlc was patched and fixed so the academy isnt so aggressive now, and just adds more to adapting to the situation (which is good), and if nothing else, just turn off the content or mod it. The devs did what they could to remedy the situation and i believe they did fix the more obvious problems, so id give it a chance on a STEEP discount. this is so far below the asking price","timestamp_created":1609438267,"timestamp_updated":1609438267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542026698589324951","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45+D/3PYCeP+VvwI="}
