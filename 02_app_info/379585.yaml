    review: "This DLC does not work! The instructions dont work - If you have orbx\
      \ Northern CA then dont buy! looking forward to this and instead got junkware\
      \ -\n\nUpdate: this is Cielosim palo alto airport that from the screens looks\
      \ good. It doesnt appear to be compatible with ORBX northern california. It\
      \ is FSX and people are jumping ship for other sims but I can say it does not\
      \ work well with orbx. \n\nDoveetail support answered my request for support\
      \ by closing the ticket after never (NEVER) sending me any suggestions on how\
      \ to fix. That really makes me want to skip flight sim world. If this is how\
      \ you treat paying customers you will shorlty find yourself economically hurt.\
      \ You can do better dovetail."
