The introduction to the story is compelling...but the core gameplay loop kind of sucks. Okay great I'm looking for evidence, I'm knocking people out or shooting them...but there's never this BIG aha moment where things get truly exciting or engaging. The game as a whole just sort of rides on this one-note premise, and the intermittent loudspeaker blurts start to become really annoying after a while. The lack of variety present in the game makes this a hard NO for me personally.","timestamp_created":1601844050,"timestamp_updated":1601844050,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525891244411468506","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhY/W+vQCfvPzpQI="}
