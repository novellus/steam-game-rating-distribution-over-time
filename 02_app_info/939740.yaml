      notes: In the game, there will be some pictures showing the zombies eating and
        attacking the player, or the possibility of the player being scared. Before
        entering the game, players should make sure they are able to withstand the
        frightening or horror scenes, and to confirm the safety of the surrounding
        environment when starting the game, so as not to risk inadvertently during
        the game.
