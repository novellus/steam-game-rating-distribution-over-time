For example it will be word \"bullet\" then you must in required game mode make and destroy this word.\n\nThings go rapidly downhill from there. For example, why would you include numbers in a word game? You're trying to spell words, and then the number 2 shows up. Huh?\n\nJust a sloppy 'game.' This is in the territory of being a scam.","timestamp_created":1570812477,"timestamp_updated":1570812477,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1573739416,"developer_response":"\nThank for you review.\nColud you please explain, what do you meen by 'For example, why would you include numbers in a word game? You're trying to spell words, and then the number 2 shows up.'\nWhere did you see numbers? On the circles, alongside with the letters, from which you need to make words ?\nAlso, was it arabic number, like '2'?\nis it possible, that you misplace number with letter in Braille's alphabet (this is one of game modes)?\nI'm asking because i definetely didn't include numbers alongside letters, and i didn't get such a bug during testing and playing.\nAlso, if you have screenshots with the numbers, could you please send it to lettersettergame@gmail.com"}],"cursor":"AoJ45Ifu3e0Cfo320wE="}
