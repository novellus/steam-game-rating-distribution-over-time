Even after years and years of using Microsoft Excel, I still came away with new \"stuff\" -- for example, adding backgrounds to spreadsheets, using the Format Painter to apply styles to other cells or ranges, and the ability to find/replace data as well as apply formatting to the replaced data.  There are a few other productivity tips as well.\n\nWho knew you could add color to workbook tabs?  Awesome!\n\nSmartArt?  Never heard of it until taking this course.  Awesome!\n\nOne minor gripe is with the interface.  It's a bit more specific than I would have liked.  For example, when clicking on elements or dragging and dropping items, you have to be very careful about where you click or the program will ask you to try again. \n\nOverall, a great program for those people new to Excel or needing a quick review.","timestamp_created":1503786023,"timestamp_updated":1503786023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5932961106300354","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hbeokN4CcaLVgwE="}
