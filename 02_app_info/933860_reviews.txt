However, there was no story, and no real logic to why certain objects needed to be used in specific places. It was the classic inventory puzzle game, where your main goal is to collect items and figure out how/where they go. There's no reason given for why you are doing this, and the graphics are very limited. Movement also is very stilted (it's a point and click game, though, so it's fine if you go in with that mindset). It would be great if these developers could turn this little snippet into an actual game--a fully-realized world, with more areas to explore, more puzzles, and a narrative. Without those things, it's really not even worth $4---I couldn't see spending more than $2 on this game, given that you can beat it in 20 minutes or so (my Steam play time shows longer, but I had the game minimized because I got bored).","timestamp_created":1609812808,"timestamp_updated":1609812865,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/t2U6PYCfNXJwAI="}
