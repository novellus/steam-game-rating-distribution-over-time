It has progressed much since last year i played for the first time.\nThose of who gives a negative review you might have not read producers note properly, that they initially reluctant to make this public because they were aware of the issues. but they had to make this game public because they need funds to keep on developing the game. Which also shows they dont want to give up on this game, this is obviously seen from the updates.\nSo dont come here venting out your anger by giving a negative review thus may destroy a nice game with decent potentials.\n\n\nstill some things to expect: \n1, being a game at test stage, bug and crashes are expected. I encounted 2 fatal error crash in 32min of game time.\n2, the game needs optimization. it is pretty leggy for an unreal engine game.\n3, I dont really see the need to introduce dx12 compatibility. the framedrop of dx12 introduced outweights the improvement of graphics.\nother than these for the price it is till very good if you enjoy games like Conan or Ark.","timestamp_created":1588437492,"timestamp_updated":1608457521,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501140058040618896","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ49sDiv/YCdauKhQI="}
