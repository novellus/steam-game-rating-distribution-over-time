Generally pretty janky, but totally playable.\n\nBUT it was a fun way to spend an hour and I want to encourage more games like this. If the sequel hook ends up leading somewhere, this could turn into something genuinely great.\n\nALSO though, PLEASE for the love of god make separate and erasable savefiles in a game with a story progression. Just thinking from a speedrunner's perspective, would be cool to be able to start fresh and do an \"all challenge\" run, not just all levels.","timestamp_created":1607983802,"timestamp_updated":1607983802,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6bTTsfYCeoefugI="}
