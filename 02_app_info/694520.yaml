      \ he <i>thinks</i>. But as life throws him hurdles and challenges in the form\
      \ of a rival group and a looming deadline for the auditions for an international\
      \ game competition, Jun realizes that he has to adjust to this terrifyingly\
      \ new stage. <br><br>Will he manage to solve all his problems using this \u2018\
      ability\u2019 of his, or will he be forced to accept that perhaps everything\
