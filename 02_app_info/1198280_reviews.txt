The guide is quite basic so you may have to search on the internet for a more detailed one, but this DLC does its job in including a guide and the entire digital artbook. It also features some notes from the developers and the artist; Azukichan.\n\n\n[b]Score:[/b] 7/10 GOOD","timestamp_created":1598674081,"timestamp_updated":1598674081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ztKZnPQCf5a5ngI="}
