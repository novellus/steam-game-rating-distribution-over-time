You have the ability to transform your ship into a slower-moving but faster firing warrior mode.  And there are whole bunch of new enemy types to contend with.  one of the nicest features in the game is the ability to change the game speed to suit your level of play.\n\nKeep up the great work Hijong!","timestamp_created":1604790044,"timestamp_updated":1604790044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1pi80vUCcv+BrQI="}
