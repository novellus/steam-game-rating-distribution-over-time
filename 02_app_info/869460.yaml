    about_the_game: "A maze type puzzle game where the player(s) have to navigate\
      \ two mice (Lame &amp; Cheesy) through a series of obstacles and traps. The\
      \ game can be played as a co-op, with each player controlling one mouse, or\
      \ as a single player, where one player controls both mice with one controller\
      \ or keyboard. Both mice are required for solving every puzzle. The player(s)\
      \ will use the mice to interact with buttons, switches, moveable boxes, mouse\
      \ wheels, etc., in order to activate objects of the level that will allow them\
      \ to make it closer to the end of the stage. These level objects may be raisable\
      \ platforms that will act as a bridge to pass over a sink full of acid, or a\
      \ door that opens a path into the next part of the level. Plan accordingly though;\
      \ a misstep could leave you stuck with no way out at all. <br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe level is riddled with various colors and objects. After a few minutes\
      \ of play, you will quickly see how those colors and objects interact with one\
      \ another. One colored object is an input device that sends a signal to all\
      \ of the corresponding colored output objects. In short, a red button will active\
      \ a red door, or a yellow mouse wheel might activate a yellow platform, and\
      \ so on. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is designed to challenge the players dexterity,\
      \ hand &amp; eye coordination, logic processes and decision making. There are\
      \ a variety of mechanics available to the player that will help them solve their\
      \ way deeper into the puzzle. Lame &amp; Cheesy is optimized to allow the player\
      \ to solve the puzzles in their own unique way. Most levels have multiple solutions\
      \ but will also only have one optimum solution. This allows the player to test\
      \ their problem-solving skills by trying to decrease the time it takes for them\
      \ to get through each level. Players can also see where their times stack up\
      \ against other players."
