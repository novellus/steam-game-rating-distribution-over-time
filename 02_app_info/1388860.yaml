      overcome challenging puzzles and move forward in a thriller story</strong> where
      image, sound and interactive functions are carefully interwoven into the narrative.<br><br>The
      result is an experience that tests your ability to solve a mystery, but above

      who is tracking down the man who murdered his girlfriend, a member of a band
      of lady thieves. The difficulty, however, of locating the murderer is compounded
      by the fact that he suffers from a rare, untreatable form of memory loss.  Using
      notes, pictures and recorded messages he will have to solve the mystery and
      maybe, just maybe, discover an uncomfortable truth in this <strong>thriller
