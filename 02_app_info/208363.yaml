    about_the_game: "The Flying Scotsman is one of the most famous locomotives in\
      \ the world, and you can drive this beautiful steamer on your own railway lines\
      \ in Train Simulator. <br><br><br>The Flying Scotsman has become a legend of\
      \ the rail world. Destined for fame from the very beginning, Flying Scotsman\
      \ entered service in 1923 as the figurehead of the Kings Cross to Edinburgh\
      \ express service, and has since broken numerous records including being the\
      \ first steam locomotive to top 100mph, way back in 1934. Designed by Sir Nigel\
      \ Gresley, this 97-ton A3-class locomotive has remained an icon, hauling express\
      \ passenger trains for 40 years and remaining incredibly busy even after retirement.\
      \ Flying Scotsman has toured the world, breaking more records along the way,\
      \ and over 80 years after entering service is in the care of the National Railway\
      \ Museum in York, UK. Flying Scotsman for Train Simulator includes the famous\
