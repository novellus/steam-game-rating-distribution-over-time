It was neat then and still is. Some people complain about the paddle being controlled by the HMD instead of your hands but you can grip the controllers and get two rackets to use instead. In fact, the best way to play this game is to keep switching back and forth between the two control schemes in real time, using whichever is better for that exact moment the ball is coming at you. I also like that your progress is saved No need to get levels and levels deep only to have to start from the very beginning next time. A classic VR game that's also a pretty cool way to introduce someone to VR that isn't a hardcore gamer. \n\nNote: If you're playing using the controllers make sure you have a decent amount of space around you and above you. You will need to dive left and right and make overhand swings just like as if you were playing tennis. If you don't have enough room then stick with moving your head to control the paddle.","timestamp_created":1597005225,"timestamp_updated":1597005225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wru76vMCcZK8mgI="}
