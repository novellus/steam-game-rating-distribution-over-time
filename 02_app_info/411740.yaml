    review: 'The controls are tight enough, but that''s only if you have something
      like Antimicro active.  The claims of full controller support are false, even
      with Steam''s controller configuration options.


      This is a collectathon type game with a HUGE amount of unnecessary trolls.  The
      level design is really lousy with them.  I''m talking about VERY hard to see
      spike traps and falling blocks that blend in perfectly with the background.  WAY
      too many unfair deaths.  This game is not fun.  X('
