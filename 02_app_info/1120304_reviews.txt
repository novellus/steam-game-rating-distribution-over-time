I have T.Flight Hotas 4 Blue and it works great in DCS, except in THIS module. The Joystick part works, Throttle is unrecognized??? My hotas is one system, connected by 1 usb wire. And I couldn't Program the axes in options either! I also encountered Thrust issue (had to use the mouse) where even just flying straight and level in free flight is impossible and I'm losing speed, even at full power. Yes, I tried different mixtures and different propeller settings. No Luck. Also, airplane kept tilting left no matter what I did with the trim (even went all the way) and it made 0 difference.\nAfter purchasing, testing, and encountering these issues i UNINSTALLED RIGHT AWAY specifically to be (BY FAR) within the 2hr Steam refund limit. Nevertheless Steam denied refund claiming... 5hr 3min use? That is FALSE. Yes, I played the game itself, but module was UNINSTALLED.\n\nBEWARE: MAY HAVE ISSUES.\n\nModel itself LOOKS very good but FOR ME it was COMPLETELY UNFLYABLE. Disappointed.","timestamp_created":1610008137,"timestamp_updated":1610008137,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40tH97fYCdKGcwQI="}
