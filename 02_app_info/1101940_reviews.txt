Seemed like it might be interesting. but I couldn't get through enough of it because of the extremely clunky interface:\n- The action buttons appear to the side of the cursor, which is offputting. Makes it seem like there's an issue, but it's actually designed that way.\n- The mouse sensitivity is extremely high, and there is no way to change it.\n- Every action has the same sound effect. It gets really annoying really fast.\n- Volume issues in cutscenes - music is super loud, can barely hear speech.\n- There's no way to skip the startup cutscene, and it's pretty long. If you do play this, do it in one sitting.\n\nI'm an avid fan of HOGs and have played and enjoyed a lot that had mediocre interfaces. This one is pretty bad. I'll just go read the book it's based on instead for the story.","timestamp_created":1583792261,"timestamp_updated":1583792441,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46tjY4PACcp2Q9wE="}
