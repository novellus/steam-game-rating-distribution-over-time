    review: "Super Blackjack Battle 2 Turbo Edition - The Card Warriors is an obvious\
      \ homage to Street Fighter II, but set in the world of competitive blackjack.\
      \ It's an interesting mix of the two and in theory, a pretty alluring concept.\
      \ Unfortunately, it fails where it counts most. \n\nGraphically, I enjoy the\
      \ pixelation and obvious references to Street Fighter II, from the character\
      \ select screen, versus screen, victory screen and all the various portraits\
      \ of the characters that accompany these. The backgrounds of the levels are\
      \ limited in FOV but what you can see of them makes each level distinctly unique.\
      \ The music attempts a retro feel that doesn't sound bad. Completing the single\
      \ player nets you an artwork finale akin to SFII's. Shout out for giving us\
      \ legit endings versus the trash you get for beating Street Fighter V's arcade\
      \ mode. The story is negligible; there's some sort of story going on related\
      \ to the mafia that kind of mirrors Street Fighter II's story but it's even\
      \ less refined.\n\nOn the surface, this is pretty cool. The gameplay, though,\
      \ is where the game bombs. I haven't played online, just single player, but\
      \ this mode is busted. In it, you play 10 rounds of blackjack against the dealer\
      \ at the same time your opponent does. After 10 rounds, whoever has the most\
      \ money, wins. Alternatively, if someone busts out, their opponent wins. While\
      \ this sounds fine - and indeed, there's nothing inherently wrong with this\
      \ - the enemy AI is a complete moron. That isn't to say they won't win hands,\
      \ but they definitely don't bother playing strategically, either against the\
      \ dealer or when it comes to betting against you. Here's a couple examples of\
      \ what I've seen:\n\n- AI will routinely \"hit\" on 20, no matter what the dealer\
      \ is showing. I've seen the dealer show a 2 and the AI has hit on 20. Note,\
      \ this tends to only happen if the AI hits on their first turn.\n- AI went into\
      \ the 8th round of a match with $8,800 and me at $950. AI bet $8,700, lost and\
      \ subsequently lost the entire match 2 rounds later when they otherwise had\
      \ a 100% of winning.\n\nSo, naturally, as some other reviews have pointed out,\
      \ the game devolves into just betting $50 every round and letting the AI opponent\
      \ do themselves in. It's not fool proof - the AI can get streaks of luck and\
      \ walk away winning - but in a typical single player game, I'd say it works\
      \ about 85% of the time. There may be one match, two at the most, that you'll\
      \ have to redo, but otherwise, it's a strategy that works just as well as actually\
      \ trying to win the most money, if not better. There's also some bad gameplay\
      \ issues that have been reported, such as an AAK constituting a bust instead\
      \ of a 12. You can also double down at any point in your turn, not just your\
      \ first action. If you can stomach all this, the replayability is relatively\
      \ high on this game considering how many characters you have to play through\
      \ to fully complete it.\n\nSome of the single player achievements are just replay/retry\
      \ bait because they depend on an entirely RNG system to work in your favor,\
      \ such as winning every hand against an opponent or winning a match in the first\
      \ round by you betting it all, your opponent betting it all, and you getting\
      \ blackjack.\n\nVisually, and in a retro-homage way, this game is awesome. Gameplay-wise,\
      \ it doubles down on an 11 and gets a 12. \n\n---\n\nScore System: 0 - Unplayable;\
      \ 5 - Average; 10 - Perfect\n(Note: each category is not necessarily weighted\
      \ equally when determining the overall rating)\n\nGameplay: 3/10\nGraphics:\
      \ 8/10\nSound: 6/10\nStory: 4/10\nReplayability: 7/10\n\nOverall Rating: 4/10\
      \ (Subpar)\n\nWorth Purchasing at Full Price/Discount: Not worth purchasing\
      \ at full price (consideration given for a deep discount and as a novelty purchase)\n\
