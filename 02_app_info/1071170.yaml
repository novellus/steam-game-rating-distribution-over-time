    review: "TLDR:  For those who haven't paid to buy it,  i suggest you don't buy\
      \ unless you want to donate to the dev team for their intention, not the product\
      \ quality.\n\nFor myself, I don't regret paying to support the dev team, but\
      \ really hope they can do it better , yes, Dear Dev team, please try play IL\
      \ DIVINO: Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling experience and Nefertari: Journey to\
      \ Eternityfor and Dear Angelica  before you create the next product. I really\
      \ hope you can do better.   \n\n----------------------\nFull review:   I really\
      \ want to like it, as i love Monet and want to experience it in VR.  And i appreciate\
      \ the work put in but this is sub par quality product compared all the good\
      \ VR experiences out there (look at the IL DIVINO: Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling\
      \ experience or Nefertari: Journey to Eternityfor example, both of those are\
      \ even free ! ) \n\nThe major problems are:\n1.  it won't even launch correctly,\
      \  when trying to open a strange vive link, which as I have no vive ( i am using\
      \ index, which is supported according the store page) , it jumps to windows\
      \ store page. you have to take off headset, or go to desktop mode to click it\
      \ to open stupid windows store to get the app pass to starting screen.  This\
      \ took me ten minutes to try and error to find out,  terrible experience.\n\n\
      2.  the experience it self doesn't even support controller, try to use it on\
      \ title screen will screw the language selection, you have to use gaze to select\
      \ mode to select the language,    and through out the experience, there is no\
      \ controller support.  even though the store page repeatedly told you it requires\
      \ a controller to play, in reality it's useless in the game.\n\n3.   let's be\
      \ honest, there is zero interaction throughout the experience, it's no different\
      \ than watching a 3D video.   It is a VR film, don't call it experience,  there\
      \  are a lot good VR film,  such as Oculus story studio's work,  but this is\
      \ much worse compare to those because of bad story telling and presentation\
      \ (see below)\n\n4.  limited walking range,  due to the fact you cannot use\
      \ controller to teleport, you can only walk to the edge of your play area, in\
      \ some scenes, i want to walk closer to the shore or particular item that looks\
      \ interesting,  i couldn't \n\n5.  the story telling is totally relying on the\
      \ auditory narration,  with no single character was rendered visually, you have\
      \ to guess what's happening by listening, don't get me wrong, the narrator did\
      \ a good job, but with only one person playing two roles, not changing in tones\
      \ or voice, you cannot even tell who is who in the dialog (which is not dialog,\
      \ just letters between monet and friend been read out loud in reality), and\
      \ the visual is virtually nothing linked to the story except showing the year\
      \ and the ending scene.\n\n6. bad performance,  in the ending scene when there\
      \ is some changes, the visual becomes choppy and frame rate drop to below 40\
      \ (i am on rtx 2080 super, it's not my pc, it's bad optimization)\n\nOverall,\
      \ it wants to be something like oculus  story studio's dear angelica,  but becomes\
      \ much worse version of it due to zero visual character and bad story telling.\
      \   it has so much potential but sadly falling short."
