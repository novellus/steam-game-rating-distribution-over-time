I was hoping this would be similar to Gridiron Solitaire, where you sort of feel like you're actually affecting a football game.  It has a baseball theme, in that there are 9 innings, but you just never feel like your cards in any way relate to the 'baseball game' being played in the narrated story line. For example, regardless of how you win the 9th hand against the Nevada Aliens, the story line says that you hit a walk-off grand slam to send the team to the playoffs.   The cards you play have no effect on the outcome of the story line; it's a separate thing altogether. There are some cards that have to be unblocked before you can remove them, like a lock that you have to find the key for, and a glove that you need to find a baseball for.  But one of these is an umpire, and to remove that card, you need to find his...WHISTLE?  Umpires don't have whistles.  Coupled with the horrendous English in the recap screens, it's obvious the creators aren't American, and aren't that familiar with baseball.","timestamp_created":1601960119,"timestamp_updated":1601960119,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rfGQ/vQCfOmTpgI="}
