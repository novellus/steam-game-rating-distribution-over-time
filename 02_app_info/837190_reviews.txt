In terms of pure gameplay, Tanglewood is utterly accomplished; the gameplay is always fun and maintains its challenge without ever stepping over the line into any objectionable artificial difficulty padding. \n\nStellar artwork and design run through this entire game – the character model for Nymn is so adorable that one may find themselves reaching for the thesaurus to find other ways to describe him (to save some time you can choose from: lovable, charming, cute, sweet, enchanting, dear, darling, delightful, lovely, winsome, precious and a personal favourite, bonny). The animations for his movements add to this, making Nymn a delight to play as. On a technical level, too, his movements are responsive and accurate, especially when navigating some tricky elements of the game; there's no cheapness associated with any failures to progress, it's all down to the player!\n\nSound design's always been an important part of any game and Tanglewood succeeds in this department as well, quite bravely taking a stripped back approach where, at times, there will be no background music at all; only the sounds of the character's movements and the ambient noise of the world around you – thus when the player hits a point in the level where some of the soundtrack does kick in, it really 'means' something and enhances the moment significantly. \n\nBy its very nature, the expectation for this game may well be that it's going to be a warm blanket of nostalgia for a bygone era but Tanglewood is a success unto itself – a game that knows what it wants to do and is delightfully precise in attaining that – this is a game that would be fun in any era. Highly recommended experience.\n\nAs an addendum, a worthy nomination for the Labour of Love Steam Awards, 2020. Having talked to the developer and heard his passion for Tanglewood, I had no question that this would be the game I put forwards for that particular award.","timestamp_created":1534439983,"timestamp_updated":1606564904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxN+uh/YCeZTKqAE="}
