    review: For those who bought this soundtrack for the stem mixing and listened
      to Jean-Marc's tutorial, I just wanted to people to know that there's another
      software you can use to load and play the stems other than Reaper, called Audacity.
      I'm definitely not trying to downplay Reaper; after all, it's the software Jean-Marc
      used to create the soundtrack for this game. However, you only get it free for
      60 days, whereas Audacity is freeware that you can use ad infinitum. All you
      have to do is open up Audacity -> File -> Import - Audio, letting you load and
      play the stems just as easily.
