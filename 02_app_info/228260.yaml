    review: 'I would recommend this game for anyone liking a empire-building game
      where you rule over land. There are some things I should mention. Let''s get
      over the cons first.


      BUGS and CONS (EDIT: ALL THESE HAVE BEEN FIXED)

      -If you load another game during a game. the boundaries of people''s territory
      don''t show (have to go to main menu every time).


      -When your character has all skills/abilities of the basics and their class,
      you can''t move forward. Level up screen pops up and the game doesn''t allow
      you to close out of it (really lame). You''ll most likely beat the game before
      you get that high so it''s not a huge deal, but it sucks you can play as a max
      level monster.


      -The enemy AI is garbage. It''s pretty much impossible to ally with anyone.


      PROS

      -Very detailed as far as leading people and managing funds


      -Character customization is amazing


      -Stats, power-ups, and abilities are easy to follow


      -The stats are fairly balanced. Despite it being a turn-based game dependent
      on someone''s speed, you aren''t utterly destroyed before moving if your speed
      isn''t really high.'
