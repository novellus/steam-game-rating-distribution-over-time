This game develops your mental attention, dexterity and sharpness. Stop the moving bridge and drive the car along the entire route.\n\nGame features:\nEasy controls\nNice pixel graphics\nMany cool achievements\n\nCollect coins and exchange them for any of the 30 new vehicles. You'll have only one chance to attach a road block on the bridge, and if it is crooked, you can say goodbye to your car. As you progress through the game, the difficulty and the number of blocks will only increase. Develop your skills at any of the two game levels!","timestamp_created":1589239932,"timestamp_updated":1589239932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.58405989408493042","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxpyFg/ICeKeShwI="}
