It is made of Arnold Schwarzenegger's stem cells and the finest Valerian steel. Stable, smooth, just a dream to fly. If you are on the receiving end, I'm sure it would be a nightmare. This plane makes short work of pretty much whatever you point it at. Tanks are tougher, but that makes sense. I was thrilled to see it on sale, but now after using it I would happily pay full price for it.","timestamp_created":1587926103,"timestamp_updated":1587926103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.610187113285064697","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4va7x2/ECcMfXgwI="}
