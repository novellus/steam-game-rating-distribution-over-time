    review: "If you like look & find games with no frivolous strings attached, you'll\
      \ enjoy the game and you should skip my review. If you're looking for something\
      \ with a wider variety of puzzles and a deeper story, then maybe look up the\
      \ background to this one and skip to Return to Ravenhearst. \n\nI played the\
      \ Ravenhearst games when I was younger and came back to them in my 20s for nostalgia.\
      \ I started with this one to play the games chronologically. And I kinda wish\
      \ I hadn't. I was originally going to leave this with a positive review, noting\
      \ that maybe I'm just not the target audience. Then I started on the sequel,\
      \ and in comparing the two I realize just how much I disliked playing this one.\
      \ I pretty much dragged myself through it for just the story.\n\nThe only gameplay\
      \ I enjoyed was doing the jigsaw pieces of the diary, which only makes up roughly\
      \ 10% of each level. The story is a lovely set up to the Ravenhearst series.\
      \ I also enjoyed when they interwove the look & find and the story. In the gameplay,\
      \ you'd see books that Charles' would have read, and in the story, Emma talks\
      \ about Charles' obsession with door locks and collecting random junk. I wish\
      \ there was more of this, and the look & find portions actually contributed\
      \ to discovering more of the story, perhaps observations that the diary doesn't\
      \ give you. The map being a floor plan as a nod to Charles building the house\
      \ was a nice touch.\n\nLooking at the negatives, the game was just monotonous.\
      \ Visually, a few screens are nice but otherwise most are not even pleasant\
      \ to look at. And then you have to come back to them. This game has a story,\
      \ but the game play does not support it other than taking place in the same\
      \ house. You could easily be playing a word search or matching game and it would\
      \ be about the same. Maybe it's unfair of me to compare this to its sequels,\
      \ but in Return at least, the look & finds contributed to puzzles and they felt\
      \ like I was investigating a part of the rooms you entered.\n\nA break from\
      \ the look & find portions are the puzzle locks that you are occasionally blessed/cursed\
      \ with. I personally found these to be a pain as they're sometimes nonsensical\
      \ and have very little direction. The few I was able to complete without assistance\
      \ from a guide did not leave me feeling accomplished or clever. Just annoyed.\
      \ \n\nThe sound design wasn't terrific either. It starts with a good atmosphere,\
      \ but the amount of creaking floors and yowling cats, plus the badly looping\
      \ ticking of the timer, is enough to make you want to mute it. I didn't struggle\
      \ with meeting the time parameters, but it wasn't necessarily fun to be rushed.\
      \ \n\nThe game isn't bad, and it does set the stage for it's sequels. However,\
      \ I honestly regret even spending $10 on this and not just looking up the story\
      \ for my adventure into the rest of the series. I personally couldn't recommend\
      \ you play it unless youre 100% here for the look & find, and the occasional\
      \ puzzle and plot is just a cherry on top. Even then, grab it on sale for $4."
