Nothing impressive or worth equipping for. This costume would have been more suitable to be a transparent outfit given the nature of this game.\n\nDengeki Bikini is surprisingly not a basic bikini and is in fact a tearable outfit. Front is shown on product description page. Back of the skirt has a cutout of a peach which acts as a window that allows the character's... peach to be visible. Overall design has a lot more flare going on compared to the Bus-Tee.\n\nOne extra that is not advertised is that the Dengeki Bikini also comes with a headwear accessory titled, Dengeki Peach Buns. The design is a pair of peaches, each with 2 bells and a tied ribbon. The accessory also comes with 5 color variants to match with the Dengeki Bikini.\n\nI recommend this DLC for the Dengeki Bikini set alone as the Bus-Tee costume is quite boring.","timestamp_created":1523056838,"timestamp_updated":1523057622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.618264436721801758","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv9/TzuICe/fTnQE="}
