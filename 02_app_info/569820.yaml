    review: "The pretty difficult game has a number of characters - both human and\
      \ alien. Getting to know them better in this audiobook  was totally amazing.\
      \ It certainly makes the game come much more alive, when you know what they\
      \ are fighting for and who the heroes are. The audio chapters are more or less\
      \ separate stories from the years before the game starts, when the aliens arrived.\
      \ Explains the origin of the superpowers of the heroes and where they came from,\
      \ as well as the alien and their reasons for the invasion. The amulets (nanomachines)\
      \ grant certain abilities to the wielders (our heroes) and they have started\
      \ the earth liberation. More powerful than the regular players, but can't be\
      \ permitted to be killed, forcing you to restart the mission. \n\nGreat with\
      \ background information about the game and its characters. Audiobook is pretty\
      \ good in spoken english.\nIf you have the game and want to understand what's\
      \ going on? - this audiobook provides invaluable help.\nMore chapters are promised\
      \ to be added. I rekommend the sci fi/fantasy audiobook warmly. \n\nSPOILER\
      \ ALERT? The alien characters haven't shown up in the game missions yet, but\
      \ here's a first glimpse of the alien society, not just waves of attacking monsters.\
      \ Gives the score a boost to 8/10 for giving some serious future expectations\
      \ to see more great stuff in the game as it's developed.\n"
