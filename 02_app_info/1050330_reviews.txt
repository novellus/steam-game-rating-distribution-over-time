This allows you to change how they sound. while it does contain the massive libary of super generic rpg soundtracks and sfx, \nI personally don't see it as a 20 dollar deal, much less a 14 dollar one. for what you get you can go on youtube and just look up what your needing. plus you don't even own the sounds if you want to stream dnd.\n\nTL;DR - Save your money for something that you can get for creative common, or just some prep work.","timestamp_created":1609341170,"timestamp_updated":1609341170,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwla6N2vYCesrmvgI="}
