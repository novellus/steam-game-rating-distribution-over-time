    about_the_game: <i>You come across an ancient relic that has a terrifying aura
      around it. Most people would leave the relic alone, but your curiosity gets
      the best of you; as soon as you touch the relic it crumbles, and binds you in
      a powerful curse. <br><br><strong>&quot;Death is imminent. Death is imminent.&quot;</strong><br><br>You
      start to hear whispers in your head. Different languages, different clues- everything
      around you is trying to tell you that your death is inevitable. Paranoia kicks
      in. How many days do you have left in you? What's going to kill you? Every little
      decision you now make can decide your fate. The only thing you can learn from
      this is that ancient relics should sometimes be left alone for a good reason.</i><br><br>Mischance
      is a game that relies heavily on an RNG system. Each and every little task you
      perform has the chance to kill you (some more than others). On one hand this
      means that the player has no knowledge over what kills them or keeps them alive,
      but on the other hand it also means that every time a new game starts you are
      dealt with different circumstances that lead to different outcomes. The primary
      objective of the game is to survive as many days as possible. The more days
      you survive, the further the plot progresses and the higher your chances of
      staying alive the next time you start a new game. Players are also given random
      modifiers at the start of the game that helps reduces the chances of dying by
      certain means. <br><br>Throughout each game the player will have to make several
      decisions. Some include choosing what meals to eat, deciding whether you should
      open random packages sent to you, interacting with strangers or taking a day
      off from work. All of these decisions also have a random chance of either working
      in your favour or backfiring, leading to the player's death. <br><br><i> <strong>Better
      start praying. The only thing that's gonna guarantee your survival is luck.
      And you'll need a lot of that to make it out alive. Not that you're gonna escape
      death forever, but it's quite amusing seeing you try.</strong>  </i>
