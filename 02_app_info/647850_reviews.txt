This is the second in the series (at least on Steam), and is the sequel to RD: Lord of Statues, in terms of story.  In the first game, we had to save a town whose statues had come to life; in this game, we are helping the girl from the first game (Princess) to save her mother and learn more about her origins.\n\nThis game isn't quite as good as the first game, despite an interesting premise. Princess summons the Royal Detective help her rescue her newly discovered mother, the powerful sorceress Selena.  The Detective finds themself exploring a spooky forest and then the fabled, but long-dead, city of the elves. As the game progresses, we learn more about Princess, Selena, and the mad, immortal King of the Elves.  \n\nI didn't find the use of magic or statues as well designed as in the first game; this game felt less immersive (less \"adventure\") and more broken up into the usual HOPA tasks of finding the perfect tool or odd-shaped key. At the same time, a couple of the puzzles were quite challenging, and there was one that just frustrated me due to an obscure and poorly explained mechanic (i.e., even with the instructions, I was a bit at a loss).  This isn't deal-breaking by any means, but it's something to keep in mind.  Also, like the first game, the HO scenes are tougher than many current games.\n\nPros:\n- interesting story, continuing protagonist and secondary character\n- good number of HO scenes and puzzles\n- beautiful art, especially in fantasy/spooky genre\n- appropriate music (though mine cut out once or twice, not so good)\n- fully interactive map (except no collectible indicator)\n- choice of difficulty level\n- excellent video /movie clips as before\n\nNeutral:  a little more challenging than many of the newer games\n\nCons:\n- felt a bit linear at times\n- interesting secondary characters but little feeling of interaction\n- a couple of puzzles that were more irritating than challenging (I don't usually mind challenging, so take that as you will)\n- instructions less clear than in previous game\n\nI still recommend this game and this series!","timestamp_created":1594941416,"timestamp_updated":1594943188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.592183470726013184","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwrWBrfMCfu7glQI="}
