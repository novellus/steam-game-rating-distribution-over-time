    review: Enjoyable fun puzzle/memory game. First mode is composed of various match
      2 tile puzzles of increasing difficulty, where you match 2 tiles with a maximum
      of 3 straight lines. Second mode is more of a memory game with the tiles hidden
      by a question mark, which you can reveal for a few seconds by clicking each
      tile and trying to find a match under the same 3 line rule of the first mode.
      The second mode becomes more difficult towards the later puzzles as it puts
      your memory to the test with a larger number of hidden tiles. In both modes,
      once you reach the maximum possible tile matches in a given puzzle, the remaining
      tiles will auto-shuffle until you finish the puzzle, which is nice. If you enjoy
      word search type games or games that test your memory, you should enjoy this.
