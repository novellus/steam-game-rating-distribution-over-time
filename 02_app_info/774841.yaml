    review: "The best value for money here would be to purchase the Tales from Candlekeep\
      \ Complete Edition.\n\nThis quick review covers the basics for each of these\
      \ DLC\u2019s\n\nThis will give you the game plus all five the DLC\u2019s that\
      \ the game has to offer.\nThe game can be played without the DLC\u2019s, having\
      \ them however does make the game somewhat easier.\n \nThis DLC gives you a\
      \ brand new Hero and the ability to takes five heroes into battle with you.\
      \ This new Hero comes with a whole bah of tricks, a special ally that can be\
      \ summoned and a new daily power.\n\nThese DLC\u2019s offers this and more,\
      \ making them must buys, even if its just to support the Developers.\n"
