      \ /><br>We\u2019ve updated Paper Pirates to version 2.0 and filled it with tons\
      \ more events, unlockables, features, and even a whole new game mode!<br><br>Jump\
      \ into the crow\u2019s nest and aim your spyglass towards the nearest dry land,\
      \ to check out this brief summary of some of the new things that have hit Paper\
      \ Pirates since version 1.0:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Achievements\
      \ and Hats:</strong> We added a whole bunch of achievements, and for every achievement\
      \ you unlock, you also unlock a new hat! Hats can be equipped in the lobby when\
      \ waiting for a game to start - pick a favourite, and wear it with pride!<br></li><li><strong>Customise\
      \ your Pirate:</strong> Hanging out in the lobby, waiting for a game to start?\
      \ Use the palette icon in the top-right of your device to choose a custom look\
      \ for your pirate! What\u2019s more, pirate appearances are saved to your name,\
      \ so if you join another game hosted by the same person, your appearance will\
      \ be ready for you next time you jump aboard!<br></li><li><strong>Fast Mode:</strong>\
      \ Already a seasoned veteran, and have the rules to Paper Pirates down to a\
      \ T? We added Fast Mode in the Options menu, so you can turn off most of the\
      \ dialogue and text, to really speed through your games!<br></li><li><strong>A\
      \ whole host of new events:</strong> Between 1.0 and 2.0, we doubled the number\
      \ of events in-game, including everyone\u2019s favourite - The Magic Lamp! which\
      \ grants a player a vision of the future and lets them wish for an event. Will\
      \ your wildest wishes be fulfilled?<br></li><li><strong>Custom Games and Scored\
      \ Games:</strong> Two brand new ways to play - custom games let you mix up your\
      \ settings. Want to start with 2, 3, 4 or even more ghosts? It\u2019s possible\
      \ in a custom game! Scored games add secret objectives, and you\u2019ll be ranked\
      \ based on how well you played throughout the game. It\u2019s an entirely new\
      \ way to play!<br></li><li><strong>The Captain\u2019s Log:</strong> Jump into\
      \ The Captain\u2019s Log from the main menu, and you\u2019ll see a record of\
      \ everything you\u2019ve seen so far in Paper Pirates. There\u2019s a list of\
      \ events, secret objectives, hats - and even biographical histories of all the\
      \ bots. Did you know they all have their own unique personalities?<br></li><li><strong>Round\
      \ History:</strong> Just finished a game and want to interrogate each day in\
      \ detail? Use the Round History button, and you\u2019ll get a friendly recap\
      \ of every job, every event, and every time someone went overboard - perfect\
      \ for finding out when your friends lied to you!<br></li><li><strong>Chats,\
      \ Emojis and Emotes:</strong> While playing with other pirates stranded offshore,\
      \ you can now use the text-chat with the message bubble in the top left of your\
      \ device to send a short message that\u2019s displayed on screen. What\u2019\
      s more, the messages have full emoji support, and you can even tap an emote\
      \ button to make your pirate do a fun action!</li></ul><br>There\u2019s never\
      \ been a better time to take a trip on a ship, so grab a crew and dive into\
      \ Paper Pirates now to see all that the new 2.0 update has to offer!</p><br><h1>About\
