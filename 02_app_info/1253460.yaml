    about_the_game: "Do you have spare time? Do you want to do something relaxing?\
      \ Perhaps you want to grind some easy achievements? Or maybe you're just waiting\
      \ for a video to load. It doesn't really matter because with Colouration you\
      \ can play the game and do all that at the same time!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn\
      \ Colouration you have a choice between 5 modes:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(1) Calm:\
      \ Hover your mouse cursor over the dimmed out squares to colour them in. Colour\
      \ in the whole grid to proceed to the next grid where you will do the same thing.<br\
      \ />\r\n(2) Speed: Test your speed by clicking on the coloured squares as they\
      \ appear (they appear after each accurate click). You have 60 seconds to click\
      \ on as many coloured squares as you can. Try to get at least 90 clicks.<br\
      \ />\r\n(3) Perception: You are given 16 seconds to study the board before it\
      \ disappears. After time's up, one of the boxes is randomly selected and you\
      \ must determine the colour of said box. <br />\r\n(4) Patience: Using the score\
      \ that you accumulate over time, you need to unlock the progressively more expensive\
      \ colours on the list. By clicking on the coloured squares, you can generate\
      \ some score as well.<br />\r\n(5) Focus: By selecting the correct components,\
      \ you need to match the listed requirements. For example, if the requirements\
      \ are: 3L, Red, and 50%, then you need to pick 3 components, have the last component\
      \ be Red, and have the alpha level be at 50%.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nColouration\
      \ gives a laid-back and satisfying experience so if you're a casual player (or\
      \ a competitive player who's on a break), then this is the game for you."
