This is a game for jigsaw puzzle fans.  There are only six separate pictures, and the challenge comes from playing with more and more pieces.  The artwork is outstanding, especially if you like the fantasy genre (wizards in particular).  This game could be suitable for younger players at the 135-piece level; however, there is enough depth to entertain experienced puzzlers.\n\nPros:\n- art design\n- puzzle design (clearly thought went into how the light effects add to challenge and interest)\n- control design (you can play \"bare bones\" for a challenge, or use a number of available sorting presets to make things faster or easier)\n- very nice music\n- Steam achievements\n\nCons:\n- limited number of images\n- no \"creative\" achievements (simple completion achievements)\n\nOverall:  If you enjoy doing puzzles in the virtual world, this game is worth adding to your library.  It lacks complexity as a game, but is well-designed for doing jigsaw puzzles.  The music is a plus.","timestamp_created":1609368708,"timestamp_updated":1609368783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.592183470726013184","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4idn22vYCfrv2vgI="}
