    review: 'Good potential. Finished all missions in just a couple of days though,
      which isn''t worth the 30.00 paid.


      Decent graphics, some quirks. Controls require that you use game controller
      and keyboard in order to be able to get the use of all capabilities. And then
      still couldn''t control throttle properly.


      There is an editor included so you can make different missions if yo can figure
      out how to get the system to save your map editing .


      Over all game 6 of 10

      Graphics 6 of 10

      Audio 4 of 10 (not from the game play but the computer voice that hosts)

      Controls 5 of 10


      Our total is a 5. Not recommended for the price. 10.00 would be appropriate.'
