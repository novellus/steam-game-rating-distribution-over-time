Back then, as I struggled against the final boss of Double Dragon 3, I was shaking, my blood pressure must be breaking records, and I was on the verge of cerebral hemorrhage. But I had no regrets, the game was excellent.\n\nIts pseudo-sequel, Double Dragon 4 did not surprise me, because before the purchase I had read a good part of the comments. But I wanted to give it a chance, curiosity and nostalgia had ganged up against reason.\n\nRough handling. I cannot find the sensations of the NES versions.\n\nThe platform phases ...\n\nNo ground and pound. Technique that already existed in the first episode and could have been easily implemented.\n\nThe Lee brothers are slow as turtles (but not mutant ninja). In Double Dragon 3, Jimmy and Bimmy had however discovered one of the most secret and effective arcana of Sou-Setsu-Ken: running. Vital technique when your little sprite crosses long levels full of emptiness. In Double Dragon 4, they can no longer run.\n\nAlthough there is a Misfits fan in the new opponents, most lack charisma.\n\nThe story and the dialogue have never been the strong point of the Double Dragon. On this point, the developers have managed to remain very loyal to the series.\n\nIn a little over an hour I finished story mode and got a good start on the tower. I don't feel like playing it again, the unlockable characters don't motivate me and get bored but online doesn't appeal to me.\n\nIf I haven't managed to dissuade you, and curiosity and nostalgia prevails with you too, never buy Double Dragon 4 full price. I wouldn't give more than a kopek.\n\nTo purify my ki after this outrage, I would instead switch to Double Dragon Advance or go back to Return of Double Dragon (Super Famicom).","timestamp_created":1609598067,"timestamp_updated":1609598067,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k6zh4fYCfoTfvwI="}
