    about_the_game: "Based on the U.S. Navy's Douglas A3D Skywarrior, the B-66 Destroyer\
      \ was SAC's light bomber, and was to replace the piston-powered B-26 Invader.\
      \ An RB-66 photo-reconnaissance version was ordered simultaneously. It was first\
      \ envisaged that the conversion from a carrier-based aircraft to a land-based\
      \ one would be straightforward, but the transition was lengthier than anticipated.\
      \ Most changes stemmed from the USAF's stipulation that the aircraft be suitable\
      \ for low-level operations. The first production RB-66B finally flew in early\
      \ 1955. Deliveries began in 1956, and 145 were produced. They were used as the\
      \ primary night reconnaissance aircraft of the USAF during that time. 72 of\
      \ the B-66B bomber version were built concurrently, and 13 B-66B aircraft were\
      \ adapted as EB-66B ECM aircraft for the Vietnam War. The final B-66 variant\
      \ took shape as the WB-66D weather reconnaissance aircraft, just 36 being built.\
