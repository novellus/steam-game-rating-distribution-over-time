    review: 'A challenging game!

      Many games describe themselves as challenging and when we play we don''t feel
      the challenge that was described, but in the case of this game the challenge
      is part of your DNA and that makes this game very cool!

      The feeling of victory you feel when you win the mazes is really good, but make
      no mistake, because in this game mistakes are not forgiven!

      For those who like challenges it is the right game!!!'
