Pretty normal for this genre in my opinion\n+ Very good beginning of the story! And I liked how the action jumped from present to past a lot\n\n- The dialogues were mediocre and not as meaningful/atmospheric as they could be\n- We get a lot of Alice's backstory but none of Richard's\n- Some puzzles are very random and unsolvable (yeah looking at you [spoiler] \"Building a bomb\"[/spoiler]!!) but a quick glimpse into a guide solves the problem\n- The story is a bit holey and internally inconsistent? [spoiler] I mean the government failed, everyone who is still alive tries to survive the snow and anarchistic state, everywhere are groups of people kidnapping and shooting people, everyhwere are graves with burried bodies and ALICE GOES TO JAIL FOR FINISHING OFF HER SON WHO WAS DEADLY SICK ANYWAY. And this is the main story!![/spoiler]\n- The endings are not bad, but dissatisfying... a bit abrupt too. Which ending you get doesnt depend on your choices or dialogues, but on whether you got all the collectibles or not. :/\n- Almost no choices\n\nYeah, there was a lot that bothered me about this game, but it still is very special and fun to play. Would recommend on sale (:","timestamp_created":1522921902,"timestamp_updated":1610060021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40MfD7/YCdO7DnQE="}
