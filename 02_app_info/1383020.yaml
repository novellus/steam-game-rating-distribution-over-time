    review: '[h1]Germany at War - Soviet Dawn[/h1]


      [i]Only just started ( i understand it''s an older game - 2013 moved from Matrix
      to Steam ) and i love the options given - lots of settings to choose and customize
      your gameplay experience - clean presentation on map ,  ultra wide screen support
      , different units ( ranging from battalions to divisions ) - the abbility to
      switch to nato symbols  + fog of war = a winning combination for me - hope the
      AI is competent enough ;-D - totally recommended for ww2 turn based fans ![/i]'
