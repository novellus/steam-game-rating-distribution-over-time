No.\nAnd three exclusive emblem stickers.\nThis is just a pointless customization.\nIt also gives you the two map packs.\nThose maps are alright in my books.\nIt is cheaper to buy 'em individually.\nThis season pass is just overpriced.\nI really don't recommend buying it.\nTwo DLC's are nice, others are bad.\nAnd I'm giving it a negative review.","timestamp_created":1606260518,"timestamp_updated":1606260518,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458265155553817749","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx82l/vUCd/OpsAI="}
