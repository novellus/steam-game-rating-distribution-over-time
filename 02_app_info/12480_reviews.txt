Reviewers are right.\n\nBut, if you already own and have played \"Men of War\" & alike, this game is worth giving it a try. The historical setting (Soviet Aghanistan war) and the original 9th Company Russian war movie clips keep you engaged and motivated.\n\nRuns well on Win 10 (1440p@144Hz) and game engine is good. Controls are manageable for RTS veterans.","timestamp_created":1609554346,"timestamp_updated":1609554346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgci64PYCfanLvwI="}
