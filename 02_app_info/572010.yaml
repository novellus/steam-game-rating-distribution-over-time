    about_the_game: You are alone. Except for the zombies! But there are guns and
      some ammo. You can fight, but there is <strong>No Way Out </strong>of this city
      infested with hideous creatures that will chase you to the end! <br>In this
      game the goal is to resist and seek an unlikely exit.<br>But your concerns are
      not limited only to the ravenous zombies that chase after you, because to stay
      alive you need to find food and you're hungry, but unlike the enemies that come
      in droves all food is scarce and hard to find!
