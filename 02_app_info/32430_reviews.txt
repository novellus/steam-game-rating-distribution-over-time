No, of course not.\nFor this low price I 100% recommend this game to any star wars fans. it has nice combat, storyline and characters.\nIt might seem cliche from time to time or there might be a plothole here and there but other than that I don't see a problem.","timestamp_created":1610143156,"timestamp_updated":1610143156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8tiA8vYCdfHSwQI="}
