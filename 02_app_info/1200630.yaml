    review: '**WARNING DO NOT BUY**


      If you like to be trolled by developers, this is a perfect game for you.


      First of all, the mouse crosshair is on your screen and it literally drifts
      off to the other screen, not to mention that there is already a stock crosshair
      for the game...so you have two and one moves quite differently then the other...horrible
      flaw and overlook.


      You start the game with no menu screen, it just throws you in a game, in the
      level you start, you literally get 4-5 empty shelves where books would go, the
      top right it says collect 8 books...it''s a box of a level that is literally
      100 feet if you will...there are two markings on the ground...these are our
      clues?


      Dude, I''ve played so many steam games lately and left so many reviews to the
      point I can tell if developers are being creative, lazy, just trying to show
      off there concept, etc...


      This game sucks!'
