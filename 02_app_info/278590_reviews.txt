Bit of advice, though, neither magic nor magic defense have any value early on.  Being able to adjust HP would be appreciated.\n\nMy biggest problem for this is a lack of window mode combined with inability to alt+tab out.  The game just freezes.  If I were playing this on a dual monitor, wouldn't be a problem, so I did recommend, but for laptop users, stay away.","timestamp_created":1605979861,"timestamp_updated":1605979861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gP729fUCeJ7brwI="}
