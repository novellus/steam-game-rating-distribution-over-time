Sadly the controls are awkward at best, and the perspective is claustrophobic and limited.\nThe maps are way too small for a decent tower defense game. I suspect this is a legacy of it having been a mobile game, but there was no reason not to open things up a bit when porting it to PC.\nOdd that right off the bat the game gifted me with so many coins I could buy just about everything up to the max level, seems like something a developer would do who had given up on trying to make it actually a better game.\nThe graphics are pretty nice, the aliens look cool and the overall visual presentation is pretty good. The music is also decent, if somewhat repetitive. \nI think most players will also find the game a bit under-explained, the common ability to hover over a button to get some idea of what it does does not exist here. Not my idea of fun having to guess what so many of the buttons do.\nFor two bucks or less, might be worth the purchase, but keep your expectations low.","timestamp_created":1516366498,"timestamp_updated":1554986695,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lb+bhuoCf8DClgE="}
