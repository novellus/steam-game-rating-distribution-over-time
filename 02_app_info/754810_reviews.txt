Really, this VN is quite unique on its own and its artstyle attracts me in a way I cannot explain. The story, albeit quite short, is well-written and the pacing is good.

And for the low low price of 0$, what is there to lose anyway?","timestamp_created":1581445374,"timestamp_updated":1581445374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg6zfmvACcPXU8QE="}
