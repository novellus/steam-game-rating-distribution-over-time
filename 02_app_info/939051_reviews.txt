Today we will be looking over the Priority Mission DLC “Poisoned Souls” which is a series of missions loosely themed around a narrative with a reward unique to the DLC at the end.  But is it worth the $3?\n\nNot so fine Warp Dust:  Another choose-your-own-adventure style mission type…but it only gave me one real choice at the beginning.  I’m really starting to get disappointed with the ‘story’ of these missions, the first ones had several branches and I was looking forward to trying them again when they reset but the last few only give you one or two options.\n\nThe reward of this is a good one, a inoculator mod that gives you class resource and probably would be great for most builds in some way, I just wish the content before was worth it.  I’d only recommend this for the reward and that makes me give it a thumbs down because it does make it feel like the item is the only reason to get it, enjoy!","timestamp_created":1591318597,"timestamp_updated":1591318657,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/vb+wPICdpubjAI="}
