    review: 'Key pieces translate so wonderfully into piano arrangements, & ripresa
      is absolutely no exception! The choice of song is absolutely on point, & having
      both 320kbps & high-quality FLAC variants available is fantastic.


      In addition to the above, the included sheet music is both well presented &
      highly appreciated as a musician!


      The price is ridiculously low for a release of this quality, so if you''ve read
      & enjoyed Little Busters and/or Kud Wafter, make sure you don''t sleep on this
      beautifully presented little collection.
