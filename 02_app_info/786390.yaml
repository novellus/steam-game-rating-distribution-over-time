      \ /> <br>It is December, 1955.  Your daughter has gone missing.  Recurrent nightmares\
      \ have been haunting your sleep, forcing a steady descent into madness.  Your\
      \ dreams bring about a variety of introspective, phobia-induced situations to\
      \ wrestle with.  And, something appears to be calling for you..  Downward...<br><br>This\
      \ is the first chapter (Prelude) ..  in a planned episodic story-driven adventure\
      \ game in which you gradually uncover the mystery of your daughter's disappearance,\
      \ and the nature of your soul.  My goal here has been to invent an artistic\
      \ style and feel that I have been wanting to experience myself in VR, and also\
      \ to set the stage for a larger series.  (This Prelude may or may not be &quot;Canon&quot;\
      \ in the official chapters to follow.)<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/786390/extras/Features.png?t=1585150303\"\
      \ /> <br>Purgatory Fell uses a Standing-Room, trigger-based locomotion, giving\
      \ you full control over your changing inertia.  This increases the control you\
      \ have over your movement, which also tends to alleviate potential motion sickness.\
      \  In this game we have the usual object grab/throw mechanics, and climbing/falling,\
      \ but also we explore new technologies in effort to evolve the VR artform:<br><br>\u25BA\
      \u25BA Fluid physics that you can push around with your hands, and displaces\
      \ around your body as you move through it.<br>\u25BA\u25BA Volumetric Lighting\
