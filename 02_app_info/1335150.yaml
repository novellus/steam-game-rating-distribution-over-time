    review: 'Previously I had bashed the Ace Attorney Trilogy - Turnabout Tunes soundtrack
      and lamented that I wished I could buy the full OST''s to each individual game
      separately.


      Well, apparently Capcom personally called my bluff.

      Didn''t expect that.


      I know you are price comparing that $10 Turnabout Tunes to the $20 full OST''s
      to each game and wondering why each costs so much, and I can happily answer
      that: The audio quality on these OST''s are the best i''ve heard for this music,
      period.


      I even compared the shared tracks between the two and this OST is noticeably
      better sounding, so these releases are basically intended for people like me
      or audiophiles (well, as much of an audiophile you can be over midi music).


      I honestly don''t know why Capcom didn''t explain this in the product description,
      given that price looks absurd without the context that this a specialty product
      intended for enthusiasts.


      Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney: Justice For All in particular I always recount
      its OST sounding compressed into oblivion in contrast to its predecessor. I
      am absolutely floored hearing it equal audio quality after all this time.


      Still the weakest of the three OSTs in my opinion, but this clarity removes
      one of my biggest issues with it.'
