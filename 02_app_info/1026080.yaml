    review: "Just finished the game and quite liked it. In the first case you start\
      \ with no clue on the whole story, but as you progress the game becomes more\
      \ fun (also a lot of inside jokes help to make it more fun to keep playing).\
      \ I love puzzle games so I recommend this game to others who also like similar\
      \ games. \n\ntip: it took me quite some effort and random clicking before I\
      \ found out I could combine items and what to do with them. I recommend giving\
      \ more clue's about this ;-)\n\nThumbs up for an original and suprising story!"
