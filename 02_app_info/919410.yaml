      \ /><br><br>Felix The Reaper is a <strong>challenging single-player puzzle game</strong>.\
      \ You take on the role as Felix, whose job is to <strong>make sure that people\
      \ die</strong>. To do this, Felix must work in the shadows and rearrange faith\
      \ so that death is always the end result.<br><br>At its core, the game is about\
      \ <strong>manipulating shadows</strong> so that Felix can set up his targets\
      \ safely covered by the shadows. The core gameplay has a Hitman Go'ish, Monument\
      \ Valley'ing and Sokoban-like simplicity running through it.<br><br>There are\
      \ three rules you have to master to become a successful Reaper:<br><br><strong>Rule\
      \ #1: Stick to the shadows</strong><br>Each level is set on a grid-based platform.\
      \ The squares of the grid are either lit up or in shadow, and Felix has to do\
      \ his job in the shadows.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/919410/extras/Stay_in_shadows_gif.gif?t=1575500557\"\
      \ /><br><br><strong>Rule #2: Control the shadows</strong><br>Felix has the ability\
      \ to rotate the sun, and move objects, to create new pathways for him to reach\
      \ his target.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/919410/extras/Control_shadows_gif.gif?t=1575500557\"\
      \ /><br><br><strong>Rule #3: Make sure people die</strong><br>The end goal of\
      \ each level is to set up your targets and have them meet their maker.<br><br><img\

      \ /><br><br>To add something extra to this core game experience, we wrapped\
      \ it in deep layers of storytelling, death, dance, art history, love and comedy.\
      \ That way you get to enjoy a wholesome story world, while boiling your brains\
      \ on complicatetedly straight forward shadow puzzles about Death.<br><br><br><img\

      \ /><br><br>Felix The Reaper sprang from a fascination with the sprawling, humorous\
      \ and grotesque art history of Death. Many themes have emerged in the cultural\
      \ identity of Death, including <i>The Dance of Death</i> or <i>Danse Macabre</i>\
      \ and <i>Death And The Maiden</i>. We sort of mashed those two themes together\
      \ in Felix The Reaper.<br> <br>For the character himself and the world around\
      \ him, the inspiration was more diverse: We took cues from the ancient TV show\
      \ <i>The Twilight Zon</i>e, medieval painters like <i>Bruegel and Bosch</i>\
      \ and the cartoon characters of <i>Adventure Time</i> and <i>Hayao Miyazaki</i>.<br>\
      \ <br>Another important inspiration for Felix The Reaper was the amazing artistic\
      \ collaborators in the production. We worked with dancers, a long list of music\
      \ artists and history scholars.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Dance</h2>Several dancers\
      \ contributed to the game's production, and eventually Gunilla Lind and Rapha\xEB\
      l Ferdinand Eder-Kastling improvised the final moves that ended up in the game.<br>\
      \ <br>Here's Gunilla doing a dance move for Felix:<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/919410/extras/STEAMassets_SPLITSCREEN_Gunilla.gif.png?t=1575500557\"\
      \ /><br>And here's Raphael doing another:<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/919410/extras/STEAMassets_SPLITSCREEN_Raphael.gif.png?t=1575500557\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Music</h2>Of course a game with a dancing protagonist\
      \ needs great music\u2014why else would he be dancing? We designed the game\
      \ in a way that lets the music artists be themselves. We wanted them to add\
      \ to the game through their personal artistic expression, rather than ask them\
      \ to be what we want them to be. This made for a varied and strange combination\
      \ of music. But since the gameplay is a non-stressful puzzler, you actually\
      \ have time to appreciate and enjoy the weirdness while playing.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">The Art History</h2>The idea for the game itself stems from art history.\
      \ We actually started with <i>The Danse Macabre</i> and <i>Death and The Maiden</i>\
      \ as a basis, and then asked ourselves: How can we make a game about this? Eventually\
      \ and through several different prototypes, we ended up here. <br> <br>Alongside\
      \ the production, a history scholar was diving into the art history of Death\
      \ across more than 10 centuries for a book manuscript he is working on, and\
      \ every time he hit upon something interesting he told us, and we tried to put\
      \ it into the game if it fit. There are five different articles by this historian\
      \ <i>S\xF8ren Hein Rasmussen</i> within the game\u2014you can unlock them as\
      \ you progress."

    review: It was an alright game, but I got bored pretty fast and didn't really
      want to start playing again once I stopped. The game is really well made and
      looks super pretty, and I like the funky dances that he does. I really wish
      there was a neutral review option, because it definitely wasn't a [i]bad[/i]
      game, it just wasn't fun for me. So yes, I do recommend this game if you're
      okay with a difficult puzzle game that is tedious at times. It is definitely
      not worth $25, and if I had payed full price, then this review would be negative
      for sure. At the current price of $2.99 I don't feel like I wasted my money,
      but I do feel like I could have spent it better.
