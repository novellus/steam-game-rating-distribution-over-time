I originally praised this game in my gameplay and impressions video on Youtube, but after only a couple of updates he vanished. Many promises were made, almost none fulfilled so stay well clear and do not give this dev your money.\n\nOlder reviews:\n\nEdit: The game now supports full locomotion, snap turning etc.\n\nGameplay based on the latest update 9/8/18:\nhttps://youtu.be/DDYsKK9knVo\n\nSum is like a breathe of fresh air for survival games and in VR we have very little choice in them. In playing I found it immersive and fun and while the basics for a survival are there such as hunger, hydration, crafting and hunting, the game does need work.\n\nCheck out my gameplay video:\nhttps://youtu.be/wOW66hZ4Aaw\n\nI found the walking to be different, on the Rift you have to press and hold the stick in, then wave your arms in an exagerrated motion to walk. Currently there is no snap or smooth turning so you do need a 360 setup up, I have a 3 sensor Rift set up so it work good for me. It has a learning curve, but after my first play I had learned a lot and will be ready to survive much better on my next.\n\nThere is cooking in the game, even without the pans it is possible to cook basic recipes to help your hunger, just do not eat raw mushrooms as they will harm you.\n\nAt this time I don`t think you can build an actual base structure, but the dev has said he will be adding building, sickness, weather effects (it rains right now but does not effect you yet), more hunting and more!\n\nIf this dev sticks with it and continues development as promised this could be a really good survival game, right now it has gotten off to a very good start!","timestamp_created":1532855455,"timestamp_updated":1604254498,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwzZ/BwvUCf9eQpwE="}
