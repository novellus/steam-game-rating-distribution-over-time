    review: Very poor English setting. Got a very rough gist of what the game was
      trying to relay. May or may not be a better experience if you know Russian.
      There's not a lot going on anyways. Reuses a lot of the same sound effects and
      is a very linear experience, keep holding D and click spacebar when prompted
      with dialog. Quick play time, and due to the broken English it wasn't that great.
      Had to reload the final decision because the game would bug out and not let
      me click anything. On top of that the fullscreen mode lets your display scale
      and doesn't have resolution options. Money better spent elsewhere.
