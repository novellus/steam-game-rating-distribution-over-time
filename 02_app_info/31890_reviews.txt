It has fun puzzles, stories, and characters, but I felt like a large part of the game was playing secretary. And that ending... was everyone just standing outside rehearsing their bit while you were DYING????? Dear goodness, was that awkward! Anyways, I'd say the game was a 6-7/10; not fantastic, but not something I'd be bored playing again.","timestamp_created":1609932725,"timestamp_updated":1609932725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sPvd6/YCcuD8wAI="}
