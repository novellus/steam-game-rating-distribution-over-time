Most people already know what they are up to when buying a Sonic game, so I don't have to explain much. You are up to an too fast game with death traps everywhere, so expect to die a lot.\n\nTechnically you can play it up to a resoltion to 1920x1080 and besides looking a little blurry, it's fine.\n\n+ The cartoon intro and outro sequenzes are really good and well made.\n\nTime to finish the game: 2,2 hours","timestamp_created":1610053867,"timestamp_updated":1610054047,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40eKs7/YCfKmwwQI="}
