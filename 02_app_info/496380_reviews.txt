There's only three positives I can give this game:\n\n1. Nice soundtrack.\n2. Trigger free.\n3. Good for all ages.\n\nSo now here's the reason I have to give this an overall negative review:\n\n1. Monotonous gameplay lacking any incentive to keep playing.\n2. Only 3 minutes per day, meaning you don't have time to accomplish much.\n3. Lack of interest.\n4. Doesn't entertain or make you feel anything other than boredom.\n\nOverall, this isn't worth any price, except maybe Â£0.00","timestamp_created":1595278948,"timestamp_updated":1595278948,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48677670955657959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6p6Ct/MCc/zFlgI="}
