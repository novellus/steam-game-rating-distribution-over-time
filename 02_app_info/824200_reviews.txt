It wasn't something that I really enjoyed. If you're looking for something cute that won't tie you in emotionally, this is for you! It's also super short.\n\nHowever, I enjoy otomes that make me fall in love with the characters, and this one wasn't it.","timestamp_created":1599360737,"timestamp_updated":1599360737,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494809657335281372","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47oPVsPQCeKiKoAI="}
