The gun-wielding enemies (which become quite numerous in later levels) can turn around on a dime shoot instantly, which becomes awful in tight corners, where you can't just snipe them with shurikens from afar. Just baiting them can lead to instant death, and when they see you, there's not even a microsecond of delay before they shoot you. Deflecting the bullets with your sword can only get you so far, since, for some baffling reason, every time you deflect a bullet, the game puts you on a 5-second cooldown before you can do it again. This means that when you come up against enemies with SMGs, where they shoot multiple bullets per second, it becomes impossible to avoid dying. \n\nAlso, why bother making an achievement for each level for completing it without dying, when dying just restarts the entire level anyways? There's no challenge there; it just makes it so you have to exit to the main menu, go back to the hub, and restart the mission from there, just so you can reset your deaths. It's just more tedium for each time you die to those instakilling gun enemies, all so you can get those stupid hats. I've had enough of this game, and I'm glad I only paid around a dollar for it, though even that seems like too much for this sh*tty game.","timestamp_created":1576368536,"timestamp_updated":1576368536,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529703021049499512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnN+4g+8CcfSw5AE="}
