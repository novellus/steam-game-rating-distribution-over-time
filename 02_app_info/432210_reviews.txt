Hidden zone are everywhere and wont be marked so basically you gonna have to check ALOT of walls. But if you ever played some older RPG's you'll be right at home.\n","timestamp_created":1609343305,"timestamp_updated":1609343305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40sCV2vYCf+PnvgI="}
