Most of it is Match 3 puzzles, but here and there are a few other minigames, including Mahjong and Hidden Object segments.\n\nThe Match 3 puzzles are the simplest I've seen. Not much variety when it comes to combos or power-ups, which makes the solving of the puzzles tedious and too time consuming. If achievements were included at least there would be some incentive to go through so many similar and unremarkable levels.\n\nI'm not giving the game a negative review because the game works and it cost me pretty much nothing, since it came in a big bundle of games. Would I recommend it? Maybe to young kids and older folks, who can benefit from the slow and not challenging nature of the game. Other than that, there must be better options out there.","timestamp_created":1608964860,"timestamp_updated":1608964860,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhu3xzvYCfvylvQI="}
