    short_description: '''You Arrive in a Town'' is a level-based RPG-lite set in
      a tabletop fantasy world for 1-4 players. Slay monsters, loot tombs, help out
      the locals or just sell them some junk and move on - whatever works for you
      so long as you keep turning a profit. Oh, and saving the world too I guess.'
