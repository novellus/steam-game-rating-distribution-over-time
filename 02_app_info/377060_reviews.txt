The game looks good and is satisfying when you land tricks and flow through obstacles. There are bugs here and there, but nothing that ruined my ability to enjoy the game. If anything i got a laugh out of them and it made it seem more like a labour of love type project. There is a Discord community for the game that has some extra content like custom maps and mods as well.\n\nOverall it's a fun inline sandbox to play around in. It appears that the Dev/s are continuing work on it, which is encouraging. Lots of potential in this game if it were to introduce more customisation and park editor style features. Hope that the game can receive further funding as inline makes a resurgence.","timestamp_created":1609985815,"timestamp_updated":1609985815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4nb6o7fYCdq+VwQI="}
