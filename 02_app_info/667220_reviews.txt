We take so much for granted in the Western world with water and other food resources on tap.  There are communities where women and children have to walk to the nearest water hole sometimes over 15kms away every day.....hence their lack of education.\nAyo is mainly a platforming game and is quite difficult in parts.  Along the way you meet some spirits who help you by giving you gifts of humility, perseverance and wisdom.  You jump like a gazelle and have the strength of a boar.  The platforming side of play requires you to be quite nimble in your jumping skills and doing multiple things at once.  I am on a keyboard and it is playable on this.  I may have shortened a couple of my fingers from pounding the space bar....but I got there!!  :)\nYour environment varies from a desert to caves (you fall down), mountains and back to the desert.  You battle scorpions, thorn bushes, wild dogs, dust storms, lightning strikes, poisonous swamps and lava beds.  Many enemies and obstacles to overcome.....and you do, if you persevere!\nGraphics are simple but quite beautiful in places.  Music has an African beat to it and rises in a threatening tone when you have the boss fights.  The grammar in the few captions wasn't good, but seeing that the devs come from a non English background, that wasn't surprising.\nI quite enjoyed this game despite the difficulties.  I did learn a few new swear words along the way!!  Recommended.  8/10\nP.S.  There are achievements for this game, but no trading cards or badge\nP.P.S.  I forgot to mention that I was nearly eaten alive by mozzies!!!","timestamp_created":1597415462,"timestamp_updated":1597495986,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.722433090209960938","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9ciL+fMCeJ21mwI="}
