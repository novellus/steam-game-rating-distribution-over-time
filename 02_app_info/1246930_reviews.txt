I loved the original - particularly certain characters - and it is great that I can now install and play it under Steam.  Thanks for doing this!\n\nI only have a couple of minor critiques/suggestions:\n\n- The card art in the current version is a bit distracting.  I liked the more subdued version of the original a bit better.  Perhaps you could provide different card sets, and let the user choose to switch them out to the one they prefer?\n\n- I loved the game \"Tarot\" (actually French Tarot) in the original, and it is not available in this version.  Would you please bring back Tarot again?\n\nOtherwise, this is great!","timestamp_created":1609491075,"timestamp_updated":1609491075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+5nJ3vYCe+6rvwI="}
