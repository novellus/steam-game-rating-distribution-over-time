    review: "So far, I have played Mage Rage for 2.4 hours. I was originally planning\
      \ to sit down and try it for an hour but I got sucked in and played for almost\
      \ two and  a half hours and I think that speaks volumes for how entertaining\
      \ and addictive the game is. There is definitely work to be done on the game\
      \ but the devs seem committed to patching and improving where required. \nQuite\
      \ enjoyable, I would suggest to anyone who likes MOBA style games! \n\nFull\
      \ disclosure: I am friends with one of the devs and was thanked in the Credits\
      \ of the game,  but I paid for this copy of the game and I have given a truly\
      \ honest review here. Have a great day!!"
