It's cute, it's a little fun, but it's so limited on where you can go that it gets boring too fast and you just don't get your \"starfighter\" feeling that you're expecting enough.\n\nI won't give it a thumbs down but they REALLY need to make a \"thumbs middle\" rating for games because that's where this game is.","timestamp_created":1580505698,"timestamp_updated":1580505698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514925360679626465","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7eHe/u8Cf+Gy7wE="}
