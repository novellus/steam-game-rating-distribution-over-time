    developer_response: 'Thank you for your feedback fakk2981.  Very much appreciated.
      Good points. I will really think upon each of the ideas you presented here.

      One very easy update will be to include volume control on the main screen and
      save it, so I will get this done. There is an update coming out with a 60 minute
      workout option soon, but in the next update after that I will put volume control
      onto the start screen also. Plus make the master volume save in general.'

    review: "I love the idea here, the simple access to workout is quite good. The\
      \ game itself does need some work on quality and presentation. \nI suggest some\
      \ fixes / changes:\n-some character animations look unrealistic, I would suggest\
      \ all workouts would be recorded by mocap and applied to model.\n-ui is horrible\
      \ looking and needs some polish\n-main volume should be set on main screen and\
      \ also saved. Currently you only change volume while in workout and it does\
      \ not save.\n-would love a higher detail character, or more of them to chose\
      \ from. Possibly with shadow included, it would add to realism. Current character\
      \ has also a problem of clothes clipping into body at some poses."
