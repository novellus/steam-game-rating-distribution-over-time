    review: 'It''s a small top-down shooter game yet for the most feels really good.
      Big things you may notice is the camera rotating with the player and doors going
      spastic. The more you play it, the more you will get use to the camera. Doors
      can be your guardian angels or your soul crushing doom.


      For those who like a challenge, want an indie feel, don''t want to spend too
      much time grinding and just have fun. I would recommend this game to you.'
