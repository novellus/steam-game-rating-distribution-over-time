    about_the_game: "Unbound Early Access is the first experience designed with our\
      \ revolutionary PlayEngine technology. A fun sandbox that encourages playful\
      \ creation using virtual reality gear with tracked controllers, while enabling\
      \ two creators to collaborate in real time in the same space, on the same 3D\
      \ objects. <br><br>The initial Early Access launch includes:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Realtime collaboration</h2> Invite friends into the space and play or work\
      \ together over the internet.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sharp Features</h2>Our models\
      \ can uniquely represent organic shapes as well as more mechanical, CAD-like\
      \ objects.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiple Objects</h2>Unbound is built to go beyond\
      \ the modelling of a single object. Like a game engine, Unbound can have thousands\
      \ of objects in a scene. And every thing is always changeable.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Compact Models</h2>Unbound models are tiny when you save them. This makes sharing\
      \ a model over the network and bringing them into a collaborative space pretty\
      \ much instantaneous.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Physically Based Material System</h2>Mix\
      \ materials as you craft, sculpt or spay paint on models. The volume and surface\
      \ of creators edits are stored internally, for use during saves.<h2 class=\"\

      \ tools, whether it\u2019s game development, rendering or 3D printing.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\"><strong>Important Note:</strong></h2><strong>Unbound will only run\
      \ on NVIDIA GPUs for some time after launching in Early Access. Most of our\
      \ algorithms are heavy on GPU compute and as a small team, development really\
