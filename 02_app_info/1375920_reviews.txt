I really like that it's not instantly on an easy mode, but you rather start on a regular difficulty. The Music is awesome to listen to, what makes me more smile when doing mistakes then actual raging for my fails.\n\nTo the Developers (If you haven't checked the Video):\nPlease make a Windowed Mode (Or Windowed without Borders Mode)\nZoom Out -> Add maybe some Planets or a Sun for more Eyecandy\nStart Screen -> Could be a little bit more settle/quiter (just saw in my recording that it's actually louder then the Gameplay)\nAdding Scores -> Hit a Beat correctly gives Bonus Points, add a Marathon (Levels mixxed) with Highscores\nCo-op Mode Maybe? -> Are you and your friends in the same Heartbeat? ;)","timestamp_created":1602837577,"timestamp_updated":1602837577,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40o+kmPUCdeGUqAI="}
