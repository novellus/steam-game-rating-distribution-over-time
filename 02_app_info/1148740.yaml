    review: "This game was good and I enjoyed playing it. Each boss has a unique look\
      \ and design with new behaviours and powers. I really enjoyed the difference\
      \ and stages and levels in this game. \n\nThe lack of sound effects isn't ideal\
      \ and the music seems a bit repetitive after time. I would recommend this game,\
      \ however, I would get it on sale. 9/10"
