With incredibly tight controls, and 100 levels that scale in difficulty with pretty much perfect pacing Pinkman is an absolute steal at the price. If you are looking for a small gift for friends who really enjoyed playing through Super Meat Boy or Celeste this is it. The one issue I had with the game is that after a death the colour scheme changes and some of the colour schemes can make it harder to see projectiles. This is a relatively easy fix by just taking an extra death to change the colours again, just a bit of an annoyance if anything.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend grabbing this game if you are even slightly interested. You'll thank me.","timestamp_created":1609988907,"timestamp_updated":1609988907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/6O07fYCe7iWwQI="}
