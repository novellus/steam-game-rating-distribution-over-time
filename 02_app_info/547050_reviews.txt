It's something like sudoku or another logic puzzle, but the visuals are designed from the bottom up based on the rules of inference that you'll figure out as you play, which makes for a kind of minimalist appearance. If you're in the mood to spend an afternoon with some clever and well-designed puzzles, you ought to try it out. Overall it isn't all too complicated and the new elements are introduced at an even pace. I finished it in about 2 hours and enjoyed it a lot!","timestamp_created":1609648737,"timestamp_updated":1609648737,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rtGi4/YCfun6vwI="}
