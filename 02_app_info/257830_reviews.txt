If you ring the yellow bell before moving the ladder, the player is stuck and cannot progress. \n\nOriginal: Point and click. I did enjoy it last time I played, but now is buggy as... Pathing isn't always working. Sometimes I have to backtrack out of a room and back or all the way to the beginning area of a room before it will let me walk somewhere.\n\nWorst two I can think of now are the Kitchen (have to return to the platform sometimes to visit the caterpillar, even though you are already on the floor and the Plane Roof (I have the ladder tipped, and tell her to climb it, but she ALWAYS walks toward the little green bird on the lower beam. Since you cannot get past the bird until climbing the ladder, this game is now unplayable past that stage.)\n\nI was going through some of my old games and restarted this one to try to get that last achievement. With this bug, it is impossible. It might have helped if they gave you some sort of counter per room/ total to look for.  Even if it isn't in the game, it COULD have been implemented on the achievement. \n\nTLDR: Pathing makes this game unplayable. Achievements are overly difficult to figure out how close you are to done.  I cannot recommend this.","timestamp_created":1511162720,"timestamp_updated":1609397470,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538948476314544678","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws5Dk2/YCcovjiwE="}
