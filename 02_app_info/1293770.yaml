      /><i>The eternal harvester of galactic empires has returned!  Witness massive
      waves of Creeper flood across the 3D terrain in this real time strategy game
      where the enemy is a fluid.  Build out your economic base with energy and mined
      wares. Assemble your forces and struggle against the creeper on all fronts as
      it floods and fills the map.  Take the high ground with your forces to avoid
      the creeper as waves crash around your base.  Increase your lines of sight and
      range on high ground, but beware the aerial units.  And, if you last long enough,
      launch orbital weapons and call down devastating strikes on the enemy.</i><br><br>Creeper
      World 4 continues the iconic and well received Creeper World RTS franchise,
      expanding into a new dimension of strategic possibilities and threats. The galaxy
      once again finds itself culled and utterly in ruins. Guide a band of scientists
      through the ultimate test of survival and restore hope to the galaxy... one
      world at a time.  Play small maps casually, while pausing and issuing orders.
      Alternately, play massive maps in real-time with full save support.  The choice
      is yours.  Play the story missions, the community crafted missions, or use the
      built in mission generator for infinite possibilities.  Use the map editor to
      make your own maps for fun and sharing.  Create custom units, or even custom
      game play modes, and share those as well.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul
