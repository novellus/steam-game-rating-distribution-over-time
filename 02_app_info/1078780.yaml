    review: "I'm a fan of lane defense games, so I've enjoyed my time with Martians\
      \ Vs Robots.\nAt the moment, it's a fun, albeit short, game (to be fair, every\
      \ lane defense game feels short when compared to the original, Plants vs Zombies).\
      \ The core lane defense gameplay of generating resources in order to create\
      \ defenses in each lane is solid. There are a few issues that make it less than\
      \ it could be; some of them may be attributed to its Early Access, pre-final\
      \ status, some may be a little more concerning for fans of the sub-genre.\n\n\
      I present these here, in order of least concerning to most:\n- at the beginning\
      \ of the game, you can play with only three units per level...but you can only\
      \ choose one. The other two are selected for you randomly. This is actually\
      \ sort of a feature for me, as I enjoy the challenge of having to work with\
      \ odd combinations of units. But it does make the game highly variable in difficulty\
      \ right from the start. You can get combinations that are so difficult that\
      \ it makes the level effectively impossible.\n- the color palette is very drab,\
      \ as everything - Martians AND robots - is a uniform grey metal color. Not a\
      \ big deal to me, but it might bother others.\n- levels are \"graded\" with\
      \ stars upon completion, based on how many lanes were defended successfully.\
      \ This makes Martians Vs Robots feel like a mobile game. I don't particularly\
      \ like that feel; I much prefer the idea of getting a score in a lane defense\
      \ game. \n- there is no information in the game about any of the units outside\
      \ of the levels themselves. So when you are selecting the one unit you can choose\
      \ for a level, you can't know what it does or how much of which resource(s)\
      \ it takes to build one of them, unless you've used them before and remember\
      \ those details. Even when playing the level, you only know how much the units\
      \ cost; you don't know how tough they are, how much damage they do, what range\
      \ their attacks have (or even if they are attacking units), how much energy\
      \ they produce, etc. etc. You also have no information about the enemy units\
      \ anywhere in the game. I found this exhausting after a while, not knowing whether\
      \ units I haven't used before would even be relevant to the level I was about\
      \ to attempt. This lack of information within the game is a big drawback, for\
      \ me.\n- when you create a unit right in front of an enemy, the enemy ignores\
      \ it and just walks through it (the only exception are what I call the proximity\
      \ mines). A common tactic in lane defense games when you're desperately trying\
      \ a last-ditch defense of a lane is to place a unit - any unit - in front of\
      \ the attackers to delay them long enough to be able to place something more\
      \ effective (and more expensive). This doesn't work in Martians Vs Robots -\
      \ if you place something in the same coordinate as the attacker, or in the coordinate\
      \ just to the left of the attacker, the attacker will walk right through it\
      \ as if there was nothing there. This is particularly bad when the unit you're\
      \ placing is a wall, whose only purpose is to block enemies, but in general,\
      \ this is just broken.\n\nThis game is in Early Access, and it's both playable\
      \ and enjoyable. But at least those last two problems should be addressed before\
      \ the game goes to final release."
