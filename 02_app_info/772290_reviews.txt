Great story.  \n\nOnly issue I had was the notebook.  I'm assuming notes could have been viewed but I could only view the to-do list even when pressing the keys to switch pages.  Had trouble coming out of the notebook, pressing N again didn't close it.  I found that double pressing M  to open and close the map was an easy way of coming out of it.  Either that or press Esc and click Resume.","timestamp_created":1609951043,"timestamp_updated":1609951043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42+uj7PYCc+6FwQI="}
