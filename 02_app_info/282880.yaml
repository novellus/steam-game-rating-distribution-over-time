    review: 'What on earth could I tell about this move of yours? I feel ashamed in
      the place of the dev. Congrats on fooling lots of ppl who were trusted in you
      and payed 30 euros for this. Then after loads of promises you have done nothing,
      just made this free to play, and tell the poor souls after 2 years of waiting:
      sorry, ask steam for refund... *huge claps for you*'
