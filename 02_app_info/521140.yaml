    about_the_game: <strong>King Machine is a game about building machines.</strong>
      Explore an abandoned factory, finding useful machinery and gradually building
      the tools and structures you need to restore the factory to operation. What
      was the original purpose of the factory and why was it shut down? To achieve
      complete control you will eventually need to confront and overcome the powerful
      machines protecting the factory's most critical resources.<br><br><strong>Freedom
      of Approach</strong> - King Machine is not a puzzle game. There are no predesigned
      solutions to any obstacle and you can build whatever machines you wish to overcome
      challenges. Whether you prefer elegant machines, baroque contraptions that barely
      work or sneaky hacks that bypass challenges entirely it's all fair play!<br><br><strong>Reuse
      / Repurpose</strong> - You can transport machines between locations within the
      factory, so if you've build some masterpiece to solve a problem you don't have
      to do all the work again in the next area.
