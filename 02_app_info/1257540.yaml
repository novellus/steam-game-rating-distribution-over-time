    review: 'A competently made Tower Defense title.


      Graphics are minimal but very good and there is a challenge to be had with the
      placement a positioning of towers. Wouldn''t mind the ability to zoom out a
      bit more.


      Still needs a bit of work for a few more  "bells and whistles", but for an initial
      release its fairly promising.'
