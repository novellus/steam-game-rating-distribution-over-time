Landscapes and enemy sprites are gorgeous, and the game has a wide variety of settings for the player to enjoy. Most importantly, it has an amazing soundtrack. There's lots of themes, drawing primarily from the 8-bit scene, and they're just so good. It's definitely a musical masterpiece. Also, props for managing to capture that well the spirit of Castlevania's musical ambiance in Act 3.\n\nNow apart from the mostly ok level design, there are numerous major issues going on on the gameplay side. I did not mind regular enemies' patterns as much as most bad reviews around. To me, the trick generally comes down to understanding the right timings for attacking and backing off. The real problem for me is the actual combat mechanics. 1) You devs seriously need to stop with combo attacks. If you can't do it right, having only one regular attack will do just fine, and nobody's gonna complain about it. 2) The sword lacks range, plain and simple. An extra bit of range would have avoided unnecessary frustration, as a lot of the time, when you land a hit on an enemy, you're gonna get hit as well for ramming into its hurtbox, even though you had an attack timing that would be more than correct in a lot of platformers.\n\nThe platforming also has a massive cheap punishment potential. The game requires a clear input from you to grab ladders and ledges, so 1) maintaining the up direction won't work, resulting in a small time loss in both horizontal and vertical progress, which the sometimes really tight level design is going to punish hard. 2) it's up for ladders and forward for ledges. Given the massive amount of stuff you need to grab in this game, this is inevitably leading to moments of confusion when you'll be falling for a cheap reason. 3) You need to be prepared to miss an occasional grab, there again leading to a lot of frustration, due to both a sometimes overly demanding level design and a sometimes ridiculous number of consecutive grabs to pull off.\nBasically, this game manages to make an issue of something that should be intuitive and unnoticeable.\n\nNow when it comes to the bosses, it's a fiasco. First, almost every single boss in the game has a ton of health. Not a problem in se, but given they're always either very easy once you figured out their patterns, or still pretty hard, either because there's a lot of RNG and stuff flying around at the same time, or they have a shield and let you attack once every blue moon, it's just boring and unrewarding. Not to mention the fact that your character's rather slow and has a teeny tiny range, which makes most boss fights tedious on its own. Also, most bosses have downright uninteresting patterns. Some of them are just not creative, and others overuse gimmicks that would belong in a shmup rather than a platformer (fighting a flying boss on moving platforms is fine [i]once in a while[/i]. It's fun when it's unexpected, but it's not a clever pattern at all, especially when they're moving fast in spiral-shaped rotations while a massive hurtbox in the middle of the stage keeps firing homing bullets at you. Yes, that's the final boss, and it was a major letdown.)\n\nDespite a big yes on the audio side, I can't recommend this game. It's not a unique experience, only a mediocre platformer (and a damned overpriced one, on top of that.)","timestamp_created":1593773838,"timestamp_updated":1602253564,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553413808345794678","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhqXwhvUCdMa3kgI="}
