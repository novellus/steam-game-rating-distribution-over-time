I really wanted to like this game because it legit looks awesome! <3\n\nBut-- the lack of a graphical options menu has made the game unplayable for me. My FOV is all messed up somehow and I can't pick any items up which basically ends the game for me. \n\nI'm going to give this a 'No' for now. I would love to change my review, but I need to be able to play the game. The last update was in August. Hopefully the Dev comes back and adds that menu, which would allow me (and many others who are having the same problems) to enjoy the game. \n\nFingers crossed, friends! :)","timestamp_created":1604326046,"timestamp_updated":1604326046,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605003297328948975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk5fSxPUCde3mqwI="}
