Fun game but if you are a stickler like me for realism, don't play. But if you are even more like me you will love this game the more you play it.\n\nPros:\nAssigned weapons and uniforms\nVariety of classes (guns)\nVariety of Maps (battle)\nEasy to figure out menu\nGreat visuals\n\nCons:\nNeeds fixing on certain maps (will change)\nBot limiting and easy to crash (probably will change)\nAfter a while the battles get boring unless you like repetitiveness\n\nAll-in-all its a great game and special to the genre!","timestamp_created":1609984809,"timestamp_updated":1609984809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gtOk7fYCe4OVwQI="}
