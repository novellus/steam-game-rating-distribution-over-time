It is extremely poorly executed. There is absolutely no integration with the base game. No thought has been put into this DLC whatsoever, because in the end I have created better parks in vanilla.\n\n1. You cannot place parks from the base game in your park areas. You are limited to a handful of new silly park assets \n from the Parklife menu. WHAT. THE. HELL.\n2. You cannot place unique buildings in your park areas. COME. ON.\n3. The 'Parkify' mod will allow you to overcome 1. and 2. However, when these are placed in your park areas, they will persistently demand policing, fire services, garbage collection, hearses, just like every building outside your park area. This means that you have no choice but to create road access to these parks, ultimately defeating the very purpose of a pedestrian-only park area advertised by this DLC.\n\nSo in the end, pedestrian-only parks are but a myth. I have created better parks in the base game with the game's existing parks and unique buildings.\n\nThis DLC boils down to a bunch of silly props and some cool looking zoos.\n\nWaste of money even at a sale.","timestamp_created":1609841929,"timestamp_updated":1609841929,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ss2D6fYCd5rUwAI="}
