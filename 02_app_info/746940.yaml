    short_description: Crazy, physics-driven, four-player marathon across Japan. Combining
      classic racers like Micro Machines and the insanity of TV's Takeshi's Castle,
      smash through offices and shopping malls and hurl fruit at your opponents in
      a party game unlike anything you've played before!
