    review: Basically Prideful Viridian, and you pretty much have quite a lot of his
      already existing pallet swaps, so if you like a lot of their colors, why not
      buy this and have them all at once for $2.99? (Though, as far as I'm aware,
      I'm not sure if the cycle contains every single of Captain Viridian's colors,
      but I may need to recheck that)
