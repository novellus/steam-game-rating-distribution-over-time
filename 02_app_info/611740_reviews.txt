Best to wait on one o' them sale thingamajigs, methinks.\n\n   Verdict: 7.5/10.\n\n   UPDATE: Alright, so I've warmed up to this one a bit of late. Short but sweet, and I do love the low-tech gorgeousness of it all. An easy recommendation to synth fans.\n\n   Revised Verdict: 8.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1529140884,"timestamp_updated":1586439313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580446779727935791","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45trJr/ECfuuOowE="}
