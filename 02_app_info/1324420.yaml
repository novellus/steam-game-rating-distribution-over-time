    review: 'A good game with lots of promise hampered by small issues.


      I say this for a lot of these games that come from Choice of Games, they are
      too short and in a lot of cases it really hurts the experience. This is one
      of those cases. Granted this game is still enjoyable and even though it is short
      it still manages to be fun enough. However because it is so short it doesn''t
      get enough time to flesh out the characters motivations, personalities and stories
      outside of passing remarks or Daichi''s past/reasoning. So becuase of that everything
      feels rushed and you never really get to settle into the world enough to be
      immersed in it. However, the writer managed to still make the experience enjoyable
      and the game fun to play.


      The biggest area I think a lot of this CoG could be improved is by including
      tags to options that specifically state what stat the options use to make the
      choice. More often than not options are so vague that you cannot tell what stat
      it is using, and it was particularly annoying in this instance as certain abilities
      use specific stats but it doesn''t tell you which ones. So you could choose
      Mind Control as your main focus and continually choose options that focus on
      it but as you don''t know what stat it uses, and it doesn''t have its own stat,
      more often than not it will not work. Even if you have used it at every opportunity.
      This is a problem with all the games from CoG, not Fox Spirit specifically,
      but it must be brought to attention.


      Regardless even with the issues I have I enjoyed the game. I''d give it a 6/10.'
