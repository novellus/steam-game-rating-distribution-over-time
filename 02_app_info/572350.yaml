    review: I would really like Craftmas and would like to have other people try it,
      but it's been broken since day one. At some point, while you're crafting ornaments
      and putting them on your tree, something you grab won't let go. It happens every
      time. Too bad cause I like the concept and the execution, but when you get stuck
      because you can't let go of the last thing you grabbed, it all goes south. Please  fix
      this issue, so I can change my review to positive.
