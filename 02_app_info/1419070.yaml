    review: 'Quite the fun game, while just launching into Early Access at the time
      of this review it has all of the necessary things for the game to be great fun.
      The roster is large and diverse and you will definitely find something to love
      here in the wide variety of designs for the monsters. I''m going to break up
      this review into a few different parts.


      Gameplay: The game is a monster taming game mixed together with roguelike elements.
      This has you catching monsters and adding them to your party while choosing
      your adventure basically by choosing between a list of generated options each
      path you clear. These appear to offer shops, evolution shrines, random events,
      and random encounters among story related events. As I said each path is generated
      meaning each run should theoretically be different for you. I definitely came
      across a variety of path choices and Mython to catch in these events so it definitely
      has me wanting to play more to see them all. Overall the battle system is pretty
      good, it''s type based advantages and disadvantages with a stamina or mana meter
      that you have to manage throughout the run. Pretty good balance but the start
      of the run could be ironed out a bit more to help ease you in at least in story
      mode.


      Sound: The music was pretty good overall, I really enjoyed the battle themes
      the most and that is a good thing as that is what you''ll be hearing most of
      the time while in the encounters. Some themes didn''t really grab me as much
      as others like the title theme for instance but overall the sound was very enjoyable,
      and as the sound relates to the battle effects and animations it all hits the
      mark very well.


      Graphics: The style is really unique, I really enjoy the high variety of color
      and toon like graphics. It meshes very well with the overall environments of
      the game and the monster designs. I''d love to be able to explore the environments
      and see what they have to offer personally.


      Overall the game gets a big recommend from me, I''ve only played a bit so far
      but I already can tell I will be coming back for more. Even in Early Access
      it offers a very enjoyable gameplay loop and  you will need multiple runs of
      the game if you want to experience everything it has to offer. The price point
      is very  reasonable for what is here currently, I''m excited to see what else
      gets added to this game over time.'
