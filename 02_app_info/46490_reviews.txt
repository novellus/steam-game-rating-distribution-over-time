Worst follow up to two good games since Penumbra Requiem maybe? Granted Requiem at least tried something new while failing. Still Life 2 is just a very worst version of a good game. And that sucks because you kind of need to play it to get the complete ending to the main plot of the first one.\n\nI'm going to go rather in depths with every aspects of this one. If you are just not interested in the details, I have TL;DR section in the end for you. But this one hurts a bit, so I need to relieve the stress and anguish of going through it.\n\n-Production value:\n\nVisually speaking, it's ugly by 2009 standard, the year of Assassin's Creed II, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves or Batman: Arkham Asylum. But even compared to a 2004 game (let's sayyy...Still Life 1) it appalling. The backgrounds are not pre-rendered this time, leaving us with over-exposed, badly textured, and washed out places, lacking the grit and the details any screen of Still Life, hell even Post Mortem could provide. Oh, there are travelling cameras now, that's a thing. The character models look worse than the first, though I can't say if it's because of the inept animations or the light. The character goes bonker everytime you try to align the way the game wants you to look at something. The game doesn't let you change gamma or brightness, so you are stuck with the bright visuals that don't work. It just looks silly and every attempt at cinematography falls irremediably flat on its face.\n\nThat's a problem since Still Life 2 is a serious noire detective story at heart and the atmosphere greatly suffers from the visuals. But you know what? My favorite game from a year later was Deadly Premonition. So it looks bad, but I'd be okay with that.\n\nWell it sounds bad too. In Still Life 2, there is even less direction than the previous two. Claire is the only okay voice in the game, and the rest is juste soooo bad. The vilain, especially considering how important having him being threatening is to the tension of the game, is so cheesy; every single moment of intimidation in the Saw-like moments of the game, I was rolling my eyes. And let's just avoid the whole \"lipsynch\" part to not upset anyone.\n\nThe sound design uses basic samples, repetitive loops for every room (the damned rats e_e) and sometimes flat out doesn't work, with muted scenes here and there. But the music is not bad.\n\n-The actual game:\n\nOkay, so it looks cheap, is sounds cheap, we got it. What's the game though? Well, it's a less than mediocre P&C. And I guess this is mostly a lack of talent and/or experience from the team at GameCo that did only this one game.\n\nSo far, I judged the game in comparison to the previous titles in the saga. I don't think it's uninteresting or unfair (I mean I did it, so I'm okay with that) but at some point I need to actually explain why it can't even be good on its own terms. And most of the problems could have been avoided with the exact same budget, and arguably with even less money.\n\nThe controls:\nBelieve it or not, Still Life 2 has bad controls, which is a first as far as can recall for a P&C adventure game. The great thing about this genre or at least this presentation of this genre, is the fact that it's easy to pick up; you just click where you want to go or on the things you want to interact with. Whereas in any P&C with pre-rendered backgrounds (2D and 3D) you have often clear indications of where to exit or enter a screen, with a system like the one in Still Life 2, you can't just click on the place you want to go. Since you are in a 3D space with fixed but not too fixed cameras, you kind of need to push your character towards the edges of a screen/scene so that the camera changes, before clicking on where you want to go. Except it doesn't work smoothly. It's like playing Resident Evil with momentum in the movement. And believe me, it can be annoying even in small spaces. \n\n\nThe second problem is the hitboxes of the objects; you have those who are a bit small for the size of the object, and then you have a few that are plain and simple not on the object itself. Not that big of a deal overall, but you can miss object you've clicked on ten times before.\n\nYou also have a skip button for the dialogues BUT, though you can skip the lines alright, you don't always skip the animation linked to it; meaning if there is a five seconds animation of your character saying \"what is this blood?\" and you skip the sound, you still get to see the full animation.\n\nAll of this make for a very tedious game to just explore. And that's too bad because I kind of like the direction they were going with the gameplay.\n\n-The mechanics:\nYou are playing several characters, one of them being Victoria, main character of Still Life, and the other being stuck with the killer, dealing with his shinanigans (I guess Saw/Hostel was still popular in 2009). So with Victoria, you have a detective story; you search places, try to establish connections, and find all the items. And with the other character, you have more a classic P&C experience with a puzzle in every room, but contextualized as a sadistic game made up by the killer.\n\nFine. Except no. And I need to be specific for this part.\n\n-I guess that we've...found our manYEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH\nWith Victoria you have three things to keep track of: 1) a cellphone, 2) a CSI kit, 3) an grid-based inventory. \n\n1) With the cellphone you can look at the dossier on the killer,informations you gathered, and you can call Claire the coroner to update the case with the informations you found. This is cumbersome in terms of navigation but more problematic, it's unclear. You especially don't really know when to call Claire because some information you find can seem important but aren't to the game. And sometimes she is the one calling you to update you on a clue you found and again, you don't know why now and not earlier or later. So it's inconsistent. In the middle of the game, you need to find every godam clue in a three story house complete with hidden rooms, back yard, front yard, balcony...and if you miss something that the game wants for Claire to call, you need to search EVERYWHERE again.\n\n2) The CSI kit is alright by my book. It's just a neat diegetic gate between you and plot points..\n\n3) This serve absolutely no purpose except slowing down exploration and puzzle solving. It has no element of choice to it so reason to exist for Vic or the other character.\n\nAnd all this makes the investigation more tedious than compelling, engaging or involving. You don't have more tools to analyse the crime scenes or surmise where the scenario is going. You just have more layers between you and picking up an object. And even though I kind of like the CSI kit for the immersion factor, it's not interesting mechanically\n\n-I want to play a game...\nAnd with the second character you need to keep track of: 1) a recorder, 2) a cellphone, 3) the same grid-based inventory system.\n\n1) Doesn't serve much purpose except with a couple of puzzles that uses information from a recording. And that's fine.\n\n2) Doesn't work most of the time so...yeah.\n\n3) I already said that it didn't make sense in this game.\n\n-The puzzles\nI do realise that I didn't even mention the challenge. Well, there are no contender to the worst lock-picking mini-game ever; that honor still goes to Still Life (second being Post Mortem). That's a good thing. Other than that, it's not a hard game. You get stuck only when you didn't search well enough\n\n\nTL;DR If not for the controls and the convoluted ways you interact with the clues and items, it would be a mediocre to (sometimes) decent P&C with a dumb storyline. But the tedium of just manipulating the character, the mind boggling choice of having this grid-based inventory and the overall botched presentation, just insulting to the masterpieces that were the pre-rendered backgrounds from Still Life, drop the game in the bad category. Stay away from this one. It's very annoying to play and hard to look at.","timestamp_created":1585816990,"timestamp_updated":1609980959,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589993536472320557","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kfuV7fYCf7Kp/QE="}
