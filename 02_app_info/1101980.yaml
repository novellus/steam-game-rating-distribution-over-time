    about_the_game: 'The past of Baishizhou is an independent game that I have been
      playing at home for more than one year. The number of developers is one person.
      Unlike most independent developers who like to buy art resources of the mall,
      the author makes his own resources;<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1101980/extras/gifhome_610x205-001.gif?t=1597467019"
      /><br>The first inspiration is to play some simulation games, I always think
      that the characters of simulation games can''t have their own plot, so I plan
      to make a game with plot and simulation method by myself. As for the background,
      why should I choose Baishizhou in Shenzhen? Because the developers have lived
      in Baishizhou, I think it''s closer to the local culture of Chinese common people,
      and more able to Resonate;<br>Because the game didn''t plan to be an open world
      in the first place, but after a period of time, we found that the open perspective
      is more immersive, so we used the open world perspective to cut into the game
      development, but this also determined that this became a large development volume,
      so we decided to launch the first chapter and then make subsequent updates.
      The game has about 10 chapters at present, and the current content is equivalent
      to the whole game 1/10;<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1101980/extras/gifhome_610x205-003.gif?t=1597467019"
      /><br>The current nature of the game is still preemptive experience. Only because
      I developed the steam game for the first time and seldom used steam before,
      I was not clear about the preemptive experience version, so I didn''t launch
      the preemptive experience on the system, but the direct formal version. Later,
      I knew that it couldn''t be changed to the preemptive experience version, because
      the system already thought it couldn''t be changed after release;<br>Fortunately,
      the trial version is now available for free download. You can download the trial
      version for the game first, and then you can buy the official version if you
      like;<br>The trial version provides novice map and Chapter 1 content. The content
      of the current official version is almost the same as that of the trial version,
      but the future game content will only be updated in the official version<br><img

      /><br>Q&amp;A---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Q:
      Is the game an open world game?<br>A: The game is played in an open world game
      mode, but it is not an open world with a huge map, but a compact map. There
      is only one street in the real Baishizhou (explained below on the geographical
      knowledge of Baishizhou). Although Baishizhou is small, there are many shops,
      and its population density is very high. There are 150,000 people living in
      it! It is in these places that the game unfolds its story.<br><br>Q: Why is
      the place of the game Baishizhou?<br>A: Firstly, the author of the game lived
      here for more than two years and was very familiar with it. Secondly, considering
      the cost of production, it is impossible for him to make a huge map like a large
      team. As for the old Baishizhou reform, the author has set up a project and
      made almost the same one. Some people have told him that he knows about the
      old change, which is not mentioned in the game at present.<br><br>Q: Is the
      game a part-time simulator?<br>A: There are simulation games in the game. Part-time
      work is only one part of them. There will be more simulation games in the future
      updates, such as disco (soon to be launched), such as hospitals (later versions).
      These places can also be consumed except for part-time work. Of course, the
      current version has no other consumption besides diet, but it will soon be launched.
      Free updates will have other consumption patterns<br><br>Q: Why not make a huge
      map of the game?<br>A: First of all, considering the cost of personal production,
      one cannot make a huge map, but this is not the most important reason.<br><br>The
      author himself spends much more time playing simulated life than playing open
      world games, so he prefers simulated play. Referring to the map of simulated
      life is actually compact, because the map simulation is not easy to develop,
      and more is based on the plot. Considering the cultural background, China''s
      national conditions tend to be compact. This is not to say that China is small,
      but that most people actually work in a two-point, one-line mode. If you make
      a big map and drive freely everywhere, it is more like a sparsely populated
      country. In China, you may have to make a traffic jam simulation just like China,
      so even if I have a lot of money. It''s a tendency to make compact maps.<br><br>Weibo:
