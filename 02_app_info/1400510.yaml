      /><br><br>Castle Rock Beach, West Australia is a short exploration/photography
      experience set in a spectacular stretch of coastline in Australia's south west.
      Use the game's camera to observe and interact with the world around you while
      exploring and completing photo-related objectives. The game has in important
      focus on immersion and not holding your hand, your attentiveness and eagerness
      to explore will be rewarded with access to hidden areas and new features. The
      game also includes an immersive curated soundtrack courtesy of Chillhop Music,
      This is definitley one for turning down the lights and wearing headphones.<br><br><img

      /><br><br>This project started out as a showcase of my work in environment design,
      I wanted to create a realistic, densely forested scene using photoscanned 3d
      assets that could run smoothly in real-time. The environment was created in
      Unreal Engine 4 with heavy reference to photos taken at the location, You'll
      encounter crashing waves, dense bushland, secluded beaches and long stretches
      of Australian country road, a lot of which resemble the appearance of the real
      location. As I spent more time on this I began to build on some camera mechanics
      I thought added a unique/personal level of interactivity to the experience.
      I hope the atmosphere and ambience created by the environment will keep you
      coming back when you're stressed.<br><br>Some Extra Reccomendations:<br>- Personalise
      the soundtrack! Feel free to pause the in-game music and play your own in the
      background.<br>- The VR version is a great way to be immersed in the world but
      I'd still recommend the desktop version as the best way to experience the game.<br>-
      Please try to avoid looking for online guides if you're feeling impatient. Often
      what you're looking for will only take a few extra minutes to discover.<br><br>Thanks
      so much for your support on this title and my other games. I'll be in the discussions
      section as much as possible to listen to feedback and talk about potential new
      features.<br>- Matt<br><br>Also features an extensive sountrack thanks to friends
