If you expect a lot of jumpscares i am going to disappoint you. There are moments that Kraven Manor will scare you and make you cry but these are few throughout the whole game. What makes this game an absolute must have in your library is the dark and creepy atmosphere and the general feeling that there is someone, something behind you the whole time. A very beautiful game with gorgeous graphics that will make you forget it's an indie one.\nThe mechanic that allows you to interact with miniature rooms in order to gain entrance to the same rooms in the manor is innovative and brings a fresh breath to the genre.\nPuzzles are not very hard to solve but neither too easy to think the game is failing. The only negative aspect of the game is the fact that is short. It will take you 50 mins - 1 hour max to finish. The great ending though will make you forget about that very fast. You should buy Kraven Manor if you are looking for a true horror experience.","timestamp_created":1412162333,"timestamp_updated":1609860514,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.595868945121765137","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjcDK6fYCc9X7Lg=="}
