    about_the_game: "Monty lay back on his sun lounger and contemplated his situation.\
      \  His<br />\r\nprevious adventures had financed these last few years of utter\
      \ bliss.<br />\r\nHe had everything that a mole could want.  His own island\
      \ in the sun,<br />\r\nmore money than a mole could ever spend - paradise! \
      \ Listening to the<br />\r\nclear blue sea lapping at his furry feet, he surveyed\
      \ his surrondings<br />\r\nand saw nothing but unspoiled beauty.  In the last\
      \ few days, thoughts<br />\r\nhad appeared in his mind - he somehow missed the\
      \ days of his<br />\r\nadventuring.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMonty closed his eyes\
      \ and decided to take forty winks.  Then the sun<br />\r\nseemed to dim on his\
      \ eyelids.  &quot;Just a passing cloud&quot;, he thought.<br />\r\nBut within\
      \ seconds, the whole island was shrouded in darkness.<br />\r\nOpening his eyes\
      \ he saw that the island was covered by one large<br />\r\ncloud.  From the\
      \ cloud, rays of light beamed out which swirled and<br />\r\ndarted over the\
      \ terrain as though they were looking for something.  He<br />\r\nsaw a ray\
      \ of light advancing towards him and felt &quot;butterflies&quot;<br />\r\n\
      errupting into a frenzy in his stomach.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nHOW TO PLAY THE GAME<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is a shooter platformer genre\
      \ played over five levels.  <br />\r\nYou are able to select levels 1 to 4 at\
      \ random, but to play level 5, <br />\r\nyou must have completed the previous\
      \ four levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach level contains food and supplies to help\
      \ you on your travels.<br />\r\nYou may find a friendly shop keeper.  Spend\
