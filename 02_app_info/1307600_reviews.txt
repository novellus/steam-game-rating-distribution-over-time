Readily evident from the initial release of [i]Steel Division 2[/i] in three (3) different price/content offers and the announced plans to compartmentalise future content in a multitude of paid DLCs, which as it can already be seen so far, are also fairly overpriced for their price/content ratio.\n[*]Sympathetic arguments towards the developer/publisher (which are both [i]Eugen Systems[/i]) have been made, stating their \"need to make money (profit)\" and that this DLC was put together after \"the community's popular demand for divisions from the previous game\". Since the release of [i]Steel Division: Normandy 44[/i], there is the constant impression that [i]Eugen Systems[/i] are facing unrecoverable financial difficulties, for which the community has shown incredible amounts of sensitivity, by buying their products just for the incentive to support their development efforts. Personally, I have surpassed that foolish impulse and can verily state that;\n[/olist]\n\n[b]I have never managed to justify the full price of [i]Eugen Systems[/i]'s products, to the actual quality/content ratio they objectively do deliver[/b].\n\n[h1]Phase B.\nThe agenda behind the DLCs.[/h1]\n[u]The release of a \"community's popular demand\" DLC would actually mean that;[/u]\n\n[olist]\n[*]There is a certain knowledge, that enough of the people who asked for the DLC's content would actually buy it, preferably at whichever \"reasonable\" price they are offered (obviously aiming for the maximum profit deriving from a \"on demand/ custom-tailored\" product).\n[*]This marketing approach obviously leaves no room for owners of [i]Steel Division Normandy 44[/i], whether they have invested money into its DLCs or not, to receive this \"rehashed\" content for free, unlike the [i]Steel Division 2: Back to War[/i] DLC, which requires you to own only the [i]Steel Division: Normandy 44[/i] base game. Not even at a symbolic price, honouring their loyalty and continued commitment for buying [i]Steel Division Normandy 44[/i] as well as taking a leap of faith and buying even [i]Steel Division 2[/i]. \n[*]As far as it is known [i]Eugen Systems[/i] did not announce any donation to a WW2 related organisation, making all the more obvious the marketing trick of the \"Tribute to D-Day\" listing of the DLC, mudding the purpose of its development. Was it the need for a little extra income, deriving from the satisfaction of a \"popular demand\" or paying their respects to the fallen soldiers? Because, at the bottom line, both motives seem to be horrendously irrelevant.\n[*]Yet again, their horrible marketing is evident, since handing out the [i]Steel Division 2: Back to War[/i] DLC for free to [i]Steel Division Normandy 44[/i] base game owners was aiming to lower the risk/satisfaction ratio of buying [i]Steel Division 2[/i] in its \"under development\" state after its official release, by offering a familiar point of game-play and the illusion of being able to play part of the new game \"for free\" (you have to buy [i]Steel Division 2[/i] to play with the \"old\" divisions after all).\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]Phase C.\nConclusion.[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*]About the DLC itself? Well nothing more or better than you would play in [i]Steel Division Normandy 44, by itself[/i]. \n\n[b]The most interesting benefits are that you get to relive content of the previous game, with updated graphics and most worryingly, mechanics.[/b]\n[list]\n\n[*]Mechanics that should have been patched in [i]Steel Division Normandy 44[/i], like the range finding tool in heightened terrain. \n[*]As for the graphics, while just a notch above, compared to those of the previous game, the in-game settings lack variety and flexibility, hampering the users' ability to customise them in-depth, as they please, offering only generic settings, befitting of a console release.\n[/list]\n\n[*]Is this game/DLC bad? Not really. It just falls flat.\n\n[*]Is it not worth its price-tag? Not really. Wait for at least a 75%+ discount.\n\n[*]Is the publisher bad/evil though? Not really. Just compromised.\n[/olist]\n\n[b][u]Interestingly enough, I am unable to say that it is good or that it would be worth it, at any rate. Horrible and exploitative marketing policies tend to overstate their presence in this one.[/u][/b]\n\n[i]And hence I have paid the price of admittance, to publish my opinion in this review.\nStill wondering how some people received this DLC for free and why all of their reviews are positive....[/i]\n\n[b]For me it's a 2/10, due to lack of innovative, new and rich content, compared to the inflated price.[/b]\n\n[h1]Critical Update[/h1]\n\n[i]On top of that, the community is an abusive and toxic mix of underage kids and fanatical and addicted zealots, while the developers represent a wall of immoral and ungrateful hypocrites, incapable of accepting criticism and improving meaningfully on their beta program, harbouring personal attacks and abusive practises on the forums, as long as they come from their loyal subjects and projected towards \"deviants\". On top of that they abuse their moderator privileges to shut down any opposition and conflicting opinion to their predatory corporate interests (masked by low quality content marketing). Disgusting and horrible mentalities no decent customer would consider being related with or wasting their time and money on their BETA-quality products, instead staying away from supporting their predatory and discriminating practises, by avoiding the funding of their survival as corporate and physical entities.[/i]\n\n[h1]Good luck and have fun.[/h1]\n\n[b]Thank you all for supporting this review. I really appreciate the special content awards![/b]\n[i]We are consumers with rights and decency, demanding fair prices for the content we are sold and not silly cash cows to be milked and taken advantage of our interest for WW2. I hope this review made it evident to all potential buyers, valuing their money, at the sacrifice of my wallet, so that they don't have to be exploited due to their potential lack of seasoned experience on the matter, based on which this timely review was published or due to their unconditional love for WW2 content. This is a wake up call, in which I cannot find anything funnier than the zealots unwilling to accept it, because it would mean their (merciful) immediate and ultimate demise, as opposed to slow and painful mental decay.
