    about_the_game: "The 58th year of Shouwa, early summer.<br>It\u2019s June, and\
      \ the summer heat has arrived earlier than it does most years. <br>By day there\
      \ are crickets, and by night there are cicadas. <br><br>We\u2019re in Hinamizawa,\
      \ a small village in the countryside. <br>There are fewer than two thousand\
      \ people here. But every year, there is an event. <br><br>This event is a mysterious\
      \ death. <br><br>On a certain day in June, someone dies, and someone else goes\
      \ missing. <br>The series of deaths is connected to the upheaval surrounding\
      \ the dam construction project. <br>A murder case that was covered up is being\
      \ reenacted. <br>Is it a conspiracy? A coincidence? Or perhaps a curse? <br><br>Someone\
      \ who was supposed to be there isn\u2019t. <br>Someone who wasn\u2019t supposed\
      \ to be there is. <br><br>Someone who was alive last night is dead now. <br>And\
      \ someone who is here right now isn\u2019t alive. <br><br>So, there is no way\
      \ to avert tragedy. There is no choice but to give up. <br><strong>But don\u2019\
      t give up. </strong><br><br>Only you can stand up to this."

    review: In my opinion, this is the best of the question arcs so far. This arc
      was simply amazing and messed with your feelings every chapter. The achievement
      to read every TIP is broken though, I wasn't able to get it despite reading
      them all multiple times.
