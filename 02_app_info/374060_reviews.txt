Obviously only read it after finishing the game.\n\nI can recommend the game if you like shorter walking simulator games and can get it on sale, since it's like 2 hours for a playthrough.\nAchievement hunters beware: some achievements seem to be broken and you can't get them, this didn't bother me personally\n\nDevelopers comment on the story: [spoiler] Christopher Adams is a journalist, writing stories and trying to sell them off for a profit. In order to increase the value of his stories he'll take events and spice them up to make them more interesting. In the case of Valerie, a girl who was mentally ill and being cared for by her father, Adams decides to add imprisonment and incest. In the case of Jame Reed, a man trapped in a collapsed mine with some friends who ended up dying from starvation, he added murder and cannibalism. And in the case of Jean Jowars Remens, where a group of cancer patients decided to end their lives rather than go through the suffering of life, he decided to add a suicide cult.\n\nIn the game you are presented with Adams version of events, rather than reality. And he become hunted by the monsters he created. In the end, the voice of the entity that is forcing this punishment on you takes matters into its own hands and walks you through your mistake. Ending all of it simply by telling you that your punishment is not yet over. Adam walks down the stairs, and the game ends [/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1609607883,"timestamp_updated":1609607883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j+WG4vYCfoTlvwI="}
