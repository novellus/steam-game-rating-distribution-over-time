I figured the London-Faversham route itself would be a nice bonus, but boy, was I wrong. \n\nFirst of all: the speed on the high speed part isn't that high. 225 km/h is quite ridiculous, when you're used to the German en French standards. But no matter: it could still have been fun to drive. \n\nBut it's not (there's bummer number 2), as about 95% of the high speed track is in a poorly lit tunnel, which is extremely boring.\n\nThird: the overhead wires vary in height, but the pantographs do not. No need to explain how weird that looks......\n\nFourth: the platforms vary in both height and width, so you can either see your train crashing the platform, or see the doors way up or down the platform.\n\nThe third rail part is way longer than the high speed part, but it's dull as [you can fill that it in yourselves]. The scenery is mediocre to say the least. The branch to Sheerness at Sea even has no scenery at all.\n\nIf you consider buying this because of the route itself: don't. Even on sale it's a complete waste of money.\nIf you like the Class 395 -which has two of the gayest repaints ever: completely pink or with a cute rainbow (just search for #trainbow)- then the â‚¬11,95 I spent on it on sale are worth it. \nIt's a cool train with nice sounds. AndI if you push Q on your keyboard every minute, it takes you where ever you want at a speed up to 240 km/h, without emergency braking all of the time.\n\nEnjoy the ride with pride, yet not the utterly bad route!","timestamp_created":1609280642,"timestamp_updated":1609280780,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7v6m2PYCeaLLvgI="}
