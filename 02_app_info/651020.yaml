    review: '3/10


      I really wanted to enjoy it but its such a hassle compared to the rest of the
      base game.


      Land is clunky, buggy and it''s not fun. It takes too much luck and makes the
      game drawn out for no reason.

      You basically just do secret lands for money. Constantly land and leave until
      you get an easy task (since most of them are just long) and then rush it and
      sell everything.

      There''s no point doing getting enchanted stuff since you a guaranteed to die
      to RNG at some point and all of it just disappears from your ship.

      Friendly fire is also a thing on land and they kill you as well.


      Overall, I can''t recommend it'
