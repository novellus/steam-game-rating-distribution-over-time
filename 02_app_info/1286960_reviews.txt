AI is solid, and it's a fun time with all three disciplines in the game. I would've loved to see it possible to work into career mode or some such somehow, but I'll freely admit I have no idea how that would even be done, so hey, it's a fun time in quick race and I'm happy with my purchase!","timestamp_created":1593992702,"timestamp_updated":1593992702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666686534881592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg83XkPMCcaOSkwI="}
