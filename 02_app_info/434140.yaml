    review: 'Well so first and foremost i really like the idea of the game and the
      artstyle while minimalistic, but it is actually pretty.

      But the fact of the matter is that it is an early access game which in very
      rough, and in the making.

      I my self have i great deal of problems with the game among some of the worst
      is no fullscreen, i know the option is there but it doesnt apply the setting
      and reverts back to the default windowed mode. And i also get the following
      error message so the likes when playing for more than 10 min.

      ___________________________________________

      ############################################################################################

      FATAL ERROR in

      action number 1

      of Alarm Event for alarm 3

      for object obj_controller:


      Variable obj_slot.ToolBox(100213, -2147483648) not set before reading it.

      at gml_Script_scr_SavePlayerInventory

      ############################################################################################

      stack frame is

      gml_Script_scr_SavePlayerInventory (line 0)

      gml_Script_scr_savegame

      gml_Object_obj_controller_Alarm_3


      Which is quite annoying when you cant play the game more than 10 min. without
      it chashing.

      But i remain hopeful that the game will be polished and finished and it may
      be worth playing and buying when finished.

      But i will keep my eyes open for updates on the game and will update as needed.
      But so far i dont think the game to be worth it YET, but keep it in the back
      of your mind and wait for it to be finished before buying.

      I do also apologize in advance since english is not my first language, and i
      am not the best at writing.
