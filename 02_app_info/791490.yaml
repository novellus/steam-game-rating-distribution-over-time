    about_the_game: Rainbow Cult is a satirical office environment where each floor
      is based off a real-life event or controversy.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2>There
      are 13 basic enemy types, one is added every level you go up.<br><br><br>Even
      though it's single player, the combat often resembles an MMO more than any single-player
      genre, although it isn't grindy like an MMO. The way you pull and aggro enemies
      and use crowd control to avoid damage should feel familiar, but RainbowCult
      ratchets up the pace much higher.  <br><br>You can throw three basic spells,
      but these also can be combined in six different ways to make important utility
      spells that add a lot of variety to the gameplay.<h2 class="bb_tag">Bosses</h2>  <br>The
      boss fights could be described as a puzzle, much in the same way that MMO boss
      fights are a puzzle - you have a limited set of mechanics and you have to figure
      out how to apply them to the encounter. <br><br>These 13 bosses each have 3
      difficulty levels, which add new mechanics to the boss to make the fight more
      dynamic and challenging, training you for the final NG++ encounter. There aren't
      quick-time-events or glowing weak spots. Just you, a handful of spells, and
      your wits.  <br><br>Can't figure out one of the boss fights? Skip it and come
      back later when you realize what you were doing wrong!<h2 class="bb_tag">Multiple
      endings</h2>  <br>Each of the three difficulties has a unique cutscene at the
      end, rewarding you for beating all 13 of the bosses.<h2 class="bb_tag">Game
      length</h2>  <br>Based on our testing we estimate it should take <i>at least</i>
      8 hours to beat all 39 encounters and see all of the endings, but a typical
      player will probably spend 12-16 hours, since you won't know the enemies or
      the boss fight mechanics on your first playthrough.<h2 class="bb_tag">Highlights

    developer_response: 'Thanks for trying out our game! It''s really helpful to watch
      people who aren''t familiar with our game try to play it, especially since it''s
      an unusual genre.


      Quick note: those black circles are a bug. They''re supposed to be on top of
      the white lines above the enemy heads. I really apologize for that, we had multiple
      people test it for us and none of them reported that issue. It looks like a
      resolution issue, we''ll get a fix for that pushed out today.


      I don''t know if you''re planning to keep the game and play it more in the future,
      but you may enjoy the easy mode more - the box cost doesn''t increase when you
      forget to make combos which was what killed you a few times. If you continue
      to play it on Normal mode I''d recommend using the fire a lot less frequently,
      and using yellow+yellow (shield) and blue+blue (tornado, traps 5 of any color)
      instead.  They''re really the bread and butter combos for beginning players.  Also
      remember that you can use the rainbow to attract enemies, to grab multiple kills
      at once without taking much damage by getting close.


      I appreciate your let''s play though, there are definitely a couple issues we
      need to explain better, especially the boss position. He spawns in one of the
      corners of the building, if you tap/hold (depending on your settings) the spacebar
      to free-look around you should be able to see a red beam of particles from the
      boss location.'

    review: 'Really cool, innovative gameplay.

      It is like, really difficult.

      I feel like it costs too much.


      I''m gonna give it a thumbs up but you should wait for a sale.
