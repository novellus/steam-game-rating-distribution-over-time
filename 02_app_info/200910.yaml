    review: 'I recently started replaying this game again, the first time I played
      and completed it was back in 2011/2012. It has a lot of charm, is witty, and
      has an interesting concept. I would also suggest just playing through it without
      the use of a guide that shows you everything, it''s much better that way. Right
      now I still cannot play on the hardest difficulty, Spasmodic, but I can get
      through Hard just fine. It offers a decent challenge and has an interesting
      story with secrets to be found throughout. It has a pretty deep battle system
      that allows for many different types of play, which you may just find yourself
      constantly tweaking as you go. Which I enjoy, it doesn''t trap you into one
      set role.


      That being said it isn''t perfect. It does have a bit of a grind and there aren''t
      an overabundance of enemies, but that''s something hard to really fault it on.
      Given the time it came out and the small team behind it. It is impressive none-the-less.


      I''ve been having a great time playing this again, it took me around 30 hours
      to fully complete initially. If a rhythm RPG sounds like something you''d be
      interested in I''d suggest picking it up. With the sale prices it''s a steal
      in all honesty.
