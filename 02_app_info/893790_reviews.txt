On one hand, I find it quite charming in its own rights. The characters are all well-written, they felt genuine in a way that doesn't just fall into certain tropes but rather given life and felt three-dimensional. The writing is actually rather forward and simple, but my Adhd brain have a hard time grasping and differentiating between the plot of the story and the message that the writer is trying to convey. I meant to say it feels mangled. Not exactly 'bad' mangled per se, but maybe a better organization of the storyline points would've made it much more enjoyable to experience.\n\nI was really expecting this game to be a slice-of-life game, probably with a bittersweet plot to go with it. I have no problem with the direction of which the game actually go; but I must say it doesn't go below or above my expectations. It just left me feeling conflicted. It is as if the game's beckoning me to like it, because hey, the writings beautiful, but at the same time I feel like... it's just not something I wanted. I feel like this is a story written from a very personal place. Something raw and which connects to the grueling reality we face. That in itself isn't exactly bad, I do think the message is beautifully delivered, but it is also wasn't what I paid and expect to experience. I guess this makes this review seems self-centered, which is, alright. This is a very difficult thing for me to express. \n\nI'm just saying if you are here to buy this game because you are expecting a story with a happy LGBTQ+ contents and ending, you will not find it in this game. The protagonist suffers from his sexuality, and it is something he learns to come on terms with in the story. That is the theme of the story; the protagonist finding courage of himself and moving on from his traumas to embrace self love. On that note, it is a very kind-driven story. But is it satisfactionary for LGBTQ+ people who wanted a positive LGBTQ experience contents as escapism from the real world? Perhaps if you are like me, I would say hell no. Maybe I'd be more appreciative of this kind of story in the future, when I feel content enough with what I can't have in my life. When my world become much less restrictive. This story opens the wounds, more so.\n\nI don't want to get personal in a review, but I had also been that lgbtq+ person who once fell in love deeply with my best friend who thought she was straight, and was rejected. The years forward after that... which i will not talk about. But I understand the perspective, I really do. Which is why, I'd rather not have to recollect the experience again in my method of escapism. Sighh.\n\nEither way, I still think; aside from the disappointing protagonist experience, this game have ALOT of lgbt characters. So that's really good. And they're very lovable. I still think this game is worth checking, if you like just experiencing stories that touches on personal perspectives. But if you wanted a happy story with a happy LGBTQ+ romance ending and plotline, you will not find it here. That's all.\n\nedit (1): wrote this fresh after I finished the game so it might be filled with the upset-ness from the ending; but i will say and admit that the gameplay is actually enjoyable and i like it. I'm just miffed about the direction the story went, still.","timestamp_created":1609352514,"timestamp_updated":1609353440,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsJW82vYCeIrtvgI="}
