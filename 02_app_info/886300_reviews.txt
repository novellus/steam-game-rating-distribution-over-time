Could've purchased something else.\"\n\nJust today though, I decided to come back and give the game another try, and honestly, I can say that it is a great game for me after all of these months. With the quarantine going on currently, I've been playing the same games over and over again and it's been driving me nuts. So I've decided to dig up games I haven't played in a long time. This was one of 'em.\n\nWhy the game is great for me is because well, you destroy everything in your path. And for me, I tend to explore or discover more parts of a map. Levels like City Tower and the Retail Stores for me are my personal best because they are big and expanding. So far, I have unlocked four maps and I can't wait to unlock more.\n\nThere are some errors though, such as NPC's dying by themselves (kind of funny when they scream) and the NPC's can also knock over some items before you start breaking them. I discovered this in Retail Store 2. Everything else though seems perfect to me.\n\nOverall, the game is chaotic, funny, and will definitely give you a bit of adrenaline depending how destructive and crazy you are, especially with the police and employees chasing you. I would definitely buy it and I can't wait to see how far the game will go because it could be a huge hit later on.","timestamp_created":1588475147,"timestamp_updated":1588475262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww56g7PECcvqXhQI="}
