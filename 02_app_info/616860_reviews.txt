But those stars are won by gathering points in it, not by completing the level. So if you want 3 stars, you have to pay attention not to complete the level until you have 3 stars. If you don't pay attention to it and complete the level normaly, you will have 1 or 2 stars and won't be able to unlock all the levels. It's stupid. And the game is low res, without any true fullscreen. Play another match-3. There are so much better on steam...","timestamp_created":1549570155,"timestamp_updated":1549570269,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49Lvl5OgCfbCjugE="}
