No. Probably not. Maybe the follow up will give it a run for its money which is touted to be released if the company ever sells more than the current six copies it has sold so far.\n\nHonestly there is nothing more to say, buy it in an instant, to be blunt, you must own this if you want to have fulfilled life. Quite honestly it is a toss up between this and Brink as the Greatest Game of All Time.\n\n","timestamp_created":1342469045,"timestamp_updated":1342469045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sP/YyLgCedzqCw=="}
