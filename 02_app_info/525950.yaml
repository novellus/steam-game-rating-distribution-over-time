    review: "[b]I played this on the Oculus Rift with Touch controllers and there\
      \ were no issues. [/b]So I'm in the USA and I know next to nothing about Cricket.\
      \  Meaning, I know it looks like baseball, but other than that I have no idea\
      \ what's going on in a cricket game.  I was flummoxed by why the ball was going\
      \ behind me even though I was hitting it straight on.  Then I took a good look\
      \ at my bat and realized I had it facing the wrong way.  \n\nI did hit some\
      \ homeruns, but usually I was lucky to even hit the ball.  Cricket definitely\
      \ has a higher difficulty curve than baseball (even though I'm sure a 100 mph\
      \ is harder to hit than anything in Cricket).  The reason for the higher difficulty\
      \ is because you have to guess at where the ball will bounce.  You are hitting\
      \ the ball after the pitcher bounces it off the ground and you have to notice\
      \ the way it was pitched to be able to correctly guess where it's headed.  \n\
      \nSo a lot of the time I was whiffing completely.  A lot of ground balls that\
      \ hardly went anywhere.  Don't even talk to me abut the scoring, I have no idea.\
      \  The game is also very barebones and lackluster in the graphics department.\
      \  Still, I had some moments of fun.  And I learned something about cricket,\
      \ it's way harder than it looks.\n\nSo should you spend $2.24 on this VR title?\
      \  Depends on the type of person you are.  Do you like trying out new things?\
      \  Do you mind a lot of frustration until you're finally able to get the gist\
      \ of the game?  Then this is worth $2.24.  Otherwise, just skip it all together.\n\
      \nSale Price Rating 5/10"
