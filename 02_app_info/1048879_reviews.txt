However, the fact that I paid $2 for a beatmap that isn't even remotely a challenge on Expert+ WITH GHOST NOTES is just tragic. I bought this thinking it would be reminiscent of the Camellia album (which is free, mind you) where songs on hard are a fair challenge, expert are a good challenge, and expert+ are truly challenging. Instead, I got a song that I missed 10 notes on first try which really disappointed me. The song is so beautiful and has some great drops, but I feel it was all just ignored and made as a quick cash grab. Don't buy this, download a different version of this song for free off of Beatsaver or something.","timestamp_created":1608967693,"timestamp_updated":1608967693,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rNT8zvYCeYunvQI="}
