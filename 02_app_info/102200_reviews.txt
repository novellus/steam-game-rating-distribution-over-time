Now, I am leaving a review so I can actually lay this game to rest properly and remember just why I stopped playing it.\n\nLong story short: the RNG is unbearable and the AI is too unforgiving. This game essentially has you play a mix of solitaire and poker against an AI and, to spice things up a bit, you can use power cards as well to turn the tide. The problem is that the AI simply never ever lets you play any move that may be advantageous for you, as it constantly steals useful cards the moment it sees them. The reason this happens is that every \"player\" gets 3 moves in one turn, and thus the AI constantly ruins your plans the moment they seem to come to fruition.\n\nThat combined with the card appearance RNG just makes the game very frustrating. You are essentially fighting a battle on two fronts; on one front, you hope for RNG to give you the right cards to make good combinations with and that you can securely tuck away in a combination before the AI can steal it; on the other front, you fight an AI that always goes for the best available combinations anyway while ruining your day. It is a battle only won with a lot of luck and patience, but sadly, it is not very fun. While the presentation of the game is intriguing, it is simply not worth going through the struggle.","timestamp_created":1609730104,"timestamp_updated":1609730147,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4q5jZ5fYCfLajwAI="}
