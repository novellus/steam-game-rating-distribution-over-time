Highly recommend.","timestamp_created":1609634490,"timestamp_updated":1609634490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6aTs4vYCfa70vwI="}
