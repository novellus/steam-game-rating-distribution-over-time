    about_the_game: "The International, a legendary tournament, which had already\
      \ become an annual celebration for all Dota 2 fans and spectators, came back\
      \ in July of 2015. This time four teams from CIS were honored to prove themselves\
      \ in a battle for 18 million dollars. But our story is about only one team \u2013\
      \ Virtus.pro. However, The International is not only about teams. Anton &quot;Mob5ter&quot;\
      \ Erohin, who didn\u2019t even know what Dota 2 was several years ago, had already\
      \ become one of very few Russian &quot;voices&quot; of game broadcasting and\
      \ was set out to get to TI. But The International didn't feel like a celebration\
      \ for everyone. Dread, who gave over 5 years of his life for this game, once\
      \ again had to visit TI not as a player, but as an analyst. What are his feelings\
      \ and emotions? What goals do Virtus.pro pursue? How does Mob5ter imagine working\
      \ in Seattle? And the main question: what does The International mean for these\
      \ guys? You'll see in a new documentary by Ivan Demkin \u2013 \xABOver the dream\xBB\
