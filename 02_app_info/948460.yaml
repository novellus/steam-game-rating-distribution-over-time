    about_the_game: <strong>Conception</strong><br>Wizard Prison started as a college
      assignment for us, but quickly became our pet project. We shared a vision for
      a difficult, retro, gritty fantasy game inspired by the 16-bit era. As each
      semester led to the next, we continued to work on Wizard Prison as we knew we
      had something worth sharing. We were excited to do our finishing touches, eventually
      add a true final boss, and release Wizard Prison to the public for some nominal
      price tag. As time went on, however, it became clear that life post-graduation
      would take the team on separate paths. Paying the bills would take priority,
      and those finishing touches would never happen. After multiple attempts to revive
      Wizard Prison to no avail, we collectively decided to release our most recent
      build, playable from start to finish, for everybody to enjoy free of charge.
      We hope you will enjoy escaping Wizard Prison as much as we enjoyed creating
      it.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>Art<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>16-bit
