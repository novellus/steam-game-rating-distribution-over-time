Game still has an active Dev. Most recent update that was a direct result of players critique on ballance.\n\nOne of my earliest games started on the Mario inspired tileset. Moved one of my team out of the starting building. Near the end of his move he got spoted by a close by enemy, a sploder. Neither of the other two of the team could move to get line of site on this enemy.  \nNow it is the enemies turn. The sploder jumps at my guy outside, landing next to him and explodes. There is now a huge crater in the ground where my guy used to be standing. A wall of the building that the other two guys were still inside of, is now gone from the explosion. With no wall to hold up the roof, a good part of the roof collapsed on my two remaining guys. One dies and the other is badly injured. \nNow it's my second turn.  \"OMG WTF just happned?\" After a bit of rage and laughter, restart.\n\nThere is a free demo, so give it a try.","timestamp_created":1485545146,"timestamp_updated":1542886689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.375642925500869751","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jtHNnecCfp/RcA=="}
