    about_the_game: This simulation takes place on the electric gondola of a window
      cleaner, against the tall building of a crowded city. The therapist has control
      over the gondola, and is able to rise, lower and pause it. The gondola is able
      to lift the client to heights even beyond the rooftop. At the more challenging
      heights, however, the client has the opportunity to enjoy a beautiful view over
      the city during sunset.
