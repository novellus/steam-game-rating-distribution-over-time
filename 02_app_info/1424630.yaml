    review: "O jogo possui 2 modos. Um modo 'hist\xF3ria', onde o jogador faz cada\
      \ fase separadamente e pontua separadamente, e um modo 'arcade'(Trial), com\
      \ as fases em sequ\xEAncia(\xE9 necess\xE1rio fechar o modo hist\xF3ria 1 vez,\
      \ em qualquer level, para liberar o modo arcade(!)). Alguns elementos em comum\
      \ com outros shmups, como o auto-bomb(enquanto houver uma bomb, ao ser acertado,\
      \ o jogador perde uma bomb e sobrevive).\nUm cute'n up para todas as idades,\
      \ recomendado para os amantes do g\xEAnero."
