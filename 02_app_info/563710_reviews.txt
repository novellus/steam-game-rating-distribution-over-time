Similar levels take far longer to solve because of how slowly the tiles turn around.\n- The possible size of the puzzles are far smaller making this basically a dumbed down version for people with less perseverance.\n- You can't really know how far you've gotten because the game doesn't tell you, how many puzzles you've solved and they also become far more repetitive because the size restriction reduces variance.\n\nThis appears like some guys were told to add a skin and make it tablet friendly so it can be sold as a premium version of the original but honestly I believe the original (which was without any monetization) was much better, so I regret paying for this.\n\nSadly it's in flash which isn't supported by modern browsers anymore.\n\nBecause of this comparison I just can't recommend it.","timestamp_created":1590532543,"timestamp_updated":1590532751,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46ffIqfICeu+/igI="}
