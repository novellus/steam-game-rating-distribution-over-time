Not a huge amount of effort has been put into the graphics. It's one of those games where it indicates the frame rate is good but actually looks poor like it's taking hits all the time. The enemies are uninspiring and the whole game feels a bit bland. The game also froze when I went to exit it, which was kinda the deal-breaker for me.","timestamp_created":1609373577,"timestamp_updated":1609373577,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48v2I2/YCdvX4vgI="}
