The movement is very slow and floaty. Like your playing as a bar of soap. Really did not like it at first but it's something you get used to as you play. Some ridiculous difficulty spikes as you progress and it starts to get hilariously unfair. The difficulty all stems from swarms of enemies, seeking projectiles flying at you from off screen giving you no time to react, The game takes the \"just spam a bunch of these\" approach rather than \"this is an intelligent and dangerous single enemy\". It gets annoying. Nonetheless, very fun game. Definitely worth $10 and a must grab on sale.","timestamp_created":1608764638,"timestamp_updated":1608764760,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/MP2yPYCe5TOvAI="}
