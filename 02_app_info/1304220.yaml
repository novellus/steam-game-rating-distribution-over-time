      /><h2 class="bb_tag"> INTRODUCTION</h2><br>Labyronia paid a fatal price to end
      the demonic corruption. Along with a new intolerant ruler, the maze-covered
      world turned to a world of prison cells. The final judgment has been cast, and
      everyone is guilty.<br><br>When a colossal angel statue appears in Labyronia,
      the people foresee their fate; the eve of summer marks the doomsday. The divine
      messenger becomes alive and destroys everything.<br><br>You are Arres, the only
      one who can avert the catastrophe. To do this, you must gather your companions,
      travel through the four seasons, and train for the coming battle. You have only
      one year to do this, but the keys of time are in your hand.<br><br>If you fail,
      however, you will be forced to witness the apocalypse. The wrathful angel strikes
      with its burning sword, splitting mountains. Giant earthquakes emerge crushing
      all traces of order, consuming the world into an endless sea of flames.<br><br><img

    review: "Not sure if this is the literal end of the Labyronia series of games.\
      \ Still, fail in your mission to become powerful enough to defeat Nerubis in\
      \ a year, and the world will end. Well, unless you can wipe away all sin and\
      \ discord against the supreme deity in that time. Which, by the way, you are\
      \ part of\u2026\n\nDecent enough. Also, for those who have been playing the\
      \ other games in the series, you may as well continue."
