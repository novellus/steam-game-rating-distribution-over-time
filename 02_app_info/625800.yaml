    review: "This game is very similar to Orcs Must Die, which is what got me to check\
      \ it out.  The traps are very similar, although the game levels are completely\
      \ different.  The enemies are quite well done!  In Orcs Must Die I will run\
      \ around getting into skirmishes but here I found I did not want to get close\
      \ to the enemies!  I get startled when someone comes up a side pass and jumps\
      \ me!  \n\nI wanted to put an english review here so people have at least an\
      \ idea of the quality.  I played through the first level, got stuck at the end\
      \ where I think you are trying to get into the tomb?  The pictograph instructions\
      \ didn't help me until it was too late.  I finally figured out I had to put\
      \ the blocks on the raised stones which I found out at that point were pressure\
      \ plates.  Sadly only one block was left, I threw the others away and they glitched\
      \ out when respawning.\n\nThe best part is when you are placing traps the left\
      \ hand lets you choose the trap and your right hand has a little diorama of\
      \ the trap in action.  I thought it was really cool and something VR can do\
      \ well.  Most of the help is in english, there is a little text at the start\
      \ that is not, hopefully it isn't important!  :)\n\nThe graphics are stunning,\
      \ and I'm having fun.  Worth the price I think!"
