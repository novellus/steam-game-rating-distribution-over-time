I feel that An Octave Higher shows a lot of promise but does not deliver. The start of it was alright and engaging. However, the writing and overall storytelling kept on bugging me.\n\nThere were places where information was dumped onto me, which is never a good sign for any type of writing. It would have been better to spread information out throughout instead of trying to hammer it in all at once. That way, it's more engaging rather than feeling like you're being force-fed content that may or may not be important to the overall plot of the story.\n\nThe switch between the three characters was confusing too and I can't say whether or not it added anything to the story. It's easier to focus on one character—as your main—and getting to know them as a person rather than more. It might have been better to let the player choose from whose perceptive they wanted to experience instead of the forced switch.\n\nThe text is what made me quit in the first place. It's highly inconsistent in so many different ways. It also had no character whatsoever, which means that it fell flat. The text kept telling me things instead of showing, which in writing is a sin. Many words were repeated when they didn't need to be and some parts made no sense at all. I had to look up certain terms, which I should not have had to do. One may think that using complicated words that mean simple things will make you appear smart, it actually has the opposite effect. It shows that the writer is naïve.\n\nIn the end, nothing was really memorable about An Octave Higher—unless you wanna count it for being unforgettably bad. If you want to play it though, then don't let my review stop you. Just don't be surprised if your experience turns sour.","timestamp_created":1609779683,"timestamp_updated":1609779683,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ465OW5/YCdPm4wAI="}
