    short_description: The player doesn't impersonate a simple man, but a powerful,
      rich and famous nobleman who seems to be able to obtain whatever he wishes for.
      But will this be enough this time?

    review: 'Art is gorgeous, story is okayish.

      I was forced to drop the game after third creepy assault scene. Since there
      seems to be no way evading this stuff, and I kinda don''t want to associate
      myself with such a protagonist - buh bye.

      I''d refund it, but 2 weeks had passed already >_>'
