    review: "Being your average chad gamer, I purchased 1001 about a year ago so my\
      \ buddy and I could play together. And having just finished one of the best\
      \ platforming games ever made, (spleunky,) we finally wanted to give this game\
      \ a go. Within the first sitting of playing this game a few things were made\
      \ clear. 1001 Spikes is a game of trolls, bad decisions, good music, charming\
      \ aesthetics and quite basic platfoming mechanics. \n\nThe troloolololols:\n\
      \ Since the game gives you only 1001 lives to finish the entire game, (kind\
      \ of,) you try your best NOT to die. Well sadly, the game goes far out of it's\
      \ way to make sure you DO die. Spikes will randomly spring out of blocks with\
      \ no indication they are there. Platforms will fall and never respawn, making\
      \ progress impossible. Tiki arrow shooting blocks will fire and kill you, only\
      \ sometimes though, since not ALL tiki arrow shooting blocks will actually shoot.\
      \ The amount of trolls in this game is immense. In the late game my friend and\
      \ I stopped asking: 'is there a troll here?' And started asking: 'Where is the\
      \ troll? I know your gunna kill me you doodle game! WHERES THE TROLL?' \n\n\n\
      The bad decisions: \nThe bad decisions tie mostly into the coop portion of the\
      \ game, though not entirely. My friend and I CONSTANTLY soft locked one another.\
      \ Example: I would cross a bridge; the bridge would fall. My friend can now\
      \ no longer cross the bridge. He is forced to kill himself, taking one our shared\
      \ 1001 with him. Other bad decisions is the character selection. When you finally\
      \ are able to unlock a new character, you cannot continue your game with them;\
      \ your're forced to restart EVERYTHING. Only the second player can swap characters\
      \ without restarting the entire game. Why this is the case i'll never know.\
      \ Once your coop friend finally does swaps characters, hope to GOSH its not\
      \ to the ninja character. He flat out breaks the most levels, bypassing some\
      \ completely.\n\nThe cat'sJAM: \nalmost all levels feature quite catchy music.\
      \ Example: 1001 Spikes OST - World 2. This is quite nice since some levels require\
      \ quite a hefty amount of game time to complete them. EXCEPT THE GOLDEN BOSS\
      \ OH MY GOSH THAT SONG IS BAD. WE HAD TO LISTEN TO THAT SONG FOR LIKE 30 MINUTES!\
      \ 1001 Spikes OST - World 6 Boss If you would care to listen. ( I would link\
      \ you, but steam doesn't like links )\n\nThe charm: \nIt looks good. My friend's\
      \ brother once had an argument that it looks super similar to phoenix wright's\
      \ old art. Lol my friend proceeded to argue that it didn't. 'I have actually\
      \ played the game I think I would know'  But let's be real, it does look a LOT\
      \ like phoenix.  \n\nThe basics of platforming:  It's all pretty simple stuff.\
      \ You have a high jump, (triangle,) and a low jump, X; you also have a GUN.\
      \ Through out the game they mix things up to a certain degree. Platforms that\
      \ switch on and off with a timer, some beyond toxic penguins, sliding blocks,\
      \ ice, and some falling blocks that soft lock your coop buddy. it all feels\
      \ very basic though. Keep in mind I mean BASIC not BAD. But I do feel like i'm\
      \ in the minority here when I say I like the lives system. It brings a certain\
      \ weight every time your coop buddy drags you down into a lava pit. We only\
      \ ever had to restart the game once though. ( near the end lol ) \n\nThe END:\
      \ \nEven with all the TRASH in this game, it's still fun. But it is quite annoying\
      \ knowing that a great deal of deaths will feel CHEAP and UNFAIR. For $15, i'd\
      \ say it's worth it. You get quite a lot of levels to play, ( and bonus levels\
      \ :)! ) It's all quite fun in coop, but I have no idea why this game refuses\
      \ to respawn fallen platforms. It's like they want us to waste all our lives\
      \ :(\n\nThe NUMBER: \nPshh! shoot, dawg. idk? 7/10?"
