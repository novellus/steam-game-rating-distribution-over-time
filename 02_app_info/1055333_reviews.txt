I feel that is too short i would've preferred if they had of maybe extended it from Portsmouth and Woking to Weymouth or even added the loop line from Romsey to Salisbury via Eastleigh and Southampton Central. Also I am not sure why you get freight cars with the route but no locomotive/s apart from a class 47 which is static. As much as I love the route. There needs to be more added to make it a perfect route.","timestamp_created":1608010357,"timestamp_updated":1608010357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kNu4svYCeZetugI="}
