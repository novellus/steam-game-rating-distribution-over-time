I love it! I wasn't sure what I was getting into with this game but I played the demo(on the switch I think) and I thought it was so good! The feel is very retro and I appreciate it. It's short so get it on sale maybe. The story and characters are bizarre and don't always make a lot of sense but I personally enjoy that kind of thing. It's definitely a game with character and I recommend it just for a unique experience.","timestamp_created":1582942052,"timestamp_updated":1582942052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6tusx/ACddCW9QE="}
