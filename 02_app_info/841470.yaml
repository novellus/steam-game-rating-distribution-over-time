    review: '[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review
      [/h1]


      greenTech+ is a game developed and published by Vertigo Gaming, the same person
      behind the Cook, Serve, Delicious series


      The game offers some really nice graphics and a nice yet simplistic aesthetic
      which is pleasant all the same and has some amazing attention to detail even
      though it is a little rough around the edges


      The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but
      a fun game nonetheless and ends just at the right time


      greenTech+ overall, however, is an okay game to play, yet sometimes repetitive
      and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is an okay strategy
      game to play in short bursts!


      [h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]
