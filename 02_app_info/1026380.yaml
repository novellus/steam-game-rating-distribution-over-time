    about_the_game: Overture Music Visualization is a solo-dev project created in
      Unreal Engine and released for the Windows platform.  It captures audio in realtime
      from any source, including Youtube, Spotify, Pandora, VLC and others, and features
      50+ customization options across several categories.  The goal of the Overture
      project is to create a versatile, general purpose music visualization utility
      with robust configuration options to make it suitable for personal use, video
      creation, or streaming.<br><br><strong>Early Access Status</strong><br>Overture
      Music Visualization is currently stable for Windows desktops and features both
      fullscreen and windowed 1920x1080 view modes.  However, the project should be
      considered early access as new features and scenes are already planned and a
      new VR mode is currently under development and will be released as a free update
      soon.<br><br><strong>Regarding System Requirements</strong><br>The project supports
      both 3D and &quot;minimal&quot; scenes (as denoted in the scene selection menu)
      in an attempt to provide a wider range of support.  The 3D scenes are more resource
      intensive, and have been tested and run above 90 FPS on a machine with the following
      specs:<br><br>8GB DDR4 SDRAM 3200<br>GeForce GTX 970 4GB Graphics Card<br>Intel
      Core i7 6700K 4.00 GHz Processor<br>Minimal scenes are performant on machines
      with much lower capabilities.<br><br><strong>Important Notes</strong><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>For best results, check your default audio device's bitrate
      settings and select the matching bitrate option in the game's settings<br></li><li>Overture

    review: "Just got it and been perusing the different visualizations... holy cow....\
      \ nice. Timer and text to show \"starting in XX:XX\" ...\n\nRecordings of the\
      \ visualization have the potential to be used with video editing software to\
      \ add more details to it.... overlays, screen, etc... \n\nLooking for a preset\
      \ to set resolution to 3440x1440 or at least have a properly non-stretched 16:9\
      \ rectangle to capture a video with OBS or other software... currently the visualization\
      \ stretches to 3440x1440 using the Fullscreen 1080p setting...\n\nExperimental\
      \ windowed 2560x1440 looks great! I am using a 3440x1440 monitor and when I\
      \ do full-screen it shows with less quality... not as \"sharp\" as the windowed\
      \ 2560x1440...\n\nWishlist: \n- Option to use smooth edged bars (have different\
      \ bar styles)\n- Ability to have different visualizers with a green screen so\
      \ we can blend them on video editing software... This is instead of the 3D backgrounds...\n\
      - Ability to import SVG shapes for which the spectrum bars can come out of...\n\
      - Better alignment of settings on the top of the window, some text overlap (at\
      \ leas\n- Ability to allow settings to display on the \"experimental\" resolution\
      \ \"windowed\" screen.\n- Make spectrum bars reach way higher.... I have tried\
      \ different music genres and audio sensitivity settings, and mostly only the\
      \ lower frequencies make the bars on the left most side go up somewhat... makes\
      \ for a rather \"uneventful\" visualization.\n\nThis is awesome!!!!! and has\
      \ lots of potential!!!\n\nWould recommend."
