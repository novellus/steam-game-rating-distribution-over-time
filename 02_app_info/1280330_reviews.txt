Enemies can and will stun lock your party and kill you by a [i]thousand cuts.[/i] There is a distinct lack of interactivity with the environment, which left me with little motivation to explore the world. [i]Better[/i] RPGMaker games have plentiful interactive objects, encouraging players to peek inside every nook and cranny.\n\nThis is the first RPG I've played where [i]so many[/i] enemies can spawn that they spawn off-screen during battle.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nYmir was chatin' with her pal, Memiru about a nearby \"waste factory\". She wanted to give it gander, and Memiru didn't want her doing so alone. As it turns out, the facility was [i]no factory[/i]— rather, it was a front for an interdimensional portal. The two ladies were sucked inside, and after a near-death experience were rescued by a Hedne, a powerful warrior. He explains that they need to find the [i]Tower of Mirror[/i] to go home. They are lost in the Bimirror Field, a conglomeration of two worlds, held together by the [i]Mirage Mirror.[/i] Their journey to the Tower will be an arduous one, \n\nYmir and Memiru stumble upon a confrontation between the Imperial army. Captain Biged has been extorting towns for money, imprisoning any who oppose or can't pay. He abducted a young lady, as \"compensation\" for a villager's lack of funding. Ymir and Memiru decide to pursue him, and end his reign (that is, on their way to the Tower of Mirror). During their journey, they will get sidetracked by thieves and scoundrels, and [i]rapey[/i] monsters.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe titlescreen was a bit of a mess — difficult to read, and lacking any sort of user configuration. The game boots into fullscreen by default, but it can booted into a [i]dinky[/i] window using RPGMaker's in-built options (by pressing \"F1\"). The in-game interface was good enough, but riddled with strange translations and misspellings.\n\n[b]- Goodies -[/b]\nThe artwork looks great, on par for any good hentai game. The monsters look plasticy, but the heroines are excellent. There are a total of twelve unlockable scenes, each based on one more (static) CGs (with many variants detailing sexual progression). The poor English translation makes the sex scenes difficult to read. Expect female nudity and male-on-female intercourse.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nI don't recommend this title. It's a poor RPGMaker experience — the gameplay isn't terribly fun, and sexual content (though well drawn) scant and poorly translated. Twelve CGs and a few nude portraits isn't much for an RPG, especially for one priced at [i]nine USD.[/i] This game suffers from a lack of balance and content.\n\n[h1]Support the Wombat[/h1]\nIf you enjoy my reviews, please follow my Curator page.
