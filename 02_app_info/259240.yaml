    review: 'Hacker Evolution: Untold is perhaps a writing simulator, as you need
      to type the command but you need your brains to avoid to be traced and to have
      a game over. Sometimes, you''ll need to begin a new campaign because you can''t
      do anything but try a different manner to avoid spending too much money you''ve
      "stolen" or to add to your trace level. That''s perhaps the most frustrating
      thing in HE. Finding exploits, reading files to find a clue, a password, cracking,
      decrypting and stealing money so that you can reduce your trace level or to
      buy better hardware, that''s what you will to do.


      And with a package called Hardcore, you''re expecting to be challenged... though
      this first DLC is incredibly easy. Hack every server with money, take it and
      you''ll beat the two levels (yeah, two levels only) as a chief!


      For 2 euros, you would have expected something more. I mean, I can understand
      two levels but if the challenge isn''t up to the name, why bother then? I''ve
      activated this for the challenge and it wasn''t met.


      However, why I''m still recommending it? Because, well, even if the challenge
      isn''t there, it''s making up for the abrupt ending of the main game, it''s
      more levels with Xenti secrets....


      But if you own the Hardcore Packages for the first game, Hacker Evolution, maybe
      you should avoid investing in both DLC. Because guess what? They''re the same
      levels. Without any difference. The Hardcore Package was clearly developed for
      Untold though, as they''re played with the rules of Untold in the first HE.'
