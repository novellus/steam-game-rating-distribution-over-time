Sentris doesn't know what it wants to be. It's not quite a tool to create music, and it's not quite a puzzle game, or even a game at all. It's more of an experience, and a mediocre one at that. It's incredibly easy to move from level to level and it blurs the experience making it dull. There really isn't any goal to work towards either. The $15 price tag is an absurd price. If you must get Sentris, then wait for it to go on sale for $1 or less.","timestamp_created":1428724104,"timestamp_updated":1569369158,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51931995153427124","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl57ssu0Ce/muOg=="}
