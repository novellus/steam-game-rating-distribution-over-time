    review: "Freedom Cry is a game, that lets you play AC IV from a different angle\
      \ (I bought the standalone version instead of the DLC for \"Black Flag\"). This\
      \ angle is the career of Ad\xE9wal\xE9, the former quartermaster on Edward Kenway's\
      \ ship in Black Flag, after what happened in Assassin's Creed IV. The game is\
      \ short but if you have played Black Flag before this, it is a nice continuation\
      \ of the story. Map, gameplay-mechanics and functionalities are similar to Black\
      \ Flag. It is a nice little additional story to Black Flag but can also be played\
      \ independently, e.g. if you want to get a taste of what Black Flag feels like\
      \ (although the story is not in chronological order then). Shanties, graphics\
      \ etc are also there! Runs without major problems on a WIN10 1909 gaming-PC."
