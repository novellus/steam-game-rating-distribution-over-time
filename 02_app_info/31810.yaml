    reviews: "\u201CThis is an entry in the series that long-time fans will love\u2026\
      \ the game delivers strong in so many ways that you will look over any of the\
      \ weak puzzles and enjoy another outing with Nancy, the Hardys, and the usual\
      \ collection of goofy and humorous characters (even a recurring character from\
      \ a previous mystery!), accompanied by dialogue that\u2019s more crisp and witty\
      \ than it has been in a while.\u201D<br>Just Adventure<br><br>\u201CThe game\
      \ offers hours of thrilling detective work. As all the Nancy Drew games, Last\
      \ Train to Blue Moon Canyon is targeted to mystery fans ages 10 to adult. It\
      \ is worth noting that this is the kind of game that can be particularly enjoyable\
      \ to play with other people. You can have a wonderful time discovering the mystery\
      \ with a friend or family member. Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon can be easily\
      \ recommended to adventure and mystery fans.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.adventurelantern.com/Reviews/NDLastTrainToBlueMoonCanyon/NDLastTrainToBlueMoonCanyon.htm\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Adventure Lantern</a><br><br>\u201CThese\
      \ puzzles are varied, logical, and make sense in the train\u2019s historical\
      \ context, and there is something simply enjoyable about investigating the different\
      \ characters and piecing together clues to the mystery of both Lori Girard\u2019\
      s disappearance and Jake\u2019s old mine. Although more could have been made\
      \ to involve them in the investigation, the introduction of the Hardy Boys is\
      \ also a nice reward for longtime Nancy Drew fans.\u201D<br>Adventure Gamers<br>"

    review: Great game - really enjoyed it! I liked how there was more than just 1
      location in the entire story that you could explore, and it featured trying
      to solve a mystery with the Hardy Boys.
