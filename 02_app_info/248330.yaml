    review: I played this game when I was very young and then played it again often
      in high school. I'd spend many hours playing this game, and was sad when flash
      ended in 2021. Then I found it on steam and was relieved. This game is very
      fun and the background music and sounds are fun as well. This game is a very
      well priced and I'd recommend it for all ages. I bought it for myself and gifted
      it to a friend.
