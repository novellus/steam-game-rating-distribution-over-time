It's very difficult to die unless you really want to, so you can complete the game in one sitting if you want (about 90 minutes). I think it's like that by design.\nMost of the sprites look like they've been \"borrowed\" from commercial games.\nA lof of the manga-style background drawings look suspicious too.\nI couldn't find a fullscreen option, but you can maximize the window. And then everything on screen becomes squashed and blurred. It's very similar to playing on a SUPER NES!\nThe action also feels like the good old times, the same feeling you could have on 16bit consoles or arcade cabinet, and this is rather nice.\n\nA very pleasant experience if you accept that' it's going to be short and intense, but don't pay more than a couple dollars for it.\n\n[h1](follow my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url] for more retro and indie reviews)[/h1]","timestamp_created":1594869587,"timestamp_updated":1594870224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyIrrqvMCepLKlQI="}
