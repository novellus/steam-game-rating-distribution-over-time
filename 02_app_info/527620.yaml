    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">Create a first person kukri knife</h2><br>Follow
      along for free in this compact ~3 hour long tutorial as we model and texture
      a game ready first person kukri knife. Every step is documented without any
      fast forwarding. At the end of the free part you have the option to learn even
      more with the extended edition in which we go over 10 more triple A quality
      PBR textures.<br><br>The modeling part covers the scene setup followed by the
      low and high-poly modeling in which we make use of advanced actions, modifiers
      and tools to help us create our kukri. After the modeling process we will jump
      straight into the UVW Editor and focus on the importance of an optimized UV-Layout
      to get the maximum out of our texture.<br><br>In the Substance Painter 2 part
      we will then bake our normal map as well as other important support maps. Right
      after that you will learn how to create an ultra realistic texture for our kukri.
      Learn how to create our base layer materials and how to use procedural textures,
      masks and generators to form up the wear and tear on our kukri resulting in
      a photo realistic appearance.<h2 class="bb_tag">What are the requirements?</h2>It
      is recommended to follow the course with the same software we use throughout
      the tutorial: <br>3Ds Max 2017 (can be 2016 and 2015 too) and  Substance Painter
      2.<h2 class="bb_tag">Who is the target audience?</h2>This tutorial is aimed
      at beginners as well as intermediate. <br>I try to avoid heavy use of shortcuts
      as much as I can during the lesson so that you can see which actions I use.<h2
      class="bb_tag">What do I get from this course?</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Nearly
      3 hours of free fully documented and commented content. <br></li><li>Knowledge
      in modeling, unwrapping and texturing.<br></li><li>Essential reference images.<br></li><li>Final
      high-poly and low-poly kukri for those that just want to follow the texturing
      part.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Instructor Biography</h2>Hi! I''m Tim - Senior
