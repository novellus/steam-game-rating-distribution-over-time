This ain't one of those games. Let's play a game. Hold down the W key on the keyboard for about five or ten minutes. Done? Congratulations, you beat the game.\n\nNo joke, my flashlight wouldn't load in so I just held W to see how long it would take to die. I beat the game. In complete darkness by just holding W. I feel so acomplished now.","timestamp_created":1531727856,"timestamp_updated":1531727856,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557046949863433838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmIiG0eQCde2VpgE="}
