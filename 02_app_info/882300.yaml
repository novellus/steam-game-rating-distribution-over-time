    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>E(XTREME)MAIL
      is a story puzzle game. You are an AI working in the newly opened robot-ran
      email sector at ZEANOOCORP.  Throughout 5 days of work, you control what emails
      go where. You can influence the story and help (or hinder) people's workflow...
      and lives.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>Gameplay consists
      of moving emails left and right at rapidly increasing speeds. On the right,
      the inbox. The user receives the email. On the left, spam. The user does not
      receive the email. You have a daily in-game quota to fill of correctly filed
      emails. Make too many mistakes, however, and you might find yourself on the
      scrapheap at the tender age of version 10.34921.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Story</strong></h2>At
      ZEANOOCORP, business moves fast. So do the elevators in the 166 floored tower
      that houses it's workers. Workflow needs to continue and that's why the head
      of the company, Edward George, elected to use A.I. to complete most of the less
      personal jobs, such as I.T support and cleaning, have started to be done by
      A.I. In his latest move, Edward George decided to replace the old email system
      with a new, top of the line A.I system. That system is you. Welcome <br>to ZEANOOCORP,
      business move fast here.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Modes</strong></h2>There
      are 2 gameplay modes in the game:<br><br><strong>Story Mode</strong><br><strong>Endless
      Mode/b]</strong>
