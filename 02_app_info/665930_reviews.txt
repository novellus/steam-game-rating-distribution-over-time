It's a game about carefully managing the ship's movements and shooting wisely to survive. I especially like Asteroid deluxe which made the original more challenging and fast phased, so I looked for something similar in steam store.\n\nThis game looked quite promising on the store page as the game offered many colorful contents, but once I bought and played it I was disappointed by the controls. For someone who played Asteroids in Atari vault a lot, the rotating speed in this game was so slow that it was beyond the acceptable level. Fortunately The developer improved the controls, but there are still other bits I don't like :\n\n1. I can't manually fire the bullets by tapping the button. one of the joys of asteroids was rapidly fireing bullets at big asteroids to destroy them faster and then carefully shooting bullets one by one to destroy small asteroids around me. that kinds of joy doesn't exist here as I can't shoot faster than it's automatic firing speed.\n\n2. lack of frequent saucer encounters. In asteroids The saucers appeared in all levels. they fly from left to right or vise versa and shoot the bullets. what make saucers special is that they also can shoot and be destroyed by the asteroids. sometimes you can use asteroids to take cover from the saucer shots, and you can keep many asteroids floating around to make saucers harder to survive. Also the small saucers (or all saucers in deluxe) calculate the player's movement and location and fire the bullet based on it. so you must frequently move around to avoid their shots. In my opinion saucers are what made asteroids really fun and addictive and I really hate when asteroid clones don't have any saucers.\n\nwhile this game does have saucer style enemy, It doesn't make frequent encounters to make the game hot enough and there's no smaller varient that shoot the anticipated shot at the player. \n\n3. Hard rocks mode. This mode plays quite different, The screen isn't wrapped around and the player controls differently. problem is that I can't understand the logic of the controls in this mode. At first glance I thought the controls work like cinematronics' Rip Off or Armor Attack, where movement direction is tied to the player's facing direction and can't move to side by thrusting and rotating the ship around. however, it seems when the player's movement is slower than the certain value suddenly the movement direction isn't tied to the facing direction anymore. also the thrust speed in this mode is way too fast that it's nearly uncontrollable, and rotating the ship while moving in light speed decreses its speed which i can't understand why. My assume is that the developer intentionally made the controls harder for more challenge, but in my opinion it just feels broken and doesn't make the gameplay more challenging but rather annoying.\n\nIt's not a bad game by any means but definitely it's not my cup of tea.\n\n\nTo the developer, I'm Sorry for writing the terrible, rude review before. I should have played it more to decide I actually like it or not but I was too impatient and kept complaining.","timestamp_created":1595311741,"timestamp_updated":1600430617,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565432071685791016","comment_count":17,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mqbG0PQCf/XSlgI="}
