Just a heads up. I bought the pack because I also like the other songs. I don't have a capo, so I can't play this one. I'm going to look for a hair tie. I'll just put that over my guitar. I'll update and tell you peeps if it works.\n\n\nEdit: So, I don't have a hair tie. I don't know why I thought I did, I have short hair and my family is mostly just boys. I tried it without a capo and the song still plays. At the beginning when you're tuning you're guitar, when it asks for the capo, just put your finger where the capo is supposed to be.\n\nAlternatively if you want to use a capo but don't have one, I ( in a stroke of genuis) took an old earphone and just wrapped it around the strings and neck. That worked for me.","timestamp_created":1456086400,"timestamp_updated":1456087036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548131585121154785","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhp7jgtMCcPXDUQ=="}
