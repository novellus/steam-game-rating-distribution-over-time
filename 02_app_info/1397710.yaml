      \ the toilet paper is running low, and we have to decide who will be the unfortunate\

      \ and will need all their wit, and cunning to navigate the local market fair.\
      \ Enter Terry....Sani-Terry. Do you have what it takes to help guide Terry through\
      \ the impossible task of gathering enough toilet paper to survive another month?<br\
