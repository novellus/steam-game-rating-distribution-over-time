Seriously, nothing has been done on this game since it got here. I'm not sure if my game is different than other people's version of the game, but I only have \"Endless Mode\" on mine and it's totally worthless. For one, one of the achievements is supposed to become unlocked when you start the game. Apparently that's not true if you start \"endless mode\", because I've tried 5 times now and still no achievement. I have no idea what the other two are as they are hidden. Sure, you can pick the background color from a small list of options, and they all basically hurt your head after a while of staring at them. The worst one is the red background. For one, the background is red and the text is just a darker red. Have fun with that. The words listed in the game are more geared to a newbie learning the keyboard. No special characters, no punctuation, just basic lowercase words. There are other, much better, typing games out there. I can't justify spending $5 on what is essentially typershark with color.","timestamp_created":1540145089,"timestamp_updated":1540145089,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561308503150939941","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4nqHzy+YCd6OOrQE="}
