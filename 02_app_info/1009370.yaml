    review: 'It''s a pretty good platformer, albeit the controls are a bit confusing.

      The interface is something to be desired, and I can''t comment on the soundtrack.

      The core gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are fun to play around with once
      you realize exactly how they work.

      There are a few bugs, one of which gamebreaking and things that aren''t explained.

      I wish the developers luck in future projects, and hopefully with more experience
      they can start polishing them too.'
