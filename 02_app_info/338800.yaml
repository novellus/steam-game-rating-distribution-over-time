    reviews: "\u201CTrevor Chan has created a perfectly balanced conquest and combat\
      \ game that deserves the widest possible audience, and has all the depth that\
      \ Age of Empires lacked. Seven Kingdoms II is without question one of the finest\
      \ strategy games on the market, largely because the world it creates has realistic\
      \ dynamics and complexity never overwhelms, but adds a richness found far too\
      \ rarely in strategy games.\u201D<br>9.1 rating - Gamespot \u2013 <a href=\"\

      Seven Kingdoms II is a highly-enjoyable and highly-detailed strategy game with\
      \ seemingly limitless options and avenues for replayability. If you were one\
      \ of the folks who missed out on its predecessor because you already dumped\
      \ your cash on other RTS games or perhaps felt the genre was over-saturated,\
      \ be sure to consider this sequel for an entertaining and deeply challenging\
      \ gaming experience.\u201D<br>8.6 rating - IGN \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/17/seven-kingdoms-ii-the-fryhtan-wars\"\

      Seven Kingdoms II is a deep, rich, incredibly satisfying game that blends myriad\
      \ gameplay elements with a near-perfect balance ...... Seven Kingdoms II makes\
      \ it work smoothly and creates one of the most addictive strategy games of the\
      \ season.\u201D<br>90% rating \u2013 PC Gamer<br>"

    review: looks good Runs bad. Real bad. The game does not like Windows 10. There
      is a fix for the game, but  it did not work for me. So if you buy this game,
      keep the refund policy in mind just in case the fix doesn't work for you either.
