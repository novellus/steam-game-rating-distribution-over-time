    review: got this game in a bundle that was $3.24 and had 11 games so this game
      was basically 29 cents. very easy game, played and beat all the levels in one
      run that took like 3 hours. probably gonna uninstall because theres nothing
      more to it but it wasn't bad for the cheap price. It's cheaper than going to
      an arcade and inserting two quarters and the gameplay was pretty much the same
      as a flash miniclip game. experience wasn't bad for me and its a good game to
      just have in the background while you chat with friends or watch them stream
      other games
