    about_the_game: "Unreal Tournament 2004 is a multiplayer first person shooter\
      \ that combines the kill-or-be-killed experience of gladiatorial combat with\
      \ cutting-edge technology. Ten game modes - both team-based and &quot;every\
      \ man for himself&quot; -- provide even the most hardcore gamer with palm-sweating\
      \ challenges through unbelievably detailed indoor arenas and vast outdoor environments.\
      \ As the ultimate techno-gladiator of the future, players will take their fates\
      \ into their hands, battling against up to 32 other players online in action-packed,\
      \ frag-filled arenas.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Assault Mode</strong>\
      \ - Assault mode returns! Redesigned for UT2004, this fan-favorite mode sees\
      \ teams face-off to defend and attack fortified bases, from fast-moving trains,\
      \ barreling across an arid alien desert to a Skaarj mother ship, poised to attack\
      \ the human home world. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Onslaught Mode</strong>\
      \ - Onslaught mode takes team combat to the next level! Opposing teams are pitted\
      \ against each other to capture and hold strategic points in order to attack\
      \ and destroy the enemy power core. Taking place in massive outdoor environments,\
      \ here is where vehicular combat comes into its own. Flying and driving machines\
      \ take combatants to the frontline and gigantic mobile battle stations serve\
      \ as a platform from which to launch devastating attacks. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Vehicles</strong>\
      \ - Rev-up and ride out in an array of land-, air-, and space-based vehicles\
      \ that play critical roles in a successful combat strategy in Assault and Onslaught.\
      \ With vehicles ranging from single man fighters to five man behemoths, Unreal\
      \ Tournament 2004 provides players with plenty of choices when shopping for\
      \ a mechanized implement of destruction. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Levels</strong>\
      \ - More than 95 maps will be available immediately, including more than 45\
      \ brand new maps for all existing game play modes as well as new modes of play.\
      \ Vast outdoor environments, deep space combat areas and tightly packed indoor\
      \ techno-arenas are all waiting for the latest entrants to the Tournament. <br>\t\
      \t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Weapons</strong> - The entire smorgasbord of frag-dealing\
      \ weaponry from Unreal Tournament 2003 returns for the experienced player to\
      \ wield masterfully against new contestants. Those armaments are joined by three\
      \ new implements of doom: the Mine layer, which disperses spider-like bombs\
      \ that chase and harass any enemy that comes within range; the anti vehicle\
      \ rocket launcher, or AVRiL, which deals out a payload of massive rockets tuned\
      \ to seek and destroy enemy mechanized units; the Grenade Launcher, which launches\
      \ timed explosives that will bounce on the ground and stick to enemies and enemy\
      \ vehicles, only to be triggered by the weapons altfire command; and, the return\
      \ of the notorious Sniper Rifle from the original Unreal tournament, completely\
      \ redesigned and upgraded to make heads roll. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>New\
      \ Characters</strong> - Unreal Tournament 2004 introduces 32 new characters\
      \ on four new teams: The human Thunder Crash, lead by Tournament hero, Malcolm;\
      \ the Robotic Corrupt, lead by an upgraded Xan Kriegor; the Iron Skull, a team\
      \ of merciless Skaarj warriors; and the Hellions -- wreckless human mercenaries\
      \ and pirates who delight in the thrill of the kill. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>New\
      \ Technology</strong> - Unreal Tournament not only brings new content for hardcore\
      \ fans to relish, it also delivers a tremendous technology update over its predecessor,\
      \ delivering a faster, slicker, deeper experience than ever before.</li></ul>"
