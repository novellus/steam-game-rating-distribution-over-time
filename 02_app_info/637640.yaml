    review: "Seems to be a dead game.\n\nAs Micah already told in his review 2 month\
      \ ago, the positioning of the pistol in your hand is more like you're holding\
      \ a sword.\nIt's an arcade style game with upgrades you can buy, but you loose\
      \ them when you die.\nalso the ground is not synched to my roomscaling, in every\
      \ other gameand vive home the ground is on the ground,\nhere the ground is nearly\
      \ on my knees.\n\nYep, it could have been a funny game when these things are\
      \ fixed. \nits not that complicated to rearrange the pistol on the controller\
      \ and add some extra lives.\n\nhave played better games which were free to play.\n\
      i have no idea who the developer is, but it looks like its his first game.\n\
      \nits has potential and i would have played it much longer an kept it when at\
      \ least the pistols were fixed, but in this case i had to return the game"
