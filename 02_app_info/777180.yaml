    review: 'A waste of my damn money, here i was thinking i was investing on a software
      to make small servers to play on with my friends on any game i wanted with your
      tipical features a game panel should have if it''s gonna try to be put to sale,
      but no, all it has for any game at all is setting up ports and little else,
      DO NOT BUY IT

      IT''S A WASTE OF MONEY AND THE DEVELOPER IS A SCAMMER'
