Give it time, it'll grow on you. I initially thought it was grindy but after upgrading my keep and unlocking a few classes, the \"customization\" depth started to open up. There are a lot of quality of life items/upgrades you'll want to take. After that, you  can just jump right into the action. Dollar for dollar, definitely a good time passer if you're waiting for the next release or have a loot itch you can't quite scratch.\n\nReminds me of a turned based Diablo 2. Scratches that loot and dungeon crawler fix. Stats on items and sets are more akin to Grim Dawn, WOW or Diablo 3 than Diablo 2. Set \"types\" can be assigned to any item and each item can have any number of stats (better or worse). Set pieces also support partial completion for when you want some of the bonuses but don't want to fully commit to all the items in the set (allowing you to mix and match 2  sets if you want). Sets don't appear to be on weapons tho. Loot is  locked behind character level so don't expect to find level 10 loot from monsters while you're still level 4... but you can equip anything you find (most items are for your current party- did I mention you can have more than one party? Tho not at the same time). Shops have higher level loot so you could buy items you can equip later (if you see something powerful or lucky and want to snatch it before going on a quest to level up).\n\nSome reviews say that the difficulty is bad/unbalanced. You can change the difficulty in game at any moment. Increasing it increases your loot quality. I appreciate this feature a lot now. If you run into a horrible dungeon (every dungeon can have attributes that change how it plays) or you run into a hoard of monsters that just annoy the living crap out of you, you can tone them down and get on with having fun! I hate when games stop being fun and being able to \"soft bypass\" the annoying enemies  is nice. When you're ready and powerful, crank up the difficulty to rake in that sweet loot. If you can handle it. If not, play on easy and miss out on all those fat rewards.\n\nCan sell items anywhere from within your inventory which is a nice quality of life feature and keeps your stash organized. Which is good cuz travelling the map is kind of slow (but not Diablo 2 slow at least) and would suck if I had to go back to town to sell all the poor quality items I collect. I just got spoiled by the \"instant\" action roguelikes that take you from one encounter to the next. Walk? Hahaha... that's for peasants! Just kidding. Traveling and exploring the world map is part of the game. Also, recently discovered \"waypoints\" that allow you to teleport instantly for free... so nevermind what I just said. If you want a non-stop dungeon grinder, use the waypoints to bypass walking! Walking is still a feature as that is how you find secret locations and waypoints initially.\n\nThere are 7 factions you run missions for. Reputation goes to 1000 for each of the 7 factions. I thought this was grindy at first a couple hours in you can easily score 200+ points with a faction in under an hour (and probably faster if I wasn't focused primarily on running dungeons and getting sweet loot). So 1000 doesn't seem so bad in hindsight. You unlock new classes at the 500 mark and get bonuses every 250 points you sink in making the reputation worth it in the long run.\n\nCharacter skills are simple but provide enough depth  to feel like your choices matter and you can mold your team to your playstyle. Characters seem to level a tad slower than I'd like but we'll see... So far they're powering up nicely. Skills and item stats crush your character's inherit attributes. Kind of like Diablo 2 or 3. Seems like skills and gear matter the most but the extra point or two to your character's stats help out in the early levels. Maybe if you get 5-10 points at later levels your character stats will still contribute... Maybe characters should get their level/2 in stat points on level up. So far I seem to only get 1 point each level. Recently I found some items you can buy/find to increase your stats so there's that.\n\nA good time sink if you're bored and need something to fill the void. You pay for what you get. Could benefit from a \"keyboard only\" layout. That might improve input speed (player wise). There are some keyboard shortcuts and I appreciate the ones that were put in but would be nice if everything had a keyboard shortcut.\n\nOverall, I really like this game and it's my current addiction. Good place to zone out, zen and find your gamer flow. Would definitely buy again and wish I had bought it a year ago.","timestamp_created":1609261345,"timestamp_updated":1609805555,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40+z45/YCcfO/vgI="}
