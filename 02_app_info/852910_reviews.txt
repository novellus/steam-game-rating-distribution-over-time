In order to get full experience you must to purchase the [u][url=jastusa.com/sweet-pool-dlc] uncensor patch[/url] [/u], but it has no guarantee of work properly, so you might be throwing your money out. I only played 6 hours of Steam's, i couldn't go any futher because the game was crashing oftenly.\n\nSo, this review's mostly from [u] [url=jastusa.com/sweet-pool] Jast Blue's version [/url][/u] \nOverall, i got 34 hours of game time and i reached 5 out of 6 endings.\n\n[b] Characters / plot [/b]\nI simply enjoed this game dispise of its depressing atmosphere. It's basically a twisted romance that will shake your guts inside out. \nAll characters concepts work like a charm, there's no waste, if they exist, they're useful and quite interesting in their own way, even the tagged as \"evil\" ones are lovable in my opnion.\nI apreciate the unpredictable factor, the plot itself is intriguing and rich of content, based on certain reviews i was expecting only tragic outcomes from it, but there is a good ending and it made me even more satisfied, on the other hand there's a ending that made me even more curious about what will happen next...so mind blowing!\n\n[b] Visual / audio content [/b] \nI love the characters designs, such good-looking cast (specialy Kitani and Tetsuo) and the voice acting makes the perfect match to each one in any single context, the unique detail that bothered me a little was when i confused Youji and Tetsuo voices during certain dialogues.\nAll CG's are so beautiful, i like how the scenes are discribed and how it zoom in and zoom out in order to focus certain spots of a same image, giving the static scenary a motion feeling afterall. Prepare yourself, sweet pool's full of strong content like non-consensual sex, gore and cannibalism.\nThe sexual events aren't much but wild, Youjii's voice actor is certain way competent for the role.I couldn't help by noticing that Youji x Tetsuo reminds me Taki x Klaus from [i]Maiden Rose[/i] in terms of rough sex. \nIn general, the dynamic elements (quality voice acting, sound effects, soundtrack and visual effects) conbinated throughout the narrative give to the player a sample of how the scene would taste like. \nA minor point that bothered me was some design elements included at pop-up windows (Save, load, quit etc) and text box's sprite that are kinda retro and glitched looking when compared to the whole game quality, but after knowing the sweet pool content, i believe it was made on purpose to give us a disturbing vibe.I also think that the main menu design looks so basic for such quality VN.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] \nThe first time i've played sweet pool was from demo and i found it unconfortable, the decision making system isn't like regular visual novels i've played - Out of expectations, there's no text options, it's all about a red and blue dichotomy which are presented as instinct and reason respectively. It may be confusing for absent-minded newcomers.\nThe choices tree is robust, except for the multiple endings, the core storyline won't suffer major changes.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2276651711","timestamp_created":1598821193,"timestamp_updated":1610145409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539622604846954346","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/qSJ8vYCfuvongI="}
