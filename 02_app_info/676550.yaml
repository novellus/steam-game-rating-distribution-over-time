    about_the_game: "Billy works in a high tech factory, only... he\u2019s kind of\
      \ a dummy. His job is to test all kinds of wacky vehicles and contraptions.\
      \ Your job is to make sure he survives the test in one piece... or not, we are\
      \ overstocked on these units anyway, so go nuts!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game\
      \ contains two game modes, Mission mode and Sandbox mode. Mission mode currently\
      \ has 9 missions where the objective is to get the crash test dummy, Billy,\
      \ to the checkpoint. To get to the checkpoint you have to overcome certain obstacles,\
      \ such as jump over a wall, fly up to an elevated platform, fit through a small\
      \ opening and so on. To achieve this, you must design a vehicle using the available\
      \ parts, such as building blocks, wheels, jets, rollers, de-couplers and many\
      \ more. Once you are happy with your vehicle, you must pilot it through the\
      \ level and get Billy to check point. While doing so, you must also keep an\
      \ eye on the maximum g-forces acting on Billy. Exceed the threshold and the\
      \ mission is a failure. Good luck!"
