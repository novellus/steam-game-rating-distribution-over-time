    review: 'Caution, spoilers.



      This is just bad and lazy.  Atelier Lydie and Suelle had two great DLC dungeons
      with new (well really from other Gust games) monsters and Bosses.  The items
      obtained from there and the enemies were worth farming and add so much options
      for end game gear.

      This dungeon has none of that!  The monsters are just buffed versions already
      in the game and there''s no new traits worth farming to put on your gear for
      your next game run!

      There are new items/traits but all they do is increase quality while limiting
      one attribute to 0. There''s one more that increases quantity made by 1.  But
      if you already reached this point and are already strong enough to beat the
      entrance boss, I seriously doubt you need these traits.'
