      The games story takes a couple twists and spices things up in upcoming levels
      and also has unique unlockable game modes upon completion of game. Don''t give
      up and keep playing !


      Hopefully you can change your review also once you finish the game'

    review: I wish there was a Meh score. Not thumbs up, not thumbs down just kinda
      eh, if you got 5 bucks and its on sale and you want to waste an afternoon ...
      you could certainly do worse. I got stuck later on in the game where it gives
      you the opportunity to play a game in the game. You play a space alien with
      a ray gun attacking Zombies. Anyways, somehow I got stuck in the arcade, Couldn't
      leave the screen even though there was a hand pointing the way. IDK. I was kinda
      burnt out by that point anyways.
