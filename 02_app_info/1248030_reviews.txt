Pretty amazing when you realize that is the work of a single person.\nHighly recommended !\n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1608761379,"timestamp_updated":1608761379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i9HpyPYCc8zMvAI="}
