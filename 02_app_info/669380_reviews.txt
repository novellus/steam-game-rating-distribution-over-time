You can see the path in the mountains. Several NPCs tell you to go north then east to reach it.  But it is visible once you speak with Rickard and get your orders (which you have done).  \n\nI hope this helps.\n\nGlad it helped!  If you have any further questions let me know!\n"}],"cursor":"AoJ4zb7b+fUCcKntrwI="}
