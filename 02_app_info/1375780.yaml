    about_the_game: "This is a game in which being scammed is a feature. You will\
      \ be trying to mind your own business and collect coin-like objects while being\
      \ hunted by evil red squares. But out of no where you will get scammed. This\
      \ game is also a scam, it is clearly a scam I would not recommend playing this\
      \ for your whole life. Spending money on this will not change your life in any\
      \ way. However it might help you pass the time, the loading screen is pretty\
      \ long so there's a cool feature. It is totally intentional too. The game has\
      \ state of the art pixel graphics, and the music will help you sleep. By sleep\
      \ I mean, obviously you will have nightmares, but you will close the game so\
      \ quickly you will not be on your computer anymore. This game is clearly a public\
      \ service that should be rewarded with the utmost respect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nControls are:<br />\r\nWASD to move<br />\r\nSpace to shoot<br />\r\nCursor\
      \ to get scammed"
