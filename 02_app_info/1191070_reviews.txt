Very PS1 era graphics with modern controls. It takes place in an old Japanese hotel, with lots of dark rooms to explore and items to collect. If you played Aka Manto, this is way better in my opinion as Yuki doesn't show up every 5 seconds (as well as more accessible hiding places) and the map doesn't feel as claustrophobic. This game is a steal at 5 bucks. It even has two different ending, think you can get them both?","timestamp_created":1609645881,"timestamp_updated":1609645881,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46t6X4/YCdcr5vwI="}
