    review: 'While I found the initial concept of the game interesting enough to buy
      and was quite looking forward to a choose your own adventure story in a setting
      I haven''t experienced before I was disappointed in how the game doesn''t seem
      to take itself very seriously. No matter what you do your character always seems
      to gravitate toward an "interest" in drinking even if you choose not to over
      and over, furthermore the game throws an almost superfluous amount of opportunities
      to get "physical" with the gender/s you''re attracted to (Granted we aren''t
      talking about full on descriptive "scenes" more just a glossed over "you did
      that" but it seemed a bit tasteless how often one of the choices in a social
      situation was to bed someone.). The stats are fairly odd and don''t quite seem
      to link up with the narrative (EG: My starting stats listed "blood alcohol level:
      Intoxicated" yet they were moving, talking, and operating tools with no problem)
      and even redoing character creation a few times the lowest I managed to get
      for that particular stat was "tipsy" from the beginning, there was also a distinct
      lack of a "here are your stats, are you happy with them or would you like to
      redo them?" option at the end of character creation. I''ve only played through
      it once so far but a fair few of the decisions I made in my play-through felt
      as is they had no real bearing on anything. I got this on a discount during
      a sale and I still wouldn''t recommend it


      Edit: I''ve now noticed my play time and thought I should clarify, yes it''s
      still only one play through but I forgot to close the game when I left to go
      do some stuff in town'
