Here you go!\nSo, just four bucks and it's yours, folks.\nI honestly did not enjoy the base game.\nThat's the honest truth, I simply didn't.\nAnd I already gave it a negative review.\nNot all of the DLC's deserve it, though.\nMap packs are really cool in my books.\nBecause they do increase my playtime.\nCustomization however doesn't do so.\nJust two bikes with one rider included.\nThere's also the sticker and two horns.\nIt's honestly overpriced in my opinion.\nFour bucks for customization is awful.\nI have to give this my negative review.","timestamp_created":1606259487,"timestamp_updated":1606259487,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458265155553817749","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kdah/vUCdNepsAI="}
