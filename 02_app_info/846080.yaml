    review: This is the emotionally heaviest thing that's ever happened to me in three
      decades of playing video games.  It's such a weird experiment but it's wild
      to think that so many of these recorded answers are statements that people would
      never make to their own family and/or friends.   It's also interesting that
      in about an hour of listening to the recorded answers, there was never a "bad"
      one.  Simply absolute strangers peeling back their psyche and explaining deep
      failures and thoughts to someone they'll never hear from themselves.   This
      isn't a fun experience but it's an intensely insightful one.
