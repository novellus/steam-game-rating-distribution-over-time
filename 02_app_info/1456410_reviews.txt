Upon purchasing the game I played for over 3 hours without break and could easily have played for longer. Every time I started a new round I found myself trying different strategies and learning new ways to play. If you're looking for a game to just sink your teeth into for a couple of hours then I'd definitely recommend Paper Shooter! It's exactly what it says on the tin. 10/10 best early access game I've played in a long while!","timestamp_created":1608714979,"timestamp_updated":1608714979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ469C4x/YCepCzvAI="}
