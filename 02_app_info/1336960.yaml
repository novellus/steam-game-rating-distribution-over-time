    review: "I just bought and installed the game, because it looked like it could\
      \ be fun. I was wrong. There's very few songs, and not only that, the last less\
      \ than a minute. Each stage is the same song, but just a little more difficult.Speaking\
      \ of difficulty,  at any difficulty other than easy or normal, you can bet you'll\
      \ have a workout and sore fingers. \n\nThe key combinations are weird, and no\
      \ matter how proficient you are at keyboarding or playing the piano, (which\
      \ I am), this game will have you scratching your head and wishing you were Mrs.\
      \ Fantastic with rubber fingers.\n\nI'd recommend saving your $10 and look somewhere\
      \ else."
