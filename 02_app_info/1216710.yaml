    about_the_game: "Hello everyone, we are Aluba Studios, and we are happy to share\
      \ our game with you: <strong><i>Cyber Manhunt</i></strong>.<br>Yes, this is\
      \ a cyber manhunt games, combined with a <strong><i>network of violence</i></strong>,\
      \ <strong><i>big data</i></strong>, <strong><i>loss of privacy</i></strong>\
      \ and <strong><i>other social problems</i></strong>, to the story of puzzle\
      \ games.<br>Many of our plot settings refer to <strong><i>real events</i></strong>,\
      \ so you can also see some familiar figures from some character image setting\
      \ maps, and you can think of reality after playing the game.<br><strong><h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Theme Idea</h2></strong><br>During the internal communication,\
      \ we found that when the Internet continues to penetrate people's lives and\
      \ accelerate the transmission of information, a negative event can quickly spread\
      \ throughout the Internet.<br>In this process, sin will be exposed and punished,\
      \ which will make people happy; but some people will suffer malicious insults\
      \ and insults from the Internet keyboard man. When these <strong><i>cyber violence</i></strong>\
      \ continue to escalate, the consequences often exceed the incident itself, and\
      \ even more stressful and end precious lives.<br>Therefore, we decided to develop\
      \ such a game related to the theme of &quot;<strong><i>hacking</i></strong>&quot;,\
      \ &quot;<strong><i>cyber manhunt</i></strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong><i>privacy\
      \ data leakage</i></strong>&quot;. We hope that players can <strong><i>play\
      \ the role of a hacker</i></strong>, and find out their <strong><i>privacy secrets</i></strong>,\
      \ like God controls the destiny of others behind his back and witnesses their\
      \ end. I hope that through this process, players can think and make their own\
      \ right judgments.<br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2></strong><br>Implemented\

      \ known information to enter into the database. After filtering, perhaps other\
      \ information about the target object.<br><br><i><strong>\xB7Crack</strong></i><br>Generate\
      \ passwords based on the obtained target person information, and use it to log\
      \ in to accounts on various platforms (including email, social platforms, chat\
      \ software, etc.)<br><br><i><strong>\xB7Disguise</strong></i><br>Obtain the\
      \ needs, social circles, etc. of the target object, choose disguise according\
      \ to the information, and get more information by contacting the target object<br><br><i><strong>\xB7\

      \ are a lot of Social Engineering features in the game, also include Reasoning,\
      \ Tracking, Puzzles-Solving, Destroying and Invading etc..<br><br><strong>\xB7\
      Complex Story</strong><br>The game will judge the good and evil of the player's\
      \ behavior. Different judgments will trigger the corresponding plot direction.<br><br><strong>\xB7\

      \ and <strong><i>Orwell</i></strong> etc., we also want to make a game that\
      \ allows players to think outside the game. Therefore, in terms of subject matter,\
      \ I also racked my brains.<br>And in order to give players a real hacking experience,\
      \ we even established a social engineering group to find some professor in the\
      \ industry and ask them about social engineering. I even read the book <strong><i>The\
      \ Art of Deception</i></strong> by the famous hacker Kevin David Mitnick, and\
      \ saw how the real hacker master works. These online and offline learning directly\
      \ opened the door to a new world for everyone in our team. The disciplines involved\
      \ include social engineering, psychology, micro-expressions, tactics, etc. The\
      \ rich content also allows us full of confidence in the subject matter and gameplay\
      \ of the game.<br>Not just professionals and books, we are also looking for\
      \ inspiration in some film works. For example, through <strong><i>Who Am I:\
      \ No System Is Safe</i></strong>, we have seen more artistic and more representative\
      \ forms of hacking technology. Through <strong><i>Searching</i></strong> we\
      \ have learned how to create reversals in details and how let the audience /\
      \ player focus on where we expect them to focus. Every part of the learning\
      \ has benefited us a lot, and we can't wait to use them in our games.<br><br>To\
      \ sum up, this game is very <strong><i>special and unique</i></strong> which\
      \ combines a lot of features. I really hope that you guys could like this game\
      \ much. Please feel free to leave your messages or feedback in Community."
