    review: "Pretty good, a little rough around the edges in terms of presentation\
      \ and UI but is clearly a game made by someone who plays games and has a good\
      \ understanding of the underlying mechanics of games and what makes them fun.\n\
      \nClass variety is pretty good, though some are much more action-intensive than\
      \ others (e.g. enchanter) which can make them feel weaker or less useful compared\
      \ to others that can get more results with less actions.\n\nCombat is generally\
      \ good, though the procedural generation does frequently result in fights that\
      \ are just clumps of one enemy type in a largely featureless room. The actual\
      \ tactical depth and variety in these combat encounters is good enough that\
      \ this isn't a huge detriment, but it does make a lot of the combat feel 'same-y'\
      \ as you explore each area, with the main variation being which enemy type you're\
      \ fighting. Having more mixed-enemy battles, like the ones against rival parties,\
      \ would have been fantastic. The AI is at least decent challenge, not so weak\
      \ as to be trivial but not so smart as to be frustrating to fight. \n\nThe occasional\
      \ puzzle and puzzle room is a great change of pace, and the music is remarkably\
      \ good, with each area also having its own theme and combat music.\n\nMy main\
      \ problem was how quickly it all ended. I explored a bit too far and found myself\
      \ having beaten the game before I was really satisfied with it, and then it\
      \ dawned on me how small the game really is. This stands out especially due\
      \ to the procedural generation, which in hindsight almost feels out of place\
      \ given the small scale. This is perhaps a larger issue than it would normally\
      \ would be because of how engaging the core gameplay can be, so it's more disappointing\
      \ to 'run out of road', so to speak.\n\nStill, the price is definitely right\
      \ for what you get, and it's a pretty fun experience if you're into party building\
      \ and turn based combat."
