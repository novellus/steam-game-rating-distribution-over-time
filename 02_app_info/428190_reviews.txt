But it didn't.\n\nThere's nothing to do except walking around and driving in cars, the animations are glitchy and unfinished, there's a lot of bugs for a relatively simple game.\n\nWouldn't recommend.","timestamp_created":1460057088,"timestamp_updated":1609075046,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw55aW0vYCesqDVQ=="}
