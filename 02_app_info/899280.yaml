    short_description: The populist wave that has swept across the world has reached
      Japan. With a jittery economy and scandals in the previous government on the
      minds of the public the government that emerges following a set of snap elections
      is more nationalist and populist than ever.

    review: "The best LIVE scenario I\xB4ve played to date. Offers great and challenging\
      \ Air Combat and (Anti-) Submarine Warfare.\n\nHowever I second an another reviewer\
      \ that devs should watch out in the future that the assets shown in the introduction\
      \ video are really present in the scenario like the Su-57."
