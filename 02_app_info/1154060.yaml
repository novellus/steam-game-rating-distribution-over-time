    review: 'Be aware that the gates of the walled garden, is not dynamic. In plain
      speaky: they doesn''t work ;)

      I don''t recommend this if you really love gates that open and close. However,
      the items are beautiful, so I would say: buy this when on sale, because you
      do get some pretty walls and things to go with. So instead of thumb up or down
      i say 50/50.

      Oh and: try the Gameguru store; it is waaaay bigger than the limited and expensive
      list of official dlc''s here, even when they are greatlooking. I shop both places.'
