    about_the_game: "Firefight is a World War II real-time simulation game with more\
      \ AI and attention to detail than any other game in its genre to date. Tanks\
      \ are modelled with a physics engine and have gears, rev counters and speedos,\
      \ and steer themselves with brake levers to give them realistic looking tracked\
      \ vehicle movement. Each bullet, shell or piece of shrapnel is modelled in 3D\
      \ and ricochets realistically off sloping surfaces. You can see each infantryman's\
      \ rank, name, weapon, ammunition remaining, heart rate and fatigue levels. Machine\
      \ gunners will call for ammunition when they're running low and other squad\
      \ members will rush over with spare ammo if they are carrying any. Wounded men\
      \ call for medics who will sprint over to administer first aid. Off-board artillery\
      \ can be called in but will have to fire several ranging shots before the full\
      \ 8 gun battery opens fire simultaneously.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 9 maps\
      \ to choose from, and each map has eight scenarios. The scenarios give you the\
      \ option to play as any of the major nationalities involved in fighting on the\
      \ Western Front from 1939 right up to 1945."

    short_description: Firefight is a World War II real-time simulation game similar
      in style to the old Close Combat series but brought up to date with better AI,
      individual soldier modelling, a faster frame rate to give more intense and realistic
      combat and an easy to use command interface.
