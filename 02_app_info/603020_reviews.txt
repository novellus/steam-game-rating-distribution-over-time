The controls are smooth, and the art style is nice. If you like games in this genre, but want a bit more of a challenge, this game is for you. Be sure to check out the other 3 games in the Skautfold series, they're all different and great.","timestamp_created":1593478838,"timestamp_updated":1607212294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw96vUmvYCepK/kQI="}
