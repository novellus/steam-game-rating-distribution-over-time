      \ comes to Train Simulator, featuring stunning scenery and an all new Class\
      \ 37/4 diesel locomotive, developed by Thomson Interactive.<br><br>The original\
      \ West Highland Line between Glasgow and Fort William was opened in 1894 by\
      \ the North British Railway, with the extension from Fort William to Mallaig\
      \ opening six years later, connecting the largest city in Scotland with the\
      \ Atlantic coast.<br><br>The route, built by Robert McAlpine, boasts 11 tunnels\
      \ and eight major bridge structures, including the iconic 21 arch span Glenfinnan\
      \ Viaduct and Borrodale Viaduct, at the time of construction the world\u2019\
      s longest single span concrete arch at 124ft.<br><br>The line opened up new\
      \ opportunities for tourism and a way of transporting fish catches from the\
      \ coast to new markets inland. Today, the 41 mile line thrives as a tourism\
      \ attraction, with steam hauled trains operating daily trips during the summer.<br><br>A\
      \ key feature of the route is its Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB) signalling,\
      \ which replaced semaphore signalling in 1987. The system spreads across the\
      \ West Highland Line and is operated from a purpose-built signalling centre\
      \ at Banavie.<br><br>Included with the route is a new Class 37/4 diesel locomotive,\
      \ featuring new exterior modelling and unique simulated power and braking performance.\
      \ The mode contains a wealth of detailing, including automatically fitted snowploughs\
      \ according to the season, dynamically cleared snow, animated cooling fans,\
      \ operating exterior fuel tank gauges, functional cab radio and RETB CDU, instrument\
      \ lighting and dimming, and even a hotplate for warming your soup!<br><br>Accompanying\
      \ rolling stock includes Mk1 coaches in BR blue/grey livery and Scotrail West\

    review: "Ok, so, the price is really expensive, and horribly overpriced, but that's\
      \ the thing that puts it down, because the actual route as absolutely beautiful,\
      \ the Ambience of the whole route is amazing, especially if you do a night run\
      \ of the whole route with snow, the 37/4 sounds are quite nice, however need\
      \ some tweaking, but one thing that puts this route down A LOT is the sound\
      \ of the water, it sounds like someone is swimming through jello. I would recommend\
      \ this on a sale, this is my all time favorite route in my all time favorite\
      \ country :3 Now just a quick rating:\n\nScenery: 5/5 \n\nLocomotives: 3/5\n\
      \nLagginess (lower means laggier): 2/5\n\nPrice: 2/5\n\nDrivability: 5/5\n\n\
