    review: "Sorry (mostly to the devs) to write a \"negative review\".. \n\nMost\
      \ people seem to enjoy this game which is great, i did not...  :-/\n\nPlayed\
      \ around 10 Levels and frankly found it boring, no real challenge or anything\
      \ compeling me to continue playing...  I think my expectation was something\
      \ as bit more fast-paced, or challenging, or that something would come back\
      \ \"pong style\"... To just stand there hurling balls, was... well, boring..\n\
      \nSorry again to be such a drag...but cant recommend this..."
