World Tour: Australian Puzzles\" has easy and hard jigsaw puzzles, and a range in-between.\n\nWhen I started, I had assumed that the jigsaw would take up the entire playing area (which is the case with other computer jigsaw games I've played), but that's not the case here (I thought I was missing some pieces when I first saw that).\n\nYou can store pieces in the upper left corner, which is handy.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't take a proper screenshot of the finished puzzle, as the picture fades out as soon as you complete it. That was disappointing.\n\n\"1001 Jigsaw. World Tour: Australian Puzzles\" is a good little game to play if you like jigsaw puzzles.\n\nI bought this game on Australia Day.\nI played this game on Australia Day.\nIt seemed the right thing to do.","timestamp_created":1580043492,"timestamp_updated":1587695562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0fWB1fECc/eb7gE="}
