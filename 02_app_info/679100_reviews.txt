The only thing that seems missing right now is saving/loading games, since the campaign starts over if you return to the menu.\n\nI've yet to try playing with friends but I bought the game as some sort of a donation to the developer. If I'm not mistaken, he said it has been in development for over 2 years.\n\nBuy it if you like an innovative and realistic take on space shooters.","timestamp_created":1517783719,"timestamp_updated":1517783719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528985500335693359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4xbO9seECcamEmAE="}
