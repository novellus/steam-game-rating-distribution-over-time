      \ come out of it during the next day. From day to day, the number and the frequency\
      \ will both always rise progressively. But unlike the number of Dupes, which\
      \ vary from map to map, the frequency is fixed by the color of the entrance\
      \ and will always behave the same during the game according to its color. Across\
      \ the different maps, you\u2019ll encounter 4 types of emission rate, from the\
      \ weakest to the strongest, recognizable by their color : green, yellow, blue,\
      \ and purple. Green entrances will emit far less Dupes per second than the purple\
      \ entrance will. \n\nAttendance needs to fit the shop capacity. Generally, the\
      \ higher the buying cost of the shop, the bigger its capacity. So, the higher\
      \ the attendance, the more capacity you\u2019ll need, and the more expensive\
      \ the shop should be that you need to place there.\nThese two very important\
      \ indicators can also be reviewed at the end of each day. Using the toggle buttons\
      \ at the bottom left of the summary capsule, you can display above each shop\
      \ respectively how many Dupes were turned away due to a lack of space (the aim\
      \ is to keep this number as low as possible), the daily income and the average\
      \ occupancy rate (while trying to maximize those).\n\nFollowing these simple\
      \ steps should generally get you easily out of the first milestones of each\
      \ map, because fitting the shop capacity to the attendance is the key to reaching\
      \ the objective, and will always yield honorable results.\nOnce you get acquainted\
      \ to this base principle, you\u2019ll naturally start to build your own much\
      \ deeper strategies\u2026\n\nHere is a guide with deeper explanations and some\
      \ strategy tips:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2268942477"

    review: 'This game bills itself as a puzzley tower defense game, but is

      none of the above. The way to solve each "puzzle" is to guess

      correctly at what kind of shop should go where, and when to

      upgrade them. There is no strategy or clue decoding. There is a

      help button that tells you the correct answer, and that''s

      basically it.


      Tower defense games give players choices and tradeoffs. Puzzle

      games give players the tools they need to solve the puzzle. This

      game gives players a bunch of things to try.


      Pros: The music is nice. The flavor text is sometimes amusing.

      Cons: It''s not fun. I have trouble imagining anyone finding it fun.
