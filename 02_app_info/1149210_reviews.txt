I'll be honest. the controls are clunky and stiff. the physics feels all over the place and the difficulty of some stuff feels extremly unfair. \n\nThat said. if you're willing to stick with it to get used to the controls and get used to the physics theres a suprising amount of fun to be had and a good laugh to have along the way","timestamp_created":1573876303,"timestamp_updated":1573876303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ydCVue4CdZG22gE="}
