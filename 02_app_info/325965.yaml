    about_the_game: "One of the first mass produced diesel-electric locomotive classes\
      \ for British Railways, the Class 40, comes to Train Simulator, from developer\
      \ RailRight.<br><br>A total of 200 \u2018Whistlers\u2019 (so called because\
      \ of their distinctive turbo whistle sound) were built by English Electric over\
      \ a four year period from 1958, and were \u2013 for a time \u2013 considered\
      \ to be the pride of British Rail\u2019s early diesel fleet. The first of the\
      \ Type 4 diesels was delivered on 14 March 1958 and pulled its first revenue-generating\
      \ service between London Liverpool Street and Norwich a month later.<br><br>Despite\
      \ the mixed success of the initial 10 Class 40 prototypes, BR ordered a further\
      \ 190 locomotives all painted in diesel green livery. Such were the changes\
      \ in railway working practices during the build period of the \u2018Whistlers\u2019\
      , batches were delivered with significant design differences, including disc\
      \ headcode markers, split headcode boxes and gangway doors.<br><br>A number\
      \ of the Class were named after cruise ships as they hauled express trains to\
      \ Liverpool, however as they locomotives were withdrawn from these services,\
      \ so their names were removed. The \u2018Whistlers\u2019 could be seen over\
      \ most of the BR network hauling flagship express passenger trains, however\
      \ as they were replaced with more powerful locomotives, so their duties were\
      \ moved to secondary passenger services and freight.<br><br>Withdrawals of the\
      \ Class began in 1976 due to their lack of power and not being fitted with air\
      \ braking, leaving them unsuitable to haul modern freight and passenger stock;\
      \ however, it was another nine years before the whole Class was withdrawn.<br><br>The\
      \ popularity of \u2018Whistlers\u2019 among rail fans has seen seven of the\
      \ Class in preservation today, with 40145 (currently numbered 345 in its pre-TOPS\
      \ guise) the first to enter preservation in 1984. Today, it has been restored\
      \ to mainline standards and is unique in being the only Class 40 to be mainline\
      \ certified.<br><br>Loco number 40145 is one of the three in Class currently\
      \ owned and operated by the Class 40 Preservation Society (CFPS), and this model\
      \ for Train Simulator is officially licensed by the Society. Available in both\
      \ BR Blue and BR Large Logo liveries, the model includes standard (HUD compatible)\
      \ and advanced versions and a wealth of details and enhanced functionality,\
      \ including authentic acceleration and deceleration physics, air system simulation,\
      \ electric system simulation, locomotive preparation and cold start simulation,\
      \ functional radiator shutters, battery isolation, fully controllable lighting,\
      \ independent controls in both cabs, change end switches, AWS isolators, simulated\
      \ faults, selectable braking modes for air/vacuum and freight/passenger, changeable\
      \ head code blinds and much more to provide the most authentic experience. <br><br>The\
      \ locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive\

    review: I don't really get why this has such mixed reviews. Yes, it only contains
      one loco in two liveries, but it has the same level of simulation as the version
      available from AP's website, and furthermore is Workshop compatible. As well
      as that, there are plenty of free liveries available online as reskins, such
      as VP's superb BR Green reskin.
