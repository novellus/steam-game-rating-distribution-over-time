I’m a 4X dev myself, and I was interested in trying GD out because there are some interesting features (turn based toggle) and it obviously takes more inspiration from MoO 1 than 2, which is right up my alley.\n\nBut now I see that the developer released a big update last month. And that’s why I’m writing this review. Since people instinctively equate low review count + released over a year ago with abandonment, I’d like to fight that perception by adding to the review count. \n\nIf I remember right, GD didn't have an Early Access phase, or if it did it was a short one. It’s a shame, because GD feels like an Early Access title through and through, and if it were, I think it would also help temper the above perception. At least for myself, if I see an EA title that’s 1+ years old with a low review count, I at least check to see if it’s still being worked on but I don't do that for released games.\n\nTo be fair, some of these rough edges may have been brought on by the most recent patch. Specifically, the UI/UX is what feels the rawest to me, and that’s what the last patch was supposed to address. But there are some obvious bugs:\n\n-Adjusting research allocation between fields is a struggle. You can increment a slider for a field and end up with less scientists working in that field somehow.\n-Certain tooltips render underneath other UI objects.\n-Some toggles will reset at random times.\n-Zoom to cursor doesn’t actually zoom to the cursor, but often over or undershoots it.\n-And more…\n\nEven without the bugs, I think UI/UX is the weakest part of the game. Selection and movement are a chore. Information retrieval ranges from OK-ish to quite bad, and trying to exactly understand the makeup of a large fleet is next to impossible.\n\nI haven’t played long enough to say one thing or the other about the AI.\n\nTurn based mode is interesting, but ideally should give readouts in the number of turns something takes instead of just supplying a percentage. If you you have no inclination towards realtime 4X, I'd be a bit wary.\n\nDespite all of these criticisms, at its core there’s a good, streamlined war game here. Actually, really good. I think if the mechanics were clunkier the UI/UX issues wouldn’t seem so dire. It’s only because the mechanics are this tight that the poor UI stands out so aggressively. In effect, the UI bottlenecks the game. It stops the player from being able to enter flow state, because he’s always struggling against it. Instinctively, I can feel that I should be able to enter flow state with proper UI/UX, and in such a state this game would be incredible.\n\nSo is it worth the ~$5 asking price? Yes, absolutely. And if the developer can ever pair this design with a great UI/UX it will be worth a whole lot more than that. But I fear, commercially speaking, GD is already in a hole it can't climb out of no matter how much better it gets.\n\nIf I were in the developer’s shoes I would be thinking about releasing a new game (with an EA phase this time!) that is a polished and slightly expanded version of what's already here, and then either gifting that or discounting it to current owners.","timestamp_created":1593211199,"timestamp_updated":1593232208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.666386127471923828","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiMaC+vICctnCkAI="}
