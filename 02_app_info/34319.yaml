    about_the_game: "The Vortex, the nearly invincible, secret, yet supremely dangerous\
      \ enemy, now seems so far away. <br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  It\u2019s only been a\
      \ short time since this monster tore Ecco\u2019s family from Home Bay. Then\
      \ Ecco braved the unknown waters to find and defeat this menace that fed on\
      \ the creatures of the sea.<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  The Vortex Queen, though weakened,\
      \ was not destroyed. She followed Ecco from her hive in deep space back to this\
      \ new, nourishing planet. Now, plunging into the warm waters of Earth, she seeks\
      \ out a deep chasm and sinks into the abyss, where she feeds upon the Earth\
      \ as she spawns streams of Vortex young.<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  Her feeding builds\
      \ in strength, creating a downward current against which small fish struggle\
      \ in vain. She is creating a new Vortex race, and her presence on Earth bodes\
      \ doom for all its creatures!<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ecco must rid the world of\
      \ this engulfing evil. Even as he tumbles in the waves, the future is unfolding.\
      \ But must it be a dark future ruled by the Vortex and \u2013 lifeless, miserable\
      \ and cold? Does Earth stand a chance<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ecco must stop the\
      \ Vortex! He is \u201Cthe stone that splits the stream of time.\u201D He now\
      \ faces his most dangerous quest yet. For it is not just his dolphin pod at\
      \ stake, but the Earth and all living beings!"
