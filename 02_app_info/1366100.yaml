    review: "[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/32482033/]Crim's Humble Opinion\
      \ Curator[/url]\n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\nAzalea is a really neat little indie game.\
      \ You take the role of a small child who needs to venture into a dangerous forest\
      \ for medicine for their dying parents. There are some puzzles you will have\
      \ to overcome Sokoban style, but they aren't anything too complicated. There\
      \ are several enemies on your journey including bosses. For smaller enemies\
      \ you don't really have any defenses aside from running or leading them to a\
      \ light. You get two abilities to get you through puzzles and there are some\
      \ chase scenes. The checkpoints are very forgiving and there are five different\
      \ difficulties you can set the game to. The colors are vibrant and dark appropriately\
      \ where they need to be. There are several different biomes to experience in\
      \ your journey and the music is fitting. The sound design never gets annoying\
      \ either. You can play with a controller or mouse and keyboard. The game is\
      \ a short and simple experience. \n\n[h1]The Minor Gripes[/h1]\nThis game is\
      \ a pretty well-rounded project. I don't have too many gripes about it. The\
      \ movement can look a bit awkward at times, but I think that's just the engine.\
      \ If you aren't into chase scenes you may not like having to solve puzzles during\
      \ a chase scene. With the forgiving checkpoints, this isn't too bad though.\
      \ There are some areas that look like you can explore them but you can't. The\
      \ only other snag I ran into is some of the limited explanation of the powers.\
      \ An indicator above where you use it the first time you use it could be beneficial.\n\
      \n[code]\n[h1](\u3063\u25D4\u25E1\u25D4)\u3063 \u2665 pros \u2665[/h1]\n+Short\
      \ & Simple\n+Enjoyable Music Design\n+Variable difficulties\n\n[h1](\u3063>\u25AC\
      <)\u3063 x cons x[/h1]\n*Nothing major to note\n[/code]\n\nFor the very low\
      \ price, this is an excellent little game. I would recommend it as a short little\
      \ one session game. It took me around 40 minutes. If you like adventure games\
      \ with simple puzzles then check it out.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcY6dCvXcTw\n\
