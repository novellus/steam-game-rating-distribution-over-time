      /><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>For fans of narrative adventure games or old-fashioned
      mystery novels</strong></h2>Sarawak will appeal to players who enjoyed the likes
      of 80 Days, A Case of Distrust, LucasArts adventure games or Agatha Christie
      novels. Sarawak is best described as a narrative adventure, and gameplay is
      split between interactive text choices and point-and-click puzzles.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Choose
      your words wisely </strong></h2>Through dialogue choices, you interact with
      a cast of characters who help or hinder your progress. The more you unravel,
      the more conflicted you become as you start to question who's lying and who's
      telling the truth.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Solve image-based puzzles </strong></h2>Discover
      Sarawak's beautiful and interactive illustrations as you open locks and doors,
      discover secret rooms, hack into police equipment, pore through newspaper archives,
      and light up a jungle research station.
