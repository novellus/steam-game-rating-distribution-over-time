    about_the_game: '<strong>Project Scrapper</strong> is a casual first-person objective
      shooter with one caveat: players have no guns. Instead, players are equipped
      with an anti-gravity jump that lets them jump onto and run along surfaces and
      gravitational rivets that draw objects together. The wide applicability of these
      rivets allow players to employ whatever strategies they come up with. Launch
      environmental objects at opponents to knock them down or launch your opponents
      themselves. Use the rivets to keep objective items from other players. In some
      game modes, players can even rip the panels composing the map. Make gravity
      your play thing.<h2 class="bb_tag">Fight against other players in several game
      modes</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Scrapmatch - Deathmatch with a Project Scrapper
      twist where players destroy the map to knock each other out<br></li><li>Treasure
      Trove - Gather as many cubes as possible in your trove or steal cubes from other
      players. The more cubes, the faster your score goes up<br></li><li>Classic Capture
      the Flag - Capture the flag, as you know it, but nothing is typical in Project
      Scrapper. Even the &quot;Mizkin Test Retrieval Objects&quot; are affected by
      rivets, allowing for weaponization or remote transport.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Play
      in maps with game mechanics specific to each</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Cube
      - A standard map (or as standard as it is in Project Scrapper) where the cube
      in the center affects the gravitational pull of everything surrounding it<br></li><li>Solar
      - Jump from planet to moving planet, dodging block storms and avoiding the incineration
      at the hands of the sun (Darwin bots are durable, but not <i>that</i> durable)<br></li><li>Dance
      Club - Packed full of colors and environmental objects with a non-open layout.
      Warp the map and create new entry points or just jump your way throughout the
      map<br></li><li>Game Board - Play on an oversized, tiled game board. Each tile
      has unique functions. Start a wildfire in the grasslands or use pirahna tiles
      to launch flying death with your rivets</li></ul>'
