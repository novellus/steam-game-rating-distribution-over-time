    review: 'I could not get into this game. Graphically it is very dated and low
      quality, this could be overlooked if it was polished in other areas, but sadly
      at this time no. It feels like a bunch of random assets thrown into a low detailed,
      mostly empty and uninspired world.  There are vehicles to be found, but again
      they are not themed in any particular way, I found a steampunk type car, then
      a scooter, I think there are more but I was busy trying to find some love for
      the game. Alas as with the games cohesion, logic and population of the world,
      it was missing.


      The dev needs to seriously work out where assets should go, have biomes or regions
      with animals and creatures populating those areas based on themes, right now
      they are just scattered around and making no sense at all. Due to how uninspired
      the world is, I did not explore base building. There was no where to be found
      an area where I thought "oh I would like to build here", instead I was searching
      for anything of interest to explore.


      I ended up refunding for now, I`ll watch this to see if it improves at all.'
