You spend most of the time in nature doing quests given by the mother Earth herself. These are: planting new trees, feeding animals, checking if everything is ok with the ever-growing forest. Beyond that, you are also responsible for reporting crimes, chasing bandits, and taking care of other things that may interrupt a peaceful life in a beautifully green environment.<br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1418380\/extras\/forester_poachers.gif?t=1605750518\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How does it feel?<\/h2>Can you imagine being in the woods right now? Birds singing, a forest cover smells so unique when the sun is rising. The moss all around you is sparkling thanks to small water drops still being there… this is what the game captures. Being a forester is what we all desire from time to time and somehow we almost feel like we miss it. This longing will be hopefully fulfilled by playing the Forester game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make yourself cosy<\/h2>Arrange your own peaceful wooden house! Wandering through the forest endlessly is great but there is no place like home. You can decorate it as you want using all kinds of rare stuff found in the woods. Of course, not everything you need is delivered by nature so you can always use a shop to make the interior feels like home. Build new fence, decorate your house, and make the forester’s life even better!<br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1418380\/extras\/forester_fence.gif?t=1605750518\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Quests and Free Mode<\/h2>The game offers a singleplayer campaign full of quests. The completion of all tasks requires time, love to the forest, and some bravery. Prepare for moments of chill but be also ready for some action!<br>For those that would like to just set their own pace there is also the Free Mode. It’s nice to simply take care of the forest and deal with random encounters from time to time.
