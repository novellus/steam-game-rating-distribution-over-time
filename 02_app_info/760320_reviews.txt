The western vibe and the pixelart are pretty cool, and the music fits him like a glove. It's not as hectic as the games I cited above, but it's fun and entertaining for a couple of hours.\nAsteriskel rating:\n* * * * * * *","timestamp_created":1603693370,"timestamp_updated":1603693370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqdvksfUCdJCZqgI="}
