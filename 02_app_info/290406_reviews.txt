What you actually get here are stat boost items. In your inventory you will find: 2x HP, 2x MP, 2x Strength, 2x Defense, 2x Magic, 2x Magic Defense, 1x Critical, 1x Dodge and 1x Speed boosts. Absolutely not needed on Casual difficulty. On Expert they help but are not required as they amount to just two or three level-ups (and you level up very often in this game). Maybe worth something on sale but I personally don't recommend it...\n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] To activate the Stardust Pack install it on Steam and then launch the game while having uPlay on. It should ask you if you want to add it to your uPlay account and then confirm once you are in the game. You also have to start a new save in order for these rewards to appear.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this DLC review you can find more in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1586260120,"timestamp_updated":1586260120,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnJKeqvECcprx/gE="}
