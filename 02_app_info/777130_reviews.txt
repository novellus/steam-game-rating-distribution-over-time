It's one of those games you leave running in the background and pick up every now and then, but it's not very interactive. It requires a lot of waiting to make progress, and if you're an impatient player, you'll have to buy your way to get farther.\nIf you're picking this up for unholy needs, keep in mind that these cutscenes are very short and not like your typical visual novel. Most cutscenes will be 3 pictures. Despite there being an option to change your character from male to female, this won't change anything in the game; Scenes are written to be gender neutral. It's a bummer.\nDespite these problems, it's pretty addictive. Characters are likable, some stories are funny. My favorite part so far has been the texting since this allows for roleplay. But if you're impatient, stay away from this game. It'll blue-ball you.","timestamp_created":1608847518,"timestamp_updated":1608847518,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.590909063816070557","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk52yy/YCfe/xvAI="}
