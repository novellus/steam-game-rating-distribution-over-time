This seems to have the absolute minimum amount of playability to be on Steam Early Access. Nearly no key does anything, and everything is put together by 4 toddlers. It takes literal seconds for the game to process that all of 5 words have appeared on screen, and until it is done processing such a heavy load, the player is asked to sit and look at all the visuals on screen. All that eye candy bouncing about, giving us players a visual experience like no other. \n\n      This company has experience in making an inferior product with their last Steam game. This game has similar issues, as the menu/game stop working for a second or two when clicking something. I don't mean for a moment or two, I mean a literal 2 seconds of sitting there with twiddling my thumbs because a game with worse graphics than 8-bit NES. Don't waste your money on this EA title, it is NOWHERE near being in a position to be test in the Early Access program, let alone anywhere near being even a little bit fun.\n\nTL:DR    Do not buy this, this game is WORSE than most vapor-ware titles. The game barely loads, and when it does, it is NOT an action RPG as the store says, as everything is so clunky the last word anyone should associate with this title is \"action.\" In reality, this is just crap with no reason to be in Early Access, and I would question whether Steam's vetting process for weeding out  scams and vapor-ware is actually working or not.","timestamp_created":1531296698,"timestamp_updated":1531308343,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525108933448791504","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ47d/FxOQCcdzkpQE="}
