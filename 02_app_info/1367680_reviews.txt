The mechanics are good. Charges move consistently, so often a solution is to create a lucky path rather than using control elements. The challenges are quite varied tasking you in different ways. At times it is frustrating and at times rewarding. The graphics are rather crude and simple, music is meh and the interface is acceptable. No bugs or crashes. Runs fine on Linux. My main problem with these types of games, is I find them too short, but this isn’t an issue here. The developers put in a lot of content. The sub-circuits are well made and fit naturally in the game. Overall, it’s a challenging game that should keep you entertained for quite some time for a pittance.\n\nAdditional:  Completed after 50 hours. The level design is outstanding. Willing to pay for more.","timestamp_created":1606557078,"timestamp_updated":1607777636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596224427223205566","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6vnAq/YCfKmotAI="}
