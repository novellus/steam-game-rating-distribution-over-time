This is my honest review if you don't like it well tough. Also no game is safe from a review whether its early access or full release, now onto the review.\n\nZombie Busters VR is an anime stand still shooter game. You only have to turn to look in different directions to eliminate zombies for a score playing until the game is beat or you die in the end totaling your score. This game has no relation to the other Zombie Buster VR game even though they are almost similar just one is anime style. \n\nThe game-play is what you expect from a stand in one place type of game. You have no moving option which isn't a bad thing as long the game is good for the style.\n\nSounds in the game is okay nothing out of the ordinary except that there is no audio option to turn the game down, you have to turn it down on the computer so you don't blow your ear drums out.\n\nThere is only one weapon in the game & all the characters use the same weapon. The only thing to make them powerful are shoot-able power ups to give you a few shots to eliminate zombies faster & easier but no way to store the pick ups for later. the only issue I have with the weapons is they are not proper height so shooting is awkward.\n\nThe characters are okay without English audio or subtitle its hard to understand what each character is saying.\n\nThe bosses are unique & have their own powers making them different but in the end there is nothing to really do to specifically beat them. Just shoot until they die avoiding or prevent their ability from damaging you. The only boss I have trouble with is the giant boss. Not sure how to defeat him before dying. \n\nThere is no co-op which is disappointing since that is on feature that got me to buy the game in the first place.\n\nZombie Busters VR is a good game & with more updates, fixes & more features it can be a fun game but with the audio, no co-op & weapon issues I listed its not really worth playing to be honest. The game gets a 4/10 score making it under average & making it not recommendable.","timestamp_created":1582939014,"timestamp_updated":1582939014,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt5Chx/ACdeuV9QE="}
