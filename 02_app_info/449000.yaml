    about_the_game: "Steno Arcade is a suite of four arcade games designed to teach\
      \ and drill steno and keyboarding fundamentals in an immersive, addictive, responsive,\
      \ and interactive way. Steno Arcade is 100% free and open source and works with\
      \ any steno machine or keyboard.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Early Access build of\
      \ Steno Arcade includes one of the four games in the suite, Steno Hero! Imagine\
      \ your favorite rhythm games, but instead of pressing buttons that vaguely emulate\
      \ the original instruments, you're hitting steno chords or keyboard keys to\
      \ precisely and accurately produce the lyrics to your favorite music! It's like\
      \ singing karaoke with your fingers! Steno Hero currently includes seven songs,\
      \ with more to be added over time:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CSunday Smiled\u201D\

      While Steno Arcade is designed to be played with a steno machine, it can also\
      \ be looked at as a traditional typing game that can be played with any standard\
      \ keyboard. You only need an NKRO (N-key rollover) keyboard if you intend to\
      \ learn stenography and want to play the game using steno. For example, the\
      \ slower, easier songs in Steno Hero are perfectly playable using a standard\
      \ keyboard, but when you get to the faster, harder songs you may find yourself\
      \ having trouble keeping up with a standard keyboard and will need to use steno\
      \ if you want to complete the songs with a high level of accuracy and precision.<br\
