His workplace is secretly a front for the Mob and Larry finds himself on a talent scouting assignment and tries to get lucky on the side.  \nMeanwhile, his estranged and forgotten lover Passionate Patti is recruited by the government to infiltrate the Mafioso crime ring and bring them down any way she can.\nWill our star-crossed lovers reunite?  Will Larry regain his memory and his true love??\n\n--\n\nA ScummVm port like the rest, the game's golden and easily accessible. Text-Only VGA graphics for this title carry on the animated tradition/style set up in the 'Land of the Lounge Lizards' VGA version, and are still cheeky and fun.","timestamp_created":1530425799,"timestamp_updated":1589120894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612406313419342041","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww5C///ECfLvppAE="}
