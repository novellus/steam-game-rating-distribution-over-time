      into all sorts of things.<br>Part horror, part comedy, and kinda sorta heartbreaking,
      Speed Dating for Ghosts is a game like no other about finding companionship

      backgrounds, genders, and time periods. Learn how they died, as well as how
      they lived, then help them find peace... if they like you enough to open up

      In a way Speed Dating for Ghosts is good metaphor for romance in video games.\
      \ Much like the ghosts, video game characters can\u2019t fulfill any of your\
      \ physical or safety needs. Instead, the appeal of romance in games leans on\
      \ the emotional or psychological end of the spectrum. As it turns out, those\
      \ are things you\u2019ll need even after you die.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/8/17536194/speed-dating-for-ghosts-romance-steam-itch-io-short-play\"\

    review: "This is one of the cutest games I've ever played. It's fairly relaxing\
      \ to sit through but also made me cry a couple of times! Some of the stories\
      \ are so sad, and others are so cute! I'm having a hard time picking a favorite\
      \ character, and getting the \"All Dressed Up and Nowhere to Ghost\" achievement\
      \ was so hard for me because I hated upsetting the ghosts (I WANT TO HUG THEM\
      \ ALL) \n\nI also liked the expansion to hell! The characters added a lot and\
      \ I liked the last scenes. \n\nPROS:\n- Good storytelling\n- Relaxing\n- Original\
      \ and cute art style\n- Nice music\n- Loveable characters for everyone!\n\n\
      CONS:\n- Maybe a little bit... too simple?\n- Doesn't take long to finish (but\
      \ for me that's a plus)\n\nOverall I just recommend you try it for yourself\
      \ unless you don't like dating sims, but even then there's much more to it than\
      \ just a dating sim! You might still enjoy it."
