Like others, I couldnt even jump over the first wall.   The people running the game did answer back and told me they were sorry and were working on it.  I have since played it again and it has gotten so much better and I actually enjoyed it pretty much although I am still having some trouble with it with the jumping.  It is much easier to move around and I do like the way they have it set up.  I do like the challanges that they have created and I am only on the first set.  I do see alot of possibilites coming out of this game and I look forward to getting the jumping right so that I can move on farther into the game.","timestamp_created":1531873540,"timestamp_updated":1531873540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580838322639465332","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw+uax1eQCeemmpgE="}
