    about_the_game: "One of the features of railway operation until the mid-1990s\
      \ was the requirement for trains carrying \u2018Dangerous Goods\u2019 to be\
      \ formed with barrier wagons to help protect the crew in the event of a collision\
      \ by increasing distance from the cargo (for safety reasons or at least due\
      \ to Union pressure) and providing a \u2018crumple zone\u2019 in the event of\
      \ low to medium speed rear end collision. In the case of the relatively short\
      \ nuclear flask trains the additional vehicles provided extra brake force allowing\
      \ the train to avoid having to run at restricted speed. Trains conveying \u2018\
      Dangerous Goods\u2019 were also required to have a Guard in attendance to lay\
      \ detonators to protect the train in the event of derailment or collision and\
      \ a brake van would often be provided to avoid having to pass the load in the\
      \ event of spillage.<br><br>Traditionally any available wagon would be used\
      \ as a barrier wagon, but no doubt with sectorisation in the run up to privatisation\
      \ it was felt this should be a tangible (and accountable) resource. As a consequence\
      \ two wagon design sheets were issued in 1989 for the conversion of HEA hoppers\
      \ to RNA barrier wagons by the removal of the hoppers and the fitting a floor\
      \ at Carlise Currock wagon works creating some thirty cut down barrier wagons.\
      \ This fleet was then further enlarged by nine more conversions which were generally\
      \ re-coded as RNA but retained their bodies, some of these wagons were never\
      \ officially reclassified as RNA even though allocated to Nuclear Barrier traffic.<br><br>The\
      \ RNA Barrier Wagon Pack for Train Simulator includes a full-bodied hopper variant\
      \ in weathered Railfreight red/grey livery, weathered maroon and clean Railfreight\
      \ grey/yellow coal sector liveries. The cut down hopper variant with added floor\
      \ is finished in clean Railfreight yellow/grey coal sector livery.<br><br>Other\
      \ features include:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tAnimated handbrake lever<br></li><li>\t\
      Intelligent flashing early style battery tail lamp<br></li><li>\tRandomised\
      \ decals with overrides on maroon and Railfreight flame red and grey versions</li></ul><br>This\
      \ pack also includes the CAR Brake Van [RF Sector] Pack as a free download,\
      \ enabling scenario writers to place an appropriate brake van at the end of\
      \ each train. The CAR Brake Van (from dia. 1/507) is finished in clean Railfreight\
      \ Sector livery and includes dynamically smoking and non-smoking stove pipe\
      \ versions, selectable trainload freight sector decals and intelligent flashing\
      \ early style battery tail lamp. <br><br>Both packs include a user manual with\
      \ further details about the rolling stock and the customising of some of the\
      \ features when using the wagons in scenarios."
