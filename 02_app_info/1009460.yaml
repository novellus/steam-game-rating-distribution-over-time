    review: 'I''d like to start with the negatives. [b]The writing is weird[/b], but
      I''m not even sure that''s the right word to use here. For example, the MC,
      Kaito sometimes contradicts himself rather quickly after a statement, there
      are instances when the dialogue feels uninspired and boring. During Koharu''s
      route, the last showdown feels extremely weak, it''s almost like the writers
      didn''t exactly knew how they wanted to resolve the situation. It''s also [b]light
      on action[/b], not what you''d expect from a story with a spy as its main character,
      so that might be a big letdown to some. Not to say there aren''t any actions
      scenes at all, and they''re not bad, but you get my point. It also [b]pulls
      its punches quite a bit[/b]. Most of the more serious issues are resolved conveniently
      and quickly, so there isn''t much tension, which makes it a bit less interesting.
      [b]The characters themselves are rather bland[/b] too. It''s not terrible or
      anything and I wouldn''t say they lack charm, but they''re certainly not very
      memorable either. Likeable, yes, memorable, no. [b]Some of the H-scenes are
      oddly timed and most of them are less than mediocre[/b].


      Now, for the [b]positives[/b]. I never expected this, but actually, the [b]romance
      is quite strong[/b] in pretty much every route. Not mushy or overly dramatic,
      they''re just nice, pure and wholesome, like they should be. The [b]endings
      are very satisfying and rewarding[/b], it made me feel like it was worth playing
      every route. The [b]music is just great. I found myself just listening to the
      music without doing anything quite a few times, so it''s worth mentioning. [b]Alongside
      the art[/b], which is not amongst the best I''ve seen, but it does have a certain
      charm, it kinda reminds me a few of those mid-late 2000''s typical rom-com anime
      art style and the actualy character designs definitely appeal to me. While [b]the
      writing could be a bit better, but the story still does a decent enough job[/b]
      that I always want to know more and the last route does a good enough job at
      answering most questions I was personally curious about. While the major conflicts
      resolutions are usually pretty safe, personally I was fine with them because
      it always made sense (except the very last one) and it still felt satisfying,
      at least to me.


      If I want to sum it up, the concept is very interesting, but it lacks impact
      because of how safe it plays. With that said, it''s still satisfying with suprisingly
      strong romance and I''d say, it''s worth a read if your current VN queue is
      empty.'
