    review: "This is one of the better expansions released in the past few months\
      \ and a worthy inclusion if you've been following this game. In my previous\
      \ review of Frontiers I complained that it didn't bring much to the table in\
      \ terms of new gameplay... well, the 17 cards added here certainly make up for\
      \ that. \n\nIn addition to padding out the 'Double Ally' ability some more,\
      \ we get the new additions of both 'Docking' and 'Ally Scrapping'. The former\
      \ allows a ship to actually be put back into your hand at turn's end IF you\
      \ have an allied base in play; the latter allows you to scrap only as an ally\
      \ ability, but these can be pretty impressive.\n\nMy favorite additions are:\n\
      (9) Colossus - colorless mercs get a massive 9-cost ship does 10 damage, choose\
      \ a color, and draw another card for each ally in play (!!!) Allows for some\
      \ impressive steamroller turns.\n\nSE - (1) Blockade Runner - Discard up to\
      \ 2, draw 1 for each card discarded. Ally-scrap to draw 1 + force 1 discard.\
      \ It's like a low cost Recycling center with clutch scrap ability.\n\nSE - (3)\
      \ Imperial Defender - 1 combat, draw 1 + Imperial Docking. Have had a couple\
      \ games with 2 of these in deck, the docking/drawing can get quite out of hand\
      \ early on.\n\nTF - (3) Trade Raft - 2 trade, 4 authority, Trade Fed docking.\
      \ It is a Cutter that you can keep recycling into your hand. AI steamrolled\
      \ me with having two of them, got himself up to 130 health. Not one of my better\
      \ games...\n\nMC - (7) Assimilator - pictured in the screenshots at top. Literally\
      \ allows you to steal opponent's card, which I think is basically a unique attribute\
      \ at this point. Used it twice to steal away Command Ships from the opponent"
