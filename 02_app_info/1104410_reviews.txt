After researching online, I discovered several people have had the same issue after creating and saving custom ships/races. I believe this content causes a similar issue. I have had GC3 for five years now and haven't had any problem playing until adding this content and trying to use it in-game.","timestamp_created":1599402469,"timestamp_updated":1599402469,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.618724465370178223","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46Jz0sfQCe9qXoAI="}
