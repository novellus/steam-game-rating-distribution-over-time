You get to play six new, albeit very short and uneventful side stories of Saito, Heisuke, Harada, Nagakura, Yamazaki and Iba this time. And if I'm saying short, I mean [i]really[/i] short. Each story approximately contains five minutes worth of reading, which makes about thirty minutes of additional content in total.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2173827732\n\nIs this DLC necessary? No. Will you miss something if you don't purchase it? No. Should you play it if you're a huge fan of Hakuoki? [b]Definitely[/b]. The DLC is kind of overpriced without discount, but don't waste the opportunity if you can grab it bundled with the main game.\n\n[quote][h1]𝐅𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰 𝐨𝐮𝐫 [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33853800/]𝐂𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐏𝐚𝐠𝐞[/url] 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐟𝐞𝐞𝐥 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐣𝐨𝐢𝐧 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥 𝐍𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐥, 𝐉𝐑𝐏𝐆 & 𝐀𝐧𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐩 [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/OtomeSekai]𝐎𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐤𝐚𝐢[/URL][/h1][/quote]","timestamp_created":1537913413,"timestamp_updated":1595376907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":42,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.776347756385803223","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r/b3ufMCdsa2qwE="}
