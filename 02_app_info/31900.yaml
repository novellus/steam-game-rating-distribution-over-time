      short, Nancy Drew: The Creature of Kapu Cave is an excellent game in an excellent
      series of games. Although the Nancy Drew series is ostensibly designed for young

      a chance.&quot; - Adventure Classic Gaming <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/reviews/241/"
