    about_the_game: "Escape to Sidious is a classic space browser game with a modern\
      \ twist. At ETS you start the game with a city. You expand them in real time,\
      \ strengthen your economy, achieve technological edge, trade, forge alliances,\
      \ expand your fleet to plunder other settlers and take-over or fund new cities\
      \ to expand your empire. The gameplay is known to many, so what makes ETS special?\
      \ We have continuously developed ETS and expanded it with many modern elements:<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n\tYou can work off daily missions to get rewards<br />\r\n\
      \tYou can solve quests, that explain you how to play and provide ressources\
      \ at the same time<br />\r\n\tMany little helpers, which make playing easier.\
      \ E.g. a combat simulator or a fleet planner<br />\r\n\tAn existing diplomacy\
      \ system that ensures fairness.<br />\r\nThese are just the biggest highlights,\
      \ but of course there is much more to discover in-game, such as a teleporter\
      \ or, in addition to the trading center, a black market that fully integrates\
      \ player trading into the game. Everything has been integrated into the game\
      \ so carefully that it doesn't look as if it's overloaded. ETS is exactly what\
      \ you are looking for. It offers the full charm of a classic browser game and\
      \ appears intuitive and modern."
