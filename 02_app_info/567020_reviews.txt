I liked the minimalistic style and the various sizes of puzzles, but most of the time when you attempt to slide a piece, it bugs out and requires a restart. Looked like a game I was looking for, but it's nearly unplayable.","timestamp_created":1599586861,"timestamp_updated":1599586861,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/M+zt/QCdM/OoAI="}
