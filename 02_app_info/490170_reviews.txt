Could be better, It's okay, somewhat fun. And maybe worth it's price but overall it doesn't feel that great of a game. I'd still recommend trying to that price or on sale though.\n\n[Quote] If you liked this review Make sure to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33220185-VR-Games-and-Tools/]Click here[/url] and give a follow for more reviews of good, bad and decent VR titles.
