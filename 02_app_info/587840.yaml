    review: 'Previously, I reviewed this game negatively because it was kind of broken.  The
      developer has since updated the game so that the controls are clearer, and the
      bug that caused endless deaths has also been resolved.


      Those issues having been resolved, I still would not advise this game as something
      you pay for.


      However, as a free experience, it does a good job of conveying melancholy and
      is worth the few minutes of your life it would take to play through.  I wish
      the fish and whales at the beginning were a little less finicky, and a little
      less "gamey", but it is worth your time.'
