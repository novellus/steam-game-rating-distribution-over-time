I completed the two campaigns with Chile and Peru, playing Chile as more offensive and Peru as more defensive. I found Peru more challenging and having a though time against some chilean ships, specially casemate ships such as Blanco but with a good strategy it can be successfully completed easily. \n\nIn the good side I would mention: (1) the variety of ships and beautiful ship models, (2) good AI, (3) a variety of options in the strategy map and ship command individually and in formations, (4) interesting history period, not previously covered in other games.\n\nIn the bad side I would say: (1) the lack of custom battles, which would be a great feature to play battles with a variety of ship formations and to get familiar with each ship type as well as an interesting gameplay, (2) the lack of historical battles, which would also be a nice addition to have the opportunity to play the interesting historical scenarios the Battle of Angamos (1879) and Iquique (1879). I would really encourage developers to include custom battles and historical battles in new releases.\n\nOverall I liked the game and there are not other options out there besides Totem Games releases to play naval games with Ironclads, a fascinating naval period because of ship design evolution and technological improvements over 19th century. I recommend this game to anyone interested in this period and War of the Pacific.","timestamp_created":1608124685,"timestamp_updated":1608124685,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rOvstfYCfJzZugI="}
