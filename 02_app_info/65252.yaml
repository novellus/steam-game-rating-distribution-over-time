    review: 'A very well designed loco with excellent sound, a nicely detailed cab
      and solid features. The loco/air braking feels very well done - careful consideration
      needs to be made regarding their use, especially when going downhill. I have
      often found long distance engine braking to be more effective (which should
      be the case!).


      The scenarios included on the WCML-North feel slightly strange. The Class 70
      first hit UK rails at the end of the 2000''s and yet the scenarios feature swallow
      liveried 43''s & 86''s (I guess they just used default locos already included
      on this route, so at least its accessible).


      I''ve seen others complaining about the "General Electrical Goods" scenario,
      notably that the braking physics incur penalties. Such penalties are entirely
      fair enough and down to driver error - you need to use long distance engine,
      & not air-braking when going downhill, and you can still stop in time for red
      signals. There is however an error with this scenario whereby I incurred a 40
      point deduction for going along a bend too quickly (81 rather than the Loco''s
      MSP of 75 - fair enough), but I somehow ended up with only 835 points rather
      than 960.'
