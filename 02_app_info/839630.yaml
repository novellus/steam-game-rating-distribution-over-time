    about_the_game: "Here are the mechanics we have finished with current version.\
      \ The game is still evolving, more elements will be added and all the current\
      \ mechanics can be upgraded, changed or even overhauled according to your suggestions!<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Infinite Open World</h2>  The game world of Survisland is\
      \ procedurally generated. It\u2019s infinite, ever-changing and beautiful. The\
      \ area of an island is usually vast, but you can also find groups of small islands\
      \ scattered across shallows.<br>  We have designed three different biomes in\
      \ current version: The Shallows, Mangrove Forest and The Swamp. Each has its\
      \ own unique landscape, vegetation, resources and sub-biomes. You\u2019ll have\
      \ to alter your strategy to survive in different biomes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >A Living Nature</h2>  Sunrise, sunset, changing of clouds and raining, the\
      \ weather and nature cycling is not only for visual satisfactions. They actually\
      \ affects you, just like real life surviving, the nature is always the most\
      \ formidable foe. <br>The nature has its inner patterns to control the weather;\
      \ you can learn and use it to benefit yourself. You can stand in shadows or\
      \ in water to avoid the heat of a summer\u2019s afternoon, start a campfire\
      \ to keep warm in cold night, detect the direction of the wind from your campfire\
      \ smoke, hide from strong winds behind a rock, avoiding rain under a tree.<br>The\
      \ plants in Survisland also will bear fruits overtime in the right seasons;\
      \ you can directly pick them up or hit a fruiting tree with a rock to shake\
      \ some off. Cutting the whole tree down can get all the fruits immediately,\
      \ but you also will lose a fruit source in long terms.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fully\
      \ Detailed Metabolism System</h2>  We made a very detailed metabolism system\
      \ to simulate real life human beings.<br>Your body is built up with muscles,\
      \ fat, bones, blood and water. All your actions will cost calories, and the\
      \ stuff you eat can only be useful after you digested them!<br>  Surviving is\
      \ not only about keeping hungry and thirsty levels at bay, but to keep nutrition\
      \ in balance, you\u2019ll have to find various foods to achieve this. Once your\
      \ body is unbalanced, there will be a symptom as corresponding to it. Some symptoms\
      \ are harmless, only act as a notification, such like Empty Stomach. Some will\
      \ reduce your body functions: getting Cold will reduce the stamina regenerate\
      \ speed and cost more calories. The worst symptoms will reduce your health:\
      \ Starving, Dehydration, Freeze, Suffocating\u2026 <br>  Wearing clothes can\
      \ always provide warmth and also some protections from environment. Some prevents\
      \ you to get wet when raining; some keep you warm in strong winds. You should\
      \ wear the suitable gears; eat various foods to keep your stats balanced!<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Realistic Items</h2>  We made a very deep and complex item\
      \ system: each item has its own size, weight, species, hardness, toughness,\
      \ quality, portability and functions. These properties determine the size an\
      \  item will occupy when you put it into a storage; is the item too heavy for\
      \ you to carry; how will this item perform in a combat; how can I carry it,\
      \ with one hand or two; where can I equip this item, as a shirt or belt etc.<br>\
      \  Item system is the heart of our simulation of real life, anything you can\
      \ think of can be made into an item and you can see it acts in our game with\
      \ the functions you\u2019d expect in real life!<br>  Now there are more than\
      \ fifteen functions we have made in the system, more will added along the way\
      \ to bring you a more realistic game world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique Crafting\
      \ System</h2>  Survisland has a unique crafting system. Some items have one\
      \ or several Crafting Nodes, it indicates different parts of an item that can\
      \ be crafted. You\u2019ll need to use various Crafting Techniques to process\
      \ these parts.<br>  Which Crafting Techniques you can use is determined by the\
      \ items on your hands, certain techniques require specific tools in hands.<br>\
      \  This Node Based Crafting system will cover all the common crafting in the\
      \ field. But you can also find use workbenches to combine items. Workbenches\
      \ can be found in wild as a wide tree stump or a flat rock.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Build Whatever You Want</h2>  From a simple leaf tent to a huge stone fortress,\
      \ you can build anything you want with our flexible Building System.<br>  You\u2019\
      ll have to craft three types of building marks: Foundation mark, Support mark\
      \ and Surface mark, to start building. Each mark represents a specific building\
      \ part and you can upgrade these marks to actual buildings.<br>  Buildings can\
      \ protect you from the most violent weather but cost a lot of efforts, choose\
      \ a fine place to settle down!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Up Coming Features </h2>Here\
      \ are some planned mechanics we will add into the game in future updates.<br><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li>More biomes and more resources. We currently only have\
      \ about one hundred items and three biomes for you to explore and the technology\
      \ level is still in stone-age. All the fun that metals can give us is coming\
      \ in future updates. And more biomes will be created as planned: Hills, Rainforest,\
      \ Mountains, Grassland, etc.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>AI Animals, currently\
      \ we don\u2019t have animals on the islands, but of course we are going to add\
      \ them into the game, actually it\u2019s the most prior function we are working\
      \ right now. There will be fishes, birds and land animals. They will have their\
      \ own schedule of life and unique reactions to the environment.</li></ul><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Mental Health, this is another important part of our surviving\
      \ simulation. Many lone survivors didn\u2019t die from the lack of resources,\
      \ but mental illness: loneliness, despair, fear. There will be some mental properties\
      \ added as basic stats, like sadness, excitement, stress or loneliness. New\
      \ symptoms will also be added to reflect the states of these properties and\
      \ they can affect the overall mental health, when the mental health is drained\
      \ out, you may lose your mind and gone crazy.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Community:</h2>  Survisland should evolve in the way you players prefer to.\
      \ So we\u2019ll take suggestions and advises from you right here on steam, we\u2019\
      ll open topics focus on certain aspects of the game for you guys to comment."
