    developer_response: "Thanks for your review. As I said on the other game: besides\
      \ it being a $1 game, I am always updating all of them, making it more rich\
      \ (you can see by yourself browsing all of my games). \n\nI follow the MVP development\
      \ philosophy in which you publish the minimum version of the product and then\
      \ get back to it every week to improve it according to the feedback and the\
      \ market, instead of working 2 years on a project that in the end does not make\
      \ more sense (as I did on my first game). The way I found to tell this for the\
      \ customers is by the $1 price (you cant' expect AAA with that value).\n\nI\
      \ will of course address those issues (I would anyway, I have a Trello board\
      \ for all of the games with the next updates). My goal is to update all of them\
      \ until they reach a console game quality so I can publish there (but I do it\
      \ all alone, after working 12 hours on my day job, still not getting any penny\
      \ from the games, so it may take a while). And there's no point in doing it\
      \ as Early Access for $1 games.\n\nAs a game developer I just want to make people\
      \ have fun. This kind of review makes me sad as it does not take nothing of\
      \ that on account. And as if I don't care for the customers (I am not a villain).\
      \ Please understand the context, it is important (even more from you that saw\
      \ my effort on the other game). You don't need to lie to make the developer\
      \ happy, far from that, you have to be honest, but words like \"lazy\" are really\
      \ unfair to my hard work. People will only see your review and nothing else,\
      \ ignoring the context too (then I basically lost 1 month of night work and\
      \ the Steam fee).\n\nPS: You can play using the keyboard just like Cut Smash\
      \ Wrap. They have the same controls (I have used it as the code base). Tutorial\
      \ and settings comes on the next update, just like the other games (probably\
      \ next week). Then, more animations, some kind of in-game store and so on. Updates\
      \ for life."

      [b]edit:[/b] the game got patched a bit, so I edited parts of the review.


      [b]soliterix[/b] is the perfect example of how not to release a video game (along
      with half the games coming out these days). despite much needed feedback for
      his previous tetris-like, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/1213860]cut
      smash wrap[/url], it had no settings whatsoever, buggy controls, you name it.
      most 24-hour projects thrown together for a game jam run miles around such a
      thing, but after a bit more work that should''ve been done before publication,
      it''s starting to resemble an actual product. still not something to recommend
      though.


      this time [b]falling blocks are combined with solitiare rules[/b], with the
      occasional joker dropping by to clear a single tile. points are awarded for
      simply placing anything anywhere, more for creating a full set from ace to king
      of the same suit. solitiare rules are now explained in the game, but [b]putting
      together a full set from ace to king of the same suit won''t work if there''s
      another card next to them[/b]. in my case, nothing happened with ace to king
      and another ace, all the same suit in one line.


      [b]the music''s pretty good, and that''s it for the positives.[/b] graphics
      would be servicable, if not for some [b]really dark backgrounds[/b], and of
      course there''s no brightness slider, nor a way to turn off background images.
      some settings got patched in, so the game can be quit now, there''s info about
      non-rebindable controls and a full screen toggle with a resizable window, but
      still still no separate audio toggles or volume settings, just ''sound on/off''
      that toggles all audio and a single volume setting. no setting to remove the
      completely unnecessary timer either.


      not sure what [b]the developer''s continued aversion to the enter key[/b] is
      all about, in a game played on a personal computer with a keyboard, but it sure
      is annoying that it doesn''t work properly here either, just like in his other
      game. it both opens and closes the pause menu and can''t be used to select anything
      anywhere. ''z'' and ''c'' are the designated keys, but even those don''t do
      anything when it comes to toggling audio or full screen, only arrows work there.
      mouse does too, but who plays tetris with a mouse?


      so the game still has a long way to go, and it''s just not an enjoyable experience
      to begin with. all you can do is go for a full set horizontally, all 13 cards
      of the same suit next to each other, and even that''s limited, as described
      above. some [b]alternate, customizable game modes would be nice[/b], like matching
      3 or 5 of the same suit, color or number. [b]I like tetris and love solitaire,
      but this paricular combination still isn''t up to scratch.[/b]'
