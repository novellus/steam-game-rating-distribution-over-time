Curious, I purchased the game in the hopes to learn more about the setting and the core gameplay of the TTRPG. I've had time to dabble in the three pathways and explore the story. \n\nThe good: \n- Every character is complex and believable. Even the minor characters you only see in passing will eventually have a moment to shine somewhere or another.\n- The writing balances its wit and sobriety well, and delivers both  comedy and horror with equal grace\n\nThe bad:\n- gameplay can be a little monotonous. \n- There's /some/ variation between the three characters in the story, but looking into all three runs I found to be tiresome after trying out one in earnest. \n- The PCs have character, but there's little variation in dialogue options or story beats\n- Save points are more like a bookmark; there's no going back after you make a choice. I've found going back through the entire game to change /one/ choice to dampen my enthusiasm in playing. \n\nIn all, I've found my experience to be fun and exciting with some unfortunate lulls. VTM: Coteries of NY relies heavily on the theatre of the mind. If you don't like \"choose your own adventure\" style games, this isn't a game for you. However, if you enjoy a complex world of both supernatural intrigue and inter-political conspiracy, you'll enjoy the game as much as I have.","timestamp_created":1610066048,"timestamp_updated":1610066048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwMba7/YCd6O1wQI="}
