It's either unfinished or broken.\n\n1. The game description promises satisfying and fluid brawls, but we couldn't really fight with eachother untill after some considrable time, when some weapons spawned and we picked them up... and even then it wasn't what I would call fluid.\n\n2. In fact generally the controls didn't seem to work - except for moving the characters, but no jumping or anything else possible... we were using 2 Xbox 360 controllers.  \n\n3. During our playtime we also wanted to check the controls and for some reason I couln't totally exit the menu after - it wouldn't dissaper untill the end of the round, it was there while we continued playing. The menu also didn't work with my controllers, you have to use the mouse...\n\nTL;DR\nThe game really seemed fun, I really liked the character custumization and the whole concept of the game, but since it isn't really playable... much... \n\nI mean... if this was an Early Access game the develloper was still actively working on and developping it, I would have left a positive review and eagerly waited for the finished product. But since it's not an EA game... I asked for a refund.","timestamp_created":1546534633,"timestamp_updated":1546536223,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511120438575744629","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kcCviugCde+xtwE="}
