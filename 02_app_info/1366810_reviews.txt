Easy to understand right off the bat, but hard to really get good at, Just like all Walter Machado games. Happy to see Machado branching out a little. Hope this kind of short cycle, heavy feedback driven development catches on in the indie scene. Less obnoxious than games jams, but not as untenable as AA development.","timestamp_created":1608771735,"timestamp_updated":1608771735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ43ZGRyfYCcJbRvAI="}
