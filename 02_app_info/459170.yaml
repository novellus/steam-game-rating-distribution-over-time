    review: Listen this is not an all hunt treasure hunt or full of history lesson
      material.  But to get a feel of the tomb and some of the objects it holds within,
      this does do.  The whole game takes about 15 minutes to go through, the experience
      is great and was a lot of fun.  I got it FREE so that I can not complain about..  Will
      Treasure Hunt Again...  8/10
