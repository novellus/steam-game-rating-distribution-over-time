    review: "Well a few months ago I stumbled upon this movie on steam while browsing\
      \ [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/374570/]Kung Fury[/url]. \n\nIt turns\
      \ out that it was filmed in my home country the Philippines. So it peaked my\
      \ interest to check the movie out. \n\nAt the beginning, I eventually realized\
      \ that the movie will have some fantasy element to it. The native language used\
      \ was \u201CTagalog\u201D however it sounded more formal than local but I guess\
      \ I understand for the sake of aiming to wider audiences locally in my country.\
      \ But I can\u2019t help but to crack myself up each time the locals converse\
      \ each other because it sounded like two Englishmen talk in 18th century style\
      \ set up in a modern time which is hilarious and entertaining to me. \n\nActing\
      \ wise, I guess it was well executed from the westerners but the locals looked\
      \ more like a bunch of entertaining clowns in a good way. \n\nPlot wasn\u2019\
      t surprising but how it transforms from Action comedy adventure to semi-horror\
      \ was a bit creepy. However, its still watchable. \n\nOverall, the movie was\
      \ entertaining. Just like I said I believe that there's a lot of imagination\
      \ and vision to the movie despite its limited resources knowing that it is an\
      \ indie movie. However, it was a fun adventure movie overall and mostly hilarious\
      \ and a bit dark on the fantasy side.\u201D\n\nThis is best to watch with friends\
      \ and make sure to have at least one Filipino for confirmations and would laugh\
      \ on things non-locals won\u2019t understand from the native Tagalog speakers."
