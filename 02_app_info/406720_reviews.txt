The game may feel slow compared to Hitman: Absolution, but there I usually lost my patience and got into gun fights. Here, it is very difficult to win, so this game forces me to be an actual spy.\n\nJust to let you know, if I load a checkpoint save, the game closes, but I haven't had an issue with my own saves.","timestamp_created":1609989682,"timestamp_updated":1609989682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtZ637fYCftyWwQI="}
