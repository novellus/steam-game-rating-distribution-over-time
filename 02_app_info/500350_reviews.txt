I wasn't blown away by it at the time and thought it was just another Xortex clone with a bit more strategy. You can upgrade your fleet and you get random starter fighter ships or weapons.  You also get random missions.\n\nI think this is a competent bullet hell shoot em up. However, personally, I am not a big fan of the gameplay loop involved. Granted, I haven't gotten far into the game, even after 2 hours. However, I have seen the same type of missions over and over again without enough variety. It may get more interesting later in the game, but at the start the game is a slog and there's just so much thrown at you. \n\nThe game gets very difficult after only 2-3 missions. You not only have to manage any damage to your fleet, but you need upgrades fast to your fleet to be able to fend off the enemy horde. Meanwhile, you can easily lose your fighter ships if you're not on top of your game (or they can be destroyed as you dock them at the last second before a warp jump). It seems that picking up the mining resource is just random luck. Sometimes you're rolling in them and looking for an upgrade to spend it on. Sometimes you have lots of good upgrade options, but not enough resources to buy anything.\n\nYeah, the more time I spent in the game, the better I was getting. Not only in combat, but also choosing the best strategy learned from my past failures. However, seeing the same mission types just got tedious fast. Others may enjoy starting from the bottom and getting some luck and getting very far and up the leaderboards, however, I found it too repetitive. Keep in mind, I somehow managed to be #2 in the global leaderboards (I imagine there was a reset on July 24, 2020).\n\nThe game ran fine for me at a steady 90 frames per second on my 1060 GTX. However, there weren't many settings options. Just an option to turn off music and an option to have a floor or not. I did not experience any bugs [u]other than the laser pointer disappearing on my right controller on Windows Mixed Reality (which is NOT officially supported). [/u]\n\n[b]Rate 6/10. I could see some people enjoying this more than I did. I probably won't play it again though.
