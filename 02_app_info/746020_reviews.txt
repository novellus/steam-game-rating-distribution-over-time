The idea for the story is good too. Unfortunately, the game obviously was not tested properly and is, in no way, production ready. Within an hour, I encountered several game breaking bugs that required me to reload from save to progress the game. \n\nBeyond the bugs, the writing clearly lacked an editor. It's full of misused homonyms, spelling errors, grammar errors, and generally poor, cliche, writing.\n\nSince it's been nearly a year since the last update of the game, it seems likely to me the developers have abandoned the game, which is a shame. It definitely has potential to be good","timestamp_created":1596392271,"timestamp_updated":1596392271,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yZ2Z2PMCfvOBmQI="}
