      \ that you can find something you can relate to. Every one of us has experienced\
      \ the dullness of work and life crashing upon us, as if something is weighing\
      \ on us, controlling us. We all attempt to break out from this \u201Cbox\u201D\
      , and our common desire is what we hope will make this story a fulfilling experience.<br><br>We\
      \ aim for realism. While we do not expect every detail to be grounded in reality,\
      \ we still want our readers to empathize with the story and characters, reducing\
      \ the need for deus ex machina interpretations. While the story might take unexpected\
      \ turns, there is logic behind every twist which, hopefully, will lead you to\
      \ gain insight into the human condition.<br><br><strong>Lunatic Works</strong>"
