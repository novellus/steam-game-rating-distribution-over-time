    review: 'A campaign set in 2015 and follows an escalation in hostilities between
      Abkhazia and Georgia. There are 12 missions, which are pretty straightforward
      and not too technical, but challenging nevertheless. The campaign has a bit
      of voice-over for situation updates and communication with ground units.


      Played on Stable 2.5.6 in 2020, mission 3 is a bit buggy due to AI ground units
      getting stuck, which is a common issue also with other campaigns.

      If this happens, [spoiler] kill stuck trucks but avoid the truck where the target
      is hiding and which will try to sneak back by the checkpoint. This truck might
      return to the road too far beyond the checkpoint resulting in mission failure,
      in which case you will have to try again. [/spoiler]'
