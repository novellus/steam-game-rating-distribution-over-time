    review: "The time is 1979, the Iranian revolution is ongoing. You play as Reza,\
      \ a young photographer who is taking pictures of the events that unfolds in\
      \ the streets of Tehran where both sides of the revolution use violence, and\
      \ where Reza is forced to take a side in the situation. Do he support the revolution,\
      \ or do he resist it and disagree with the protests? That is very much up to\
      \ you to decide for yourself as the game let you choose what to do, and how\
      \ to act. You can refuse to give photographs and support the protest, or you\
      \ can work with them. \n\nThere is also some brutal interrogation scenes with\
      \ torture involved. These scenes can be very graphic at times. \n\nThe game\
      \ also gives you a lot of context to what's going on. This is by no way a perfect\
      \ game, most likely not the biggest budget either, but i feel that you get a\
      \ good picture of what was going on, and that both sides used violence as a\
      \ weapon. With the Shah using Evin Prison as a tool to torture and oppress the\
      \ opposition it also becomes clear that the opposition (and now the regime)\
      \ intensifies this and uses the same prison and continues torture and oppression\
      \ of opposition. \n\nI feared when starting this game that it would be biast,\
