It contextualizes the auto-runner mechanic by putting you in control of a typical goon in a platformer. You've been granted the ability to jump but that's about all the agency you have in the game. At least at first. \n\nThe auto-runner mechanic was used to great effect to build an excellently crafted puzzle game, rather than a platformer. Sure there is the need for well timed button presses (especially for the secrets), but most of the challenge stem from the puzzle design. Virtually every hour of play, in my 10 hour playtime, brought a new mechanic and with it: a new set of logical wrinkles. It never got so challenging that I felt compelled to consult a guide, but it kept me engaged - in a state of flow.\n\nAccompanying the excellent puzzle design was well-crafted pixel art, a joyous soundtrack (Caravan Shake [https://youtu.be/pgEReWBEy7M] is a banger), and the ability to dress your avatar up with cosmetic unlocks. The gameplay is focused and honed to a fine point and contains more content than I expected for this \"small\" indie title.","timestamp_created":1609778869,"timestamp_updated":1609778890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0ZCT5/YCcr+4wAI="}
