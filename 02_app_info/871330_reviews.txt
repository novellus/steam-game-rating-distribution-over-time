I love the way you can destroy everything, so you can carve out caves through the environment and attack from below by bursting upwards.\n\nLots of gear for different playstyles - and there are thousands of outfit combinations which you find in little chests throughout the game. It's really satisfying smashing enemies into the air, combo-ing them in mid-air, and then smashing them back down to the ground. \n\nin my version you can also unleash special attacks when your combo bar fills up. New players could do with an ingame tutorial to learn some of the extra moves! can't wait until future updates where we can upgrade achaem too!","timestamp_created":1538486533,"timestamp_updated":1538486533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509594917297363281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4uK+8muYCfq7wqwE="}
