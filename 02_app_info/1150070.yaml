        \ occasional bloody visuals and text descriptions of varying detail. The setting\
        \ features many violent aspects one might find in real-world wars, as well\
        \ as situations that may bear resemblance to domestic violence.\r\n\r\nSEXUAL\
        \ CONTENT: Partial and full nudity are present in the game, depending on the\
        \ user's settings. Consensual sexual content between adults appears in each\

    review: 'I''m really enjoying this game so far and can''t wait for the 2 remaining
      routes.  The story is simultaneously sweet and dark, but always enjoyable.  There
      are a handful of word-choice and missing-word errors sprinkled throughout Anji''s
      route, but they are all minor and you can generally figure out what was meant.  I
      personally loved the humor and found the characters more relatable because of
      it.  The characters are interesting, if sometimes frustrating.  However, even
      their frustrating traits make them more interesting as the story progresses.  For
      example: Learning of tsundere Anji''s tragic past goes a long way to explain
      why he is initially such a flaming d***** to the MC.  We also watch MC growing
      through and past her indecisive nature -- a trait that was initially irritating,
      but was crucial in her being able to change her long-held prejudices and help
      others do the same.


      Additionally, the adult scenes are particularly well written and feel geared
      toward a female audience, which is both wonderful and rare (i.e., focusing on
      a slow build up and teasing -- emotionally and physically -- rather than the
      usual "BOOM. Boobs out. Make sex now." of many hentai games).


      Finally, I love the extra artistic effort the developers put in to help keep
      the story feeling realistic.  For example, giving all of the characters at least
      2 outfits and/or hairstyles helped maintain my immersion in the story because,
      unless you wear a uniform or have very little, people don''t usually have only
      1 outfit or wear the same thing every day.  It also helped establish the passage
      of time or circumstance -- different outfits = different day or event.  However,
      this fact often overlooked (or sacrificed) in this genre of game due to the
      extra time and resources it demands -- which is understandable given that many
      of these games are not huge blockbusters.  So the fact that the extra effort
      was made here is a major plus for me.


      There are definitely a few plot holes that need to be filled, but the developers
      seem to be very responsive to suggestions and constructive criticism on anything
      pointed out -- judging by how quickly the Anji sex-scene issues were addressed
      and corrected through Steam forum discussions.  I''m feeling pretty confident
      that the final story will be cohesive and comprehensive enough to be satisfying
      and enjoyable.
