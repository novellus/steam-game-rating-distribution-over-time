After 30 minutes, I had pretty much experienced all that I could find to do in this game. There just wasn't much there. \n\nYou can look at certain screen savers like Starfield, or Flying Toasters, or The Maze. There are currently 13 total screensavers to choose from. Each one of them has settings you can tweak, such as the amount of stars in Starfield or how fast they move or how much they glow, etc. Some of them have Easter Eggs as well, although they were pretty underwhelming for the most part (although the one during Realistic Words where you can speak the words shown was pretty cool). \n\nI found the interactions to be clunky. At the office environment you can only teleport and the teleport trigger button is also used to grab items. There's these manuals that you can read by swiping left or right which are just not pleasant to read in VR. I found an error on The Maze where I spawned outside the maze (on my second playthrough though it was working just fine). \n\nAt the end of the day, although I am a 90s kid and I liked some screensavers (you had to have them back then on CRT monitors), I just didn't find this game all that interesting. It was pretty much the definition of a \"meh\" experience. The fact that the price was increased to $10 when there's only 30 minutes of content just doesn't seem like a good value proposition in my opinion (especially when the quality of the content isn't especially high). \n\n[b]Rate 4.5/10. Close call on whether to recommend or give a neutral recommendation or a negative one. I just think the high price point tipped the scales for me in favor of a no recommendation. I kind of regret my purchase to be honest.
