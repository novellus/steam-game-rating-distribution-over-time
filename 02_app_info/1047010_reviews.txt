I am however an avid fan of cyberpunk, seinen and adult scifi comics so I gave it a go. This game is absolutely unique in its atmosphere. Combination of pastel neons, calm synthwave and romance gives you a fluffy, warm feeling around the heart. It also indirectly got me thinking about some philosophical concepts, the ideas presented were good, that's where the long playtime came from, drifting away to my own thoughts .\nHere's the problem, the art is too static , sometimes with weak design choices (those which are good are taken from Akira, Blame! and Gits but what's original has a different feel to it, different quality). The premise was fantastic it just didn't quite deliver, started strong and fizzled out. Like a relationship. Also the teen style of M.A.R.A. androids is on verge of being inappropriate.\n\nI'm really torn between recommending and not recommending this game. If you have cash to burn then and like anime, ''yes'' is the answer I guess. You could do way worse. If you just like cyberpunk, then stay away.","timestamp_created":1609875619,"timestamp_updated":1609875619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y4+E6vYCfo7mwAI="}
