The alternate history this game presents is hilarious but it's being played so straight and serious. They aren't playing it for laughs or trying to be absurd, this game really thinks the story is going to pull at your heart strings.\n\n An American Woman flying with the Red Tails? P-80s with tail gunners? German Aircraft Carriers with Italian bombers on them? Sure why the heck not? The voice acting is also something to behold\n\nNot so hilarious is the \"time limit\".....for some unknown reason if you take to long with destroying targets or dogfighting the game will have a \"Mission fail in 2:00\" pop up. There's no reason for it 90% of the time. Also annoying is how the game constant flashes tips at you, pausing the dogfight..I disabled this option but it kept happening...often at annoying times. It kept telling me to press the loop control and turn away even though my goal was to attack a ground target.\n\nIron Wings is truly something else, this game is the Rogue Warrior or Ride to Hell of WWII games. You almost have to see it to believe it","timestamp_created":1553230693,"timestamp_updated":1603409268,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0vmoqfUCfLnFvQE="}
