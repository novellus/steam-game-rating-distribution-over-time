      are amazing creatures, with an epic legacy throughout myth, legend, and RPGs,
      but when heroes rise to the heights of mythic power sometimes the dragons in
      your campaign are the ones running for cover. The mythic rules for the Pathfinder
      Roleplaying Game offer an amazing toolkit for building exciting and amazing
      monsters, but the balance of power is still decidedly pro-PC. NO MORE!<br><br><strong>Path
      of Dragons</strong> from Legendary Games brings you nearly 70 new mythic abilities
      specially tailored for the scaly suzerains of monsterdom, including a host of
      abilities suitable for every kind of dragon, from clinging breath to impenetrable
      scales and from winged tempest to strafing breath. In addition to this array
      of abilities both offensive and defensive, Path of Dragons also brings you rules
      for new Dragon Paths: focused clusters of special abilities built around key
      themes of dragonhood, from a miser dragon''s fool''s gold, hoard crawlers, and
      jeweled coat to a tyrant dragon''s mythic minion, imperious glare, and cult
      of the dragon! These Dragon Paths work in concert with existing mythic abilities
      and can be applied to any mythic dragon of any age, color, or species, because
      you just might need an cunning green dragon sibilant, a hulking white dragon
      titan, a brilliant blue dragon arcanius, a stoic silver dragon watcher, or a
      soaring brass dragon skylord. Good or evil, chromatic or metallic or something
      else, every dragon in your campaign will find something to smile about in Path
      of Dragons. Mythic dragons are great, but now it''s time to Make Your Dragons
      Legendary!<br><br>The Mythic Path series from Legendary Games looks to fill
      in the niches that are not quite served by the existing mythic paths, providing
      exciting new options for your mythic heroes and diabolical dirty tricks for
      your mythic villains, made by the same creative minds that helped build the
      mythic rules. Whether for heroes or villains, the abilities in these Mythic
