      \ /><br>Hello. I'm Fummy, creator of The Witch's House MV.<br>I'm happy to announce\
      \ that we're finally ready to release the game.<br><br>The Witch's House MV\
      \ is an RPG Maker MV remake of the original game, which was released back in\
      \ 2012.<br><br>We remade all the graphics, including map tiles and character\
      \ sprites, and worked hard to enhance the atmosphere and 2D beauty in The Witch's\
      \ House. It took us five times as many hours to create this version, but we\
      \ feel like we've finally managed to satisfy ourselves.<br><br>Aside from graphical\
      \ improvements, we also added two new difficulty settings that was not present\
      \ in the free version.<br><br>The first difficulty setting is a more accessible\
      \ one that allows you to instantly retry. The other difficulty setting is a\
      \ more difficult one which is only unlocked by those who manage to reach the\
      \ game's true ending.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>&quot;The normal difficulty\
      \ isn't enough to satisfy me...&quot;<br></li><li>&quot;I'm not averse to instantly\
      \ dying upon reaching new areas.&quot;</li></ul><br>If either of these describe\
      \ you, then we recommend you give this new difficulty a try. You also may be\
      \ able to uncover some new story bits concerning &quot;her&quot;...<br><br>The\
      \ world of The Witch's House has been reborn anew, and we sincerely hope you'll\
      \ all enjoy it.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/885810/extras/04.jpg?t=1604903434\"\
      \ /><br>My name is Dan Stern and I\u2019m the Scholar of the First Deal at DANGEN\
      \ Entertainment (sounds fancy, but it means I work with the devs to get their\
      \ games released so you can play them).<br><br>Japan has a longer tradition\
      \ in 16-bit horror games because of the variety of games that was released on\
      \ the Super Famicom. But that wasn\u2019t something I experienced because of\
      \ growing up in the West. It wasn\u2019t until I discovered The Witch\u2019\
      s House some years ago that I learned 16-bit games can scare me just as well\
      \ as high-res AAA games made in 3D. I learned that even in pixel-art, horror\
      \ is possible; it just depends on the creator\u2019s mastery of atmosphere and\
      \ timing. Fummy-san absolutely has that mastery and as silly as it sounds, I\u2019\
      ve never had so much fun dying a lot in a video game.<br><br>I was ecstatic\
      \ to find out that not only is there a remaster of my favorite indie horror\
      \ classic, but that DANGEN could help to get that game in front of fans that\
      \ I know will love it. Playing The Witch\u2019s House MV feels like a totally\
      \ new experience and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have fun with the new content\
      \ after you finish your first playthrough.<br><br>Cheers!"
