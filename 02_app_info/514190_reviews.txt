It's paced with perfection and offers a narrative on par with what is expected of the series. The production values still hold up almost ten years later, in addition to some of the best acting the series has seen (and that's saying something). Above all else, The Eternal Dive is the quintessential video game movie, truly capturing the essence of the series in flawless transition. Even the puzzles are adapted.","timestamp_created":1595262228,"timestamp_updated":1595262228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4rrCtvMCdcXAlgI="}
