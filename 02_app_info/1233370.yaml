      Silver Lions;<br></li><li>Premium Account for 7 days.</li></ul><br>T-126<br><br>The
      T-126 experimental light tank was built in the summer of 1940 at Leningrad Experimental
      Automobile Factory #185. The project was developed on the basis of combat experience
      in Spain with the goal of creating a tank suitable for the conditions of future
      wars. Only one model of the tank was ever built, and it was never used in combat.
      The T-126 featured sloping armour, torsion bar suspension, diesel engine, three-man
      turret, and a commander''s cupola, all of which were advanced features at the
      time. The tank is equipped with a 45 mm 20-K cannon and a 7.62 mm DT machine
      gun. It is a premium version of the T-50, being its prototype design, it shares
      it similarities, but actually is better due to much thicker armour all around.<br><br>Zhukovsky''s
      I-153-M62<br><br>Zhukovsky''s Chaika is a distinctive vehicle in mainly appearance.
      It performs very well and can take bombs and rockets into battle. With a forward
      armament of 4 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns, it can quite quickly ruin enemy
      planes, and its payload options allow it to deal with a couple lightly armoured
      vehicles while it''s over the battlefield. Besides that, Chaika can be equipped
      with rockets and bombs. It is best used as an air superiority aircraft. Due
      to its fast climb rate, tight turning radius, and speed, it outperforms many
      of its contemporaries.<br>The plane is painted after the camouflage scheme of
      Soviet pilot Sergey Y. Zhukovsky in the 127th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the
      Soviet Air Forces.<br><br><strong>Note!</strong><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Refund
