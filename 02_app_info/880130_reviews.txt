Firstly, I do want to mention that as of now I have not finished the game in it's entirety, so this could be considered first impressions so what I say should be taken with a grain of salt. I will be speaking about my personal gripes so far and not necessarily the extra features since I haven't experienced those yet, However, with that said, I've been very frustrated with the game to not talk about this. This is of course subject to change when I complete the game.\n\nI like the large world and I appreciate the attempt at making the game more difficult, immersive, and expansive, however in my opinion it falls flat in these two aspects. 95% of the time the game is so dark I can't even tell what the world looks like when my character is stuck on something(I know there's torches but those don't last and they cost resources unless you find a fire), movement is slow especially on the world map even with a horse which is perhaps intended but it's not like I would want to explore the game at a slow pace since the graphics aren't exactly pretty to look at.I play on the hard difficulty and battles are incredibly boring since half the attacks don't hit,I learnt all accuracy passive's and it's still a dodging match. Now you could say this is part of the hardcore experience, but in my opinion this isn't really hardcore but more like rng for whether your attacks hit or is evaded over and over. In addition to that, it doesn't help when the enemies are usually parties of 5 meaning you have to wait for each and every mob to attack to do anything. The quests are also infuriating since like any other RPG player you accept every quest you come across and then forget where the quest giver is until you track them. Now to be fair RPGmaker games don't have sophisticated tracking to guide you directly to the NPC but since the world is as large as it is, with most of the NPC's being mindless husks it makes it a pain sometimes to even turn the quest in. Another minor gripe is when an NPC decides to block a one way path until they move out of the way so you can move on. The map only gives the locations of major areas so some quest locations are extremely vague like the one where you have to return some tools to a man in Dstrem but this location doesn't appear on the map. One of the quests \"Lost in Battle\" seems to be glitchy since as of now I still cannot find the sword in a tiny battlefield location.More unforgivable is when  I almost got softlocked since the main questline required you to find a messenger, but how you find him was a clue only outlined when you received it. Meaning if you accepted the quest and didn't read the dialogue initially or forgot about it as I did when I ended my session and came back I was clueless until I found the solution in the discussions.\n\nNow that my rambling is over, I do want to enjoy the game, but it has become so difficult to do, I see that most others actually enjoyed the game so maybe it's just me.\n\nEdit: Dstrem is actually Ostrem, imo the ingame naming of Ostrem looks like Dstrem at least to me, the quest \"Lost in Battle\" is not glitched the Battlefield location is a different place from the Battleground location although in this case one would think a battlefield is basically the same as a battleground.","timestamp_created":1609708212,"timestamp_updated":1609727276,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609718786,"developer_response":"Hey. Thanks for checking out the game and sorry it fell short. some have referred to this as one of the most innovative uses of RPG maker but I guess not everybody feels that way. :-(\n\nSo after thoroughly reading your review there are a couple things I would like to point out. One is that you can tweak the darkness setting to your preferences in the character record item in your inventory. also the hardcore mode is meant to be hardcore so if you are \"griping\" about that, that seems like you should probably pick the normal difficulty as that is the way the game is meant to be played. Hard is freaking hard. Even I don't play on hard haha. movement speed on the world map is significantly faster with a horse unless you are over encumbered so be sure that you take that into account. torches can be gained freely at any campfire and you can carry those around as well if you are having other issues with the darkness.\n\nOstrem literally does appear on the left side of the map. Go into the game and open up your map and you will see it in wraikin province exactly where they say it is. You can also see that location on the map on the store page or in the game folder because I included in all three places. Proof: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2348763987&fileuploadsuccess=1\n\nIf you needed any help you can always simply ask me as I get back to my players usually within a few hours. I was literally working on Christmas Eve because somebody mentioned a bug...\n\nYou can also get more party members to have a group of up to four characters at once and you can choose and manage who they are and how they fight. again you just need to use the character record which is explained in the tutorial. You can upgrade your leadership.\n\nFor quests that give vague locations you can always talk to the NPCs involved and they will give you much more detailed instructions and you can also check your journal because that usually gives much more of a hint.\n\nI never once make anybody accept a single side quest that I can think of in the game so that is false. You always have the option of what to take and what to leave unless it is directly part of the main quest. there are also multiple choices you can do in all of them so you can change the outcomes.\n\nI told you where the sword was on the forums. Here is a screenshot though: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2348766602&fileuploadsuccess=1\n\nThe messenger is somewhere between The starting city and Vulkold. The NPCs give you at least five hints on where to look. It seems almost a little too easy if you read what they say. I'm not going to explain it again here because it sounds like you were frustrated but you can talk to at least three or four NPCs who will all give you more of a detailed clue about where exactly to look. That's part of the investigation. If that isn't enough, The messenger is somewhere along the road near the tree line between the two cities. They tell you exactly what bridge he took and what route he was taking so it can't get much simpler...\n\nI'm sorry you were disappointed in the game. It sounds like you were getting understandably frustrated and I'm sorry to hear that.\n\n If you would like I will gladly refund your money via PayPal."}],"cursor":"AoJwvp7O5fYCe4uZwAI="}
