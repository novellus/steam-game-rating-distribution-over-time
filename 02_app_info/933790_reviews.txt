A bit like a grilled lime.\nBut if you just want feedback on whether or not you should pick it up, skip to the ~tildes~ near the end.\n\nAs ever, let's start with the bad. 2.99, huh... With that, I could probably have gotten some nutritious food from a food truck. The quality of the food would've been either superior or subpar. One or the other, with no room for other possibilities in-between. Unlike that money, disappeared into my gullet, this OST will last until my ears give out on me. So, did I make the right choice?\n\nDamn right I did.\n\nFor one, the non-looping versions are much cleaner, audio-wise. You'll know what I mean if you listen to a lot of music, but if you liked the game's OST (and I loved it), you'll hear the improvements pretty much instantly. More importantly, though, the 'full' versions of various tracks, stitched together from their smaller component parts?\n\nWow, they paint an audial picture that I feel like I'd missed out on.\nI had no [i]idea[/i] how good Noa's theme was, and how it worked on multiple levels\n\nGuess that's what I get for chasing rabbits.\n\nBut a lot of the themes (Solvant, Kowaii, and Himitsu especially) are really enhanced through these mixes. I can't tell you whether the cost'll be worth it to you as an individual; it'll depend on how much you like listening to game music and Broken Minds' OST in particular.\n\n~Closing thoughts~\n\nAs a guy who listens to a lot of music, though, of all genres - yeah, I'd have probably paid 5.99 for it, no regrets. Also, worth mentioning is that the bonus track is [b]really[/b] good, so if your'e on the fence, you might consider that. \n\nIt'll probably come down to you, though, like most music/bonus DLC.\nDo you want to give a bit back to the creator, do you really like the music? If so, purchase.\nAnd if you're in a place where 2.99 is gonna hurt, or didn't find the music as memorable, you can pass.\n\nWould I recommend it? In a flash second.\n\nBandcamping this, but -\n\nFavourite track: It's a secret!.. (28 - Himitsu)\nRunners up are Inside Her Mind and Noa's Theme.","timestamp_created":1542281227,"timestamp_updated":1542281227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r/3Hi+cCduXmrgE="}
