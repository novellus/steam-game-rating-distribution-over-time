Dressed in a stainless steel and red\/orange livery and equipped with both third-rail shoes and pantographs to collect energy across the length of the MTA’s New Haven Line, the first M2s entered service in 1973. An initial order of 144 cars was completed by 1974 and an additional 100 cars were ordered and built during 1975-1977. All axles on the M2s were powered by 162-horsepower GE 1259 DC motors and the cars could seat up to 120 passengers. The cars were built as married pairs, and with a roster of 244 cars, the M2s assumed the workhorse role of operations on the New Haven Line between Grand Central Terminal and New Haven as well as on the New Canaan Branch.<br><br>In 1987-88, MTA and Metro-North (the latter formed in 1983) acquired for the New Haven Line a group of 54 M4 cars. These new EMUs were similar to the M2s, with two key exceptions: By this time, Budd was winding down as a rail car manufacturer and the M4s were constructed under contract by Tokyu Car. More significantly, the M4 EMU sets were configured as “triplets” with a center car that was not equipped with an operating cab.   <br><br>Well into the new millennium, the M2 and M4 cars served as the backbone of New Haven Line operations, until in 2011 MNCR’s new generation of EMUs, the Kawasaki M8s, began arriving. As the M8s arrived, retirements of the older M-series cars began in 2012. The last of the M4 and M6 triplets were retired in the summer of 2015 and it was left to the venerable M2s to close out the tenure of these electrics. A few M2s journeyed on in MNCR service until December 2018 and a pair of M2s are preserved at the Danbury (Connecticut) Railway Museum.<br><br>The M2 and M4 EMUs for Train Simulator feature realistic operating procedures and characteristics, interactive controls, passenger interiors, two authentic liveries, and include M2 married pairs and M4 triplets. And the add-on includes career scenarios over the length of Train Simulator’s NEC: New York – New Haven route’s main line (route available separately).<br><br>The Metro-North M2 and M4: Long-lived, legendary – and now available for Train Simulator!<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios<\/h2><br>Four Career scenarios are included for the NEC: New York – New Haven route<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>[MNCR M2A] New Canaan Branch Shuttle<br><\/li><li>[MNCR M2A] Midday Stamford Local<br><\/li><li>[MNCR M4A] New Haven Semi-Express, Pt. 1<br><\/li><li>[MNCR M4A] New Haven Semi-Express, Pt. 2<\/li><\/ul><br><strong>Please Note: <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/258643\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >NEC: New York – New Haven Route Add-On<\/a> is required, as a separate purchase, in order to play the scenarios featured in this add-on.<\/strong><br><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
