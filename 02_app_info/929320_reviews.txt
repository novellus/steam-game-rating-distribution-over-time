There's no real dialog, just puzzles and pictograms (which might be a clue to another puzzle). Most of the fun is figuring out just what the puzzles are in the first place. Each puzzle brings you a little bit closer to re-starting the systems in this strange, deserted complex and finding a way to get out. The Rhem series was released over the past decade and a half. There is a loose plot that links the four Rhem games together, but you don't have to play them in order. I'd recommend skipping Rhem I and trying any of II-through-IV first (the game play of Rhem I is not nearly as smooth as the others, if you like the series you can always go back). Although Rhem II is as good a place to start as any to see if you really like the series. The general thread is that you are searching for some items in a mysterious, hidden complex (and have to find your way out!) This game doesn't support SteamSynch. The graphics are simple and in a limited color palette (Rhem II dates to 2005). The colors are muted (it is an abandoned, dilapidated complex) and there is limited animation but this doesn't detract from the game.\n\nThis is a game for puzzles. There's very little hand holding here -- you really need to walk around and explore the game world. Taking screenshots, notes and mapping are essential (I use a smart phone). The puzzles [b]do not[/b] have directions spelled out -- most of the fun is figuring out just what the objective of puzzle is , or even if something is a puzzle. I recommend taking screenshots of the puzzles because sometimes you will find a clue and realize that it relates to a puzzle all the way back on the other end of the complex. Other times a puzzle needs a clue that you just haven't reached yet. Even the slightest detail in a scene might be a clue. Look everywhere for clues -- up, down, behind doors... [b]nothing[/b] is off limits.\n\nI spent several weeks stumped on a particular puzzle. There were three parts to it, and even though two were staring me in the face it didn't click for a long time. This is why it's best to resist the urge to go to the walkthrough. This is a game to be savored, for puzzle fans everywhere.\n\nJust when you solve a puzzle and open what you think is the final door... you see a whole new wing of the complex with puzzles waiting to be solved. By the time you are done, you'll know the layout of the complex better than that of your neighborhood. By the time you've solve everything, the achievement will leave you full of relief and excitement like you won the Stanley Cup. This is again why I recommend avoiding the gameboomers.com walkthrough until you have been puzzling as much as you can. Highly recommended and a few dozen hours of enjoyment for a decent price.\n\n[b]I played this on Win 10 and had no issues.[/b]\n\nEdit for the Steam Special Edition (Rhem II SE): There's an additional area that wasn't part of the original Rhem II but has been added for the SE. Towards the end of the game it may not be entirely clear if you are getting clues that you need to solve the game, or ones for the optional SE area. There's a \"Gameplay Hints\" discussion thread that might be useful.","timestamp_created":1545164258,"timestamp_updated":1608912448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.708809256553649902","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoPWpzfYCcunQtQE="}
