    review: 'Simple GameGuru shooter with only 1 map. I had fun for a few minutes,
      i think, i like the blueish filter, it gives an interesting look. But besides
      that, it is just killing zombies until they hit you once, then it is game over.
      No other maps, no music, only 3 weapons. Thats too less to recommend the game.  See
      for yourself, if you want to play it.
