    about_the_game: "This app works by balancing the elements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      There are four basic elements, each with a movement posture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe Water movement is a small step back with the left or right foot and relates\
      \ to the kidneys. Hands can be behind the back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Wind\
      \ movement is a big step back with the left or right foot and relates to the\
      \ lungs. Hands can be out to the sides.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Fire movement\
      \ is a big step forward with the left or right foot and relates to the heart.\
      \ Hands can be pointing up front.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Earth or Ground movement\
      \ is a small step forward with the left or right foot and relates to the stomach.\
      \ Hands can make an open circle in front.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese are the four\
      \ main movements and there are nine in this app. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis app\
      \ can be practiced in three modes:<br />\r\nGame mode, in which you use the\
      \ computer or phone to pose the screen figure;<br />\r\nMeditation mode, in\
      \ which you actually follow the sequence of postures; and<br />\r\nRoutine mode,\
      \ which is a computer-led exercise routine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChange the kind\
      \ of information with the lower left control.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChange the\
      \ movement speed and the audio with the controls on the right.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nHide and show these controls with the upper-right button.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nYou can step your foot or slide it. You can do this standing or sitting.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the end of the introduction. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      This app works by balancing the elements, so, after awhile, each element is\
      \ done as much as any other element."
