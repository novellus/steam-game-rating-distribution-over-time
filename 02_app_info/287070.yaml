    review: I rate this game 4/10. Tried it a few times but get bored with it very
      quickly each time. The idea is good, but the execution feels very amateurish.
      Graphics are cartoonish, sounds are cheap and gameplay is slow and clumsy. Issuing
      commands and moving units frequently result in wrong actions. It is simply not
      a pleasurable experience and I can't help thinking that this game probably belongs
      on mobile devices like ipads.
