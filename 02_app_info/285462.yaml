    review: 'I took my first listen to this pack today (I sample each pack shortly
      after I buy it), and the files in it have issues, caveat emptor.  Here is a
      thread that describes the issue, that the files are encoded incorrectly (see
      Ossra''s first post in the thread) to be compatible with VX Ace without additional
      work on your part.  According to Lunarea in the thread, she was going to put
      in request to get the issue fixed back on 6/25/15.  I can''t recommend this
      pack without the fix since it should be plug and play.
