    review: '[h1]"It could be a really cool game, but without an English version (promises
      since few months already), it''s hard to understand everything the game has
      to offer"[/h1]


      Interesting concept, even if of course it''s hard to understand everything without
      any Chinese knowledge.

      You chose you route (from the bottom) and then climb it (like a ladder).

      There are really normal, tough and super hard enemies (and bosses of course)
      along the road (usually short, again without understanding all what I''m doing).

      But basically you have cards for slash/attack/defend/magic.

      Also items in shop (and with some events on the road) and you could possibly
      upgrade your cards (same like in Slay the spire).

      Your characters get upgrade (when earning new ranks) and get new skills etc.


      Sad the devs promises (since july 2019, they said "in 3 months" for full release)
      an updated english version for the game but still never happens...

      Hope we have some good news one day (even if I really doubt).


      Still, we are waiting for both, english version and full release (we are in
      February 2020).

      Again (as usual) I can''t put a mixed thumb so...it''s a yes (but more leaning
      to a meh - without good understanding on all mechanics aka english).'
