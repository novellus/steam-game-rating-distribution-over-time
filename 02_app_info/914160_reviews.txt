Arena is a simple arena fighter where you are trying to knock everyone out and be the last to survive. As much as I'd like to enjoy this game I can not recommend anyone getting this game even if it's free now. We need workshop so we can make our own maps and we need [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/914160/discussions/0/1741105805761273496/]bots[/url] added so we can at least play, as of now you can only play when you have people and the game lacks that. You can buy loot boxes with the coins you earn in-game and open them for free to get hats, emots, face, color, accessories.\n\nIf you are interested in Steam inventory items this game has coin drops after each match, more for kills and being the winner then you can buy loot chests with them and get items.
