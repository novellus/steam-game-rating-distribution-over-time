    review: "[h1][b][u]Overall - 27/100[/u][/b][/h1]\nThis is one for the litter box.\
      \  I expected a very cheap Mario clone with a cat sprite, and was sorely disappointed.\
      \   \n\n[h1]Playing as a cat - 20/20[/h1]\nThere's no associated story, but\
      \ the player sprite is very clearly a cat.\n\n[h1]Acting like a cat - 2/20[/h1]\n\
      It's called grooming adventure, but you don't actually do any grooming.  Aside\
      \ from the fact that the end-level flag is a tuna can, there's nothing remotely\
      \ cat-like about the gameplay here.\n\n[h1]Adorableness Level - 2/20[/h1]\n\
      What you see in the screenshots is as cute as it gets.  Once the gameplay starts,\
      \ any joy you felt will be replaced with frustration.\n\n[h1]Polish - 1/20[/h1]\n\
      The game runs, which is about as much as I can say about polish.   The menus\
      \ are super basic, and I had to restart several times due to level-breaking\
      \ bugs.  Some of the platform movements are so unexpected and unhelpful that\
      \ I honestly can't tell if it's a game bug or just the developers trying to\
      \ frustrate me.\n\n[h1]FUN? - 2/20[/h1]\nTeamkerberos' idea of \"fun\" is to\
      \ confuse, disorient, and frustrate the player.  The standard platform types\
      \ don't work in consistent ways from level to level, or even within the same\
      \ level.  The same platform type might be solid at one point, but then a falling\
      \ or spinning platform the next time you see it.  And you won't know until you\
      \ jump on it.  (My favorite type of platform just gets flung to the edge of\
      \ the screen the moment you touch it, and then it can no longer be used!) The\
      \ only solution is to keep jumping forward at a break-neck pace, only pausing\
      \ for the briefest moment on each platform.  Which brings us to the cactuses...\n\
      \nAbsolutely anything can have a spikey cactus in it, and you won't know until\
      \ you jump on it or stand too close.  The platform-confusion pushes you into\
      \ these cactuses, and then you die.  The goal seems to be to die enough times\
      \ that you memorize the level and are then able to beat it.  At that point,\
      \ the idea of \"fun\" is long gone.  With no acheivements, and no idea of progression\
      \ through the levels, there is absolultely nothing to keep you going."
