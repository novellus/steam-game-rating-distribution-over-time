    review: 'The concept of this game is cool:  It provides no instructions, and just
      some hints, about where you''re supposed to go and what you''re supposed to
      do next.  The graphics style is unique, in a pleasing way to me, and who doesn''t
      want to play as a wolf?  However, the gameplay is less than desirable to me.  I
      haven''t played it for very long so it''s possible it could grow on me.  What
      bothers me the most is there''s no way you can distinguish areas where you can''t
      go, and areas where you can.  A tall dune that looks like it''s a blockade,
      actually lets you run right over it- whereas you''ll be out in open space and
      run into an invisible wall that you can''t walk past.  And as you''re running
      through trees, rather than going transparent after the wolf runs through them
      to allow you to see where he''s going, they completely block your screen so
      you can''t see what''s ahead.  I stopped playing after I came upon a large crate
      that was movable- and I''m guessing is part of solving the first puzzle- because
      pushing it in whatever direction you want to go is incredibly frustrating with
      the way the mechanics of the game cause it to move.  Maybe you don''t actually
      need the crate so it doesn''t matter if it''s difficult to move, but at that
      point I kind of just lost interest.  If these issues were fixed- mostly just
      the first one about world boundaries- I would totally be interested in playing
      this game.'
