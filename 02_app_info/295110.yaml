      \ to protect against dangers, both living and undead, that lurk around every\

      \ the undead still linger in considerable numbers. Stay alert and quiet to avoid\
      \ attracting them, and be prepared to either run or fight for your life at a\
      \ moment\u2019s notice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCRAFT - Gathering raw materials is\
      \ a key part of crafting. Axes, pickaxes, and crowbars allow you to harvest\
      \ the various trees, rocks, and vehicles scattered around the world. You should\
      \ collect what you can, when you\u2019re not actively fending off threats.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nTAKE BACK CONTROL - The first step in re-establishing society\

      \ neighbors may find that they\u2019re better off just taking what they need\
