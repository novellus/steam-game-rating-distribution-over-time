    review: "Normally I wouldn't give a thumbs up to a game that has so many issues.\
      \ Maybe it's due to it's age and/or running on Proton?! Would only work in windowed\
      \ mode in Linux, so had to go to Proton. But the game is really neat, with great\
      \ animation and great story! The dialog is something else, they really put a\
      \ lot of thought and imagination into it and the story. \n\nJust make sure you\
      \ save the saveFile-1.tiw (the number is the slot) a lot in a separate folder\
      \ and rename so can pick which one want to restart with. Especially when meet\
      \ Steve/Pete! You don't want to go too far back if making the dough doesn't\
      \ work correctly.  Also save a lot cause if you alt-tab, it might not come back\
      \ and you will have to stop and restart the game. Sometime the videos lock-up.\
      \ Fun game, but do the above and you won't get so frustrated you rage quit."
