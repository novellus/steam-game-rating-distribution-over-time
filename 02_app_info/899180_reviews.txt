And it happens after each mission - you can't choose next mission or access upgrades menu before voice finishes speaking. Very dumb, very annoying.\n- Building turrets in a mission consumes the main resource. And it is never explained to player. You may finish the mission but with almost 0 money left. That is especially demotivating when the mission was hard to beat: you put a lot of effort and the payoff is in reverse proportion. The game forces you to replay easier missions where you can win without extra turrets at all.\n- Guns available to the player. The first two guns, pistols and grenade launcher, are good: requires some skill to shoot, fun to operate. But the other two... The effect and operation is not instantly obvious to the player. When there are 3 and more guns, switching to the needed gun becomes a challenge and I didn't found an option to exclude unneeded guns from my arsenal. Ounce you unlocked it - it will be with you on every mission.\n- Upgrades for the guns may seem ok, but you didn't feel any noticeable difference.\n- Enemies are boring: looks the same and are bullet sponges. Except the very basic one they require multiple direct hits to kill. It generally feels better when there are many low-HP enemies that one with high HP, but the game does not do that.\n- TD games usually prioretizes towers over manually controlled weapons (abilities). Towers do main damage while manual abilities are situational and in general do very little damage. But that is not regular top-down TD, it's a VR game where you shoots in 1st person and it is the main player's activity within the game. And your direct shooting is made less important that building towers. That feels seriously broken especially in higher levels: the game forces you to shoot in 1st person and focus all your attention on it, but it is not the way you win.\n- The difference between towers not obvious: looks like it is always better to use more expensive towers, no combinations of towers of different type (like freezing tower + splash damage tower) are involved.\n- The amount of guns and types of towers is very limited. The levels looks the same with no variations in visual style, the same with enemies. There is not enough content.\n\nConclusion!\nThe issues with amount of content may be hard to fix for a small dev. team, but it is totally unreasonable why other aspects of the game are below the threshold. Overall the game has good formula: TD + shooting gallery + upgrades. That makes it somehow interesting to play in general, but any sole aspect of the game is not up to the standards: TD is bad, shooting gallery is bad, system of upgrades does not has enough options and in turn also bad.\nThe game starts to feel repetitive after ~1 hour of play.","timestamp_created":1606003404,"timestamp_updated":1606280802,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7f3y/vUCcZXjrwI="}
