    review: 'Outright inferior to the 2D version of the game. Only includes two sets
      - the original and War of Shadows - and the interface is not any better than
      playing the 2D version via Bigscreen or Virtual Desktop, except with some layering
      errors (where items behind other items are rendered to occlude them anyway).
      Disables Chaperone for the duration, because it is strictly seated/standing
      only; your own "body" gets horribly confused if you move around.


      Ascension is fine, but this is a terrible rendition of it. Buy the 2D version
      instead.'
