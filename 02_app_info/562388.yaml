      \ service!<br><br>The \xD6BB 4010 provided a long-distance express service between\
      \ Vienna and Zurich in the form of the \u201CTransalpin\u201D. Simmering-Graz-Pauker\
      \ rolled three of the new train sets, classified as the \xD6BB 4010, off the\
      \ production line in 1965. Formed of a power car, cab car and four intermediate\
      \ coaches fitted with first and second class throughout, the new fleet would\

      \ considerably with the multiple units of today. With of-the-era rudimentary\
      \ systems on-board, starting up the \xD6BB 4010 is a fairly easy procedure once\
      \ you know where the relevant controls are; simply raise the pantograph, turn\
      \ on the main switch, select your intended direction of travel, set the lights\
      \ up appropriately and you\u2019re good to go.<br><br>Where the level of complexity\

      \ change it, means a hassle-free journey and a smooth ride for the passengers.<br><br>Despite\
      \ being retired just over 9 years ago, the \xD6BB 4010s history culminated in\
      \ a 3-decade express service history, and time as famed traction throughout\

    review: No cruise control on this baby!  Really fun to drive, very manual procedure
      to hold your speed.  You need to let the circuit click up to the desired amperage,
      then switch to drive to hold, and when you approach your desired driving speed
      you need to reduce the amperage and then hold again.  Dynamic brake going downhill
      is pretty straightforward.  The cab looks really good, nice patina on all the
      controls, passenger view is pretty basic, but who looks a that while you are
      VERY busy driving the thing.  Highly recommended for fans of classic Teutonic
      electric EMUs.
