      \ are a tool of corporate oppression. Feared and despised, you hack into the\

      \ are an Observer.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BECOME A NEURAL DETECTIVE</h2>You play\
      \ as Daniel Lazarski, an elite investigator of the future portrayed by late\

    review: "I could not recommend Observer in my original review as I felt that it\
      \ was just not scary or interesting, especially when compared with Layers of\
      \ Fear, or better yet, measured up to SOMA, from which Observer draws a surprising\
      \ amount of inspiration. I nevertheless enjoyed the dark, mature cyberpunk setting\
      \ and found Janus, Rudy, and the protagonist to be likeable characters. I was\
      \ still interested in checking out Observer: System Redux, but owing to the\
      \ greedy business practices of Bloober Team, I really don\u2019t feel like supporting\
      \ this studio anymore. In fact, this has dissuaded me from pre-ordering or buying\
      \ The Medium.\n\nEssentially, Observer: System Redux is like that AAA game that,\
      \ instead of having a free High Resolution DLC and a few paid DLCs, gets released\
      \ again as a standalone experience for the price of a brand-new game with near-complete\
      \ disregard for its loyal fanbase. Even AAA studios would not resort to such\
      \ egregious practices.\n\nAdmittedly, there was a short time window during which\
      \ a discount for owners of the original game prevailed. I did benefit from that\
      \ discount, but I realize that I am in the minority. Most people were not even\
      \ aware of said time window and discount. As such, I want to leave this review\
      \ to raise awareness about these anti-consumer practices. At the very least,\
      \ the discount should\u2019ve prevailed indefinitely for all owners of the original\
      \ Observer. However, in all fairness, Observer: System Redux should have been\
      \ released for free for anyone who owns the original game.\n\nApparently, the\
      \ studio is working on a solution. I shall update the review accordingly.\n\n\
      But, this is not unreasonable in the slightest. Take CD PROJEKT RED. They\u2019\
      re working on a next-gen version of The Witcher 3 with all DLC content that\
      \ will be released for free for all owners of the game across all platforms.\
      \ Think CD PROJEKT RED is too big for a fair comparison? Fine, they got their\
      \ hands full with the Cyberpunk 2077 situation right now anyway. But still...\
      \ They give it to the people for free.\n\nTake SUPERHOT Team then. They gave\
      \ out SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE for free for all owners of SUPERHOT across\
      \ all platforms. This is a very small studio and their new game was in development\
      \ for at least three years. But still... They give it to the people for free.\n\
      \nThere are countless other gaming studios that are leading by example and doing\
      \ what\u2019s right for the people and the community by creating value that\
      \ will ensure goodwill. These studios value and respect their fans and loyal\
      \ supporters. They did not forget where they came from. Why? Because charging\
      \ full price for the same game, albeit with \u2018new\u2019 content is not right.\
      \ Because a timed discount for owners that went largely unnoticed is unfair\
      \ to those who did not know about it.\n\nGive it to the people for free. Or,\
      \ at the very least, make the discount applicable for all owners of the original\
      \ game."
