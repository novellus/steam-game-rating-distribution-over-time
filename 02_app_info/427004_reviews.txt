Beating the game. (40 hours average)\n2. Grind out the house upgrades. (2nd play through, or x hours.)\n3. Boosting noires lily rank with everyone. (2 hours)\n\nThat 3rd one is rather dull.\nEach character has cutscenes, one viewable at every 10 points on the lily rank marker - totaling 10 cutscenes for 100 lily rank each.\nLoading up a level with atleast 5 slots available for 4 characters to boost rep with noire. Killing all but 1 enemy and leaving its aggro range. Grouping 4 characters on each side of noire. The preps done. Now use noires buff and end the turn... 100 times.\nBut thats not enough. Thats only 4 of the 23 main cast. So repeat the process 5 more times totaling 6 cycles of this.\n600 buffs, 10 seconds each turn = 6000 seconds. Plus 6 sessions of 2 minutes ending the match and prepping the cycle = 720 seconds.\n\n112 minutes. 8 minutes shy of 2 hours... 2 dull, repetitious hours.\nKicker. There is an achievement for doing this with all 23 characters. But hey, atleast there is one less cycle after every 4 completed characters because math. 71 cycles, 7100 buffs... 22 hours... Never again.\n[spoiler]Please stop this[/spoiler]\n\nI would advise getting this if you want to see all the content without all the drag.\nWith the bundle if you want all the things. Or along with the DLC characters. Or standalone.\n[spoiler] [spoiler] Atleast pump the brakes [spoiler] Holy fuck [/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1467188453,"timestamp_updated":1467266382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":33,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.767424821853637695","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi4f5z9UCduueWw=="}
