It's a fun gamebook with lots of choices to make, and its presentation on the PC feels very slick (it was originally a mobile game).\n\nMy first run ended when I got a bad roll and was stabbed in the neck with a kitchen knife, but I'll definitely be trying again. With any luck, I'll be more successful next time.","timestamp_created":1483343397,"timestamp_updated":1483343397,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467289716005325317","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iICKr9kCdOWubg=="}
