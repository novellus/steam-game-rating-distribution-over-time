    developer_response: "EDIT 2: \nAre you still having trouble with the linux version?\
      \ I pushed a package. If you don't see changes then you may need to delete your\
      \ cache. I can help with that if this is the case. Just let me know.\n\nEDIT:\
      \ I have uploaded a fixed version for windows, and removed linux support temporarily.\
      \ Once I get a proper build I will add the linux version back in. In the meantime\
      \ feel free to keep using windows or the browser version.\n\nYou are correct\
      \ in that there are only the five levels, and the linux version is wonky. I\
      \ packaged it all using electron and it was a terrible experience.\n\nIf you\
      \ want to play the full game, I would recommend heading to \nhttps://pocoman.sleepless.com/production/?pack=classic.pmp\n\
      \ which is what the game is supposed to load.\n\nI'm still working on fixing\
      \ the packages for steam."

    review: "[b]EDIT 2:[/b]The game has been updated to contain all levels now, and\
      \ it's a fun little sokoban for a very low price. [b]/EDIT 2[/b]\n\n[b]EDIT:[/b]\
      \ The Linux version is currently broken (see reply from developer below).When\
      \ the Linux version has been fixed to include the full game, I will update my\
      \ review to reflect the changes. [b]/EDIT[/b] \n\nA fun little sokoban, with\
      \ emphasis on little. The game contains only five levels, and took a mere 10\u2013\
      15 minutes to complete. It also didn't launch properly at first on Linux, and\
      \ left a processor lingering, which I had to kill manually.\n\nThis is one of\
      \ the kinds of games that make me wish for more granularity in Steam user reviews.\
      \ It's definitely not a solid recommendation, in spite of the thumbs up, but\
      \ for the low cost, it's not a bad way to spend your money and time either."
