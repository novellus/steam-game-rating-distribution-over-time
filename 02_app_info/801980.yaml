    about_the_game: "Book of illustrations and concept art from the game Kingdom Come:\
      \ Deliverance, which, just like the game, is a little out of the ordinary. While\
      \ in the case of fantasy and sci-fi games the illustrator can let his imagination\
      \ run wild, limited only by what can subsequently be transformed into models\
      \ in the 3D engine, the approach in Kingdom Come was quite different.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nOur game takes place in a historical setting \u2013 it aims to be\
      \ as authentic as possible and to depict the Middle Ages as they really looked,\
      \ and not like we see in clich\xE9d, often very misleading images on the silver\
      \ screen. What\u2019s more, the story takes place in a quite specific place\
      \ and time and features real historical figures. We wanted to create a world\
      \ in which you could finally see how things really looked then, how people lived\
      \ and dressed and what the landscape we know intimately looked like at a time\
      \ when people used it quite differently than they do today. So, the illustrations\
      \ for Kingdom Come were also created differently. There was still a need for\
      \ imagination, but it was supported by historical research, consultation with\
      \ experts and examination of archives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo apart from creating\
      \ attractive images of the hero of the game in action poses, our illustrators\
      \ also had to learn about drawing old maps, book illumination, altar panels\
      \ and frescoes. They created detailed diagrams of medieval mining works and\
      \ equipment and projected into the concept landscapes depicting real places\
      \ their acquired knowledge of medieval farming and land use.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe art you will see here is only a fragment of the thousands of illustrations,\
      \ sketches, maps and concepts that had to be created for the game \u2013 enough\
      \ to fill several such books. Almost everything you see in the game first had\
      \ to be studied diligently by someone before being painted. And we believe the\
      \ artists did a first-class job."
