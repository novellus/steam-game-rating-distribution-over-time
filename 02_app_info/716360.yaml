    review: "I usually don't write reviews, but I've decided to write my first review\
      \ because I feel very strongly about this game and its potential.\n\nFirstly,\
      \ I LOVE minesweeper. This 3D twist to the original game only improves the experience,\
      \ and dramatically so. I'm not sure I can express how much I have enjoyed playing\
      \ this game in only one review. It is very well executed, and has little to\
      \ no bugs. In my experience playing, I have only encountered one bug, in which\
      \ in extreme cubes, there is a chance that, in the 3D view, there are blocks\
      \ that display both a ONE and a ZERO. Developers, for more information on this,\
      \ feel free to email me at gusbres@gmail.com.\n\nThere are a couple improvements\
      \ I would make to the game. First, I would increase customizability of the cube.\
      \ There ARE 4 existing modes: Easy, Medium, Hard and Extreme, however, the cube\
      \ can only be increased to a certain size, and there can only be between 5%\
      \ and 20% mines throughout all 4 modes. One thing I would love to see is a time\
      \ trials kind of setup, or even a battle mode, in which you could compete against\
      \ friends, where 2 or more players are given the same cube, and it is a race\
      \ to find all the mines. I think this game has so much potential, and I would\
      \ love to see it grow. \n\n4.75 / 5."
