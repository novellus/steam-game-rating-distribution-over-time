If you enjoy \"cat and mouse\" stealth gameplay, where you're relatively defenseless and have to avoid enemies, you'll probably like it. It's dripping with atmosphere. The stealth works well partly because ths game has such a strong sense of place - Sker Hotel is rendered in incredible, moody detail.\n\nThe main issue with the gameplay is that it's too simple. For 85% of the game, you're avoiding stupid, slow moving enemies who can only detect you by sound. The sound mechanic could have been great but the desingers only added a few ways to be heard, like walking/running near an enemie, or coughing if the air quality is bad. If you crouch-walk near enemies and hold your breath in dirty air, you'll never have a problem. If wish they'd added more ways to make noise, like stepping on broken glass, bumping into furniture and whatnot. \n\nThe game eevntually introduces new enemies but they're essentially boss firghts and are over quickly. When you return to old areas, the game usually chages up the patrol path of the enemies but they never add new dangers.  The original Resident Evil added hunters when you returned to the mansion and it was scary as fuck. But there's little tension as the game goes on because the enemies just aren't that threatening.\n\nAnd yet I had fun sneaking through the creepy old hotel, avoiding enemies and occassionally almost getting caught. Just wish there'd been more to it.","timestamp_created":1610068408,"timestamp_updated":1610068408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7Mbj7/YCeJy2wQI="}
