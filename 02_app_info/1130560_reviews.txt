It's also not that cheap either. The game lacks a lot of polish and doesn't feel like a lot of effort went into the game. There are some good ideas but overall the execution is pretty poor.\n\nThe audio is all over the place. I'm sure the customer noises are for your information but hearing them across the map breaks immersion and just doesn't feel right. The noises themselves were kinda meh. All around just meh.\n\nVisually the game was also sort of meh. Scale on the Players? NPCs? Patrons? People buying your sh*t... They were way too short. They were all about 5ish feet tall and all the same height. Just one of those little things that's really insignificant but glaringly immersion breaking. Like a tiny paper cut on your finger while you try to type. It's the tiniest of wounds but always at the forefront of your mind whenever you touch a key.\n\nThe UI was pretty bad IMO. The laser pointer selector kept going away whenever you touched the stick. You'd have to attempt to scroll with the stick again to get it to come back. Where you needed to look to interact with the UI vs where the response information was presented were at opposite ends of the menu. Just poorly designed. Having recopies show up before purchasable items when you can't craft anything for quite some time seems poorly implemented. There just wasn't much I liked about the UI.\n\nI did like the mechanics I saw though. Wandering around and scavenging for loot from dead adventurers and just designing and running the shop in general. A lot of good ideas, just very low effort implementation. I would have liked to see some other adventuring mechanics and I would have liked to try crafting but that appears to be a mid to late game mechanic.\n\nWhich brings me to your goal, or lack there of. With the flat games like this, you have a story or a MP goal of building up a town. There's a purpose for getting all that money aside from just hitting achievement goals. There was no purpose here. No feeling of progression. The leveling system had no meaning other than to ding every once in a while. I didn't see any new unlocks or mechanics. So... What is my overall goal? I didn't see one.\n\nThis is overall a mostly neutral and meh review but I think it leans more negative than positive. Which is pretty disappointing because I expected I would like this game and was going for a win after MoH. Oh well... Maybe next time...","timestamp_created":1608487562,"timestamp_updated":1608487562,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwsY3VwPYCcOThuwI="}
