    short_description: Virtual Home Theater (VHT) is a media player and desktop mirroring
      software that simulate the perceived audio and video of a real cinema or home
      theater system in virtual space, delivering true 3D spatial audio in VR, replacing
      the old &quot;head-locked&quot; stereo audio technology.
