You need a basic understanding and knowledge of Kana in order to play this game.\nThere are no lessons, study cards, nothing in the game that would actually teach you what each Kana are. Not even a JPEG of the Hiragana and Katakana alphabets for you to learn from. \n\nEven when you get the answer wrong, the game says out loud which answer you pressed, but does not show you the kana which would have been the correct answer. So for an example, if the game wants you to pick \"Mi\", and you pick \"Hi\", the game will say out loud \"Hi\", and you take damage. Then the game moves on. There is no opportunity here to learn other than trial and error, which is not very effective or fun.\n\nThere is no bonus reward for choosing the answer quickly, nor does there seem to be a penalty for taking your time, as the zombies only seem to damage you when you choose the wrong answer. \nNo time trial mode, survival mode, anything of the sort. You choose a difficulty, but going for a harder difficulty at the beginning is nearly impossible, no matter how good your Kana knowledge is, since for some reason the difficulty raises the hit points of the zombies and due to the weapon system, you will not be able to do much damage. I understand the \"idea\" behind this mechanic, but I don't understand how it is supposed to be fun or educational in any way.\n\nPro mode, which mixes both Hiragana and Katakana choices gives no additional rewards to the players, but it is the most fun mode of the three to play. \n\nThis game might be fun if you're at a very specific period in your studies, where you have already studied and learned most of the Kana and want a quick way to test your memory, but even for that, there are better alternatives.","timestamp_created":1608997480,"timestamp_updated":1608997480,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5KTuz/YCdYy2vQI="}
