      /><br><br>I saw that island in my dream... Always the same island... <br>A great
      castle surrounded by different biomes...<br><br>One where the rain never end...
      One where the fog is deadly thick... The one where you can freeze to death...
      The one where you can lose your soul in a giant maze... The one where hops burn
      like the lava on the floor... And finally the one where you can fall forever...<br><br>In
      my dream i saw that island... I'm now there and there is no turning back...
      A lonely knight on a deadly island... Farewell...<br><br>This game is a short
      real time combat collectathon with a cartoony looks in the style of zelda mixed
      with dark souls where you have to collect golden coins to progress through 6
      unique biomes ( worlds )... This game have a life time of approximately 2 hours...
      Hope you guys have fun!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1379570/extras/BANNER_DESC_02.jpg?t=1604854006"
      /><br><br>We strongly recommend to play the game with a controller due to the
      frequent use of the camera. It is possible to play with the keyboard but it
      is not recommended. To rotate the camera from left to right with the keyboard
      use the ( Q and E keys ), from down to up use the ( F and R keys )... To zoom
      and unzoom the camera use the ( C and V keys ) and finally to reset the camera
      use the ( K key )...<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1379570/extras/BANNER_DESC_03.jpg?t=1604854006"

    review: This game is really cute, but can be really hard! It say 2 hours of gameplay
      on the game page but took me almost 3 so i'm gladly surprised for that! The
      concept is good, but it seems that the sword was not always working as intended.
      This is a game made with smile game builder, so i can understand. Great game!
