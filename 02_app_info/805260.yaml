    about_the_game: "PICNIC is a 3 dimensional labyrinth game. And this 3 dimensions\
      \ are not only spatial: The first dimension is the visual dimension, a surreal\
      \ digital labyrinth in which the user is awaking in the middle of a nightmare.\
      \ Far away is a kind of bright green plastic hill, this seems to be, close to\
      \ a strange phony star, the only colorful thing in the monochrome game world.\
      \ On a wall is something written, inviting the user to go to the green hill,\
      \ to the &quot;picnic hill&quot;. On another wall: The user should listen carefully,\
      \ THEY will show him/her the way. If the user is &quot;listening carefully&quot;,\
      \ THEY will &quot;show you the way&quot;. And actually, if the user is searching\
      \ a way through the visual labyrinth, THEY appear and THEY are telling something...\
      \ It seems to be a story... about someone, who is planning to make (the game)\
      \ picnic or even to have a picnic, but something happens... maybe something\
      \ very scary... So the second dimension is the story labyrinth.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nWhile searching a way through the labyrinth and &quot;listen carefully&quot;,\
      \ what THEY say - the user will &quot;rewrite&quot; or de-construct (depending\
      \ on the ways the user is choosing) a story... But this story is again a labyrinth,\
      \ a text labyrinth... <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhich could be a novel, called PICNIC\
      \ - depending on choices and how willing the user is &quot;to listen carefully&quot;\
      \ - and also depending on the third dimension of the labyrinth: the noise labyrinth.\
      \ Because if the user is not willing to &quot;listen carefully&quot;, the novel\
      \ PICNIC, meaning what the &quot;creatures&quot; are saying, is turning into\
