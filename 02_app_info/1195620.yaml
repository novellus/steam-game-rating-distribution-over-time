    review: This game is actually pretty good. There's not a whole lot to it, and
      honestly it's a  port from the XBL-Indie game line-up that got axed years ago.
      A one-dude studio. It's just a simple Outrun clone with an 80's-ish aesthetic.
      There isn't really much as far as a story goes and what little is there is pretty
      absurd. I'm not sure if that was intentional or not but either way I like it.
      Though there isn't much written dialogue, there are spelling mistakes throughout.
      Not an issue for me, but to some it could be a gripe I guess. The game only
      contains a few synthwave-ey tracks, which work and sound okay but grow old quickly.
      There are recycled assets, some minor graphical glitches during certain sections
      of the race, and the annoying fact that you can get hung up on the "wall"(edge
      of the screen), especially going through tunnels, which can get frustrating  as
      it can slow you down and cause you to lose precious seconds needed to reach
      the checkpoint. None of those issues are anything game-breaking though and it's
      all worth it because once you taken a few runs and start getting in the groove
      of the traffic and getting a feel for the steering, it suddenly clicks. At first
      it seems like there's WAY too much traffic. Like, "ruining the game" traffic.
      Once you get the feel of the controls and the handling though, you begin to
      be able to manage that traffic a lot better, and soon you're weaving in and
      out of impossibly packed corners with ease. Swerving between tight clumps of
      vehicles that are all moving at different speeds, and rarely even scratching
      your paint. You start to realize that the game is really about avoiding other
      cars, and it's actually pretty damn fun. The hit-boxes are just forgiving enough
      to make you feel like a bad-ass without making you feel like you're driving
      with an invincibility star activated. It feels really good. So good that I wish
      there was more to it. No meat and potatoes though. Just a value meal. There
      are 3 characters, each with their own slightly incoherent "story", which is
      really just some small lines of dialogue that read out chronologically across
      the top of the screen at certain points throughout the race in the form of speech
      bubbles. The same every time. Corny but amusing, and honestly it's just a small
      extra that didn't really need to be there anyway and I actually enjoyed it,
      so I'm not complaining. I think if it were a little better localized it would
      make more sense but there seems to be a bit of a translation gap. The writing
      on the screen can be toggled on or off which is a nice little touch since once
      you've completed a character's story and have read what they have to say, there
      really isn't a need to have it play out again and take up space on the screen.
      Just like in Outrun you have to make it to each checkpoint to continue to on
      through the next section, which changes the scenery and look of the area. There
      are no branching paths to choose from while making your way to the end. To "win"
      the race you must simply make it to the end of the last section. There are no
      other cars to race against. Just a steady flow of traffic, narrow tunnels and
      tight corners hindering your path to success. Ocean Drive Challenge will definitely
      scratch the Outrun itch for anyone looking to do so, or anyone who can enjoy
      a little arcade racer with tight controls and a small entry fee. This game is
      obscure and buried on Steam so waiting around for it to go on sale may be an
      exercise in futility. To me it was worth the 6 bucks.
