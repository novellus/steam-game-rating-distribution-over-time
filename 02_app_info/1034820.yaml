    review: 'There might be some potential, but not in this state, the game is far
      from complete, it needs a ton of polish, and playability tweaking, then it could
      start becoming interesting. It doesn''t save between level, so once you''ve
      completed the horrid first level, level 2 starts you on a unicycle without explanation
      how to play and you die in 5 seconds from falling! Then back to the very begining!

      The graphics are so much better than how the game plays that it makes me wonder
      if it''s not an asset flip, or worse, if the sprites have not been "borrowed"
      from another game.'
