However, also like the game, it feels incomplete. Like, where is Keaton's song? Where is the outdoor variation of the casino theme? Where are the item acquisition jingles? :(\n\nThese are honestly nitpicks, though. This is great stuff, honestly better than half the game soundtracks I've picked up on Steam. My only hope is that it will only grow bigger as the dev continues to work on the game.","timestamp_created":1609290292,"timestamp_updated":1609291046,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx5PO2PYCd43QvgI="}
