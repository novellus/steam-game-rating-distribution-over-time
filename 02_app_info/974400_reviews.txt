I've been a novice/casual virtual pinball player for a while, but I never once bothered nudging tables. If you take the time to practice, you will learn that every surface can act as a propellant. and your flippers can be considered your absolute last line of defense in many cases. You can often nudge the ball off a wall into a bumper more easily than using a flipper. These end up being invaluable skills and when you go back to more forgiving tables, you might be surprised how differently you handle them. \n\nThe artwork is mostly identical to the updated and original versions of the tables in this game, and in that respect they are colorful and pleasing to look at. There are plenty of graphical and sound options in this engine to fit your mood and preferred play environment. \n\nThere are MANY achievements to unlock, and you can earn reward tables for gaining them. It's also worth noting that at the time of this review, you can play EVERY table available in-game (other than the reward tables that must be unlocked by achievements.) While there is a score limit on tables you haven't purchased, you can still gain some achievements in them, and it's great to be able to test out a table before you decide if it's something you'd like to purchase.\n\nThe driving factor, as well as the focus of these tables, is getting a higher score. It's very rewarding to see your improvement, and how you stack up against others on the leader board. It can get quite addicting to play \"just one more time\" to move up and improve your skills.\n\nI would also argue that the default keyboard control scheme may not cut it for you, as it did not for me. My recommendation is setting the left and right flippers to the \"Z\" and \"?\" keys (US layout,) leaving the upwards nudge as space bar, setting the right ALT key to nudging downwards, and setting left and right shift to nudging left and right. this allows you to comfortably use your pointer fingers for flippers, middle fingers for nudging left and right, and your thumbs for nudging up and down. I've personally found this layout to be very helpful.\n\nOverall, I can highly recommend this purchase, and (again, at the time of this review) $2.00 US is an absolute steal.","timestamp_created":1604767799,"timestamp_updated":1604768503,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zYLq0fUCfJH5rAI="}
