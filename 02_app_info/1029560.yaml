    review: 'Additions:

      - Add setting to have mouse shown on screen. Sometimes it was hard to see where
      I was aiming

      - Add objective markers/direction markers. Sometimes it wasn''t obvious what
      I was supposed to do

      - For weapons that can be charged up before firing, add a "charging bar" or
      some other indicator to display how charged the weapon is

      - Possibly add more health packs


      Pros:

      - Great performance

      - Great textures and models (general look of the game looks awesome)

      - Lots of content (levels, pilots, tanks and weapons to choose from)

      - Satisfying physics


      Cons:

      - I die quite fast (might just be because I''m bad at games)

      - Some of the bombs have a lot of knockback which sends me flying into other
      bombs (this might be intentional as the level literally has "knockback" in the
      name



      Bugs:

      - Rarely, the camera will be in the wrong place but only if you want to go off
      the main path

      - During gameplay, my cursor will not come back after failing a mission'
