Felt like it was going to be another college project. I was so wrong! This is Missile Command for 2020, in the best way. Unlock all of the upgrades to find your perfect playstyle. Great action gameplay, fun choices, and the art really grew on me. Seeing ships explode into color clouds, which then get cut to pieces as projectiles fly through them, was massively satisfying. \n\nThe tutorial interface is a mess, and almost made me reconsider my purchase, but after the 30 seconds looking at bad text placement, the game enabled its hyperdrive and kicked into high gear.\n\nFor new players, look at the tips on how to use the shields. While I got used to the game without them, they occasionally saved my life. I also noticed the word \"seasons\" in the menu, and really hope we see new content eventually. This game will definitely stay in my current roster of games played.","timestamp_created":1600016513,"timestamp_updated":1600016513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/s6axPQCdKDNoQI="}
