    review: "Purchased this game for a dollar, have played mostly through it (From\
      \ what I can read), though it doesn't take long to do so, even with a couple\
      \ of deaths.\n\nFor what I paid, this is so-so. If you really love these pixellated\
      \ dungeon crawlers, then I'd recommend it, but everyone else would be okay to\
      \ steer clear. The chief problem isn't the game's length, the utter predictability\
      \ of monsters and combat, nor even the tendency of RNG to completely mess up\
      \ a run-through, but rather the mechanics. Sometimes when firing a bow or magic,\
      \ projectiles inexplicably miss. Sometimes I can't hit things in melee, but\
      \ they just chop me down - and sometimes vice versa. The combat just doesn't\
      \ work very well and doesn't provide a very enjoyable experience. \n\nWith a\
      \ lot more work and streamlining, this could be all right."
