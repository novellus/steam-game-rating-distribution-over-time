    review: 'Dear Adrian,


      I waiting your game and put in my wishlist when I saw the pictures.

      But, For me, the gameplay is approximativ and the game in this state is unplayable
      without a rank of luck egal to 10000000!


      I love this kind of game, and played many all times, but I cannot do something
      good in this game. It''s too chaotic for me.

      The design is good.'
