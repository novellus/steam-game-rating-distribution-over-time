Overall, the game is a buggy unpolished mess, Game play is lacking, and there's literally no way to pay off your debt without cheating.\n\n3/10 - has potential, needs way more polishing, and beta testing.","timestamp_created":1606965742,"timestamp_updated":1606965800,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxIWok/YCdvPztgI="}
