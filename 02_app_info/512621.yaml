    review: 'In this dlc we have a pdf file all about Reigns.

      This thing was part of the Collector''s Edition.

      And I actually enjoyed reading through it all.

      It''s not that huge, it''s just 24 pages of stuff.

      Most of it is filled with various art and such.

      You can get this DLC for a very cheap price.

      Supporting them developers is always good.

      And overall: There''s nothing negative to say.

      It''s just a nice addition for the fans to enjoy.

      This thing gets the positive review from me.'
