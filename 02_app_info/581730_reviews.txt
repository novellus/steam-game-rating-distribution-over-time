Self-described as \"A 3D shooter made in the spirit of the the 90s' FPSes\" - truth be told, this game would have been outdated if it had come out in the early 90s and stood next to Ultima Underworld or Elder Scrolls Arena - both of which you can pick up for less than $8.99 .\nIf you like Hexen/Heretic you can pick them up on Steam - for $1 more than Autumn Night 3D you get the entire bundle with Heretic 1, Hexen 1 & 2 + Deathkings of the Dark Citadel.\nOther newer games catch the 90s feel and look with much better gameplay: Amid Evil, Apocryph, Dusk, Ziggurat and Wrath Aeon of Ruin.","timestamp_created":1584892700,"timestamp_updated":1584892700,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1uy9gfECctCM+gE="}
