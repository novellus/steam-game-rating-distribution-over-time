The bow rotation should be based on the arrow hand.\nIt's really hard to aim with just the bow hand, it's almost impossible for me.\nSo, currently the game is unplayable for me due to this.\nI urge the dev to add tow handed aim while pulling the arrow, at least as an option.","timestamp_created":1609729490,"timestamp_updated":1609729490,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483870983123779297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxdfW5fYCe5ajwAI="}
