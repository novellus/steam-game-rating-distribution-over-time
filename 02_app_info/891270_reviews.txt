It would be better if there is a overview screen where I can see all the important infos at once like the XP stars I have/get when I train or make a practice round. Furthermore the design could be better and some visual effects. The game could be much better with less text/infos, but more action buttons in one screen that there is no need to switch the windows so often. I dont know exactly but I miss something with this game, maybe the named things are not exactly that, what I mean.","timestamp_created":1605240635,"timestamp_updated":1605240635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ454fz3/UCfMaGrgI="}
