I'll brook no thieves outside of myself, so I promptly murdered him. Unfortunately, I missed the guard in the corner of the room, so I had to murder him too. Thing is, no one else heard my bloody hacking, so I quietly climbed out the back window. Later in my demo, I was told that the crime was discovered, but it wasn't quite pinned on me yet.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.usgamer.net\/articles\/the-10-best-indies-of-pax-east-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >USGamer<\/a><br><br>“Consequences to your actions loom around every corner, and I'm excited to see just how dynamic the game can get.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/gallery\/15-fascinating-new-games-that-shouldnt-be-overlook\/2900-2660\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gamespot<\/a><br><br>“This town would always remember the day when the two gangs’ leadership were killed – the day their town was saved.
