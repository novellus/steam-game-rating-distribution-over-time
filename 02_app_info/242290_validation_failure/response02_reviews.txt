I would only recommend this one for the 'Hardcore' fans of F1. For £6.50 for 2 tracks (£3.25) each, it does seem a bit steep. However, I would recommend it if you just like Imola. It's a great track that's hard to master. Overall don't buy it unless you really like it or it's on promotion.","timestamp_created":1415045534,"timestamp_updated":1415045534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.705272555351257324","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk6rSu8kCd//ZMA=="}
