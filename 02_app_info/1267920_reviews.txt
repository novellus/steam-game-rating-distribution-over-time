There is no way to change keybindings, no directions or help for the editor. The editor itself also feels unfinished as you cannot rotate the way you would expect to. Sometimes the AI will literally spot you through walls when standing still. I like the idea of the game but it is very poorly executed. I have fun playing the missions although AI is wonky. Please update the game with more weapons, better AI, and a better editor.","timestamp_created":1588047233,"timestamp_updated":1588047233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/re/3/ECcbr/gwI="}
