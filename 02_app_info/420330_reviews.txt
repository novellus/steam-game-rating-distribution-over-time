You are limited to 3 types of gadgets, all of which have limited numbers that can't be recovered. Most of the gadgets are distraction variations, and the starting set is very weak. Coins have a tiny radius and should not be limited uses. There is only so far you can get with clever stealth, and some areas will stack guards in bright areas in front of the only door available to progress. You have no way to control light, no way to take down guards early on, and no free distractions.\n\nImagine if Metal Gear Solid limited how many times you could knock on walls. I'm sorry, but absolutely not. I know the goal is pure stealth, but the levels are not designed for clean runs with no detection.","timestamp_created":1601224052,"timestamp_updated":1601224052,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520201981067657471","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0oGZ6PQCfdq6pAI="}
