When you move into place you can accidentally touch the wall (very slightly) and fail because it's a tight spot to put yourself into. With the walls it can be very hard to dodge, (not sure if tracking problems but even moving my hands and body far away from the wall it can still think you hit it, bug?) \nI think putting on Small Room or what-not helped but it still happened commonly even with the setting on.\nI personally don't enjoy the game, but I do see potential with others who are interested. \nI don't think its worth the price. Maybe could drop it to 10 or under, or wait for a sale.\nIf you are interested in this genre, look into investing into Beat Saber, the game is less strict on arm movement and overall more fun.","timestamp_created":1610146167,"timestamp_updated":1610147436,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3oKR8vYCcJnUwQI="}
