Not much.  I get I only played it an hour, but there wasn't much to suck me in.  The music wasn't bad, I suppose.\n\n[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]\n\nIt's like all the other top-down space shooters out there.  Nothing separated it against the dozens or so other games I played like this.  I guess if that's okay to you, then this game would be okay.  But the combat was only okay, the mining okay, the space travel okay.  Everything just felt okay, which is not what I am looking for.  It just blends in with other games in the same genre.  It's clean for what it is, but that doesn't mean I want to keep playing it.\n\nHowever, I am not refunding it because I want to support devs who make games like this.  If, down the line, I am craving a game like this and haven't played one in awhile, I may reach for this one.\n\n[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]\n\nI was bored!  That's all there is to it.\n\n[b] Disclaimer [/b]\n\nI have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!\n","timestamp_created":1609703059,"timestamp_updated":1609703059,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44+3x5PYCd4eWwAI="}
