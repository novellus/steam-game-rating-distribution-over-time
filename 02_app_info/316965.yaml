      in Czechoslovakia in the 1960s to replace older L-29 jet trainers. Powered by
      an Ivchenko AI-25TL turbofan engine, the L-39 has a top speed of Mach 0.80,
      a service ceiling of 11,000 m (36,100 feet), and can pull up to 8 G. Although
      primarily used as a trainer and light attack aircraft, the L-39 has also become
      popular with several aerial acrobatics demonstration teams.<br><br>Being a trainer
      aircraft, the L-39C has a tandem cockpit with the student in front and the instructor
      in the back. The instructor has several controls to mimic system failures to
      test the student. The L-39C also has two underwing pylons for bombs, rockets
      and close range air-to-air missiles. For decades, the L-39 was used by nations
      around the world to train pilots that later went on to fly aircraft like the
      MiG-29 and Su-27.<br><br>A later evolution of the L-39 was the L-39ZA light
      attack aircraft. The ZA adds two additional weapon pylons and a center pylon
      to mount a gun pod. The ZA has proved a popular choice for low-intensity conflicts.
      The L-39ZA will be available later during the Open Beta.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key
