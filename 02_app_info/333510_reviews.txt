Stop it. Shut up. Listen.\n\nThis is far from my favourite game on Steam. It's far from my most played game on Steam. I will say this instead. This is my most admired game on Steam. Currently I own 781 games. I'm not often in the mood to play it, now that I've finished it on hard. However, I keep it installed on every machine I have Steam on.\n\n\"But you've played a paltry 20 hours only!\" - That's mostly true. I think I played maybe 5-6 more hours that weren't logged one time. That's not the point though. This game doesn't need \"progression\" systems, with artificially tacked on hooks to trick you into playing indefinitely. You have everything you need to play at the absolute highest level from the beginning. I don't need to drop 80 hours to treasure this... and I find myself returning to it for an hour or so every few months.\n\nI know that this is a weird choice. It's idiosyncratic. If you would like, though, let's try to explore what makes Isbarah so special. \n\n- Bullet Hell Bliss. Dodging is sexy. Dodging in slow motion is double sexy. Double dash dodging in slow motion is... I dunno, I'm not a mathematician. The game is not about you doing combos and attacks of your own. It's about you frantically weaving through impossible curtains of bullets and although you are in a state of absolute panic somehow doing it with grace and beauty. I know that this subgenre is intimidating to people, but strangely Isbarah makes even advanced scoring concepts such as \"grazing\" incredibly readable and clear. This game will trick you into appearing superhuman.\n\n- Memorisation is for chumps. This game isn't about \"learning patterns\" and trial and error in the traditional sense. I'm sure that those skills help. However, the game gives you enough tools to dodge, slow-mo, and wall your way through every challenge in a variety of ways that the idea of \"solving\" a particular pattern, or there being only one way out of a certain boss phase, is laughable. Some of the added challenges you can enable, such as the ghost bullet, really highlight how this isn't a game about min-maxing and optimizing your way to victory. \n\n- Difficulty. Obviously this is a divisive concept in games these days. For most games, I usually start on normal or hard (depending on the game and number of choices) and then find little need to go back and play through again at a higher difficulty. For whatever reason... the itch is here for this one. It's not to scratch off steam achievements or tell my friends how great I am at this somewhat obscure indie game. I feel the drive to get further in Isbarah because I purely enjoy getting further in Isbarah. Currently chipping away at some of the bosses on \"7th hell\" level difficulty. The game is a thing of beauty at all levels. \n\nTo the extent that this game is a new genre (and it sort of is), I am absolutely begging for more in this genre. I cannot wait to see what this developer does next.","timestamp_created":1570729122,"timestamp_updated":1570729122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616393446922302246","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjYuw2+0Cfszv0wE="}
