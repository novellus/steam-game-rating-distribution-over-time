If you like having a wide variety of little experiences and $5 is the equivalent of an espresso, then its worth a try.  Had one decent scare but mostly its a bit odd.  Still, ill keep it installed as a quick showcase for friends or family that dont have VR and want to quickly try a few different things.  Plus i dont want to discourage further development of these types of things ...\n\nEDIT:  I played a trick on my 5 year old who has loved VR so far.  He either plays Angry Birds/Spiderman/Flying Hero games, drivers, Roller Coasters or short Videos.  I told him this was a new video...  Hes not stupid.  He was getting a creepy vibe and asking if it was going to be scary.  I lied.  And got a heck of a good laugh at his inevitable scream :)","timestamp_created":1595346082,"timestamp_updated":1610070974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw46vt7/YCfY7dlgI="}
