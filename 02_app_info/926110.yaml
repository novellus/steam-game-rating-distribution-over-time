    review: "This game was good. I mean really good. I had a lot of fun and, what's\
      \ best, it keeps you going. It's a story about swapped identities, love triangles,\
      \ honorable knights and beautiful ladies, betrayal and death (hence the title)\
      \ and the eye of Iago (the way someone sees is not what it seems). \n\nIt's\
      \ a Middle Age romance set in Romania, more specificially around the Bran Castle\
      \ which can be seen in the majority of scenes. I have adored the backgrounds\
      \ of this game! It mixes Medieval architecture with traditional Romanian household\
      \ items and regional costumes. \n\nAside from the praise I give to the backgrounds\
      \ and to the soundtrack, I must say that the puzzles are absolutely different\
      \ from one another. Some of them resemble the ones found in other games of this\
      \ genre; however, the vast majority are so diverse that you need to think outside\
      \ the box to solve a puzzle. \n\nFor instance, you have to click on the hand\
      \ of your protagonist in order to shed light in different spots to retrieve\
      \ parts of a broken goblet. You'll find out more when you'll purchase and play\
      \ this game which I definitely recommend! Let's now go over the Pros and Cons\
      \ for this game.\n\nPROS:\n- Catchy story;\n- Beautiful scenes;\n- Fitting soundtracks;\n\
      - Fast-travelling map;\n- Diverse puzzles and Hidden Objects minigames;\n- In-game\
      \ achievements unveiled at the end of game;\n- Sidekick funny-looking dog called\
      \ Bandit;\n\nNEUTRE:\n- I didn't know up until the end of the game that the\
      \ pink dog rose is the Hint button;\n- I would have wanted to belly rub Bandit;\n\
      - I didn't see a Romanian in the credits, so now I understand why some words\
      \ written in the Romanian language are grammatically and ortographically wrong.\n\
      - It's alright, thought. The words don't hinder the game in anyway. Plus it\
      \ makes the player feel an authentic experience of the Romanian culture and\
      \ tongue.\n\nCONS: \n- Even if it has Steam Overlay, I still couldn't take any\
      \ screenshots. So no screenshots.\n- No Trading cards;\n- No Steam achievements\
      \ (as we usually know them);\n- The Guide book doesn't give you clear instructions\
      \ on how to solve a HO minigame or a puzzle;\n- No Journal entries.\n\nAll in\
      \ all, I recommend it to anyone looking for a romance story and a good adventure.\
      \ I just love Nicolae! Kudos to the developers for creating such a character!\
      \ I would love to see more of these games from this developer. \n\nI would like\
      \ to hear your opinion as well. How did you find the story? How did you think\
      \ about the mechanics of the game? And so on. Please write and let me know.\
      \ Until next game!"
