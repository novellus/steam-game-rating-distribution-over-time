Unfortunately, I found it to be quite lacking in many areas, and the most disappointing thing was this game could have, and perhaps, should have, been so much better. While the in-game characters do have a good resemblance of who they are supposed to be, and the voice acting and soundtrack is pretty decent, these factors may just about be the only good part of the game, and sadly, that's not enough to warrant a positive review from me. In relation to the graphics in this game - while graphics do not make or break a game - this game does not look like a 2013 release. The animations don't look good at all, especially the movement and when you need to do something with your partner like \"pry open doors\". Additionally, graphical elements such as flames also look terrible.\n\nThe gameplay is mediocre at best. Terrible game mechanics and clunky and unresponsive controls contribute to a pretty poor gaming experience. The \"stealth\" and shooting is nothing special for a third-person shooter, just different in the form of Star Trek weapons - I guess the alternate fire is somewhat interesting... but not enough to make me go \"wow\". The cover system is pretty abysmal as well, there are so many better cover systems out there. The minigames including hacking and bypassing are stale and boring - interesting the first time or two, but quickly becoming repetitive, boring and a chore. The linear level design also makes the game a chore to play through. Figuring out what needed to be done was more frustrating than fun, and after succeeding, I only felt like \"phew, now I can move on\" as opposed to a sense of accomplishment. Except that half the time, I couldn't! This is because of game breaking bugs, especially in single player where your partner gets stuck or can't move, or the objective itself is bugged, forcing you to restart the checkpoint if you're lucky, or the entire chapter if you're not. Apparently these bugs have been patched, and some people have never encountered bugs, but I've personally encountered many. The jumping mechanics and the collision detection are also pretty poor and quite frustrating.\n\nThe plot was nothing special, and I found myself playing through it for the sake of completion rather than a desire to know what happens next or out of enjoyment, as good games will do to me. The campaign is probably too short for my liking as well, considering the price of the game, even accounting for Australian prices. The game is slow, long, and tedious... not fun and enjoyable. Co-op would improve this game, I suppose, if you can get it to work (which I couldn't), due to the pretty poor AI - not just your partner, but also the enemy. The inability to follow instructions can be crippling, forcing you to fail stealth if you're lucky, or to load the past checkpoint or even the chapter if you're not.\n\nSadly, I uninstalled as soon as I finished enough of the achievements that I could be bothered getting. Sadly, despite loving Star Trek; as a gamer, this is a game I cannot, and will not recommend.","timestamp_created":1403418502,"timestamp_updated":1609849358,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":126,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.859742045402526855","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6/if6fYCdqvQKA=="}
