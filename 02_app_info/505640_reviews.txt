In the end I'm incredibly glad I did. \nI enjoy both the campaign and the skirmish mode as well. It has a fun little story, an interesting art style and is quite easy to learn the ropes of the game. \nThat being said, I did not say it is an overly easy game. Expect to lose a couple rounds here and there, learn from the mistakes and continue on to conquer...in the shadows...quietly...with bombs!","timestamp_created":1609831493,"timestamp_updated":1609831493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42OXb6PYCdrPQwAI="}
