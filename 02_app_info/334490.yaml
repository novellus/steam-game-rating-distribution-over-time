    review: 'This is a really difficult review as there are a lot of ups and downs
      in this game.


      The main plot is not original but the little sub-areas are extremely varied;
      there was not, however, a lot of fleshing out done in each area and it left
      me wanting to know a little more about each place.


      Voice acting is limited to the narrator and that was well done.  Music and sounds
      were decent.


      Graphically not stellar but certainly passable; hidden object scenes were clear
      and there was no pixel-hunting or looking for badly-labeled items ("is that
      blob a football, or is THAT blob a football?" isn''t an issue in this game),


      Some of the puzzle solutions were downright silly, but I think that''s actually
      what the game was going for.  I''m not thinking that they''re taking themselves
      too seriously here so it''s pretty important that players suspend disbelief
      too.  The solutions do make sense, they''re just sometimes... well, silly.  Like
      I said.


      As the tags clearly state, this is a hidden-object/casual puzzle game, not a
      full-fledged adventure game.  Make sure you read what you''re buying before
      you buy it and are disappointed.


      The worst thing the game has going for it, honestly, is length.  Since most
      of the puzzles aren''t grossly difficult, I pretty much plowed right through
      in about two and a half hours.  This makes the $9.99 cost WAY too expensive
      for what you''re getting.  I would not get this if not on sale.


      So in the end, I am going to recommend this as a short, silly HO/puzzler AS
      LONG AS IT''S ON SALE - there are plenty of better games out there if you''re
      going to pay full price.  But it''s by no means godawfully bad, and worth wasting
      a couple bored hours with.'
