This game is surprisingly complex, and can be very competitive.  It's easy to play, and the ships have stats that differ slightly and lend themselves to different playstyles, whether you want to be the first to the finish, or destroy your opponents right off the starting line.  It also has catchy chiptune style music, if you're into that.\n\nIf you have multiple xbox controllers and friends, I highly recommend this game.  The more players the better.","timestamp_created":1470038938,"timestamp_updated":1470038938,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.457941323518753052","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwmcLJotYCf6iDXg=="}
