    review: Excellent little drone training sim. Easy to understand right off the
      bat, but hard to really get good at, Just like all Walter Machado games. Happy
      to see Machado branching out a little. Hope this kind of short cycle, heavy
      feedback driven development catches on in the indie scene. Less obnoxious than
      games jams, but not as untenable as AA development.
