    review: 'It might be best to get this while it''s on sale (as with everything
      else on Steam), but know that you''re getting a 55 page artbook with this buy.
      Seeing all the creatures that were rendered on your screen as dots in painting
      form is really, really cool. It still doesn''t answer all of the questions you
      might have about this game and this world, but it gives you a sense of real
      people in a real world trying to solve those questions.


      Oh, beat the game first, by the way. Then crack this open.'
