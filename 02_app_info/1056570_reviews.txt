I didn't know this before purchasing, but this title only has two routes. You can tell super easily looking at the description but I bought this because I was looking for another otome to try and the otome games subreddit goes crazy for this one.\n\nWhile some people disagree, I think my favorite thing about it was the localization. It made the game feel less generic, and made the comedic moments a lot more entertaining. I liked the heroine too, as much as the \"super hardworking, outgoing and always optimistic MC\" is kind of overdone, I love it when the MC just outright expresses her interest in which ever love interest she's pursuing. And I liked the boys just fine too, though I kinda feel like each story line ended kind of weirdly? Like I believed that they were in love just fine but the plot kinda lost me by the end of both routes. I did end up preferring Cinderella's story, and kind of ended up liking his character better, even though Red is certainly much more my type of LI. \n\nI did enjoy my time with it. It's a little high priced for what it is imo, but like I think if you're already into otome games then it's pretty par for the course, you'll probably enjoy it. I think if you're looking for a game with a more direct main character and you don't really care about the number of routes, then give it a shot.","timestamp_created":1609809250,"timestamp_updated":1609809250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7fiG6PYCdprIwAI="}
