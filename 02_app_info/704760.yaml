    review: "HOX: Due to personal connections I have bias to the devs.\n\nEven though\
      \ my playtime is really short, I beat the game once with Bj\xF6rn and tried\
      \ out 2 other available characters. I played the initial beta when it was on\
      \ Steam in the past. I didn't spend enough time learning the scoring system\
      \ so I'm going to skip that. Even if it was a potential problem, the game has\
      \ bigger ones as listed below.\n\nTl;dr: the game feels disappointingly unfinished.\
      \ The main gameplay is there, but the game lacks a punch on both \nthe player\
      \ character's and on the bosses part. Some of the design choices are also questionable.\
      \ You're better off skipping this game.\n\nPros:\n+ Music was energetic, drum\
      \ 'n' snare mostly\n+ Bosses were very distinct from each other in visual and\
      \ gameplay terms\n+ Some skills and passives change the gameplay drastically,\
      \ Gerhardt's plasma rifle being an example of this\n+ Good amount of graphic\
      \ and audio options\n+ Rebindable keys\n+ The combo system (the more hits you\
      \ get in without getting damaged yourself) rewards careful players with more\
      \ damage output and faster kill times...\n\nCons:\n- ... But the combo system\
      \ doesn't really make you feel much more powerful with 5 percent damage increments\
      \ to already low damage output characters.\n- Some skills felt very similar\
      \ to each other with small modifications or offered only very small adjustments\
      \ to stats. Diversifying the skills and cutting out the similar ones would make\
      \ the choices more\n- Randomized boss order. Depending on the the character\
      \ played, you could start with a boss that is noticeably difficult to deal with\
      \ unupgraded character. Option to pick the boss or having static order feels\
      \ like more sensible choice\n- Randomized skills. Some of the skills are clearly\
      \ better than others and it's frustrating when you might or might not get the\
      \ skills you want. Having all the skills available would increase the options.\
      \ If the devs felt like the player might get too powerful too fast they could\
      \ have introduced resource that player uses to buy or equip the skills they\
      \ want, with the better skills requiring more resources to buy or to equip,\
      \ getting all the powerful skills more difficult or impossible to get. I remember\
      \ there already being a skill shop in the beta so why they changed to this,\
      \ I have no idea\n- The feedback on player character's basic attack is really\
      \ lacking. It feels like you're slapping wet paper towel against a wall, no\
      \ matter which character you play.\n- Lacking visual feedback on some enemy\
      \ attacks and projectiles. I'm colourblind person and it was incredibly difficult\
      \ to see spikes coming out of the holes in Dark Mechanism fight. The gas cloud\
      \ on Warrior Spirit seemed to have a bit bigger damage radius than the visual\
      \ cloud indicated\n- No colourblind options\n- You can get stunlocked and since\
      \ there is no invulnerability frames, quickly killed. This seems to only be\
      \ problem with the NODE (being able to drive on you) and Dark Mechanism (it\
      \ can spin its cogs on you). Stunning mechanic didn't seem to be explained anywhere\
      \ either\n- For how simple the game is, the player UI is really complicated\
      \ and demands you to pay attention to different corners of the screen.\n- Really\
      \ ugly and unintuivite menus\n- No controller support\n- Leaderboard is listed\
      \ only in order of biggest points. Run time and character used is listed, but\
      \ you can sort by these. Number of hits taken not listed at all.\n- Some arenas\
      \ felt very uninspiring visually (Bermuda Devil, NODE) and flat without any\
      \ physical obstacles to make the levels special (NODE, Warrior Spirit, Immortal\
      \ Ringmaster)\n- The game lacks visual cohesion. The bosses, arenas and playable\
      \ characters mostly feel like they're from entirely different games\n\nPersonal\
      \ opinion: As the game is, I sadly can't recommend it at all. All the things\
      \ listed previously make the game frustrating and tedious to play rather than\
      \ fun. It hurts me to say this but I'd recommend saving your money and buying\
      \ a better game in the genre, Furi for example.\n\nI'd like to do nothing more\
      \ than to recommend the game (I enjoy boss rush games, the devs are from my\
      \ childhood locale that doesn't have enough game development and I knew one\
      \ of the devs at a time) but as the game is, I can't do that with good conscience.\
      \ I only hope they get better in their craft and have the chance to keep working\
      \ on the game or make their next game better."
