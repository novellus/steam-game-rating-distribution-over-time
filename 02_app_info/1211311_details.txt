It uses the standard 7.62x25mm Tokarev pistol ammunition. A high rate of fire combined with a very large magazine gives it an impressive amount of firepower, but takes a very experienced soldier to control.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tula Tokarev 33<\/h2>The TT-33 is a soviet semi-automatic pistol. As with most Russian designs it is simple to manufacture and easy to operate and maintain. It is a formidable weapon, with good penetration and effective range.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">RGD-33<\/h2>The standard Soviet hand grenade with a frag sleeve. Very easy to use. The RGD-33 fits nicely in right between the German stick grenades and the US Mk. II, both in how far they can be thrown and damage.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">t-20 Komsomolets<\/h2>The T-20 is a small and versatile tractor. Originally designed for towing artillery pieces, it is well liked and often used by infantry for transportation to the front line. It is lightly armored and armed with a light machine gun for protection.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">42WLA Lend Lease<\/h2>The 42WLA is an army motorcycle used for quick transportation of troops or scouting. The motorcycle can be used to get one or two soldiers behind enemy positions for a surprise attack or reconnaissance.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SU Medic Pouch<\/h2>A medic pouch is used by soldiers to carry a small supply of first aid kits intended to help wounded soldiers. The pouch can be resupplied at any medic crate on the battlefield.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Veteran Membership<\/h2>Progress faster and earn more Credits and Warfunds!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ribbon Boosters<\/h2>Ribbon Boosters will accelerate the progress on all your soldiers during combat.
