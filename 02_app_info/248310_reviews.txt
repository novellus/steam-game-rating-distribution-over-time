Its a mix between sonic, and a beatem up. You can actually fight instead of just jumping on enemies, and its really cool, even having combo mechanics here and there. Each character feels unique in there own ways, having completely different play styles from one another. For example Lilac (the main character) has a more stream lined approach to the gameplay, having a more balanced move set, while Carol (her friend) is more based around quick movement and timing. The stage designs are actually fun, and has a pretty good difficulty balance during the entire game, which is something you don't really see in games now. Graphically this game looks amazing having super smooth sprite animations, and really nice, thematic and unique looking stages. Also the music is amazing. The story is a little bit up for some critism, being a little \"cringy\" at times, and has some sudden and oddly placed tone shifts here and there but other than that I personally really liked it. And if you don't like the story, there's not only options to skip the cutscenes, but an entire mode that dedicated to just the gameplay alone (classic mode), so I think the story is redeemable with any problems it had. Really, this game is awesome and incredibly fun. Can't wait for the sequel!","timestamp_created":1609861307,"timestamp_updated":1609861408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0PTN6fYCc/DdwAI="}
