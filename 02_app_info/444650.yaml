    detailed_description: "<h1>Development Progress</h1><p>Endciv is in the second\
      \ attempt of development during the Early Access phase, after many things did\
      \ not work out as intended both technically and on a game design aspect. Therefore\
      \ a complete re-development was initiated and everything was re-designed and\
      \ coded from scratch. We are now in a state to add more content to the game\
      \ with a more solid foundation.<br><br>The main purpose of this recent release\
      \ was to satisfy those who already own the game. Nobody is suggested to buy\
      \ the game right now, our main goal is Spring 2019 for the game to flourish\
      \ and to be playable for a wider audience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Building</h2>Construction\
      \ and city building aspects. The number and variation of buildings and objects\
      \ will be constantly increased during development and it will become more challenging\
      \ for you to build more advanced buildings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Economy</h2>The\
      \ economy of the game is our highest priority at the moment. This includes the\
      \ number of different goods and production facilities but also how trading and\
      \ resource management performs. We constantly improve and adjust balancing.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Combat</h2>Combat features are a low priority and will be\
      \ implemented once the economy and building features are more solidly implemented.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Immersion</h2>The last aspect describes the emotional and\
      \ ethical aspects of the game. We want to provide a grungy post-civilization\
      \ scenario and believable events in the game. This also describes how detailed\
      \ the game will be. The full potential of this aspect can only be achieved towards\
      \ the end of development.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\

    review: "Das spiel ist tot, ich war von Anfang an dabei und der Entwickler wollte\
      \ nie wirklich in die Early Access Phase und viele haben ihn drum gebeten.\n\
      \nUnd dort war es, ein paar wenige Updates brachten ein fast spielbares Spiel\
      \ hervor.\n\nJedoch nicht lange und der Dev gab aus Privaten Gr\xFCnden auf.\n\
