A truck and a Buggy...I mean come on? And worst part is...There is a EASY and HARD mode...Fine i started with the hard mode and discovered a very strange thing...Apparently The developers haven't heard that cars can actually turn...This shi t can't be for real!?...I was litterly going 5 kmh through corners and STILL i had to reverse the car and SQUEEZE the car though a corner and THEN hit the wall...My waterbottle have not flown so many times around my livingroom EVER!...I was *F*R*U*S*T*R*A*T*E*D* to the limit...I was finally through the HARD mode with the last of my sanity and saw to my horror i had to do the whole thing in EASY mode...EASY mode was really EASY mode for one f ucking reason...The cars could TURN!? So the developers has chosen that the different between HARD and EASY mode should be that the cars can't turn in HARD mode???....WTF!? I mean WTF!?!\nWith all this said...Yeah you can upgrade your 2 cars...Weapons, armor, nitro etc. but these things dosen't do jack for the game and it's funess (is that a word?)...This game stinks in every aspect and it's so boring...The 16 tracks is in the same place just add a few more corners and nothing else.\nPlease people...DO NOT BUY AT ANY PRICE...To be perfectly honest, do not gift the game to anyone and if it's gifted to you delete it from your inventory.\n\nMy Judgement: 1/10\n\nPeace out Peeps!\n","timestamp_created":1448409790,"timestamp_updated":1448409790,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629574835300445557","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4+78ndECfbu7SQ=="}
