Our protagonist, Alice Nanno, one day finds a mysterious book (aptly named \"The Witch's Love Diary\") that contains stories about herself and her friends that seemingly never happened in reality.\n\nI won't spoil it any further than that, but suffice to say that the mystery only grows more involved the more you go into the game. It's a fantastic and wild ride to uncover the truth behind the Witch's Love Diary and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a romance novel stirred with a mix of fantasy into it.\n\nThat said, there is one thing that stood out to me, so much so that I actually have to consider it a negative point against the game:\n\nThere are a [i]lot[/i] of sex scenes. Like, a LOT. Compared to most other VN's I've read where the sex is mostly isolated to the most important/climatic moments, The Witch's Love Diary has one, like, every 15-20 minutes of reading. This may make it either more or less interesting to you, but I found it detracted more than what it added and drew too much attention away from the story being told behind the scenes. It got to the point where I'd go \"oh come on, not [i]again[/i]\" because it was interrupting the flow of the story often at the most important moments.\n\nSpeaking of story, this VN is one of the ones that does that thing where it gives you the illusion of a branching story (there are several choices you can make throughout) but they all ultimately lead to the same endings, just in a different order. That's worth keeping in mind if you do decide to pick up the game; don't worry too much about which choices you make, it ultimately doesn't matter because you'll have to see all of the scenes regardless. I actually prefer the kinetic novel style more, so this works out for me (it may not for you).\n\nNow, in terms of playability, The Witch's Love Diary has more or less all the features you'd expect out of a modern VN: quicksave, quickload, skip, message log, CG/music/movie gallery, scene replay, the whole nine yards. Nothing really to complain about there.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a recommend. The price point is more or less average for this kind of VN, and it [i]is[/i] actually quite long, so I'd say it's worth it to pick it up at full price if it interests you.","timestamp_created":1609342099,"timestamp_updated":1609342099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44/OQ2vYCfYvnvgI="}
