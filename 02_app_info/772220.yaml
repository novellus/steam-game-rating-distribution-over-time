      solve all of them... Will you fight for the side of kittens or Poland? Fuzzy
      slippers better than hot dogs? Soda versus Bieber?? You shall fight, and the
      Arbiter shall judge. All results are final.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/772220/extras/ArbiterExplode.png?t=1528205309"
