It looks better, plays better, sounds better, shows more polish, offers more challenge, and was overall much more satisfying.\n\nThis game appears to be a broken copy of that exact game.\n\nRight away I was blasted with very loud and really annoying music. I went for the settings I n the corner of the screen and tried clicking it, but the settings button didn't work.\n\nNot a good sign.\n\nOut of the box it supports 21:9 ultrawide, which was great. The graphics were garish and bland. The background looked pixelated and not terribly attractive. The game lacks a certain visual polish overall that make it a bit hard on the eyes.\n\nI am not a fan of the music either, most of which just sounds busy, loud, and overall feels like a bad fit for this game.\n\nThe game is also quite short, which isn't a bad thing for those of you that don't enjoy padding in games, but this just feels bare-bones and could have made for some original ideas and challenges.\n\nThere is also a cheat (or design flaw): [spoiler]When you hit the ESC key to pause, you can still turn. This can be used when about to hit an obstacle, rendering any challenge nonexistent.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Native Ultrawide support\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Bugged options menu\n    [*]No controller support\n    [*]Visually uninteresting\n    [*]Uninspired audio\n    [*]Lacks challenge\n    [*]Copies a mobile game that's better\n[/list]\n\n[b]Verdict: 3/10[/b]\n\nLacks polish, challenge, and fun. Definitely not worth the asking price; probably not worth your time at all.","timestamp_created":1565196997,"timestamp_updated":1565196997,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.602888941764831543","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mNrAtuwCeKv1zwE="}
