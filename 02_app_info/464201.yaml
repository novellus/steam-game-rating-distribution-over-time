    about_the_game: A convergent missile cannon. Missiles launched from this weapon
      will separate in the air and rain down on the enemy's head. Their damage pattern
      isn't limited to a single target, but an entire area. Though exceptionally powerful,
      misuse of the homing feature when the enemy is too close can reduce its effect.
      Press and hold the attack button to display the sight, represented by a red
      square. When a target in range is captured within this sight, a positive lock
      will be established. A maximum of two enemies may be locked on at any given
      time. Release the attack button to unleash missiles, which will track the target
      or targets and explode on contact.

    review: 'Equip two on the same weapon set and you become a great Hector assassin.
      Or at least you will be until just before halfway through the game (on Normal).


      Pros:

      - Long range.

      - Respectable reload and lock-on timers, with no nead for aim-assist from an
      Air Raider.

      - Crazy high damage for such a low-level weapon. (Seriously, how is this thing
      only level 3?!)

      - Flies high up before tracking the target, making it easy to snipe enemies
      from behind buildings.


      Cons:

      - Completely useless in small spaces like the underground, or when standing
      under something solid.

      - Has no secondary functions (dash, jump, zoom, etc.).


      Highly recommended if you haven''t started finding level 10+ weapons yet.'
