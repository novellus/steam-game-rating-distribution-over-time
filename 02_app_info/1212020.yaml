      elements where every decision you make can drastically change the course of
      game''s story.<br>The first episode of the game is over, but our story is far
      from that. You can return to the world of &quot;Void''s Calling&quot; in the
      second episode, which is already under development. Forlan''s adventures will
      continue from the exact moment you said goodbye to him.<br><br><strong>Game
      features:</strong><br>- Non-linear storytelling; <br>- Your choices influence
      the story; <br>- Few endings; <br>- Open world;<br>- A number of parallel evolving
      story lines;<br>- Beautiful graphics;<br>- Interesting main story;<br>- Animated
      erotic scenes.<br><br>To be Pure isn''t always about having clean hands. If
      you decided to become a mage''s hunter, you''ll see all sorts of things, shitty
      and bloody things. You just can''t sit idle knowing that the high art that was
      prohibited by a royal edict can easily cause disturbance to the world''s harmony
      crafted by the Almighty and let Void enter our realm, can you?<br><br>Lone warriors,
      led by mysterious Call and who go under the name of The Pure Ones, travel around
      the continent, always looking for those who decided to violate the world''s
      harmony with the help of their &quot;wonderful&quot; gift. It doesn''t mean
      a thing whether they''re doing it out of selfish motives, simple curiosity or
      desire to help everyone.<br><br>A man or a woman, all the same. The punishment
      is inescapable. No mercy for no one! No mercy for no one! <br><br>Forlan is
      only 32 but he''s already seen a lot and it may seem like he''s up to anything
      the world can throw at him. However, at one point he stumbles upon a small town
      called Krazengoph while following the call of Void, that place turns out to
      be a real test to the hunter''s abilites since Void has already wormed its way
      into the citizens'' souls and poisons them, effect similar to post-mortem poison.
      <br><br>To find a sorcerer who broke the law in the town, citizens of which
      are slowly but steadily losing their minds and are falling into the cesspool
      of madness and lust, isn''t going to be an easy thing to do. Will the Pure One
      be able to cope with it alone or should he look for a help from one of the town''s
      citizens? Not matter what turn these events might take, there''s one thing to
      be sure of. Forlan will never be the same after visiting this town, Krazengoph...'

      notes: "Our game focuses primarily on story, but please note that the sexual\
        \ encounters between characters are graphic. The game has realistic combat\
        \ scenes (Medieval setting), so if you are a squeamish person, we highly recommend\
        \ that you do not play this game.\r\nThe game contains mature content, such\
        \ as sexual scenes and extreme violence. There may also be some elements of\
        \ sexual assault and non-consensual sex.\r\n"
