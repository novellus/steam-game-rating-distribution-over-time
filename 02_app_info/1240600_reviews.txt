After selecting a stage, you begin with a collection of scrambled tiles. When (correctly) assembled, they form an (animated) image. You are timed, and if you run out of time, you will lose a heart. If you lose all your hearts, it's game-over.\n\nThere are twenty-one stages and eleven pieces of art to put together.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThere is no story or character bios. Moving on.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe title screen is simple and clean, sporting a pixel aesthetic and animated bikini babe. She flaps her arms and eyes with ceaseless determination. In-game, the center of the screen is reserved for the puzzle, and the remainder for your time, hearts and pieces. For some bizarre reason, the developers didn't implement a means to disable sound.\n\n. . . so I had to mute the game via my Windows \"App Volume\" settings, just to keep rockin' to my jams.\n\nThe moment I saw this game, I thought that I had seen the assets before. There's another game I played, with [i]strikingly[/i] similar sprites, mechanics and overall user interface. The game in question has been removed from the Steam Store, so I can't provide a link. But I'm suspecting an asset flip.\n\n[b]- The Goods -[/b]\nThe artwork looks decent, but I was not [i]super[/i] impressed with the animations. As a pixel artist (myself), a lot of the girls use the same base, which becomes clear when compared side-by-side. The animations seemed to imply that the girls were made of jelly, and lacked bones. As there is no gallery, you have to re-solve puzzles anytime you want to review an image. You can't fullscreen puzzles that you have solved.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nAs this title lacks [i]the most basic[/i] of features you'd expect in a jigsaw puzzle (from a gallery to turning off sound), I'm going to give this game a [i]thumbs down.[/i] Unless you specifically [i]need[/i] a pixel aesthetic, I would look elsewhere for your jigsaw fix.\n\n[h1]Support the Wombat[/h1]\nIf you enjoy my reviews, please follow my Curator page.
