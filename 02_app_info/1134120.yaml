    about_the_game: "So, you like chipped teeth more than chip shots. Alley gangs\
      \ more than alley-oops. And in your most honest moments, you gotta admit that\
      \ football is just a little boring.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWake up and smell the\
      \ blood. Spectrum HoloByte proudly throws the first punch in the Brutal Sports\
      \ Series, a new line of futuristic sports simulations created by Millenium.\
      \ Introducing Beastball, a rowdy ride through the football of tomorrow. Eight\
      \ teams of man-made mutants, each with their own skills, duke it out for the\
      \ league title and the Beastball Championship. Pit your favorite team against\
      \ a human or computer opponent in the arena. And when the door slams shut, heads\
      \ are gonna roll. Literally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's 2089, and a strip of dirt\
      \ in a pit is home to the game, a fast sport guaranteed to churn the blood.\
      \ Superb animations and sounds capture all the hits of slambang comedy. And\
      \ they're really slambang. Stomp the other guy? You catch a cannonball. Try\
      \ to run out of bounds? You suck wall. Leap high for a kick and you get skewered.\
      \ The object: put the ball in the goal. How you do it is up to you.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nBeastball. Football with a new set of rules. No rules.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\n* One or two players.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* League or Championship play.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n* Special weapons and skills for each team.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \n* Combatant regenerator after each match.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Laughs. Blood."
