    review: "I can't believe how few reviews there are for this. To make matters worse,\
      \ only one has watched the whole season.  Outcast is one of the best shows I've\
      \ seen in years.\n\nAn amazing cast, great acting, excellent SFX, and a well\
      \ executed plot all make this worth your time.  The pilot episode is free, so\
      \ why not check it out?  I did out of curiosity and was hooked.  Now I'm watching\
      \ for a second time with the GF and still thoroughly entertained.  This is definitely\
      \ the surprise gem that I'll be recommending to all my movie buff friends. \
      \ \n\nOn sale or not, it's worth the money!"
