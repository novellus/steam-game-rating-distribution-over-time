    review: "This is an incredibly cute game. Cute characters and cute writing. I\
      \ just wanna make the clouds happy.  \n\nGame play wise, your objective is to\
      \ get a direct line of sight on the enemies in each room, or indirectly by using\
      \ the newly happy units to make others happy. The units move like chess pieces,\
      \ and there are walls and other barriers that prevent movement and line of sight.\
      \ The caveat is that you only have a certain amount of turns per level to find\
      \ a key and defeat the boss. This means that the strategy comes from trying\
      \ to use as few turns as possible to complete each room. This to me makes it\
      \ feel kind of similar to match 3 games. You are trying to set up combos so\
      \ you dont waste time moving things around individually. I think its pretty\
      \ unique and fun. \n\nIt is an Early Access game and I ran into a couple of\
      \ issues. My game did crash once, but loaded up right at the turn I left off\
      \ at. However I did have a room, when using the diagonally moving character,\
      \ was unable to move away from the door because of an indestructible object\
      \ and impassable object in both of the possible movement directions. This meant\
      \ that I lost the run unfortunately. \n\nIt is a rougelike so each run is a\
      \ random level layout, and each room is pretty random. The roguelike elements\
      \ are well done. The playable characters are unique, and the trinkets you can\
      \ collect can impact your playstyle or make the game a tad easier. I do think\
      \ it could use more variety of trinkets and such, but is fine as is. \n\nIn\
      \ terms of challenge, I think its fair. I managed to beat the only two levels\
      \ currently in the game in roughly an hour; with a bit of luck of course. However\
      \ there are two other unlockable characters which require clearing 100% of each\
      \ level. After spending a few hours on it I have been unable to accomplish this.\
      \ Because of the highly random layout of each room, using only a few turns per\
      \ room for so long seems impossible. A couple rooms have an obvious 1 turn solution,\
      \ and others take at least 6 because you can only immediately \"attack\" one\
      \ enemy or future enemy. I think each room could stand to have either less enemies\
      \ or walls, because having 8 different things barricaded in a corner is frustrating\
      \ and feels like I had no chance. If the room doesn't allow for an ok start,\
      \ things get out of hand quickly. \n\nAs a personal preference, I find for a\
      \ game about spreading happiness, the monochromatic art style makes it feel\
      \ pretty lifeless, and gets to be a bore to look at after a while. I think the\
      \ game could benefit from some more color. \n\nOverall I recommend the game\
      \ if you are into puzzle games and roguelikes. I look forward to what will come\
      \ from Early Access development."
