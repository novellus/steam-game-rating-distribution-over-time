The only regret is that, having created a fully functional version 1.0 of the game, the developer(s) up and disappeared and we hope that they did not literally get hit by a truck or something.  Maybe there's been no activity precisely because nobody wrote a review!  Well, it's getting one now.","timestamp_created":1606451834,"timestamp_updated":1606451834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwybX/g/YCe6qYswI="}
