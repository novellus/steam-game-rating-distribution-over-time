    review: 'A nice game. I played on linux, and enjoyed it. Five chapter, that you
      have to go through begin to end (since there are no checkpoint saves). The story
      is ok, the journal logs unfold the story as the player proceeds through the
      chapters. The audio/music compartment is minimal, but the space ship atmosphere
      is preserved. I enjoyed the the fact that someone on the ship used to listen
      for classical music...Was tha Mozart? Boh.. The game is not very long I think
      one can finish it in about 3.5-4 h. My rating: 7/10, go play it.'
