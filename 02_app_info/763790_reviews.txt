Then I saw this for PCVR recently and it says it allows you to enter the train even though I couldn't find anything in the video or internet that shows it. Anyway, I decided to give it a shot since it was on sale too. Wow, it's true you can enter the trains and it's made the app 100 times better! Hope the dev update it for PSVR owners too so, they can enjoy this amazing function, which changes the game completely to another level. Another great idea is if the dev allowed you to import own 3D models (even allowing text input would be amazing - since this is a creative app for people who like creation), that'll be cool, even a workshop maybe, since it has some Google Poly stuff (but shutting down 30 Jun 2021 though).\nI have 'Rolling line' and that's a cool app for mods and stuff, but the learning curve is much steeper and complex I find. This one is so much simpler and easier to just pick up and play/create! Highly recommend for people who likes to create & play! üëæüßêüëç","timestamp_created":1609953784,"timestamp_updated":1609953784,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjKau7PYCd6GHwQI="}
