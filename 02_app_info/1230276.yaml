    review: 'This is another superior creation by Jonathan Lewis of Milepost Simulations.
      I am particularly impressed with the forestry. I see a significant improvement
      in the trees over his previous release of the Peace River Region. The scenarios
      are very enjoyable.


      That being said, I must concur with some previous reviews of this route in that
      the route could do with some more "eye candy." Scenery objects are rather sparse
      relative to the FOV of the camera angles.


      All in all, I could see this becoming one of my favourite routes and I have
      no reservation about recommending this route to others.'
