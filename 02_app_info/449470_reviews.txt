Click where you want to go and your man will walk there. \nBattles auto engage when your character and the MOB meet. \nThile this game is somewhat limited as to what you can actually do, it does scratch that nostalgic itch.\n\nGraphics are 16 bit-ish soundtrack is MIDI-ish. The in game music tends to get on ones nerves after a while ( I turned it off)I didn't find any bugs and the game works smooth. If you're looking for a simple time killer that reminds you of the good old days, this isn't bad.  If you're looking for more... Not going to find it here.\n\nOverall rating 5/10 based on repetitive simplicity but I would recommend to that that want to re-live their childhood.","timestamp_created":1525389492,"timestamp_updated":1536686002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9fHn5OUCd7PMnwE="}
