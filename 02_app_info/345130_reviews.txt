That's why you see a lot of \"bruh dis gaem doeznt support 1920x1080\".\n\nThe game didn't come out in 2015, it came out before Team Fortress 2 was halfway done in development. This game was also present on the WildTangent launcher for those of us old enough to remember what that even is. Back then computers weren't that great, but this game was pretty damn cool for my super low-spec PC. Naturally it can't compete with more modern stuff like Nova Cluster or Beat Hazard, but anyone telling you it's a ripoff hasn't done any research or has ZERO prior background knowledge of this game.\n\nTL;DR: Game is older than the \"release date\", that's when it was added to Steam. VERY old game lacking \"modern\" specs.\n\nGet it for the nostalgia, for those of you that know the old WildTangent games launcher.","timestamp_created":1609929206,"timestamp_updated":1609929206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj8XQ6/YCeKT7wAI="}
