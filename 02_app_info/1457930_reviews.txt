Good gameplay, okay graphics, and zombie gib. I have some suggestions to the developer(s). \n\nGRAPHICS:\n-Adjust reload animations.\n-Please add on to the maps, these are good looking maps with not very much in them.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n-Add an interesting mechanic so it sticks out from other zombie shooters. You're on a good path with the gun unlocking system, its just that there are also other shooters that have this feature. Some features like perks or attachments. I don't see many zombie shooters with perks or attachments. Sliding would be nice as well. \n-Remove the camera shake when shooting. I would really love to see the dismemberment and heads exploding.\n\nZOMBIES:\n-Polish zombie models. While they work, I just want something to spice them up. \n-Make different looking zombies. Adding a variety of zombie models can help replace the usual gray zombie.\n-This is optional, but making different types of zombies that do different things. Like I said, this is optional. I'm pretty happy with the zombies that are already in game.\n\nLike I said in my review; this game has SOOO MUCH potential, and there is effort there. You are genuinely invested in developing this game. \n\nIn this current stage of the game, I rate it a solid 7.5/10.","timestamp_created":1610117654,"timestamp_updated":1610117654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw37Sf8fYCdqXHwQI="}
