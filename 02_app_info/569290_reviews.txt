For a metroidvania style game, the artwork and fighting weren't to bad at all. However, It really isn't all that deep. Not a whole lot of customization or techniques to get into.  I was expecting a lot more than there was. The storyline also was not very deep and the translations shoddy at times. \n\nIf you really, really like metroidvanias, Id say give it a go but don't expect a lot. There were definitely things that could be changed or added to the game to make it a lot better.","timestamp_created":1608764929,"timestamp_updated":1608764929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vpb3yPYCcqjOvAI="}
