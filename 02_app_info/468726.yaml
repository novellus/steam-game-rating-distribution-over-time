    review: 'One of my all time favorite tabletop games. I own quite a few of the
      various seasons and expansions in real life but for $10 I didn''t mind picking
      this up to play online.


      I use this game to introduce my friends into tabletop who aren''t into board
      games but like video games. I usually describe it as L4D in tabletop form and
      it sells it to them and they all have enjoyed it so far. Definitely make sure
      you''re familiar with the rules though to ease them into it!


      I do wish there was more content but luckily the workshop has just about everything
      and great scripting too.'
