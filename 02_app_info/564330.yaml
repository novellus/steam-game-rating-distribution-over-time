    review: 'I love tower defence games, and this is one of my favorites. I like being
      able to grab a gun and help my defences. I like the unique guns  and towers.


      I don''t like that the game isn''t finished yet. I''m hoping they add an endless
      mode where the waves get tougher and tougher until you fail. I''d also like
      to see a leader board that kept track of  my top scores for each map. Of course
      we need to see more maps as well. Right now there are only 4. I''d like to be
      able to reset the game so others can play it from the start without the benifit
      of already won upgrades.'
