    review: "[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38384881/]A Bird's Eye View\
      \ Curator \U0001F99C[/url]\n\n[h1]Introduction[/h1]\nDjilyaro is a walking simulator\
      \ in which you collect objects that make the world surrounding you get more\
      \ trippy and psychedelic every time you pick up an object.\n\n[h1]Visuals and\
      \ Mechanics[/h1]\nIt's as simple as it sounds. The visuals are flat and boring\
      \ and when you pick something up they get a metallic sheen or rainbow effect.\
      \ The mechanics are literally walk, look around and interact.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\
      The gameplay of Djilyaro is immediately as boring as it sounds. You walk slowly\
      \ through a badly textured world until you find collectibles that make the world\
      \ trippy. Admittedly and a definite unintentional analogy for real life, everything\
      \ gets so trippy that it's hard finding the normal among the insane. Then, after\
      \ being surprised out of nowhere by a flashy object and a loud jump-scare scream\
      \ you get send to a vast and empty city I couldn't find anything to do in that\
      \ had very ominous music I was on edge for the rest of that 'attempt'. Which\
      \ eventually lead to me going back to the menu to reset the game and again more\
      \ of the flashy dudes showed up. My only guess is that Djilyaro has the intention\
      \ to be a Slender-like game where you pick up collectibles and don't get caught\
      \ but the flashy things always hunt you down and move faster than you can making\
      \ this a guess without a definite answer and that getting caught just sends\
      \ you to time-wasting limbo.\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\nThe soundtrack, as far\
      \ as it's there did make at least an impact on me, but for the wrong reasons.\
      \ After a jump-scare then getting ominous music obviously puts you on edge,\
      \ but the area you are sent to is just emptiness making it unease without reason\
      \ unlike fridge horror.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nSo in conclusion, I would personally\
      \ not recommend Djilyaro, I kid you not however when I say that the weirdness\
      \ of this game does set a poignant tone of unease and 'mood' but at the speed\
      \ you walk and the vastness without guidance of this game and just how unfair\
      \ it is. Djilyaro couldn't keep my attention and as there is no saving or no\
      \ real explanation of an objective, you have to do whatever it is you do in\
      \ one go so I personally wouldn't recommend this game. It is however very cheap\
      \ so do give it a look for yourself!\n\n[h1]Associated Media[/h1]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2341864621"
