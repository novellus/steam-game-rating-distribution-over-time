After some deliberation, I decided to get it. Credit goes to my husband, who encouraged me!\n\nThis soundtrack has been one of my go-to's whenever I wanted something relaxing but not [i]too relaxing[/i]â€”something lively enough to keep me alert while I'm deep reading. \n\nMy only criticism would be the track lengths: I think they're too short. Considering the price though, I wouldn't expect them to dole out 4-minute long tracks. I just would've preferred them to be longer for listening outside the game. \n\nGreat job to Raphael Benjamin Meyer and the rest of the team! I look forward to listening to the other soundtracks!","timestamp_created":1598815533,"timestamp_updated":1598815533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530812323093414307","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/J61oPQCePLmngI="}
