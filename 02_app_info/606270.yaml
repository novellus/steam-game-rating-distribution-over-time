      \ reality, either against the computer AI, or against a friend on the same computer\
      \ (using desktop screen and mouse). There are 3 AI settings to choose from and\
      \ the chess board measures 1.5m x 1.5m.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game can be played\
      \ both room scale and seated. To play the game room scale, just place your controller\
      \ on the piece you wish to move and then pull the trigger whilst lifting the\
      \ piece up. Then place it over a valid square and let go of the trigger, when\
      \ that square has turned green. To play it seated, you can simply hold the 'Point'\
      \ button down and then aim at the piece you wish to select, before pulling the\
      \ trigger. If playing against a friend on the same computer, then they will\
      \ need to use the desktop screen and mouse. They can then play by first clicking\
      \ on the desired piece and then clicking on the valid square they wish to move\
      \ to."

    review: "I bought this game because it's hilarious watching the dude in the tux\
      \ move his pieces inhumanly fast. \n\nOh, and it's a perfectly functional chess/checker\
      \ game too. Best $2 I've ever spent."
