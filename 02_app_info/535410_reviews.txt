Not that I expected a AAA RTS, and for the 1$ sale I got, its OK for an hr.  It looks like most of the positive reviews were from EA based on potential and the great progress the responsive dev was making.\n\nPros:\n- tactical VR space fleet\n- decently crisp gfx and visually differentiated unit types\n- good unit variety with different weapon systems and purposes\n- campaign, skirmish w/ bots, multiplayer (if you can find someone else playing)\n- minimap\n\nCons:\n- no plot at all\n- no objectives beyond kill or be killed\n- no actual RTS elements, looks like these were planned but dropped\n-- no resourcing, no mission to mission state, no research/upgrades/promotions, no unit building facilities, etc\n- in practice, it's more tactical than strategic\n-- each mission starts with some credits to buy a small fleet with and you earn somewhat more credits during the mission\n-- each mission starts fresh with 2 fighter squads and mission specific amount of credits (no fleet progression or mission specific setups)\n-- \"campaign\" is 8 or 10 missions that introduce more ship types and larger battles\n-- finished \"campaign\" in half an hour, most the missions I just purchased a few units and watched without directing much\n- controls are clunky and should have been more gestured based (like Tethered) rather than button based and/or some sort of in game HUD\n-- selecting units (beyond 1 or all) was really hard\n-- no pause/slow (strikecraft are always moving)\n-- no ability to select by unit type (anti-strikecraft, anti-frigate/cap)\n- no stats listed for the ship types","timestamp_created":1546672755,"timestamp_updated":1546672755,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k6q4jugCctTFtwE="}
