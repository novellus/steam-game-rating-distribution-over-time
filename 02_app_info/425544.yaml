      \ or oppose the kingdom. After many centuries, peace finally rules in the realm.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nBut the Lionhearts are forged for battle, so after many years\
      \ peace eventually grew boring. That's when they heard about the Awesomenauts,\
      \ a band of mercenaries embroiled in perpetual war, and set off to a land far\
      \ far away to once-again fight side by side.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC contains\
