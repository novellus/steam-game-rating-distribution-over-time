    review: "Just no... Don't buy this game... I do recommend it for @Tryyton who\
      \ likes derpy games for his channel at twitch.tv/tryyton but for me, I just\
      \ don't have the patience for a game of this caliber.\n\nLike it has good intentions,\
      \ with it's hunger/thirst/stamina/fatique, crafting,  etc... I found fruit,\
      \ was hungry, ate it, didn't change the values however, still hungry. And you\
      \ have to press R for basic crafting and B for advanced crafting... \n\nI recued\
      \ this lady from a hut for example: https://clips.twitch.tv/HappyGracefulMeatloafAliens\n\
      \nMy character feels way too small, running could be faster and jumping should\
      \ be higher. Maybe an option too, to turn of the footsteps sounds? https://clips.twitch.tv/GrotesqueGrossCheeseTBTacoRight\n\
      \nI wasn't hungry, there was no monster behind me, my health was 100% and suddenly\
      \ this happens: https://clips.twitch.tv/CarelessKitschyBurritoDAESuppy Just\
      \ random, just like that. No explanations... \n\nThe idea might be good, but\
      \ the execution of making a game from it is bad. Maybe another DEV sees this\
      \ game and thinks, let's collaberate and make a decent game from this. I just\
      \ do not recommend this game. \n\nHowever, I do like the idea behind it, the\
      \ setting of a prehistorical world, the goal of the game. But for recommendation,\
      \ no points. Sorry.\n\n\n"
