I do think this game would benefit from voice over the intro and ending, even a cut scene that is drawn out if you can't do animation.  Have the radio play more than one song, or at the end do credits with that song that can be played on the radio.  overall worth $10. I did get this at halloween on sale though. Some issues with being able to see through wall but otherwise this is a good puzzle game.","timestamp_created":1604884057,"timestamp_updated":1604884057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uumi1fUCcKWhrQI="}
