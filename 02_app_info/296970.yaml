    reviews: "\u201CIt's genuinely great, like, it's one of my favorite games this\
      \ year so far. It's got so much going for it, so much depth, so much character,\
      \ so much replayability, great systems, unique concepts in combat, awesome presentation...\u201D\

      \ rel=\"noreferrer\"  >TotalBiscuit, The Cynical Brit</a><br><br>\u201CHere\u2019\
      s where I start to love Renowned Explorers. The encounters aren\u2019t just\
      \ a paper/rock/scissors system of aggressive, friendly, or devious. The more\
      \ pertinent choice is whether you\u2019re going to talk or fight. Either approach\
      \ has distinct rules, with some characters suited to one or the other.\u201D\

      ...Renowned Explorers still stands as one of the best surprises of the year\
      \ so far that wannabe adventurers of any age can enjoy. Encountering some thugs\
      \ but instead of fighting, it just turns into one great big insult throwing\
      \ contest where the loser runs away, foaming at the mouth. Brilliant.\u201D\

    review: "A great game with a lot of cool game mechanics!\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2351999225\n\
      \nSo, I was seeing this game for years, but didn't buy it duo unpleasant visuals.\
      \ Finally I bnought it this holidays because wanted something with good strategy\
      \ elements.\n\nI started playing and... was bored duo endless tutorials. Read\
      \ about that, great, now do that, wonderful, read this. Bla bla bla..\nAlso,\
      \ I am not of fun of such nonsense setting. (you can damage there with insults\
      \ and kisses), so... tried to do something, clicked different buttons and forced\
      \ myself to play. Wanted to close the game, but....\nAfter I completed the first\
      \ expedition and I got myself into World Map, I have started to look for different\
      \ things. I realized the game is huge and has a lot of deep mechanics. So, I\
      \ started to play it again... then again... then again. Until I got a great\
      \ crew. I think the strategy how to train the, and passed it with a high score.\
      \ \n\nAfter that I bought DLC and started again.\nThe game is great. Check for\
      \ Pros below tp prove my words.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2351999293\n\
      Pros\n- Unusal turn-based combat. You can with with not killing enemies but\
      \ speaking wit them and making them friendly. There are 3 types of damage type:\
      \ aggressive, friendly and deviate. There is usual rock-paper mechanics but\
      \ with these mechanics. Be aggressive against friendly and be deviate against\
      \ aggressive.\n- 20 characters of 4 classes with slightly different abilities\
      \ and basic perks. Each character has unique perk if used as a captain. You\
      \ can take 3 in the battle. So, basically, each walkthrough with new men is\
      \ different from previous\n- Interesting adventure mode. You explore a location\
      \ and get resources. Most of events start a combat battle or a text quest. Your\
      \ explorers should have perks to pass these quests. So, you need to make perfect\
      \ teams and level up certain perks to be successed.\n- There are 5 expeditions\
      \ before the game ends. Beetween expeditions you can make researchs, buy items,\
      \ earn extra resources with jobs, hire people (gives extra perks). This part\
      \ os the game is really fun\n- There are 5 difficulties in expedition. Each\
      \ difficulty has 3 different locations.. This and points above make the game\
      \ EXTREMELY replayable and fun.\n- 2 DLCs which adds even more stuff and mechanaics.\
      \ The game gets funnier\n- Community makes weekly challenges. The community\
      \ is still alive.\n- Funny setting of the game. Not serious, but fun and hilarious.\n\
      \nCons\n- Boring tutorial with too much of text blocks. I was very close to\
      \ close this game and forced myself to play a little more. it got interesting\
      \ after I appeared in the World Map.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2351999338\n\
      [h1]Resume[/h1]\nAt first glance I found this game confusing, but after I completed\
      \ a first expedition, I started new game again and again until I finished it\
      \ with a great score on Iron-Man modification. The game is nice. It is really\
      \ fun to learn mechanics and thinking about your the best team, planning perks\
      \ and etc. Also, the game has incredible replayability.  Two DLCs adds even\
      \ more replayability. There is a lot of achievements. It is fun to play this\
      \ game with small sessions with long time between them. The game has good combat\
      \ and extremely satisfying talking/RPG elements. It is very fun to collect stuff\
      \ and planning your crew after each expedition. Overall, I recommend this game\
      \ for a full price for all strategy fans."
