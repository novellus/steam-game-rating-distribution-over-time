      \ /><br><br><br>The story of Samphi is about re-living memories of a failing\
      \ relationship in a last-ditch attempt to understand and save it. All memories\
      \ will take place in randomly generated sandbox areas, giving you freedom over\
      \ how they play. Instead of just carting the player from A to B with fixed dialog,\
      \ I want you to be able to create your own worlds, play how you want, and ultimately\
      \ have your own experience. Also, with the addition of RPG features such as\
      \ character progression, skills, and pets, I hope to really immerse the player\
      \ into the world they create.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341270/extras/boy_and_girl.png?t=1500193517\"\

      \ to survive, and hone them to master the world around you. The goal isn\u2019\

    review: To keep it short and to the point, this game is dead and is no longer
      being developed. The developer has been honest about that which is nice but
      I very much recommend against buying this game as there is very little here;
      it's basically a Terraria/Starbound clone with a tiny fraction of the content
      and nothing new to offer.
