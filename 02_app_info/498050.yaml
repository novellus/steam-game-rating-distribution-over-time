    review: "Here's a news flash for you upcoming developers...\n\n[h1]'Never connect\
      \ the game's ending to the easiest puzzle in the game!!!'[/h1]\n\nOr you will\
      \ get something like this happen...\n\n* Starts game. \n\n* Gets told about\
      \ a mystery involving disappearing children at an orphanage that needs to be\
      \ solved.\n\n* Opens front door. Enters room.\n\n* Can\u2019t be bothered with\
      \ first room. See's corridor. Walks into room on right.\n\n* See's Puzzle. Solves\
      \ puzzle.\n\n* Mystery Solved. The End.\n\nI was honestly so shocked that my\
      \ bottom jaw hit the ground real hard. Completely bamboozled I just had to look\
      \ in the discussion boards to see if others had experienced this too. Yep, I\
      \ was not the only one, others found it out just as quickly.  On the other hand\
      \ some had walked around for about an hour before realising that they could\
      \ have just solved the puzzle at the beginning by themselves. I had bypassed\
      \ the whole game within 6 minutes max.\n\nThe clueless Mexican developers http://www.ensenasoft.com/\
      \ should have known better. On what grounds they claim this is worth $5.00 is\
      \ beyond me? If you want your monies worth I strongly suggest that you don't\
      \ try to solve puzzles in this puzzle game or you could come across the ending\
      \ quicker than you had hoped.\n\nIn fact the whole game from top to bottom seemed\
      \ to be just a bare boned framework of a game. The puzzles are all easy, half\
      \ I solved without even needing any clues whatsoever. There is hardly anything\
      \ to click on in each room other than the puzzles, practically nothing to read\
      \ story wise which is a complete shame because with the nice visuals and each\
      \ room having its own unique twisted feel to it, a morbid full expose on the\
      \ child experiments conducted would have beckoned my curiosity more. \n\nInstead\
      \ you\u2019re just treated to a room with a dentist chair, a crane overhead\
      \ with a hook and an abandoned assault rifle and the gasp expression of your\
      \ main character when he declares you found the torture room. I'm not sure why\
      \ your main character, who looks like 'Harry Potter' having an allergic reaction\
      \ to a bee sting, finds this all too shocking.  I'm pretty sure that assault\
      \ rifles and overhead cranes are just normal tools of the trade for Russian\
      \ dentists.\n\nAnyway, in final, an overly simple point and click adventure\
      \ puzzle game that could be over within six minutes if you\u2019re too ambitious\
      \ in puzzle solving. The real mystery of Rivenhallows is not about why the principal\
      \ is doing work experience dentistry on the side, but more why on Earth is this\
      \ marketed more than 50 cents? \n\nBelow the complete game by me... \nhttps://youtu.be/x3TXpkkfWnY\n\
      Now for all the things I bypassed...\nhttps://youtu.be/dzL3xAwaIwo\n\nIf you\
      \ enjoyed reading this review feel free to subscribe to my curator page. Thanks...\n\
