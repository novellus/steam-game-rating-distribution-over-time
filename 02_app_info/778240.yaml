    review: 'The game very much feels like its in EA. Lots and lots of rough edges.


      The guns feel odd, sort of spacey knock offs of the typical military load out.


      Reloading is a pain, if you have anything left in your clip you need to throw
      it out and put in a new one - which sounds fine, but then you randomly grab
      your swipe card instead of your ammo.


      Picking up items is a pain, ammo clip into corpses and scenery. And you randomly
      grab your swipe card, or pistol (if you have another weapon in your hand).


      Killing enemies is a pain. They sometimes fire thru objects, they sometimes
      fire at you when you are well tucked out of the way - that bit is fine, its
      just you get a 1 second slow down effect every time a bullet comes at you, even
      if you are in zero danger and the bullet is in another room.


      The bottom line is, the game feels like it has a lot of work needed. It recently
      got a huge price drop, so I gave it a try, and I was finding it a bit annoying,
      but OKAY for the money up til a certain point. Mild spoiler [spoiler]You find
      yourself in a cave level getting teleported into the middle of a bunch of mobs,
      a bit like old school quake on a really high difficulty, and the things I mentioned
      (and more) which are a "pain" get upgraded to outright "frustrating" [/spoiler]'
