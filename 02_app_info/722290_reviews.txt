It's missing a sense of purpose. They threw in too many mechanics that make it difficult for the player to enjoy playing. The principal hiking mechanic is more frustrating than fun. None of the tools you have to use are helpful. The grapple is neat when it works, but aiming it is impossible.\n\nIs HikeJam a silly physics party game or a meaningful game with competitive hiking? I can't tell you!\n\nKeep in mind this is a multiplayer game, and there's no one playing online. The bots are idiotic AND too good at the game. On the simple levels, they'll destroy you, and on the weird levels, they can't figure it out.\n\nPlease do not buy it.","timestamp_created":1577741655,"timestamp_updated":1577741655,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553718984127044678","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4veOurO8Cfpy96AE="}
