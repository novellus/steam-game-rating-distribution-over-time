    review: 'Eh, not the worst (or best? idk) thing I''ve originally seen locked behind
      preorders and then released to the general public. Master level is fine in this
      DLC, everything else is just... meh.


      Battlemode was honestly a forgettable experience for me so this DLC aside from
      maybe the shotgun is entirely meaningless to me.


      Do what you want, buy it or not for the doots or the nostalgia vibe, at least
      you don''t gain unfair advantages like with Chinese/Korean free-to-play-but-has-microtransactions-up-the-ass.


      I am saying no to this DLC simply because the Doot Revenant is a tired, overdone
      meme, bundled with a bland, generic and really uninspiring shotgun skin with
      the only reason I myself would buy the Deluxe edition or this DLC is for the
      master level (and The Ancient Gods DLC if Deluxe edition), that''s it.'
