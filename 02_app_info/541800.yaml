    about_the_game: "The Thumper Soundtrack with music by Brian Gibson. Ten tracks\
      \ in both MP3 (320kbps) and FLAC formats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CAs spartan\
      \ and laser-focused as Lightning Bolt\u2019s music.\u201D - FACT<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nBrian Gibson, co-creator of Thumper and bassist for the ballistic duo\
      \ Lightning Bolt, makes his solo debut with the Thumper OST, approaching the\
      \ rhythmic violence his music is known for with a propensity for tense, electronic\
      \ thrusts, pulsing synth swells, and symphonic bursts. Drawing from music originally\
      \ created for the game that Gibson created the art and music for, the album\
      \ takes the listener on a trek through trans-dimensional journey where the brutality\
      \ of the music\u2019s momentum is equally entrancing. Despite the presence of\
      \ lush, even soothing tones, the tensions that blossom from each track overwhelm\
      \ the senses to invigorating effect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKnowing that the soundtrack\
      \ for the game was originally developed as generative, based on the player\u2019\
      s gameplay, it is easy to see how the music developed to be so immersive and\
      \ varied in texture. Every piece on Thumper dictates a new terrain, each as\
      \ otherworldly as the next: drifting through ethereal canyons, gleaming over\
      \ laser infested space, and plummeting into craggy bombasts of meteorite alike.\
      \ Rhythm here reigns king, although in contrast to the break-neck stylings of\
      \ Lightning Bolt, Gibson applies a steadier throb that remains as propulsive.\
      \ Similar to Gibson\u2019s ability to create a multitude of drastically varied\
      \ tones with his bass and effects pedals, the music of Thumper finds a tapestry\
      \ of orchestrated instruments \u2013 brass, strings, and swaths of percussion\
      \ instruments \u2013 applied with masterful skill."
