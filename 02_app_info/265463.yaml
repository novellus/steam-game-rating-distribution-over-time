    review: I am very disappointed to find a spelling mistake in the iconset, gaurd?
      really? Also you cannot mix the terrain for water for instance if you make a
      pool with sand around it and then put sand terrain around the pool, there will
      be a ring of grass. Other than that you get lots of content. Ill change my review
      when the dev fixes these problems.
