    review: 'On 4 June 2019, the "developer" of this game illegally revoked thousands
      of keys he sold for it on other sites, harming all Steam users who paid for
      those keys or received them as gifts.


      Valve needs to make it harder for developers to simply revoke keys at will like
      this. In most jurisdictions, according to consumer defense laws, Valve would
      also be considered legally responsible in these cases, since it is their Steam
      platform that allows the generation of those keys and their revocation.


      UNTIL PEOPLE START MASS REPORTING THESE CASES FOR FRAUD OR LEGAL VIOLATION,
      VALVE WON''T DO ANYTHING. SO PLEASE GO TO THE GAME''S STORE PAGE, CLICK ON THE
      FLAG ICON AND REPORT IT.


      Also, report the developer''s profile for scam and blacklist all his games by
      clicking the IGNORE button on their store pages so he won''t see a cent from
      any of us again.


      I had to buy this abomination of a game AGAIN to be able to write this review.


      Finally, under no circumstances send emails to this "developer" asking for new
      keys. Not only is the "game" not worth it, but also an individual who scams
      their player base like this cannot be trusted with any of your personal info.'
