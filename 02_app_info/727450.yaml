    review: this game offers a very unique perspective of music and how it will save
      the planet from aliens invasion, using different kinds of music tracks that
      i instantly fell in love with, yet the game seams to be lacking a small tweaks
      for it to be an everlasting experience that you can never get enough of, i don't
      know what it is exactly, but its definitely in the right direction
