    review: 'This map is big, much bigger than any of the other scenarios.  There
      are three cities on the same map, so you have a lot of distance to cover.  This
      leads to a lot of building and planning.  If you''ve completed all the other
      scenarios on normal difficulty, this won''t be too taxing.  Have not yet tried
      on expert difficulty, which should ramp up the challenge significantly.


      The developer has obviously put a lot of effort into this game.  The big map
      is both fun and visually rewarding.  It feels more like a miniature world, whereas
      the previous ones felt more like one small city.  Also nice to see some new
      buildings, stations, car bridges and terrain.  Hard to find a better value at
      just a couple dollars.  You''ll reach that payback in the first 5 minutes of
      play.'
