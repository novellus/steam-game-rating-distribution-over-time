I was a big fan of those games, so I decided to see what aspects of conversing with an A.I. Em-A-Li explored.\n\nUnfortunately, Em-A-Li is first and foremost a horror game, and any exploration of ideas seemed to me like a distant second priority. While it's possible that a potential player might ruminate on the events of the story, it seemed to me that the developer's foremost intent is the frighten. Therefore, I can't say I really enjoyed my time with the game. \n\nThat being said, developer Yobob did an excellent job setting an ominous mood using only the RPGMaker toolset. The game is bug-free and competently made.","timestamp_created":1593398070,"timestamp_updated":1593398070,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr6H7/vICfNKakQI="}
