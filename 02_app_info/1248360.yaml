    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Important:</h2>When using the WalkinVR for\
      \ the first time, it MUST be started from the &quot;Launch&quot; button, to\
      \ ensure any additional services and drivers it requires get installed.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Requirements</h2>WalkinVR is utility application that will add extra\
      \ features to your existing VR Setup: Oculus, WMR or Index and it does not have\
      \ extra requirements about spec of the PC.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Movement and\
      \ Rotation</h2>Players are now able to move and rotate in virtual reality without\
      \ having to perform the movement in the real world. This feature is most utilized\
      \ when players need to move, reach, stand and turn around 360 degrees.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Gameplay with Personal Assistant</h2>A third part Xbox Controller can\
      \ be used to assist the player with movement and button pressing.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Adjustment of Controller Position</h2>Players can adjust the controllers\u2019\
      \ position and range of motion. This feature helps players who are not able\
      \ to move their controllers to the height or depth required by the video game.\
      \ Players can also adjust the movement sensitivity of their virtual reality\
      \ controller that is translated from their physical controller. A 3- inch controller\
      \ movement can translate to a 6-inch controller movement in virtual reality.\
      \ Players can change the orientation of their controller in virtual reality.\
      \ This helps players who have a limited range of motion in their wrists.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Hand tracking with external sensor (in development).</h2>This\
      \ feature is dedicated for players that have problems with holding of controllers.\
      \ This can be mostly caused either by spastics or spinal injury. In such configuration\
      \ external sensor is tracking player's pose and transfers that position into\
      \ Virtual Reality."
