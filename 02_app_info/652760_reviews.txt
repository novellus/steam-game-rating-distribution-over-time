It's a good little SHMUP; the controls are tight, later levels feel challening but never unfair, and the way the powerups layer on top each other becomes very satisfying to use. I've played a lot of flash and Steam top down shooters, and while all of the giant, constant explosions and flashing colors can be entertaining, the graphics here avoid cluttering the screen with a lot of garbage - I like some visual flair, sure, but I like being able to see what I'm doing too.","timestamp_created":1512196485,"timestamp_updated":1512196485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+OX7iuACcKz4kAE="}
