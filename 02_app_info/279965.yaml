      called into question the Wehrmacht's ability to win the war, but did Kursk confirm
      they would lose it?  Or can the vaunted German Panzer Corps turn the tide at
      this critical hour?  Take command of your forces once again and prepare to make
      your stand against the Soviet Steamroller as it advances across Eastern Europe!<br><br>This
      DLC features 13 all new scenarios, featuring an elaborate campaign structure
      containing an unprecedented amount of unique objectives including escorting
      supply drops, breaking out of enemy encirclements, safeguarding evacuations,
      launching raids behind enemy lines, and more.  In addition, this DLC has the
      capacity to save your core force for use in future campaigns!<br><br>The Grand
      Campaigns are a series of expansions for Panzer Corps.<br><br>Each campaign
      can be started with the core force from the previous Grand Campaign, so you
      can continue all Grand Campaign expansions carrying over all the core forces
      that completed the previous ones. Alternatively players can start with a preset
      core force and play each campaign on its own, or jump in to the Grand Campaign
