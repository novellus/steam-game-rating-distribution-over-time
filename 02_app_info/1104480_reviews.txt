There were many versions but as far as I know I had the best, which was the Amiga. I don't know what this port is based on but it's so disappointing - the scrolling and controls don't even work properly together, which makes it virtually unplayable. Was it really that difficult to release a properly functioning version of this for the price?","timestamp_created":1598801804,"timestamp_updated":1598801804,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520201981067657471","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwru+AoPQCetbhngI="}
