The game had many plot twist that I enjoyed a lot. I never saw them coming either. But the ending is what ruined my whole experince for me. It was as if someone had flicked a switch and said \"YOU LOOSE!\" \n\nThere were many moments like this in the story. My character was all out of options and I was certain it was going to be the end for them. Yet time and time again the game would bypass these sticky situations, and let me continue with the plot.  Then the ending came. Just because I picked the wrong allies, or because my \"Magic meter\" wasn't filled I lost.\n\nMy character didn't die, but they might as well be dead. That is how unsatisfying the ending was. This game also saves your progress at all times. If there was a manual save function I may not be this upset. But it took 3 hours to finish the game. I don't want to spend another 3 hours fussing over every little detail to make sure I win in the end.","timestamp_created":1581591977,"timestamp_updated":1581591977,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wsuOn/ACcr378QE="}
