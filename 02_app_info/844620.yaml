    review: "It's a good game. \n- Graphic: The graphic style remembers, Alex Kidd,\
      \ but the atmosphere is adressed also to a target of mature gamers\n- Music:\
      \ the retro style is my favorite (Only the click button into main menu  has\
      \ a bit annoying sound, but it's my idea). The actions sound aren't invasive\
      \ (in these type of game, there is also the risk about sounds very disturbing\
      \ after a few of minutes, but the taken choice has been correct according to\
      \ me, for except about the click button into main menu as I said.\n- Story:\
      \ it' simple. It's a plot between one of the most important and tragics events\
      \ of the world and a fantasy adventure (good the choice about an hero-machine\
      \ and the link with a simple coffee machine, I like it, because these imaginative\
      \ features can approach to the game also young gamers). Summarily, the game's\
      \ story wants to present a mature game but correctly adapted to new generation\
      \ of gamers (and more young. It's a way to hand down to a new generation the\
      \ vintage look of the videogames, always current)\n-Gameplay: simple and intuitive\
      \ (with keyboard and joystick). Anyhow, the tutorial is available for every\
      \ doubt or difficulty. Be careful to the movement of the character. I think\
      \ it's very fluid until you got used to it. But this fluidity is a positive\
      \ feature in particular if you play to the \"extra\" game ( I don't want spoiler\
      \ anything. You must try it, it's funny).\n"
