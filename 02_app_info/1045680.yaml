    review: 'It''s a nice game.


      Don''t take it as a perfect simulator: it''s far from it.

      I don''t like that the only way for you to control your expenses is to spend
      years and years studying how to save.

      I didn''t pay 4000$ for an auto insurance as soon as I turned 18, for example.
      I''d like to choose wether I want to get married, to have children, or to divorce.
      Oh my, the divorce event is the worst in the whole game.

      Why do I have to upgrade a category to its end to see what''s best to invest
      in? That''s all lost time.


      If you want to break the game, it''s as easy as getting a professional job (alright,
      that''s realistic, but you get old in the meantime).

      Or just get an unskilled job, while you mine crypto (with the same hardware
      for decades, that never breaks down, and that''s always up to the task), and
      use Penny stocks or any commodity. Yes, because both will give you an average
      23/27% return year over year, making the whole game very repetitive at that
      point.

      Come on, everybody knows that you can''t earn so easily from Penny stocks, even
      if you spend 90 months of your life studying them.


      There are a few bugs: if you edit the music/effects volume changes, and then
      you go to the menu, they go back to default; if you go to the menu, the game
      window resizes itself, every single time; there is no fullscreen.


      But, honestly, there isn''t much more on Steam for people who enjoy finance
      game, and it''s fun and easy to play.

      I think its price is perfectly reasonable.

      Overall, I''m glad I bought it.'
