    review: 'I''ve got nothing really bad to say about the game, because it is extremely
      good for a free game, i enjoyed every second of it, getting all the secrets
      and bosses defeated was really interesting, the mechanics of all the monster
      were really different than others i''ve seen, the story was really simple but
      still deep and fun to experience, btw i cried with the last ending i got, and
      it''s not easy to make me cry.

      Something i really want to focus on is the music, it fit every second of the
      story and made the experience 25% more enjoyable than what it would have been
      without it.

      Truly, when i finished the game, i really thought it should cost something,
      it is my actual favourite RPG Maker game, and i got so interested in it that
      i took my time in the bonus room. Simply a fantastic game, a fantastic experience,
      10/10.'
